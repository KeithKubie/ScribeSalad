MICHELLE WILLIAMS: Welcome
to the forum live-streamed

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.250
worldwide from the
Leadership Studio

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.280
at the Harvard TH Chan
School of Public Health.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.470
I'm Dean Michelle Williams.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.890
The forum is a collaboration
between the Harvard Chan School

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.110
and independent news media.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.080
Each program features
a panel of experts

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.950
addressing some of today's most
pressing public health issues.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.470
The forum is one way
the school advances

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.260
the frontiers of
public health and makes

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.180
scientific insights accessible
to policymakers and the public.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.760
I hope you find this program
engaging and informative.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.006
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.492

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:01.290
MARTY KADY: Welcome
to the forum.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.810
I'm Marty Kady, and I'm
the editor of Politico Pro,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.790
and I'll be serving
as today's moderator.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.998
Our panelists, I'm going to
introduce them right now.

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:09.810
To my immediate right
are Bob Blendon,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.090
professor of Health Policy
and Political Analysis

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.000
at the Harvard TH Chan
School of Public Health

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.030
and the Harvard Kennedy School,
Richard Frank, professor

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.310
of Health Economics in the
Department of Health Care

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.160
Policy at Harvard Medical
School, Martin West,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.260
Professor of Education
at the Harvard Graduate

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.970
School of Education.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.670
Joining us remotely
is Sheila Burke,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.250
Adjunct Lecturer in Public
Policy at the Harvard Kennedy

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.120
School.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.640
This event is presented
jointly with Politico LLC,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.370
and we are streaming
live on the website

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.380
of the forum on
Politico, as well

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.210
as on Facebook and YouTube.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.120
This program will also
include a brief Q&amp;A,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.512
so you can email questions
to theforum@hsph.harvad.edu,

00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:52.470
and we'll try to answer
some of those questions

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.840
both from the live audience
and whatever you email in.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.410
There's also a live chat
happening on the forum site

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.430
right now.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.450
So as we open this forum
to discuss health care

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.790
and education priorities
in the new Congress,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.290
we're really doing
this at a fraught

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.539
moment in American history.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.330
To put it bluntly,
our government

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.160
appears to be in a crisis.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.050
We are on day 33 of the longest
government shutdown in history.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.620
It's a shutdown long enough to
have cost billions of dollars

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.230
and economic damage
and incalculable damage

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.499
to our national
political dialogue.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.790
I live in the Washington
area, and many of my neighbors

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.820
are furloughed, deciding
what bills to pay

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.320
and what bills not to pay.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.120
I flew up here
yesterday to Boston.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.210
The TSA agents who screened
my bags are going on a month

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.530
without pay.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.810
Everything from school
lunches to food inspections

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.530
to national parks are threatened
by an intractable debate

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.914
about a wall at the
US-Mexico border.

00:02:49.914 --> 00:02:51.330
So it's with that
context, perhaps

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.720
that cloud, that we will discuss
what our panel of experts

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.676
thinks could happen on health
care and education policy.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:01.050
This could happen either in
Congress, through the courts,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.040
through the executive branch.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.498
Maybe, we'll even
talk about what's

00:03:03.498 --> 00:03:05.490
happening at the state
level, if and when

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.230
Washington returns to
some level of normalcy.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.890
But first, we wanted to
examine, what do Americans

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.250
say about the new
Congress' top priorities?

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.980
Politico and the
Harvard TH Chan School

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.627
conducted polls of
Americans to find out.

00:03:19.627 --> 00:03:21.210
These polls will
serve as a background

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.280
for today's discussion,
but we're also

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.860
going to talk more broadly
about what actions could happen

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.699
in this divided Congress.

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.490
We're going to set up
the conversation here

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.010
with a brief video clip
about the top health issue

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.890
that they came up for
Republicans and Democrats, drug

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.910
prices.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.830
And this is a clip
from the US Department

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.980
of Health and Services.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.180
Let's see the clip.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.650
COARD SIMPLER: I was diagnosed
with chronic myelogenous

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.150
leukemia.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.590
JANET FLYNN: With breast cancer.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.550
RICHARD KNIGHT: My kidneys
continue to deteriorate.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.070
PAMELA HOLT: I have
in this last year

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.180
had to pay over $10,000 in
medical costs for my drug

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.990
to keep me alive.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.114
RICHARD KNIGHT: My medications
are quite expensive.

00:03:57.114 --> 00:04:00.615
JANET FLYNN: The out-of-pocket
costs were staggering.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.580
SUSAN LEE: Over $5,000.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.830
COARD SIMPLER: So I just
ended up charging a lot of it

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.595
on a credit card.

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:07.261
RICHARD KNIGHT: I
probably won't retire.

00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:10.920
SUSAN LEE: I am not going
to drain my savings account.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.425
I'm not going to sell my home.

00:04:12.425 --> 00:04:14.550
ALEX AZAR: For too long,
there's been a lot of talk

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.540
on drug prices and no action.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.050
It's time for drug prices
to go down, not up.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.700
DONALD TRUMP: My
administration is

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.720
launching the most
sweeping action in history

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.600
to lower the price
of prescription drugs

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.740
for the American people.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.070
SPEAKER 1: American
patients first.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.670
HHS.GOV/DrugPricing.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.700
Produced by the US Department
of Health and Human Services

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.396
at taxpayer expense.

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:41.770
MARTY KADY: Bob,
will you give us

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.910
an overview of
these poll findings

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.560
and what they tell us about
where the American public is

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.200
on these policies?

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.075
ROBERT BLENDON: Yeah.

00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:48.130
Marty, let me try to be helpful.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.610
So when this shutdown
is over, we're

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.425
going to have a country
in Congress that

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:55.500
are unbelievably angry.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.430
They're also going
to be very polarized.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.550
What we're trying to
do in very few minutes

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.760
is to use a poll we
did to find if there

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.550
could be any common
agreement on issues

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.990
that people would work on.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.320
And very briefly, the
research and the news coverage

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.040
is not the same.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.510
It turns out when you
study a Democratic House,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.330
they actually follow what
Democrats think much more

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.320
than the public.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.110
When you follow a
Republican Senate,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.125
they're likely to follow
what Republicans say.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.500
So what I'm briefly
going to show

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.640
is what people say are the top
priorities for this Congress,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.290
hoping something would get done.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.790
And then we're going
to briefly look

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.860
at do they agree on anything?

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.660
And then my colleagues
are going to talk

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.110
about what might happen in
areas where there's even

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.180
some agreement for this.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.520
So one thing about
our poll with Politico

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
is most polls you see about
priorities give people

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.900
five choices.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.670
We gave them 21, where anything
that appeared in the major news

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.790
was on a list.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.350
So if we can have the first
PowerPoint just briefly.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:06.310
So these were out
of 21, the top six--

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.180
lowering prescription drugs,
reducing the deficit, which

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.880
I think the tax bill
got people nervous,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.881
spending on infrastructure--
and you actually

00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:16.630
have to describe the
people you're talking

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.070
about bridges and highways.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.920
They have no idea what that
"infrastructure" word means.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.860
Reducing the number
of hate crimes.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.430
Briefly, we've gone from worried
about international terrorism

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.580
to actually hate crimes
in the United States.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.885
Addressing opioids, and
spending on kindergarten

00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:36.220
to 12 public education.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.640
The next PowerPoint briefly,
all you have to look at

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.020
is the yellow.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.040
Given the top six, do the
Republicans and Democrats

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.180
agree on anything?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.890
And it's only on
prescription drugs,

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.920
in terms of the hierarchy.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.600
But I want to take a quick look.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.000
Just take a look at Republicans'
one, two, and three,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.270
because you can explain
why there's a shutdown.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.710
One is drugs.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.050
Two is unauthorized immigration.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.490
Three is the budget deficit.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.310
And on the Democratic side,
it's drugs, climate change,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.830
which doesn't show up on
the Republican list at all,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.330
and renewing DACA.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.060
So now you know exactly
what the negotiations

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.760
are going on in Washington.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.450
And then we looked at just
health and education much more

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.070
narrowly for that.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.660
So we go to the next slide,
and we looked at health first.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.120
So to no surprise
again, drug prices

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.220
sits at the top of the list.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.220
But what showed up in
the election is here,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.670
an idea that was only an
insurance term protecting

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.190
people with serious
illnesses is now

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.670
so much in the core
of American life.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.320
And to the surprise
of everybody,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.485
it wasn't an election
issue, but both,

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:51.610
you'll see it in a minute,
Republican and Democrats

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.220
do not want Medicare touched.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.470
Lowering overall health care
costs and biomedical research.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.450
So is there any agreement
between the parties?

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.860
Next slide.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.650
And so it turns out
in the health areas,

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.880
there is more agreement.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.530
What don't they agree on?

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.930
Republicans are high on reducing
health care costs and veterans,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.660
and they don't show up
on the Democratic lists.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.900
And Democrats are high
on fixing the ACA,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.670
but not on the Republican list.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.450
And biomedical research is
still higher with Democrats.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.809
So you see some
possibilities here.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:37.500
Two of them are just sustaining
what the existing programs are,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.350
but prescription drugs
shows at the top.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.419
The last, we take a look
at two in education.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.110
And there's a smaller list
because education has not

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.240
had the same national focus.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.090
And so you can't give
them 24 items when people

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.230
aren't proposing for this.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.280
So let's go to the next slide.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.276
And so the top education
are student debt.

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:00.900
For those of you who
don't follow this,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.670
10 years ago, there
was no such thing

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.560
as a polling issue
called student debt.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.930
It just would never show up.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.330
Now, it's the top.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.710
The spending issue, spending
for local community colleges,

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.490
investing in school
buildings, and the last

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.800
is expanding charter
and private schools.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.060
But watch when you look
at the partisan split

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.540
in this last slide.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.680
So what you see is in the
narrow area of education,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.210
Democrats and Republicans
agree on everything but two.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.270
Republicans are
interested in expanding

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.650
charter and private schools.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.140
Democrats are not.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.220
Democrats are interested in
regulating for-profit colleges

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.500
and technical institutes.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.980
Republicans are not.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.770
So this is the agenda.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.870
And the question for
my colleagues are,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.230
given the animosity between
the parties and where we are,

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.280
is it possible that
these could happen?

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.330
And if is, what would happen
that would be helpful?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.130
But that's the background.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.870
You have some
background of where

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.730
people believe that Congress
should go in the next year.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.730
MARTY KADY: Thanks, Bob.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.640
That's a great foundation
for this discussion today.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.550
There's a fascinating
consensus between the parties

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.577
on certain issues.

00:10:15.577 --> 00:10:17.160
But then when you
get down to tactics,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.040
when you go back
inside Congress,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.075
what we're likely
to see is gridlock.

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:24.450
What the American people are
telling us through this poll

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.420
is one thing, and you do start
to see the ideological breaks.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.290
But moving back to Washington,
the likeliest scenario

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.460
for this Congress broadly is
that this new invigorated House

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.650
Democratic majority
run by Nancy Pelosi

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.050
and a young, diverse
group of Democrats

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.390
will pass a lot of bills that
reflect the progressive agenda,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.655
and a lot of people with
an eye toward what the 2020

00:10:45.655 --> 00:10:47.280
agenda should be,
and almost everything

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.140
will die in the
Republican Senate.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.120
So if we restrict
our conversation just

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.703
to what will Congress do, it's
going to be a very short forum.

00:10:53.703 --> 00:10:54.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.780
So we're also going to
include the potential

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.550
for executive action,
what can happen

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.150
in the courts on these
policies, and what's

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.400
happening in the states.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.872
At the state level,
you're possibly

00:11:06.872 --> 00:11:09.330
going to see a lot of action
on health care, and education,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.320
on Medicaid.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.750
States have really become
laboratories of innovation

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.070
on policy, chiming in where the
federal government has failed.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.414
So let's go to drug pricing.

00:11:18.414 --> 00:11:19.830
Richard, you've
studied the forces

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.642
that drive prescription drug
pricing in the United States.

00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:25.350
This is the number
one thing in the poll.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.630
Republicans, Democrats,
Independents all

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.090
believe they pay too
much for drug prices.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.050
That clip was really compelling,
and you hear those stories

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.550
over and over.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.650
We had that clip of
President Trump and Secretary

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.270
Azar saying, we're doing
something about drug prices.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.520
But let's get realistic.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.480
Give us a roadmap on
legislation, regulation,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.590
and executive action.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.517
What do you see ahead?

00:11:47.517 --> 00:11:48.350
RICHARD FRANK: Yeah.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.460
Well, I think prescription
drug policy is a bright spot.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.810
And at the risk of
being Pollyanna,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:03.810
I think that there's
progress to be made here

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.800
in a bipartisan way.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.610
I think there have been
actions taken by the FDA.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.090
There are proposals
right now in the Congress

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.720
and being made by the Trump
administration that offer,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.970
I think, reasons for optimism.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.550
For example, the FDA has
taken a number of actions

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.070
to promote more
competition by easing

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.280
the way for generic
drugs to come to market.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.340
So this includes putting
more money into getting drugs

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.110
onto the market faster.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:37.200
It involves curbing some
of the practices that

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.510
have been used to keep
generic drugs off the market

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:48.330
and limiting the ability
to exploit consumer

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.500
protections and safety.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.750
And so I think that they've
taken some good first steps.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.400
And there are now
bipartisan proposals

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.400
working their way
through the Congress that

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.760
will build on that.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.170
One example is a thing
called the Creates Act, which

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:12.660
is really aimed at taking a
bipartisan approach to curbing

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.420
anti-competitive actions
that make it harder

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.080
for generic drugs to show
that they're bioequivalent,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.830
that they're equally effective.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.270
And that bill, I think,
is going to come up,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.540
and I'm very optimistic
that it'll pass,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.980
and it will make a difference.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.950
It will save
billions of dollars.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.300
A related policy domain is
in the area of competition

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.820
for biologic drugs,
where we have

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.720
the possibility of a new
class, a new set of drugs

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.810
called biosimilars,
which are like generics,

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.240
but for biological drugs.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.460
And the FDA has been slow
in getting the regulations

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.270
to bring those to market.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.470
But there's impatience on
both the Democratic and the

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.730
Republican side.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:07.800
And you see us trying to
learn lessons from Europe here

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.580
to get those drugs
to market quicker,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.550
and again, save
billions of dollars

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.010
because all the
really expensive drugs

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.380
that you've read about in
the newspaper every day,

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.345
for the most part,
are biologics,

00:14:18.345 --> 00:14:21.830
and so that's a
great place to save.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.860
A couple of other areas where
I think, in a sense, there's

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.870
low-hanging fruit, one is
anti-gouging legislation.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.600
There are several bills
in Congress right now.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.240
I think it's an easy one.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.670
Here we are in the middle
of an opioid crisis,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.880
and we have some of the most
effective drugs being jacked up

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.490
about 600% a year.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.520
And I think that people
on both sides of the aisle

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.390
are outraged by that.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.120
And so I think that
offers a possibility.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.770
And then finally, I think
one of the things that

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.440
came through loud and
clear in the election

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.880
is that wholesalers,
manufacturers, pharmacy

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.850
benefit managers all
make money from the way

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.860
that prices are set.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.280
The people that get hurt by
the price setting arrangements

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.810
are consumers because
they pay list prices

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:21.730
and don't share in the actual
transaction prices post-rebate.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.300
And I think, again,
both sides of the aisle

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.480
say, we've got to do something
to fix this and allow

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.720
the consumers to share in
the cost-effective gains

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.995
that we've made.

00:15:34.995 --> 00:15:36.870
MARTY KADY: Well,
thanks for your optimism

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.470
in this moment of gridlock.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.810
It's unusual when the
president, the Republican Senate

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.820
and the House Democrats might
actually agree on something,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.210
so maybe you've got a
more optimistic outlook

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.300
than a lot of folks here.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.050
Two other health issues we want
to touch on here that came up

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.710
in the polls, Americans
are overwhelmingly

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.620
concerned with protecting
Medicare and keeping coverage

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.810
for pre-existing conditions.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.860
This is across the
board rhetorically.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.680
But as Sheila
knows, when you dig

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.300
into the actual
bills, especially

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.758
some of the Republican
bills, there

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:11.340
are some cheaper sort of
off-brand insurance plans

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.037
that might not cover
pre-existing conditions.

00:16:15.037 --> 00:16:17.370
Sheila, can you talk a little
about those two priorities

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.820
and what you expect to see here?

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.870
And feel free to cover Congress,
executive action, wherever you

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.610
see the roadmap ahead on this.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.470
SHEILA BURKE: Thanks
so much, Marty,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.660
and thanks for
including me today.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.750
Medicare, as Bob knows and
Richard certainly knows,

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.530
remains enormously popular
among the American public.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.080
And it is approached
with great caution

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.800
by both sides of the
aisle and both bodies.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.230
While the House leadership,
the new leadership

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.170
is inevitably going to raise
a number of the suggestions

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.740
about Medicare buy-ins
and Medicare for all,

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.380
and will no doubt try and
respond to those issues that

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.910
arose during the
course of the election,

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.750
I think it is unlikely
that any major moves will

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.970
be made with respect
to the Medicare program

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.070
on either side of the aisle.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.190
Unfortunately or fortunately,
we are already in the '20 cycle,

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.700
so people are already looking
towards the '20 elections.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.510
And I think they approach
Medicare and the suggestion

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.160
of doing anything
to Medicare that

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.200
will alter it any dramatic way
essentially will fall flat.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.079
But I think there is going to
be real focus on strengthening

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.819
the program, and
I think there'll

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.480
be discussions that take
place about what might one

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.510
do with respect to the current
structure of the program, which

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.290
has remained largely
intact since 1965?

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.190
Certainly incremental changes
may well be discussed.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.070
Drugs, as Richard has suggested.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.090
There is a big piece
of the Medicare program

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.700
and a lot of the discussion
around drug reform, which

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.070
has to do with the cost of
drugs to Medicare beneficiaries.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.560
So we already know the
administration and the Congress

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.830
has begun to look at
some of those questions

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.170
around negotiation,
around the price point,

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.390
around rebate strategies.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.100
But there are also
other elements

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.780
of the Medicare program
that people have

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.430
talked about strengthening.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.650
There are a bucket of things
that Medicare does not

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.800
currently cover that people
have suggested really

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.550
need to be added to the program,
issues around dental coverage,

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.710
interestingly enough, vision
coverage, hearing coverage.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.700
And really, the
out-of-pocket costs,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.520
because there's no real
catastrophic protection

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.410
for folks that are in the
traditional Medicare program.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.110
So I think there'll
be attention given

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.680
to some of those issues by
Democrats and Republicans.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.680
I also think there'll be
efforts to try and simplify

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.670
the program.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.820
The Medicare Advantage Program,
which is the managed care

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.640
piece of the program,
now has about 30%

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.370
of the population enrolled
in those programs,

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.210
and there are questions about
simplifying that program, about

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.910
access issues, issues
like telehealth,

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.550
and other opportunities to
essentially make services

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.630
more readily available.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.500
One of the other interesting
questions that may arise

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.820
are over the historic Stark
rules about, essentially,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.280
the protections under
HIPAA and Stark,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.760
and whether they are inhibiting
the development of organized

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.810
programs.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.730
Both the administration
and many others

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.610
are interested in getting
Medicare beneficiaries

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.280
into organized systems
of care, believing

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.230
that coordinated
care, in fact, will

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.980
improve the health of our
elderly and disabled citizens,

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.770
so there'll be attention to
those kinds of questions.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.610
Senator Grassley, the incoming
chairman of the Senate Finance

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.400
Committee who had been
chairman previously,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.520
has a long-standing
interest in oversight,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.530
and has indicated
already his interest

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.330
in looking at the
Medicare program,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.430
looking at fraud
and abuse, looking

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.170
at the cost of the program.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.510
I fully expect he will do that.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.310
Incoming chairman
of Ways and Means

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.070
Mr. Neil has also
indicated interest

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.290
in looking at
oversight, but also

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.780
interest in looking at what
the administration is doing

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.840
in terms of demonstrations,
with respect to the Medicare

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.540
and Medicaid programs, for
particularly the Medicare

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.690
program, and wanting
greater transparency over

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.790
what, in fact, might occur.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.730
With respect to, essentially,
preexisting conditions

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:11.080
in sort of my short comments, a
couple of things come to mind.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.400
One is people are increasingly
sensitive to the increasing

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.150
number of the uninsured.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:20.980
We're upwards of 13.7% or
almost 14% now uninsured,

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.900
so those numbers are going up.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.510
So the question
about preexisting,

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.090
the question about
coverage availability

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.040
is one that, in
fact, is of concern

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.850
on both sides of the aisle.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:34.020
As Bob has suggested, deep
divisions over the fundamentals

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.310
of the ACA.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.410
Of course, we have
the Texas court case,

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.580
which has called into question
the fundamentals of the ACA,

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.980
although it is on pause,
as a result, frankly,

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.500
of the shutdown.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.160
But on January the 29th,
the Ways and Means Committee

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.470
has scheduled a
hearing on oversight,

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.530
essentially looking at the
preexisting condition issue,

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.660
looking at what those
solutions might be.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.470
And it is the one piece
where, in fact, both Democrats

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.260
and Republicans seem to
have an interest in finding

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.980
a resolution as to what
one might do with that.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.860
The president has sent
sort of mixed signals.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.490
He wants to be sure
they're covered.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.210
But then, of course, they put
forward the short-term plans,

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.090
which will be
permitted to avoid any

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.220
of the requirements in the ACA.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.290
So those questions,
the questions

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.580
of what the administration is
doing on a regulatory basis, as

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.060
well as legislative attempts
to try and fix that issue,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.740
I think, will be on
the agenda for both

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.376
the House and the Senate.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.500
MARTY KADY: Thanks, Sheila.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.590
And we'll be coming back to a
lot of the politics of the ACA

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.650
in the future as
this panel goes on.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.040
But we're going to
shift to education here.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.130
Another perhaps a bright
spot in the poll in a country

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.440
so bitterly divided
over politics,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.350
there was some unity on
increasing spending on K

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.560
through 12 education, on
funding for community college,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.240
and overwhelming concern
about student debt.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.380
That's where there's unity.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.570
The tactics on
what to do about it

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.910
is where it sort of falls apart.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.606
Martin, thanks for
coming on here.

00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:08.730
You're an education expert.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.220
What's the outlook for Congress
and the executive branch

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.674
on education policy on
these various topics?

00:22:13.674 --> 00:22:15.340
MARTIN WEST: Well,
thanks for having me.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.270
Let me start with the issue
of increasing spending

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.930
on K12 education where despite
the very interesting poll

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.750
results, I think you're
very unlikely to see much

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.730
in the way of
substantive change.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.190
Major changes to
federal spending

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.620
on discretionary
programs like education

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:37.251
tend to happen in the context of
major reauthorizations of laws,

00:22:37.251 --> 00:22:39.000
like the Every Student
Succeeds Act, which

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.710
governs federal involvement
in K12 education.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.670
And while that
law is technically

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.210
up for reauthorization
this year,

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.120
there is absolutely zero
appetite in Congress

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.110
to revisit what was a very
hard-won bipartisan compromise

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.910
in 2015.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.220
And I think the overall
budget picture, which

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.590
includes the threat
of sequestration cuts

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.540
if there there's no
new budget agreement,

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.150
means that those who are
pushing for increases

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.190
in any discretionary
spending category

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.890
have very, very little leverage.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.470
Now, in making that prediction,
I should note two caveats.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.830
One is that I do think
the poll results help

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.400
us understand why despite calls
from Republicans to reduce

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.980
the federal footprint in
education, to even eliminate

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.950
the Department of Education,
after two years of unified

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.080
Republican control,
you actually haven't

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.220
seen a decrease in federal
spending on education.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.830
Education's actually fared quite
well over the past two years,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.492
from a budget perspective.

00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:35.700
And I think that's because
cutting education spending

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.730
at any level of government is
just not a political winner

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:39.259
right now.

00:23:39.259 --> 00:23:40.800
And that's what I
think you're seeing

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.870
reflected in the poll results.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.720
And the second caveat is
that it's very important

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.780
to keep in mind that the
federal government is just

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.370
a 10% investor or
less in K12 education.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:56.280
And so that means even any
very substantial increase

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.850
or reduction in federal
spending on K12 education

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.300
doesn't really translate
into a major change

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.770
in the level of resources
available in a given school.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.380
As in most aspects of
our education system,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.150
the real action is at the
state and local level,

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.840
and you have seen
increased activism

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.030
around issues of school
funding and teacher salaries

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.930
in the past year that
we can return to later.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.050
Now, on student loans,
I think it's important

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:28.380
here to distinguish between
efforts to reduce the debt

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.040
load of former students
who are currently repaying

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.430
loans and efforts to fix the
student loan system going

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.360
forward.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.660
The former may be
a desirable goal,

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.810
particularly as concerns
mount that debt loads may

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.070
be holding back the economy.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.680
And I suspect you'll hear
Democratic presidential

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.880
candidates talking about that
a lot on the campaign trail.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.700
But it does nothing to
increase access for students

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.830
to higher education
going forward.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.977
On the latter, this question
of actually increasing access,

00:24:59.977 --> 00:25:01.810
I think the big question
is whether Congress

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.393
is going to be able
to reach agreement

00:25:03.393 --> 00:25:06.040
on a reauthorization of
the Higher Education Act.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.250
And there, the major player
is Senator Lamar Alexander

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.070
from Tennessee.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.270
He's a former Secretary of
Education, former university

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.080
president.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.240
He's recently announced
that he's not running

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.490
for re-election in 2020.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.920
He wants to go out
with a legacy bill,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.250
and this would be the
opportunity to do that.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.960
He's made, I think,
good progress

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.180
in creating some
bipartisan consensus

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.880
around the goal of simplifying
the federal financial aid

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.150
system and creating some
accountability for colleges

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.880
by putting them on the hook
if their students don't

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.310
repay their loans.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.660
I think the big question then is
whether the areas where there's

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.230
not bipartisan consensus,
questions like campus safety,

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.090
and sexual assault,
federal regulation,

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.190
all that under Title
IX, whether they

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.500
will get in the
way of the ability

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.235
to reach a deal going forward.

00:25:56.235 --> 00:25:57.610
The other prediction
that I think

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.760
it's very safe to make with
respect to the new Congress

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.010
is just that you'll see
a ramped up oversight

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.917
function in the House
of Representatives

00:26:05.917 --> 00:26:07.750
with respect to the
Department of Education.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.960
So incoming chair of the
Education and Labor Committee,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.262
Bobby Scott from Virginia,
has indicated that he's

00:26:14.262 --> 00:26:15.470
going to be holding hearings.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.890
He's going to be
requesting information

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.870
from the department,
particularly with respect

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.570
to issues of civil rights
protections in schools,

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.137
and the regulation of
for-profit colleges.

00:26:25.137 --> 00:26:27.220
These are areas where the
Trump administration has

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.800
made some significant changes
through executive action

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.990
to Obama-era
policies, and I think

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.710
you'll see a lot of examination
of those areas over the months

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.505
to come.

00:26:36.505 --> 00:26:38.240
MARTY KADY: Well,
as you've heard--

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.420
thank you, Martin--
the student loan debt

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.430
is a big burden
for many Americans.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.290
We've got another clip here.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.620
This clip is from the
nonprofit Student Debt Crisis.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.690
Let's roll that clip
and then discuss.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:54.290
SPEAKER 2: I am 30 years
old, and I am currently

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.390
$38,500 in student loan debt.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.020
SPEAKER 3: I am in
student loan debt.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:06.050
SPEAKER 4: $23,522.01
of student loan debt.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.210
SPEAKER 5: I'm 29
years old, and I have

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.820
$60,000 in student loan debt.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.000
SPEAKER 6: $70,026
of student loan debt.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.810
SPEAKER 7: $44,000
of student loan money

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.550
to get my master's degree.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.360
SPEAKER 8: Today, I owe $89,000.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.110
ERIC SWALWELL: Hi.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.360
I'm Congressman Eric Swalwell.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.295
I represent the 15th
district in California.

00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:28.850
I have about $100,000
in student loan debt.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.880
SPEAKER 7: I've worked
at times four jobs.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.980
SPEAKER 4: I've been
making thousands

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.680
of dollars' worth of payments,
and I'm barely keeping up

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.780
with the interest rate.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.950
SPEAKER 8: Rent was 250 a
month, and my car payment

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.300
was 180 a month.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.120
SPEAKER 3: I do not want to
be paying off my student loan

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.270
when I'm 80, when
I'm 70, when I'm 60.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.330
MARTY KADY: That's a
pretty sobering clip,

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.420
and really a wide range
of people talking,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.980
and wide range of ages, too.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.220
So this is clearly
a national problem.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.800
It's a crisis for
a lot of Americans,

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.360
a crisis for parents
trying to save,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.340
adults trying to pay it off.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.620
Can you talk a little
bit more about some

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.300
of the options for this?

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.470
You mentioned Lamar Alexander's
higher education bill.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.990
And would that
impact this at all,

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.625
or are there other innovative
ideas around student debt?

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:20.000
I think that's an important
topic, especially in a higher

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.810
education setting here.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:21.560
MARTIN WEST: Yeah.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.320
I think it's important as we
start talking about the student

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.820
debt issue to make
sure that we have

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.150
a good understanding of where
the problem is most severe.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.770
And it turns out
that if you look

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.650
at who's struggling in terms
of repayment, who's defaulting

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.480
on their student
loans, it's generally

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.900
not those borrowers who
have significant debts,

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.200
those who have borrowed to
go to a four-year school,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.690
especially those who borrow
to go to graduate school, who

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.090
tend to have the
largest debt loads,

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.150
and ultimately tend to be
very successful economically,

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.890
and to be able to manage
that repayment burden.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.450
Where the problem is
most severe is people

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.820
who have very modest
loan amounts, generally

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.560
under $20,000, who have borrowed
to attend a career training

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.750
program, maybe in the
for-profit sector,

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.820
have failed to complete
it, failed to transition

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.640
into the workforce.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.098
And they're the
ones who are really

00:29:10.098 --> 00:29:11.930
defaulting on their loans.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.380
And so I think the reason it's
important to keep that in mind

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.040
is that any sort of across
the board debt relief proposal

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.280
is likely to be quite regressive
in its impact ultimately.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.910
And so I think
that's where there's

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.250
a need for some creative
thinking, as you say.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.250
The idea that's really
emerged in higher education

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.110
over the past
couple of decades is

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.110
the idea of income-contingent
repayment plans.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:39.170
So basing the amount
that you repay

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.450
to some degree on your income.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:46.550
And this would target assistance
where it's most needed.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.010
The reason it makes sense
from an economic perspective

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.820
is that college is generally
still a very good investment.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.920
Most people, as a
result, are able to repay

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.950
that loan that they borrow, but
it's also a risky investment.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.615
And so I think this is a
good way to manage that risk.

00:30:03.615 --> 00:30:05.240
If it doesn't pay
off for you, then you

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.950
end up paying back less, and are
less likely to go into default.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.320
You saw a big expansion
in the availability

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.860
of income-based repayment plans
under the Obama administration.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.230
And interestingly,
this isn't an area

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.440
where you've seen the Trump
administration roll back

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.180
those programs.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.420
I think in the context of
a potential congressional

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.640
reauthorization of the
Higher Education Act,

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.544
you would see an attempt to
really simplify and streamline

00:30:31.544 --> 00:30:33.710
the various options that
are available to borrowers.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.020
They're ridiculously
confusing right now.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.480
They require you to recertify
your eligibility year to year,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.652
and so they're not as widely
used as they should be already.

00:30:43.652 --> 00:30:45.110
And so I think
that's an area where

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.782
you'd see a lot of thought.

00:30:46.782 --> 00:30:48.920
MARTY KADY: Well,
thank you, Martin.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.110
Great review on student debt.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.930
Let's go back to Sheila.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.770
To pick up on something you
mentioned, the ACA lawsuit.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:01.760
Basically, the entire ACA was
thrown out by a Texas judge

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.230
back in mid-December.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.060
It's caught up in
the courts now,

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.130
and I think a lot of people
were caught off-guard with that.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.080
It was thrown on a
technicality, but that

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.180
was an ideological
decision, but one

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.440
that still reveals the ongoing
legal fragility of Obamacare.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.714
We're almost 10 years into this
law, and it's extraordinary,

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.380
I think, to people
who don't follow this

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:30.232
that a lower court judge can
try to toss the entire law out.

00:31:30.232 --> 00:31:31.940
And it'll go through
the courts, but what

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.249
is your outlook on that and
any other legal challenges

00:31:34.249 --> 00:31:34.790
to Obamacare?

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.248
I know one of the
questions pending

00:31:36.248 --> 00:31:39.020
from our online audience is
whether Obamacare is here

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.890
to stay.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.740
I don't know the
answer, but maybe you

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.411
can jump in there a little bit.

00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:46.910
SHEILA BURKE: I'm not sure any
of us really know the answer.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.690
I mean, I guess I would posit
that it is, in fact, here

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.060
to stay.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.310
But, in fact, the court case
did catch us by surprise.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.250
It, of course, is
being appealed.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:00.230
The appeal is obviously
on hold while we're

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.160
in this break period.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.760
But I think there is an
ongoing set of challenges.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.710
Certainly, there are
the court challenges

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.060
which are being appealed.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.740
But there's also
the ongoing efforts

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.990
on the part of the
administration,

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.180
with respect to the
program that occur

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.060
in a regulatory or
an administrative way

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.220
that we continue to see,
whether it's shortening

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.760
the period of enrollment,
whether it is basically

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.390
ceasing the funding for much
of the outreach activities.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.450
So there's no question that
there are efforts going on

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.340
and will continue to take place.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.860
At the same time, I think
there is an acknowledgment

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.230
that there are
elements of the ACA,

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.740
have they been given the
opportunity to repair or to fix

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.500
the original legislation,
that folks would

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.690
have liked to have go forward.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.480
There is an obvious question
as to the benefit structure

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.640
in the ACA, and the
fullness of the benefits,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.200
and whether, in fact, that
ought to be revisited.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.770
But I think we will continue
to see this tension.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.620
Obviously, with the House
now under Democratic control,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.360
you won't see the
same kind of pressure

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.090
that you saw from
the House Republicans

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.300
essentially pursuing
legislation and moving it.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.559
The Senate has chosen not
to pursue much of that work.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:11.850
But I think you have to assume
that there will continue

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.680
to be issues that arise.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.120
There are also
issues taking place

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.700
at the state level with
a number of states not

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.360
only in the case of this court
case, but a number of states

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.510
that are seeking ways and
waivers to essentially do

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.600
a number of things, whether it's
with their Medicaid program,

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.780
or whether it's restructuring
their benefit structure,

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.160
or restructuring their
insurance market.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.210
So I think we have to assume
those conversations will

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.995
continue to take place.

00:33:37.995 --> 00:33:39.380
MARTY KADY: Thanks, Sheila.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.010
Richard, I want
to go back to you.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.140
On the question of
drug pricing, I'm

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.371
curious about what the
industry's approach is

00:33:45.371 --> 00:33:45.870
going to be.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.661
They're going to get
hauled up to the Hill,

00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:51.930
and Democrats certainly love to
have pharmaceutical executives

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.290
up there taking the
oath and being asked

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.880
why insulin costs so much.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.560
So can you talk a little
bit about industry strategy

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.067
when it comes to dealing with
the politics of drug prices?

00:34:05.067 --> 00:34:06.150
RICHARD FRANK: Well, yeah.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.880
We just saw a
report that came out

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.100
that well I guess this past year
has been the biggest lobbying

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.506
expenditure year
in quite a while.

00:34:16.506 --> 00:34:17.880
I think it was
around $26 million

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.030
was spent by big
pharma lobbying.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.320
So clearly, they're not
standing still for this.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:31.080
And I do think the
actual picture has

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.210
gotten more complicated.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.440
I mentioned earlier that there
is this concern about why

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.230
is it that everybody
is making money

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.370
on the backs of consumers?

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:48.389
And I think the entire way
that we've organized our supply

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.469
chain and the way we
put prices and discounts

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:58.890
through the system has
created enormous complexity

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:05.010
and opportunities for our
firms with market power

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.080
all the way down
through the supply chain

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.290
to make lots of money while
the consumers are paying prices

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.680
that are way out of line with
what any of the other players

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.790
are paying.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.810
And so I think that's
going to be a concern.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:21.420
And I think actually, efforts to
fix that will probably receive

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.420
some support from the industry.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.880
And so that's,
again, a common point

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:32.070
where you can triangulate all
the players mostly falling

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.270
on the side of fixing that.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.680
MARTY KADY: Trump is very
unpredictable, as we all know.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.260
Do you see him doing something
unilaterally on drug prices

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.810
to make substantive
and political point?

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:47.670
RICHARD FRANK: Well, there's
this issue around his desire

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:53.430
to introduce European
prices into the Medicare

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.920
program for
physician-administered drugs.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.530
And I think that is
an important signal

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.250
because much like the
Obama administration,

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.690
it represents an effort to
separate how you pay doctors

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.190
from how you buy drugs.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:15.270
And so that's an
important debate to have.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.370
The actual specifics of the
use of international prices

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:25.650
to set prices here is, I
think, less clear and much more

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.490
controversial.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.160
And so whether we will
actually land there,

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.150
I think probably we won't.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.860
But I think having
a conversation

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.400
about rearranging the way we
pay for physician-administered

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.035
drugs is important and
will probably happen.

00:36:41.035 --> 00:36:42.780
MARTY KADY: Thanks.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.110
Let me go back to Bob here,
back to the poll, the foundation

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.940
of this discussion,
and how it showed

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.540
where American priorities are.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.330
There tends to be a mismatch
between what people polled say

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.409
are their top priorities
and how they expect

00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:56.450
things to be carried out.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:59.460
That's where the ideological
debate really happens,

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.270
and that's where the
breakdown happens in Congress.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.929
What does the polling show?

00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:05.720
This poll, the first
two polls of the year,

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.460
or previous polls
that you've done

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.680
show where the
breakdown happens.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.640
ROBERT BLENDON: This is
important generically

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.040
for people to recognize.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.190
When people often
answer polls, they

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.640
expect preferences
about principles.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.250
I want something done
about drug prices.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.270
When they learn about what
it is, they come apart.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.690
And so there's a real
division about whether or not

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.500
we should encourage just more
market competition on the drug

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.000
side.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.630
People just believe for this.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.030
At the other side are people,
let's get the government

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.370
across from the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:50.600
And basically, a
negotiation is a nice word

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.390
for somewhat more
price controls.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.550
And so one side,
you split exactly

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.710
on what you do about that.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:04.580
So a lot of these policies,
and the answer is taxes.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.180
When asked about, should public
school teachers be paid more,

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.900
73% of people said absolutely.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.034
Those teachers are right.

00:38:13.034 --> 00:38:14.450
And then just the
simple question,

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:20.810
would you pay more taxes to do
that, half said no for that.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.560
So these divisions about
how the policies are--

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.080
and it wouldn't be as
difficult if people

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.790
didn't separate by party.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.860
That is, if you didn't go to
a different clubhouse, you--

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.210
but now, if I don't
want to pay those taxes,

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.740
I'm in the party of
no taxes for that.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.800
So a lot of these
issues come apart

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.720
not only because of the
lobbying that goes on,

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.840
but because how to solve them
is not a uniform agreement.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.380
That doesn't mean it
can't be done for it,

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:56.780
but it's harder because people
have philosophical views.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.771
Take the issue of the ACA.

00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:02.270
There are people who agree there
should be many more benefit

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.400
choices that are
available, and others

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.440
who are very afraid
of what that would be.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.900
And so fixing the ACA could
be a very high priority.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.537
But the second
line is, OK, we're

00:39:11.537 --> 00:39:13.370
going to have a thousand
different policies.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.920
No, we're going to have
two, and that'll do it.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.800
So the inability
to agree on the it.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.740
And I just want to
alert people, this

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.430
is the most poorly
understood about polling.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:26.900
People like Medicare forward.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.890
They like this.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.960
And then they tell you they
won't pay a dollar in taxes.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.600
And so unless you confront
people with the actual choice,

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.680
a lot of these polls
are not that suggestive.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.480
At the same time--

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.040
I'll go back to
this at the end--

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.480
I think the political process
will be unbelievably frustrated

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.450
if two years from now
after people were told

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.730
this election is one the
most pivotal elections

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.970
in American history and
nothing gets passed.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.490
So I don't want to
have a new cynicism

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:02.040
scale about everybody's
going to be running in 2020.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.990
Well really, nothing
could be done.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.620
We ran and we couldn't.

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.070
I think something on this
list will have to be done.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.300
I think there'll be a
great deal of cynicism.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.880
But then again, I
didn't predict who

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.129
the president was going to be.

00:40:15.129 --> 00:40:16.241
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:18.170
MARTY KADY: Well,
let's leave Washington

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.890
for a moment on that
note and discuss,

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.770
I know this panel is supposed to
be about the role of Congress.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.120
We've established the
divisiveness and the gridlock.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.760
So I want to talk a little bit
with each of the panelists,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.190
if you have just a
moment to weigh in,

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.490
about the role of states.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:38.640
States have become real
innovators on policy.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.440
If you watched Governor
Gavin Newsom's inaugural

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.750
in California, he's proposing
free community college.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.190
If you look at the
state-by-state actions in K

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.354
through 12 education
and in higher ed,

00:40:51.354 --> 00:40:52.520
there's a lot of innovation.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.220
There's things that are
working in both Republican-run

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.870
and Democratic-run states.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.630
On health care, I was telling
our panelists beforehand,

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.442
our Politico Pro
policy reporters, we

00:41:01.442 --> 00:41:02.900
have a lot of people
in Washington,

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.750
but we're finding more
interesting stories

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.900
in California, and in New
York, and Florida, and Indiana,

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.560
places that are experimenting
with different ways

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.450
to handle the ACA.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:18.800
California wants to expand it
but other conservative states

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.950
are trying to have work
requirements around Medicaid.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:25.617
Indiana has passed one of the
most restrictive abortion laws

00:41:25.617 --> 00:41:27.200
in the country because
they want to be

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.860
the state that makes the
challenge against Roe v. Wade.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.780
So maybe we can do
a quick round robin

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.370
with a few minutes
left here before we

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.800
go to our audience about
what states you're watching

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.840
and should our audience
watch for, like, hey,

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.990
Washington is gridlocked.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:42.380
Here's what can actually
happen that could prove

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.844
to be a productive policy move.

00:41:44.844 --> 00:41:46.010
I'll start with you, Martin.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.750
MARTIN WEST: Sure I'll
start with one of the issues

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.900
that you just mentioned, which
is the notion of free community

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:50.400
college.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.210
That proposal has been
made in California

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.940
and some other states
by incoming governors.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:00.190
What's interesting about it is
that it's a bipartisan issue.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.160
Leading the charge, Tennessee,
a traditionally conservative

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.070
state.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.070
And one of the reasons
it's attractive to states

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.110
is because it's relatively
inexpensive to do.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.570
Community college is
already quite affordable,

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.910
and a Pell grant from
the federal government

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.330
covers much of it
for most students.

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.550
So I think you'll see
continued interest in that.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:22.120
One concern there is
whether that availability

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.490
of a free option might
do some students who

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:26.500
could have attended a
four-year school to attend

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.710
a two-year school, where
completion rates tend

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.070
to be quite low, and they
might have been better off

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.170
in a four-year option.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.550
So I think that's
something for policymakers

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.900
to pay attention to.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.120
More broadly, I think
at the K12 level,

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.960
you have seen some
divergence among states.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.540
There are several states
that have taken various steps

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.990
over the past decade to expand
access to private schools.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.960
That really is a question
addressed by state policymakers

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.970
rather than the
federal government,

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:02.290
despite Secretary DeVos'
obvious interest in that.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:06.700
And so states like Indiana
Florida, Ohio, Louisiana

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.300
have gone quite aggressively
in that direction.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.400
More blue states have
avoided that altogether.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.510
And so there's an interesting
divergence going on

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:20.590
that we can learn from a
lot going forward, I think.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.860
Bob, I don't think many
in the charter community

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.810
would have appreciated
your linking

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.390
the notion of charter
schools to private school

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:31.000
choice in the poll question.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.377
Charters have tried to
avoid that debate yet.

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:34.210
ROBERT BLENDON: Yes.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:35.751
MARTIN WEST: And I
think you're going

00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:39.730
to see ramped up conflict over
the role of charter schools.

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.920
There has been a bit of
partisan polarization

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.130
on that topic in recent
years, and so that's

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.380
going to be something to
watch going forward as well.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.480
MARTY KADY: I'd like to just
jump over to Sheila real quick.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.830
We've got about a minute here.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:54.550
Are there particular state
moves on Medicaid or ACA

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.800
that we should be watching
that will tell us something

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.566
about where things are headed?

00:43:59.566 --> 00:44:02.080
SHEILA BURKE: I think,
Marty, as you suggested,

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.450
there are a host of
things taking place.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.760
Certainly, Wisconsin is an
interesting state to watch.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.630
It's looking to expand
its Medicaid program.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.810
Colorado and New
Mexico are both states

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.420
that are looking to increase
opportunities for coverage

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.330
and are looking at public
options and expansion

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.460
I think we also need
to watch what the state

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.760
insurance commissioners you're
doing in a variety of states,

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.820
some of whom are trying to
prevent the kind of changes

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:31.300
that a short-term plan
might result in in terms

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.090
of their risk pools and
essentially drawing people out

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.950
of the ACA plans.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:39.980
Obviously, California, as usual,
leading a series of efforts,

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.650
including wanting
to provide coverage

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.590
for undocumented immigrants.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.330
And that is
similarly, you've got

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.460
that taking place in New
York, both in the city

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.330
as well as in the state.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.390
So I think there are really
a host of activities.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.280
Arkansas, of course,
has led the effort

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.050
on the work requirements.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.910
We're now looking at
data that's suggesting

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.950
close to 18,000 people
will have lost coverage.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:03.280
So I think they're really,
each of the states, either

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.520
in Medicaid, either to expand,
or the work requirement

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.430
issues, other waiver requests
that are coming forward

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.490
from a number of states
in terms of flexibility

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.350
under the 1115 waivers.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.600
And I think we also have
to keep an eye on what

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.200
the Feds are willing to do.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.840
That is, what the
administration is

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.030
willing to allow to go forward.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.850
And there's another court case
before the Supreme Court, which

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.680
is quite interesting,
which is looking

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.340
at CMS' authority with
respect to its regulations,

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.290
and its pronouncements,
and what has

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.750
to go through a
public comment period.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.150
So again, I think there is
a great deal taking place

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:38.373
at the state level.

00:45:38.373 --> 00:45:39.910
MARTY KADY: Well, thank you.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.890
The Arkansas case is
an interesting example

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:44.050
of what sounds good on paper.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:47.590
Let's have work requirements, if
you're especially conservative,

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.960
for Medicaid, and
then 18,000 people

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.112
end up getting kicked off.

00:45:51.112 --> 00:45:52.570
I don't know if
they intended that,

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.269
but that's been the consequence.

00:45:54.269 --> 00:45:55.810
We're going to jump
to some questions

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.030
from both our online
audience. and if we have time,

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.839
folks in our live audience
can ask a question or two.

00:46:00.839 --> 00:46:02.380
There is one question
about the poll,

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.360
and I'm glad this is
in here, because it's

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.390
an interesting one.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:08.380
It said the majority
of Democrats

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.547
want to repeal and
replace the ACA.

00:46:10.547 --> 00:46:12.880
When you pause and say, wait
a second, that's not right,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.310
it's because they want
something bigger, Medicare

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:21.340
for all, single-payer,
maybe a European-style plan.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.729
Bob, can you talk about what the
poll revealed on that question?

00:46:24.729 --> 00:46:26.270
That is a question
from our audience.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:28.360
ROBERT BLENDON: So
a terrific question.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.490
How can you have people
incredibly in favor

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.240
of something for repealing it?

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.530
So it turns out an
accident of the poll

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.660
is if I want something bigger,
I have no way to say that.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.990
So we looked at the second poll
we did, and the results are.

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:46.045
If a Democrat said, I want
repeal and replace, almost 80%

00:46:46.045 --> 00:46:48.530
wanted Medicare for all.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.450
They wanted universal coverage.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:54.680
What they were saying is the
ACA is too anemic as it is.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.040
I need something bigger.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.610
But we only gave
them one question.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.250
So Republicans were answering,
I want this thing shrunken.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.160
I want a lot of conservatives--
and the Democrats in it

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.470
wanted to have a debate
over Medicare for all.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.980
So we really in the future
need to split that out.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.924
When you say that I want
an alternative to the ACA,

00:47:12.924 --> 00:47:14.840
do you really want
something larger and bigger

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.490
that covers everybody,
or do you really

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:18.400
want something much
more restricted?

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.210
But our apologies to everybody.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:23.660
We've got numerous
emails about, my neighbor

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.050
is furiously in love
with Medicare for all

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.390
and said they wanted
to repeal the ACA.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:30.830
Could you clarify that?

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:32.542
We have.

00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:35.450
MARTY KADY: There's
a specific question

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:38.480
from an online participant
here who didn't

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.052
provide their name for Richard.

00:47:40.052 --> 00:47:42.510
I don't want to duplicate what
you've already talked about,

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.720
but this person is asking,
since reducing drug prices

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.100
is an area of consensus, what
is the first actionable steps

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:49.600
we'll see?

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.200
I know you addressed some
of the legislative options,

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.397
but if there's something
specific that people out there

00:47:55.397 --> 00:47:57.230
should see as a signal
that there's actually

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:58.620
something happening on this.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.453
RICHARD FRANK: Yeah.

00:47:59.453 --> 00:48:03.470
I think you're going to
see a lot more being done

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:07.010
both in legislation, regulation,
to get generics on the market

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:09.650
quicker, to get
biosimilars on the market,

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:12.290
to just really amp
up competition.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:17.400
I think everybody agrees
that that's a good thing.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:24.326
And we've seen that when you do
that, prices continue to fall.

00:48:24.326 --> 00:48:26.170
MARTY KADY: And one
for you, Martin.

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.910
It's from one of our
online participants.

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.040
The question is, given
the student debt crisis,

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.577
community colleges become
increasingly more attractive,

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.910
but it's still really expensive.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.220
What would have to be
done at the federal level

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.500
to make a difference
in increasing access?

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.200
This poll shows people
are in favor of it,

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.150
but is there any
collaboration you

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.190
see between the
Republican worldview

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:47.560
and the Democratic worldview?

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.550
And you mentioned a lot of
the folks on that video,

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:54.380
I don't know what their higher
education background was.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.822
But some of them didn't
look like they had just

00:48:56.822 --> 00:48:58.280
graduated from a
four-year college,

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.950
maybe had gone for master's,
taken some community college,

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.900
or for-profits.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.730
But can you try to
address this question?

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:05.720
MARTIN WEST: Yeah.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.640
A community college
option is usually

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.440
quite an affordable
one, contrary to what

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.720
the question suggests.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.790
Now, there is the difficult
issue of living expenses.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:19.880
And it may be possible to
provide additional support

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.100
for students as they are
going through the school

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.800
beyond tuition.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:32.990
But I think that's where
you'll see states trying

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:37.100
to innovate through the
free community-type programs

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.620
that I was mentioning
a moment ago.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.950
I think, from a federal
policy perspective,

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:45.950
the Pell Grant system is
relatively well-established.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.390
There is question about
who exactly is eligible

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.600
and how you certify
your eligibility, how

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.880
we can simplify that for
students and make sure

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.250
that process is not a barrier.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.490
But I think the real question
is, how do we give schools

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:01.471
some skin in the game when
it comes to student results,

00:50:01.471 --> 00:50:01.970
right?

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:05.720
And I think finding
a way to hold

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.050
them accountable
for their student

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.400
success in repaying
their loans has to be

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.800
part of that conversation.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.580
And I think members
of both parties

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.780
have come around to that
view, sometimes reluctantly.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.430
The Obama administration
really tried

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:21.590
to advance that cause
through something

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.840
known as the gainful
employment rules, which

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.060
said that career-focused
programs mostly

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.120
in the for-profit
sector might lose

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.730
their eligibility for
federal financial aid

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.130
if their students weren't
successful in repaying

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.580
their loans.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.100
There's been a
lot of controversy

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.100
around that proposal,
questions about its legality,

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.300
its feasibility.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.270
The Davos administration--
the Trump administration,

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.350
Secretary Davos, has
repealed that approach,

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:52.260
and I think that's where the
action will be going forward.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.260
I think the key step
will be to make sure

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.340
that it applies to all colleges,
including community colleges,

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.981
rather than appearing to single
out the for-profit sector,

00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:03.230
which I think was one of the
challenges with the Obama

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.935
approach.

00:51:03.935 --> 00:51:06.050
MARTY KADY: I want to put in
a plug for a Politico story.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.330
We mentioned that
Gavin Newsom, who

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.560
is a governor of one of the more
liberal states in the country,

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.730
is pushing free
community college.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.380
But we had a recent
story in Politico

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.890
about a community college
in eastern Tennessee,

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:20.240
which is a place that Trump
won by 40 or 50 points that

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.910
has long had free
community college.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.490
The name of the college is
slipping, but look it up.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.500
It's a really interesting
story on a policy

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.720
that is working in a
different part of the country.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.590
I'm going to throw a
question to Sheila here.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:35.390
It's from Joyce Friedan, who is
a news editor at MedPage Today.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:36.925
Hi, Joyce.

00:51:36.925 --> 00:51:39.050
Any thoughts on what might
happen with the Medicaid

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:39.750
program?

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:42.170
She's specifically asking about
whether the administration

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.030
or congressional
Republicans will push

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.670
for block granting Medicaid.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:50.660
That's a long-term
conservative priority block

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.850
granting federal
money so that states

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.700
can put their own ideological
imprint on it is something

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.960
they love to do with Medicaid.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.710
Can you take that question?

00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:59.960
SHEILA BURKE: Sure, thank you.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.700
It's a terrific question.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.106
There has been a very
recent story suggesting

00:52:04.106 --> 00:52:05.480
that the administration
was going

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.960
to allow states to essentially
seek through a waiver process

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.750
the ability to block
grant and give them

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.360
full flexibility in terms of
the design of their Medicaid

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.140
program.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.320
The other form of this
is a per capita cap.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.760
Both are resisted tremendously
by Democrats, a fear

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.980
that the program, in
fact, will not only

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.770
change its nature because
of the state's flexibility

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.410
around issues like
eligibility, but also

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.580
that the funds over time will
be an adequate cover the folks

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.900
that are currently
covered under the program.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:40.010
So I fully expect that there
will be continued pressure

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:42.140
on the part of
Republicans to pursue that

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.660
or to allow the states to do
it through a waiver process,

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.980
but I think it will continue
to be fought tooth and nail

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.820
by the constituencies over
the entitlement program

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.630
nature of Medicaid, and also
those states, essentially,

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.480
who are likely to lessen
the number of things

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.630
that are provided and lessen
the coverage writ large.

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:04.330
But I assume it will
come back up again.

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:07.100
MARTY KADY: There is a
question on drug prices

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.140
from our online audience.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.150
What can be done to
lower drug prices

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.100
by reducing risk
and inefficiency

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.390
in drug development?

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:18.440
For example, this questioner
says that 90% of new drugs

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.150
fail in phase 3 clinical trials.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:24.470
So what is the improvement
that could happen

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:25.670
during the clinical process?

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:27.530
I don't know if that
statistic is correct,

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:28.952
but you can correct as you go.

00:53:28.952 --> 00:53:30.410
But that's an
interesting question.

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:32.520
A lot of the cost is
built into the process,

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.115
not just at the retail end.

00:53:34.115 --> 00:53:35.210
RICHARD FRANK: Yeah.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:41.090
And this is not a
place to necessarily

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:43.550
be super optimistic.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.160
Most of the cost of
the clinical trials

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.450
comes from human testing.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:53.960
And as you get more and more
towards personalized medicine,

00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:02.150
as you get more granular
in your clinical targets,

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:06.350
unless you have huge
impacts on the disease,

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:07.760
you need very large samples.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:12.440
You need to do big tests,
and that's expensive.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:17.060
And the combination of
having these targets

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:22.980
and having these
dramatic testing needs

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:26.100
does not leave me
optimistic on that front.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.290
I do think that artificial
intelligence, some

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:32.610
of the big data things
that we're seeing offer

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.840
some opportunity to
shave some costs,

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:40.220
but I don't see a clear path
right now to dramatic changes

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.795
there.

00:54:41.795 --> 00:54:43.850
MARTY KADY: We're going
to do some wrap-up here.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.590
We have about four
minutes to go.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:51.350
And I'll ask each panelist
to give a quick takeaway

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:52.820
on our discussion.

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.830
Feel free to make any
bold predictions that

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.230
are sure to be wrong,
since we're on tape.

00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.615
I'll start with you, Sheila.

00:54:59.615 --> 00:55:03.260
SHEILA BURKE: So I think your
suggestion, bold predictions,

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.440
I think the question is
really what's unknown.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.450
I think we have to
anticipate that there

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.180
will be either actions on the
part of the administration

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.810
on a regulatory basis or
an administrative basis

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:16.910
that we can't predict
today that could have

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:19.250
some enormous impacts
on either the Medicaid

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.590
program or the Medicare program.

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:24.410
I think it's a two-year
period of time where

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:27.710
there is deep division,
as Bob has suggested,

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:30.900
with little where one sees
the opportunity for coming

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.400
together.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.530
Drug prices may be
one of those areas.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.160
But I worry that, in fact,
we will make little progress

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.170
on some of the other
broad health care issues

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:41.570
about which we are
concerned because

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:43.550
of that fundamental
disagreement as to what

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.710
the role of the
government should be.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:48.140
But I'm expecting and
looking forward to the states

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.750
testing out a lot of things,
positively, one hopes,

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.290
in terms of providing
services and making

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:55.700
things more affordable.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.170
MARTY KADY: Martin?

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.520
MARTIN WEST: Sure.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.540
So I guess one prediction going
forward, as we're sitting here,

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.030
teachers in the nation's
second largest school system,

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:06.830
Los Angeles Unified,
have recently

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.380
wrapped up a week-long strike.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.630
Teachers in Denver
have just voted

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:13.140
to authorize a
strike of their own.

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:15.740
This comes on the heels
of statewide walkouts

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.800
in six states, including some
quite conservative states

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.420
last spring.

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.040
I think there's
a lot of activism

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.410
around the issue of school
spending and teacher salaries

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:29.300
right now, and I expect
that to continue.

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.460
Public sector unions,
including teachers unions

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:34.850
recently lost the ability
to collect agency fees

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:38.030
from nonmembers for their
representation services.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.860
They're out there really trying
to demonstrate their value.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.820
And so I think you will
see continued activism

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.290
on that front.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:49.100
One last observation, I
was wondering about my role

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.410
on this panel and
why it made sense

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:56.540
to have one education person
alongside multiple health care

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:57.110
people.

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.140
I do think there is a natural
connection between the two

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.820
issues, however.

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.670
And that's because this question
of controlling health care

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.470
costs, which came
up in the polling,

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:10.500
is one that matters for health
care and also for education.

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.700
If we look at why states
have reduced their investment

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:16.010
in higher education
on a per-student basis

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.145
in the past few
decades, the key driver

00:57:18.145 --> 00:57:19.520
seems to be that
they're spending

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.060
a lot more on Medicaid.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.560
So I'm not an expert on the
health care cost control front,

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.170
but I hope you all
can do a good job,

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:29.014
because it will matter
a lot for those of us

00:57:29.014 --> 00:57:29.930
who work in education.

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:31.526 --> 00:57:34.200
SHEILA BURKE: And actually,
Marty, if I could just add one

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:38.005
note to that point, and that
is the link between education

00:57:38.005 --> 00:57:39.360
and health care.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.240
And we know that the
social determinants

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.970
of health care and the
contributors education

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.920
is an enormously
important factor

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.800
in terms of people's access
to services and people's

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:49.710
understanding.

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.250
So there is a real
linkage there in terms

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.870
of how to make
services available

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:56.640
and how people take
up those services

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.570
MARTY KADY: Richard, any
quick wrap-ups or predictions

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:00.280
for this year?

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.613
RICHARD FRANK: Yeah, two things.

00:58:01.613 --> 00:58:05.150
I think that we
all are clamoring,

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:08.600
and the public's
clamoring for quick action

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.830
on drugs and things.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:13.760
I think it's important to
have a new conversation.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.529
This has been lying dormant
for about seven years

00:58:16.529 --> 00:58:18.320
since we had the last
serious conversation.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:22.010
I think that there are huge
problems in Medicare's drug

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:26.430
program that will be
important to address.

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.760
And I think having a
conversation about how

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.220
to do that, the
negotiation issue,

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.940
putting down on the
table what the ideas are,

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.060
and vetting them carefully,
I think it's important.

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:42.770
Just on one last point,
which is slightly different,

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.780
I think one of the
areas that showed up

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:49.820
in Bob's poll that also shows
up in the state federal nexus

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.490
is addressing the
opioid problem.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:57.140
And I think there is enormous
bipartisan opportunity there.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.140
And I think leveraging
all the tools

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.690
we have at both the state
and the federal level

00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:08.870
is incredibly urgent
to do and really should

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:12.932
be the major responsibility
of this Congress.

00:59:12.932 --> 00:59:14.390
MARTY KADY: Bob,
you're the one who

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:16.770
monitors trend lines in polls.

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:18.020
Where do you see things going?

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.120
ROBERT BLENDON: So
most practical takeaway

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.140
is six months from now,
the leaders of the parties

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.580
are going to go
off by themselves,

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.163
and they're going
to ask one question.

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:30.350
Do we want to run in
2020 having done nothing?

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:33.890
And President Trump's going
to have to look in the mirror

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.860
and say, what did
I actually enact?

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.230
And so where there's a big
difference about the future

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:43.220
is I think you can't be alone in
that room and say, do nothing.

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.860
I think something
here has to happen,

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.450
that you actually
go back to people

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:50.360
and say, this just
wasn't a sabbatical.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.740
We did something here.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.320
But others will
write tomorrow, no.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.500
The best advantage is to hold
hearings and investigations

00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:58.550
and go home.

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:00.420
I just think some
of these issues,

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.240
whether it's education
or drug prices,

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.250
they're actually going
to have to act on,

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:07.610
because the cynicism
of voters, that you

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:09.980
ran on these
dramatic discussions

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.690
and nothing happened, is
going to be very, very hard.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.669
But that's a
prediction of someone

01:00:14.669 --> 01:00:16.085
who's been wrong
quite frequently.

01:00:16.085 --> 01:00:17.870
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:20.390
MARTY KADY: Well I'm a
Washington journalist,

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.290
so I'm trying not to do
any predictions after 2016.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.180
So I don't know what's
in the Mueller report

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.880
or what will be in it, I don't
know when the shutdown will end

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.800
or how it will end,
and I don't know

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.260
what the economy will
be like a year from now

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.660
when Democratic voters are
going to the Iowa caucus

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.260
and deciding among 30 to
40 Democratic candidates.

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.180
But do know that
those three things

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.240
will be the cloud over
these substantive issues

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.260
as we roll through the
next six, 12, 18 months.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.550
We're going to wrap up here.

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:53.030
On behalf of the
Harvard TH Chan School

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.190
of Public Health
and Politico, I'd

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:57.260
like to thank
everyone for coming,

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.860
and thank you to
our online audience.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.580
I'd like to put in a
plug for the next forum.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:03.950
It's on February 1.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:05.360
The title is Rare Cancers--

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.677
Charting a Faster
