00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.310
Flash, the old timey sounds that
recall baseball from the '20s

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.496
were equal parts
acting and technology.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.720
Hey guys and dolls.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.670
Trace here with the
latest in vocal repartee.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.700
One of my favorite things to
do when I'm doing a fake accent

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.480
is an old timey
newsreel announcer.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.166
Just throw on a quick flash
and then use normal sentences.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.040
It sounds way better.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.670
Flash, rebels take
the planet of Endor.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.060
So why did those
guys talk like that?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.290
Firstly, they didn't
actually talk like that.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.420
They announced like that.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.130
And they acted like that.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.810
Around the turn of
the last century,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.990
America was still proving
itself as a nation.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.690
At the time, parts
of the Northeast

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.110
and mid-Atlantic regions
had a certain affectation

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.050
in their accent.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.980
It was like a blend of
British and American,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.340
but not entirely either.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.670
It came from certain groups
of the American aristocracy

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.550
and fell out of favor
after World War II.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.010
It was also taught as a manner
of speech for Hollywood actors.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.030
You might recognize the accent
from someone like Cary Grant.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.010
Well, I imagine you've had wide
acquaintance amongst policemen.

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:04.774
I'll have to call one
if you keep that up.

00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:07.820
But when you electronically
record the human voice,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.435
things get even stranger.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.482
It was recently discovered that
French bookseller douard-Lon

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:16.620
Scott de Martinville
was the first to record

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.700
the human voice.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.480
In 1857, de Martinville
patented the phonautograph,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.950
a simple device that recorded
the vibration of sound waves

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.460
onto soot-covered paper.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.004
That invention
eventually evolved

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:29.920
into Edison's phonograph,
which could actually

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.200
play the sounds back.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.680
But it sounded really tinny.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.430
This had to do with
the lack of technology

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.510
at the time for capturing bass.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.560
And as recording and
reproduction improved,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.950
the sound got better,
and reproduction, more

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.350
and more accurate.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.250
Then we were presented
with a new problem--

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.670
we hated the way our
voices sound when

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.820
it was recorded, right?

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.820
What the hell is that?

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.320
In case, you're wondering, yes,
that is what you sound like.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.320
And a higher pitched
version of yourself

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.270
is really what it is, with a lot
more [ANNOYING SOUND] in there.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.450
But when you speak,
you can hear yourself.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.410
So why does it sound different?

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.330
Your bones.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.507
Sound vibrates everything
around it, including our bones.

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:06.590
So when we speak our voice,
goes out of our mouth,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.070
through the air, and
then into our ears.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.340
But it also goes
through our skull

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.160
and resonates into
the backs of our ears,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.170
making our voice sound deeper.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.640
So why do we hate it so much?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.540
Because mirrors lie.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.160
They lie to you,
and you lie to you.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.860
We spend our hives looking
in the mirror perfecting

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.900
how we think we look.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.190
But that is not you.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.274
That's a reverse image.

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:27.440
Your left side is you right.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.648
Your right side is your left.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.620
The whole world is upside
down-- well, flipped anyway.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.000
We spend our lives perfecting
the sound of a voice

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.210
that only we hear.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.410
So when we hear it
as others do, it's

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.910
similar to the one
we know and love.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.550
But it's not quite right.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.600
What is your favorite accent?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.270
British?

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.430
Southern?

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.840
Jack Sparrow?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.240
Throw your favorites,
and why, in the comments

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.490
so we can talk all about it.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.420
Thanks for tuning in
to DNews everybody.
