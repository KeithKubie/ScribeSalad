00:00:00.745 --> 00:00:01.778
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.778 --> 00:00:05.697
is think a little bit
about the estate tax.

00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:07.200
Estate tax.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.281
As the name of the tax implies,

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.609
it is a tax on someone's estate,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.805
or, when someone passes away,

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.889
it is a tax on what they
want to leave behind

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:19.072
to whoever they want to leave it to,

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:20.809
either in their will or in their family,

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.542
or whoever they want to
leave their stuff to.

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:26.137
Sometimes it's referred
to as an inheritance tax.

00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:29.005
Inheritance tax.

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.608
Sometimes you'll hear it
talked this ways on the news.

00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:34.337
Maybe it's a little bit derisive.

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:36.602
It's called a death tax.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:39.167
A death tax.

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:42.009
The general idea, let's
say that right now,

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.423
my entire net worth,
I am worth $3,000,000.

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:49.001
I am worth $3,000,000.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.079
Then I pass away,

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.735
so this $3,000,000 goes into my estate.

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:58.079
This is my estate.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.668
This $3,000,000 could
be all of my savings;

00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:01.872
could be my stock portfolio;

00:01:01.872 --> 00:01:03.672
could be the value of
my land, my real estate;

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:05.279
everything I own; my car.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:07.211
Everything combined is worth $3,000,000.

00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:10.831
It goes into my estate after I pass.

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.269
Let's say I leave everything in my estate

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:17.244
to my daughter.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.262
I leave it to my daughter.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:24.272
It's at this point that the
estate tax comes into question,

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:27.143
of how much money will my daughter get?

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.269
It turns out for $3,000,000

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:33.871
my daughter is exempt for inheritance.

00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:37.875
From an individual, the
first $5,000,000 are exempt.

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.423
In this situation,

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:42.336
where I'm leaving
$3,000,000 for my daughter,

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:48.425
she actually will get
the entire $3,000,000.

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:51.003
If, let's say, I'm even richer than that.

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.925
Let's say that I have $6,000,000.

00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:56.079
Let's say the scenario,
where I have $6,000,000.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.002
It all goes to my estate.

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.753
It all goes into the
estate after my death,

00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:05.604
and now the first $5,000,000 is exempt.

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.004
Let me write my daughter over here.

00:02:09.188 --> 00:02:12.804
My daughter will get the
first 5,000,000 tax free.

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:15.136
5,000,000 tax free,

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:18.672
and then the increment
above that exemption,

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:21.603
the increment above
what has been excluded,

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:24.073
will then be taxed at a certain rate,

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:26.070
and that rate is constantly changing,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.342
but for the sake of simplicity

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:29.218
I'm going to go with 35%,

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:32.803
and that's actually the rate in 2011.

00:02:32.803 --> 00:02:34.754
The rest of the 1,000,000,

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:41.712
the 1,000,000 taxed at 35%.

00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:45.333
The Federal Government will
tax 35% of the 1,000,000,

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:50.475
so they will essentially
take 350,000 for themselves.

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:52.800
350,000 for themselves,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.291
and my daughter will
be left with 5,650,000,

00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:59.802
because of this 1,000,000
you take out 350,000.

00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:02.739
You have 650,000 left.

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.468
My daughter, in this situation,

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.207
will be left with ...

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:15.017
Maybe I can write "$5.65 million."

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:17.517
The Federal Government took 350,000.

00:03:17.517 --> 00:03:19.591
If I am super-rich,

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:21.991
let's say that I am worth ...

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.078
let me make a number
to make the math easy,

00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:27.207
so I don't have to get a calculator out.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:33.909
Let's say that I am worth $1,005,000,000.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.999
This is my net worth.

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.575
In this situation, the first
5,000,000 will be excluded,

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:44.142
so my daughter will get the 5,000,000.

00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:45.938
Will get the 5,000,000 directly.

00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:46.999
That will be excluded.

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.268
Then everything above that
will be taxed at the 35%.

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:55.793
In this situation, you have
$1,000,000,000 taxed at 35%.

00:03:55.793 --> 00:04:01.913
1,000,000,000 at 35%.

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:05.999
In this scenario, the Federal Government

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:10.943
will take $350,000,000.

00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:14.000
Would take $350,000,000,
and so that would leave,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.413
of this billion, $650,000,000
left for my daughter.

00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:21.331
In total, she would get this 650,000,000,

00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:23.809
plus the 5,000,000 that was excluded.

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:29.201
She would end up with a
total of $655,000,000.

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:30.803
I wouldn't feel too bad for her.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.928
She should be pretty okay.

00:04:32.928 --> 00:04:34.834
That's just how the estate tax works.

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:36.997
These examples I gave,

00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:38.877
the 5,000,000 that is excluded,

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:42.534
this is for an individual
when they pass away.

00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:44.269
If it's being done as a couple,

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:46.266
this exemption is actually 10,000,000.

00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:48.751
If, between my wife and I,

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:52.207
we have $1,005,000,000,

00:04:52.207 --> 00:04:53.664
and let's say I pass away,

00:04:53.664 --> 00:04:55.197
and we own everything collectively,

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:59.539
she actually gets the extra
joint exemption passed onto her,

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.919
and then if and when she passes away,

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.468
this would be $10,000,000
that will be tax-free.

00:05:05.468 --> 00:05:08.138
In this scenario, if this
is being done as a couple,

00:05:08.138 --> 00:05:10.956
my daughter would get
the entire $6,000,000.
