1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience. Joe, you did it.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,530
You might be right about this racist shit,
by the way,

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,820
because the only other ones that
don't have to pay taxes. The, the,

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,070
the golf league. The PGA and that. The NHL

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,820
Peter [inaudible].

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,910
Hold on. There's another fellow. Well Dad
is fucking creepy. You should be pissed.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,300
Yeah. Doug Golf guys don't have to
pay tax like the most money. Right?

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,470
Wow. That's dark. That's dark,

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,250
dark racism. Wow. I think it's racism.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,610
I'm crying racism for the NBA and
I don't even watch basketball.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,440
Yeah. The idea that you could get
away with that Scientology thing,

12
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:44,690
that that could be,
we need to start our own fucking religion.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,340
That's what needed to do.
God dammit.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,750
That's how you're really
good tip blockchains.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,810
That's how you're really locked down.
That's the quote right there.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,060
When this dog and
religion, God dammit. Well,

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,000
they have so much money that
they can get away with it.

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,540
Like Scientology is a number
to land owner in Los Angeles.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,350
They own more buildings and
property real estate in Los Angeles.

20
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:07,490
Then like almost anybody,

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,580
hey freakiest thing is,

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,310
you know how to rope off everything
at a time square when, uh,

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,090
when the ball is going to
drop or whatever. Yeah.

24
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,600
And there's a certain time you
can't go past the barricades.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,810
One night I was there and the guy said,

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,600
why are you a member of the Church
of Scientology? And I said, yeah.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,700
And he let me in through the barricade.
Real Story. Dude. Real Story.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,830
He probably just wanted to fuck you.

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,290
[inaudible] handsome guy.

30
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:43,211
[inaudible]

31
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,240
take a cod podcast.

32
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,370
[inaudible] press a button.

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,550
You gotta keep the ball moving. What is
the, wow, what are you supposed to say?

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,340
Amazing.
He probably loved you,

35
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,690
dude. The Scientologists friends I could
give me goosebumps are really good song.

36
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:10,870
Didn't give me goosebumps.

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,740
Like the other day I was driving
home and radar love came on.

38
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,850
You know that song you've
ever heard that song? Oh God.

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,470
It's like a one hit wonder band from
the sixties or seventies pull that,

40
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:26,740
pull that out. Brian is the
greatest driving music of all time.

41
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,500
And when I was 18 years old,

42
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,980
I had this girlfriend that
moved to western Massachusetts.

43
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:34,090
I was living in Boston,

44
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,470
I was living in Newton and she moved to
like an hour and a half away and he's to

45
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:40,780
have to drive to go visit her.
And My cars were always pieces of shit,

46
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:41,940
so it's always a death drive.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,140
Then one time I broke down in the
snow storm halfway to visitors.

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,120
Fucking huge disaster.
But uh,

49
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,210
I had a cassette and I would play this
song radar love because it's all about

50
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,014
driving.

51
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,310
It's all about driving when
you're exhausted and just
keeping your foot on the

52
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:00,701
gas.

53
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:05,701
And this song came on the other day and
my whole body tangled like I'm driving

54
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,700
and I heard it come on,
like as I change the channel,

55
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,540
it was right with a drum starts beating

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,890
right here,
right here.

57
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,140
And that's right when I hit the channel
and that was in the car and I was

58
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,170
driving and it was late at
night. Any, first of all,

59
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,920
my whole body started tingling and it
brought me immediately back the beans,

60
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,900
some half retarded,

61
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,110
18 year old driving my piece of shit.

62
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,320
Audi Fox that could fall
apart at any minute.

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,060
Wheels could fly off and go
in the fucking oncoming lanes.

64
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,620
Listen to this shit though.
Their boys in my head that Mikey d

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
some dude did this to

66
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,960
it's half as as I'm shifting

67
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,050
[inaudible]

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,710
red.
That's a powerful fucking song.

69
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,900
They have loved radar love.

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,110
She sends it out and he gets in the
car and fucking guns it over there.

71
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,880
That's fucking beautiful. Thank you for
introducing that to me. It's tingly.

72
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:36,170
It gives me tingles.
So tell me man we were,

73
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,510
we were talking about this but
we got off track, up subject.

74
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,800
What did you do the entire
year that you were in? Solid.

75
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,790
Sorry,
what was your day?

76
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,780
Did all to wake up cause
cause it was weird.

77
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:50,170
They would feed us like at m
4:00 AM was breakfast, right?

78
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,740
Does that wake you have a
feed you breakfast and eat
and pass back out. Right.

79
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,491
And then you get up again,

80
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:57,730
like really nine or 10 and hour
and 10 o'clock we'll be lunch.

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,820
That's what need you to
tell it. [inaudible] weird
schedule, pick the lunch.

82
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,410
And then from that point
on I will just read,

83
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,620
I would read from 10:00 AM until like 11
at night and I'll take an hour break to

84
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:08,920
work out.
Wow.

85
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,990
I mean I read the second year I
kept track of with 117 books. Wow.

86
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,020
But um, I, there's not any way
I could ever have way more.

87
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,660
But you went out of books, you know,
you run out of books. It's so boring.

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,780
I only came out of my cell every other
day for an hour, you know what I mean?

89
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,630
And then just like a
just fucking board dude.

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,100
What is it like to not talk to people
for so long? I mean you talked to,

91
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:34,770
I mean it's just weird dude.
It's like a, as far as anybody,

92
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,390
it's like a fucking time warp
because when you're in there,

93
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,250
the day goes by real slow with like the
months go by quick and then when you get

94
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,890
out it's just like, it's like a, it
was all a dream. You didn't move.

95
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,830
You weren't even in there. It's weird.
It fucks with your head and then like,

96
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,300
oh it was whoa man, they under fed us so
bad. Do they fucking on the Fed is bad.

97
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,800
Yeah. And last thing real bad, uh, I was
trying to calculate how much protein,

98
00:05:56,801 --> 00:06:01,640
I thought that was good in a day and it
was like 20, 30 grams, dude, Whoa, here's,

99
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,160
here's, I know it was
bullshit. And this is in Vegas,

100
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:07,040
especially if it's anything
goes better in Vegas.

101
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,260
We only got a piece of
fruit like twice a week.

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,620
So like we've got like an orange like
twice or three times a week. That's it.

103
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,610
But it's weird cause Mayweather was there,
right? So may when I got there to his,

104
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:20,720
his like two months sends fucking,
he started bitching at the, at the,

105
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,820
at the judge like they're not feeding
me enough to give me shit for you,

106
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,260
blah blah blah.
All of a sudden Bam fruit every day.

107
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,740
Big Portions, all this shit for all of
you. Everyone. Right. Cause I know why.

108
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:32,181
I know why.

109
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:35,370
Because they were scared that maybe
whether it's camp was going to have the,

110
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,980
the people that feed us, you
know, investigating. Yeah.
You know, and guess what,

111
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,660
the second he left went away. Wow. No
Shit. I swear to God. And I told the,

112
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,590
I told one of the cool, God's aim and
come here. I say notice motherfucker.

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,760
They as soon as me with her
started bitching at court,

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,530
now we've got bigger trades and we got
fruit everyday and he started chuckling

115
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,110
and he laughed and walked
away. Blight. It's like they
knew, they knew what was up.

116
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,370
They were undefeated
on the fuck out of us.

117
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,540
Yeah. My Brother Sam is the cherries
and the brother wrote it. Yeah. Big,

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,950
big part of it that keeps sticking with
me was that he was like this really

119
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,100
normal quiet kind of kid and
then he got hit in the head.

120
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,490
He got like hit by a car and he got
really fucked up and when he recovered he

121
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:20,750
became this reckless fucking maniac.
He became Kennison. So you know,

122
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,760
a big part of what made him so
amazing might've been an accident.

123
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,590
Like that happens sometimes.

124
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,320
Like there was a story recently
about a guy who got hit in the head.

125
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,350
He had some sort of head injury and
then he came out of it and he could play

126
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:37,210
music. Like there's weird things
that happen sometimes, right?

127
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,630
I went to school with a girl that had
a head injury in that she got huge tits

128
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,520
and I'm not trying to be funny.
I wish I was lying to you.

129
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:47,420
This chick was flat chested is fuck.
Got a head injury her freshman year.

130
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,040
By the time she was a junior,

131
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:54,041
her tits were fucking ginormous and
should become like this sex fucking crazy

132
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:57,140
chick like,
and I went to grammar school with her.

133
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:01,880
I knew she wasn't a sex fiend and I
bumped into like when she was a senior and

134
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,090
she was fucking nuts. I was
a junior. I was like, Jesus,

135
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,360
just to fucking kids and just wondering
to fuck. Just, just, you know,

136
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,140
like if this guy doesn't fuck me,
y'all gonna fuck me. I'm like, ah.

137
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:16,980
I don't think I had injury. Think it
was, now that you said that, well,

138
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:20,030
think about Shannon and reusable and now
she won't talk to me now. She made up, I,

139
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,580
my buddy of mine bumped
into her and she goes,

140
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,840
I don't talk for that mother fucker.

141
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,870
She wasn't talking about slow because
she wasn't, you wouldn't bug her.

142
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,050
I don't know what it was. And I,
and I still mad in the freshman.

143
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,470
That's the girl I got left back
over. Oh Wow. In the seventh grade,
