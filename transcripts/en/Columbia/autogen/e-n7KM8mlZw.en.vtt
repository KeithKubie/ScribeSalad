you could say that megafauna extinction

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720
you could say that megafauna extinction
 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.969
you could say that megafauna extinction
is about big animal extinction but why

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979
is about big animal extinction but why
 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.310
is about big animal extinction but why
would you say big animal when you can

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320
would you say big animal when you can
 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.750
would you say big animal when you can
say megafauna and and you know give a

characterization of the equatorial climb
 

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.970
characterization of the equatorial climb
and here the middle climb is that it is

and here the middle climb is that it is
 

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.150

when you get up here that's just too

when you get up here that's just too
 

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.690
when you get up here that's just too
cold so you don't have any thing there

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:57.700
cold so you don't have any thing there
 

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.190
cold so you don't have any thing there
so it's the the temperate zones north

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200
so it's the the temperate zones north
 

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.500
so it's the the temperate zones north
and south that theoretically is where

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.490
and south that theoretically is where
you have civilization and as luck would

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.500
you have civilization and as luck would

have it Ptolemy and Aristotle both lived

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:10.750
have it Ptolemy and Aristotle both lived

have it Ptolemy and Aristotle both lived
in such a temperate zone and therefore

at Central Asia and you say well Central

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:30.990
at Central Asia and you say well Central

conflict and so people got in their

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:29.580
conflict and so people got in their
 

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.880
conflict and so people got in their
boats and they and they left but there

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:31.890
boats and they and they left but there
 

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:33.260

was no place to go that wasn't already
 

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.330
was no place to go that wasn't already
inhabited and so they come and they

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:35.340
inhabited and so they come and they
 

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.570

know what can I say

that would be new and different and I

that would be new and different and I

that would be new and different and I
thought well I have to draw on what I

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.160

know and that is the other parts of the

different in that area and then with the
 

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.910
different in that area and then with the
domestic animals it's it's a similar

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920
domestic animals it's it's a similar
 

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.950
