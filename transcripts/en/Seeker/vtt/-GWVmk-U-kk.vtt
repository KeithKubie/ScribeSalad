00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.860
You're hearing these dolphins

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.680
use high-pitched clicks and whistles

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.597
to navigate a world of obstacles, danger, and prey

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.040
with their pods.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.140
But these spirited signals are in 
jeopardy of being drowned out

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.780
as the ocean gets noisier every year.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.620
PAUL: When we saw those dolphins, and

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.220
put the hydrophone in the water, I almost cried.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.740
It was the first time in my life I could hear their voices.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.960
With more than 500 miles under his belt,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.660
Ben Lecomte and the crew are more eager than ever

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.000
to get his trans-Pacific Swim back on track

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.840
and continue raising awareness for ocean health.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.740
They will then resume the protocol

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.020
of collecting 8-12 hours of underwater audio each night,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.920
in an effort to build the most comprehensive

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.760
soundscape of the Pacific Ocean in history.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.840
PAUL: The first goal for us is to have this photography,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.700
this sound postcard of the ocean.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.320
This data could help scientists determine

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.637
how crowded the ocean is with marine mammals,

00:01:18.637 --> 00:01:21.177
and how they're affected by man-made sounds,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.400
like shipping traffic.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.100
HERVE: The more you have sounds
in the sea,  in the oceans,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.780
the less the animals can communicate

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.560
between each other, so the less they meet.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.040
The less they meet, the less they reproduce.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.480
The team is using a calibrated hydrophone,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.060
a microphone that picks up specific frequencies

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.540
within a 20-km radius underwater.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.560
It can detect everything from the 
playful clicking of dolphins

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.580
to the sound of sperm whales hunting.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.500
HERVE: A "soundscape" is a recording 
of a multiplicity of sounds.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.820
Recording these sounds will create which scientists call an "acoustic transect."

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.260
HERVE: Each night, we're recording 
from sunset to the morning

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.780
with the same hydrophone, at the same position, 
from the same boat

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.140
so it makes something like 3,000 hours of recordings.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.200
When the team receives the data, they feed it through artificial intelligence models

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.500
they've developed that can recognize the 
calls, clicks, and whistles

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.860
of a number of different cetacean species.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.340
Anthropophony are the sounds from human activities;

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.100
biophony are the sounds from biological activities;

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.580
and geophony is the sounds 
from the wind, and the rain, and the tectonic.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.420
So our work is to use what we call the
machine listening system.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.640
We train this machine on the soundscape
of cetacean sounds,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.120
and then they are able to index, or categorize, classify

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.920
sounds from many different species.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.680
This catalogue could map population 
densities of whales and dolphins

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.340
as the crew travels east, and may even pick up some

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.620
surprising signals along the way.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.060
HERVE: During the Cold War, some did record
what they called a "Big Duck."

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.680
They didn't know at all what it was, and they thought

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.140
it was a special submarine from the East Bloc.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.180
But it was a minke whale.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.020
And this minke whale has been completely described

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.380
only 10 years ago.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.780
If audio evidence can reveal where cetacean superhighways cross the Pacific,

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.800
then policymakers can develop "quiet zones"

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.300
to help alleviate the stress of human noise 
on wildlife communication.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.100
This is why continuing Ben's mission
to highlight ocean health is so important.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.040
HERVE: The best outcome of The Swim
is to demonstrate

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.900
that there is a continuity alive in the ocean.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.480
It's a complex habitat. It's full of life.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.580
And the density of this life will be depicted
by these recordings.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.600
PAUL: The water is not empty.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.700
It has been very surprising to see how much life there is.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.820
We have our everyday whale...
like at the point where we drop Ben,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.819
we always have  a whale waiting for us.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.600
So to enter in some kind of relationship with this world

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.960
and with all these mammals
and all these creatures in the water....

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.000
Learning from them by listening is very, very touching.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.320
