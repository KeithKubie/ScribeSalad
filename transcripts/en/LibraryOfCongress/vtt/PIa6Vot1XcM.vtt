00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.770
&gt;&gt; We are here at the Library

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.580
of Congress today celebrating
a really remarkable milestone,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.230
100 million books that
have been given away

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.340
by the Imagination Library.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.840
Can you share with us the
story about your incentive

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.180
for beginning this program?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.690
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: Well,
first of all, I'm very --

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.120
very excited about being here
at the Library of Congress

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.370
and knowing that I have a
little book that's going

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.910
to go there forever
that's celebrating our 100

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.210
millionth book.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.720
But, the actual beginning of the
Imagination Library was based

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.880
on my own life, and my
own dad who was not able

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.660
to read nor write,
but one the smarter

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.800
that one would ever
want to know.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.570
And daddy got to live long
enough to see it, again,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.020
to takeoff and do good.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.190
And to hear the kids
call me the book lady,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.910
he got such a kick out of that.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.760
But, daddy took a
lot of pride in this,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.310
and I wanted to make
my dad proud.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.150
I wanted to honor him
because of his goodness,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.260
and his willingness,
and his love

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.620
for all his kids,
there's 12 of us.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.960
And so, daddy just worked
hard, and it was just --

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.580
it made me feel good in my heart

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.900
that I could do something
to make daddy proud.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.280
And the bigger it gets, the
more I think about my dad,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.220
and to think he must be up
there somewhere thinking,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.520
"Yeah, you go.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.820
You go, you did it."

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.120
So, anyway I'm proud.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.540
And The Little Coat of Many
Colors is a story, a true story

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.580
from my childhood about a little
coat my mother made for me.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.200
So, today I got to honor
my daddy and my mother

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.500
by having the little that
she had told that inspired me

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.750
to write the song about
a little raggedy coat.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.150
She told the story from
the bible when she made

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.540
that little coat
for me in real life.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.160
And so, it was just -- today
was -- it was real special,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.080
because of mom, dad, and
the 100 millionth book.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.530
&gt;&gt; They must be so proud.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.880
Have you've thought about how
many children you've impacted

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.400
with this program?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.700
It's so remarkable.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.000
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: Well,
it makes me feel good

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.300
to hear all the little stories

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.420
from all the kids
that I -- they say.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660
That I've touched, all
the little letters I get,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.530
letters from the
kids, and the things

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.030
that all the kids have to say.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.560
Some of the kids when they're
six years old I get letters,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.700
because they're really
disappointed that they're not

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.000
in the program anymore.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.250
They're not getting their
books, because it stops

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.140
when they start kindergarten
when they're five, so it's cute.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.190
And then, through the
years, see we've been --

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.690
for 23 years we've had
this program going,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.440
but it's only been in the last
several years is it's done

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.740
so great.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.070
But, the fact that we have
kids that are in college now,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.220
or kids that are married
and have little kids

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.380
of their own now, it's
really amazing to, you know,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.740
to get a letter from
somebody like that.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.860
And to say, you know,
what it has meant to them,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.340
or what it's meaning to
their little bitty kids.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670
&gt;&gt; They are Imagination
Library graduates.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.970
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: Yeah, they are.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.730
&gt;&gt; In 2011, you expanded
the program to include audio

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.360
and braille books as well,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.930
why was that an important
step to take?

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.320
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: We felt that
it was important for audio

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.930
and for the braille, because
there's so many children

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.650
out there that are so different.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.040
And that's one of the
things in the Little Coat

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.390
of Many Colors book talking
about the difference in people.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.860
And the anti-bullying,
or just accepting

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.550
that everybody is not the same.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.670
So, accept each other as
we are, and who we are.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.430
But, it really -- I think we
will grow through the years,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.900
and with all the --
this day in time,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.680
with all the social
media I'm sure we'll have

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.500
to make all sorts of changes.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.710
But, I'm always hoping
that we can have some --

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.870
the little physical books that
they can hold in their hand,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.490
and they can actually
get through the mail.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.430
But, time will tell, but
we'll grow with the times.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.720
&gt;&gt; One of the announcements
today is about a collaboration

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.480
with the Library of Congress,
and the Imagination Library

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.360
to hold story time for children.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.730
What do you think it says to
the children around the nation

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.030
that the National Library --

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.460
the Congressional Library
has programs for them?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.580
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: I think that
should mean a lot to children.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.610
I really think to have
a program like that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.290
where they feel special,
they're made to feel special,

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.530
and they think -- I think they
take a lot of pride in anything.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.450
I think children
take pride in anybody

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.450
that makes them feel special.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.490
I think it gives
them a confidence.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.780
I think it instills
a pride in them

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.170
that they carry their
whole lives.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.810
And plus, I think it's
a wonderful program,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.920
I think it also has a whole lot
of children to be, of course,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.710
and they can share, you
know, a common dream

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.150
and a common thing -- or theme.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.430
And so, I think that
it's a wonderful thing

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.000
that they're doing, I think
it'll just make the children

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.160
even more special
and more complete.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.530
&gt;&gt; Like owning their own books.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.360
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: Like owning
their own books, yeah.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.970
&gt;&gt; I wanted to shift gears and
ask you just a couple questions

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.580
about one of the other
wonderful legacies

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.710
of your life of song writing.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.340
The unit -- the U.S. Copy Write
Office is here at the library.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.180
You've been writing songs
for so many decades,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.680
and we did some homework,
and found one

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.200
of your earliest registrations,
It's Sure Going to Hurt by you

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.500
and your uncle Bill Owens.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.800
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: Yes.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.010
&gt;&gt; What does copywrite
mean to song writers?

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.310
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton:
Well, it feels --

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.180
it makes you feel like that
you've -- what you do, your art,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.630
your work is being
recognized and being protected.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.430
I remember I started writing
for BMI Broadcasting Music,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.100
I've always been with them, when
I was really -- really young.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.890
That particular copywrite
you're talking about,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.680
I think I was 15 maybe
when -- 14 or 15.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.170
I was probably 14 when I
wrote it, 15 when it came

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.570
out as a record, It May Not
Kill Me, but It's Sure Going

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.580
to Hurt was the whole
them, It's Sure Going

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.950
to Hurt was the title.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.200
But, when I -- they actually
shared that with me today,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.230
they brought some of the
things out and let me see them.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.240
And it was just amazing to
think that all these years,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.250
and going back that far in
time, and it made me feel

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.400
like an old fossil in a way.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.370
But, I mean, I feel --
I've often said that I'm --

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.100
I feel like I'm as
old as yesterday,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.450
but as new as tomorrow.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.370
And to think that they had
all that stuff from back then,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.250
and now here I am, you know,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.320
still doing good
things in the world.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.340
And doing -- hopefully trying
to continue to do good things

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.100
to uplift people, and mankind,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.600
and to glorify God,
you know, in my way.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.300
So, I just really -- you
know, it's been a journey,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.000
and it's been one that I've
tried to stay on course with.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.460
I've tried never to waiver,
I mean, I love to branch out

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.860
and do different things, but
I've always kept, you know,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.750
kept straight to more to my
music than anything else.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.430
Because out of a song,
it's carried me everywhere,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.510
carried me out of the
Smokies, it's brought me her

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.080
to Library of Congress.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.550
My little story of Many Colors

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.150
and the little book,
and the song.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.520
So, its' been a wonderful life.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.270
&gt;&gt; Well, speaking of that
song, the Library in 2011,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.390
added that song to the
National Recording Registry,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.670
which is the congressionally
created program

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.860
to recognize the most
important sound recordings

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.160
in our nation's history.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.460
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: Wow.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.760
&gt;&gt; What did the recognition
mean to you?

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.650
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: It meant a lot,
and one of the things I'm proud

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.310
of still about The Little
Coat of Many Colors,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.500
because at that time,
you never think

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.390
about those things of course.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.890
Because ma 'ma had just made
that little coat out of scraps

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.310
and I needed the coat.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.240
In order to make me feel
proud and not ashamed

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.270
that I was having to
wear rags and scraps,

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.310
she told me the story
from the bible, the --

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.330
little Joseph's coat
of many colors.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.060
Then as years went
by it became a hit,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.900
it really healed
a lot of people.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.650
People related to it, because so
many people had been made fun of

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.220
or laughed at, or made to feel
less over it's being, you know,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.720
a handicap or overweight,
or just anything that --

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.070
or whatever it may be.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.370
But this little book addresses
the difference in people.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.350
It's about love, it's more
than a song, it's a philosophy,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.580
it's an attitude,
it's about acceptance.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.640
And now in schools they teach a
lot of - from this little Coat

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.770
of Many Colors book, my --
the original one, and the song

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.030
when we first illustrated
the song.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.460
And it's -- really
talks about bullying

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.990
and just how it's not --
that's not a good thing.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.760
And when I did a
children's album this year,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.640
all the money going to
the Imagination Library.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.060
A lot of the songs based
on some of the books

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.360
from the Imagination Library,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.050
but I did directly
address the bullying.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.930
There's a song called Making
Funny -- Funny, and it's like,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.450
how would you feel if
this happened to you?

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.120
So, through that little book,
The Coat of Many Colors,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.830
and how that little book
has meant so much to so many

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.490
through the years,
the song and the book,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.450
and what it teaches children,
makes me feel very proud.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.400
And I know -- I know
my dad's proud

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.670
of the Imagination Library,
and the 100 million books,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.990
but I know my mom
is just as proud

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.290
of The Little Coat
of Many Colors.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:38.510
So, this is -- this is a great
honor for me for my parents.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.100
&gt;&gt; What a great honor to have
you here with us at the Library.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.400
Thank you so much.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.010
&gt;&gt; Dolly Parton: Well,
thank you very much.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.570
&gt;&gt; This has been presentation
of the Library of Congress.
