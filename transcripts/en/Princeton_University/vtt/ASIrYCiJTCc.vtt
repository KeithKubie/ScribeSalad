Eric Salazar:
Thank you for joining me on a tour of Princeton
University's Eating Clubs. I'm Eric Salazar,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.890 position:94%
Eric Salazar:
and I'm a former president of the Princeton Quadrangle Club.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.059 position:75%
Eric Salazar:
The clubs are some of the most prominent and
active dining and social options for Princeton's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.199 position:81%
Eric Salazar:
upperclassmen. All 10 of the clubs are coeducational
and are operated by student leadership.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.440 position:67%
Eric Salazar:
About 70 percent of Princeton's junior and
senior class members eat their meals in one

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.910 position:70%
Eric Salazar:
of the clubs that line Prospect Avenue, which
students call "The Street."

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:00.200
[music]

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.790 position:70%
Haley Thompson:
What I like about eating here is that we have
some impact on what we get to eat. We have

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.110 position:64%
Haley Thompson:
a really open relationship with our chef,
and if there's a dinner that's delicious,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.870 position:69%
Haley Thompson:
we can go to the chef and tell him that it
was delicious and we want more of something.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.580 position:70%
Eric Salazar:
The clubs provide a range of social, academic
and intramural sports activities that are

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.230 position:67%
Eric Salazar:
just as much of an attraction as the meals.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.330 position:67%
Haley Thompson:
What being a member of the club means most
to me is having a family on campus. I study

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.870 position:80%
Haley Thompson:
here, I eat here, I do pretty much everything here.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.130 position:70%
David Hou:
Everything we do here at the club is a social
function. It all has a uniting feeling for

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.460 position:67%
David Hou:
all the members, and that's really what the
clubs are about.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.780 position:70%
Haley Thompson:
I certainly do a lot of work at Cap, as well.
We have problem-set sessions in the computer

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.570 position:66%
Haley Thompson:
room. I've taken finals in the library. It
really supports me academically as well as

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.800
Haley Thompson:
a place to be social and have fun.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.440 position:81%
Eric Salazar:
The clubs host a range of educational opportunities,
including professor roundtables, peer tutoring

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.040
Eric Salazar:
and group study sessions.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.970 position:72%
Haley Thompson:
One of the great things about having a library
is that you can always go to study,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.720 position:70%
Haley Thompson:
and it's very helpful because you're studying
with your friends, so you don't feel like

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.710 position:73%
Haley Thompson:
you miss out on anything by studying but you're
still getting things done, which sometimes

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.819
Haley Thompson:
is tough.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.959 position:72%
Eric Salazar:
The clubs arrange other activities such as
community service and outreach, social events,

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.489 position:72%
Eric Salazar:
recreational activities and intramural sports.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.870 position:67%
David Hou:
Over the past few weeks, we've had our I.M.
three-on-three basketball tournaments and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.359 position:83%
David Hou:
some indoor soccer. I participate in every
single one of my club's intramural sports activities,

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.659 position:72%
David Hou:
and it is a blast. I have the time of my life.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.909 position:84%
Haley Thompson:
This fall I played flag football, and the
dodgeball tournament every year is a great experience.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:43.120 position:77%
Eric Salazar:
In 1855, faced with a lack of campus-sponsored
dining options and a prohibition on fraternities,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.439 position:67%
Eric Salazar:
Princeton students began dining in boarding
houses in town.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.540 position:69%
Eric Salazar:
Twenty-four years later, a group of students
rented a building on Mercer Street and began

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.040 position:56%
Eric Salazar:
a more formal kind of "eating club."

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.849 position:66%
Eric Salazar:
The process of becoming a club member has
evolved over the years. Today, any student

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.249 position:67%
Eric Salazar:
who wants to join can become a member of a
club. They are very diverse, and about half

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.620
Eric Salazar:
of the members are women.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.359 position:67%
Eric Salazar:
The University's financial aid policy helps
students on aid cover the costs of eating

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.700
Eric Salazar:
at the clubs.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.609 position:67%
Eric Salazar:
Students are eligible to join a club in the
second semester of sophomore year. Half of

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.090 position:69%
Eric Salazar:
the clubs have selection processes, and half
admit members through a sign-in process.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.599 position:69%
Eric Salazar:
Each club is small enough to get to know all
of your fellow members. For example, you may

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.319 position:73%
Eric Salazar:
bump into future Olympians, classical musicians
or ballet dancers.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.090 position:70%
David Hou:
Or you can go into our pool room, play a game
of pool with that guy you've always seen

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.629 position:66%
David Hou:
and find out that he actually speaks seven
different languages and

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.029 position:69%
David Hou:
has studied Latin with the Pope's secretary
in Vatican City. And the great thing is that

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:44.950 position:81%
David Hou:
this happens at all 10 clubs up and down the street.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.709 position:61%
Eric Salazar:
Membership leads to long-lasting bonds.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.290 position:77%
David Hou:
Each club has its own unique culture and occupies
a very specific niche along the street. But

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.889 position:69%
David Hou:
I'd say that all 10 come together to give
the University a very unique atmosphere, and

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.060 position:73%
David Hou:
that is what makes the eating clubs so special.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:40.060
