00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.480
A source of light we tend to take for

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.560
granted and not really think about
as a light source is the sky.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.840
Especially for outdoor environments,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.380
a lot of the ambient lighting
is actually sky lighting.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.860
So let's enable it in this scene.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.000
As you can see,
the shadows gets a nice blue touch here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.110
Let's disable the sun in order
to isolate the sky lighting.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.011
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.239
Areas where more of the sky is secluded,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.570
like under the roof in the back of
the scene, is getting generally darker.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.620
But it's a very smooth effect that
also accentuates details and geometry.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.940
The most trivial example of the
importance of the sky as a light source

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.590
is a cloudy day.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.540
Just like in the middle of the night,
the sun is not reaching in, but on

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.130
the cloudy day, it's not dark outside,
because of the light from the sky.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.830
It should be said that the light from
the sky is mainly light from the sun

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.350
taking a different path down, but we
won't cover the details surrounded here.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.550
For most application you
want to treat the sun and

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.770
the sky as two different
light contributions.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.790
Sky lighting is a very effective way
of setting the mood in an environment.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.343
We can experiment with different
colors and it makes a big difference

00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:31.517
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:35.433
In this case, we're only looking
at constant color skies, but for

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.968
more realism, it's possible to use
images representing the actual sky color

00:01:39.968 --> 00:01:41.700
from different directions.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.700
Unfortunately computing proper sky
lighting in interactive applications can

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.530
be hard from performance point of view.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.870
Different flavors of ambient ablution
can take you part of the way though.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.160
This wraps up the sky lighting session.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.200
Thanks for your attention.
