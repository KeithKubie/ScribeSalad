00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:05.493
(mouse clicks)
(electronic beep)

00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:08.576
(bright piano music)

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.444
- [Man] We are the paradoxical apes.

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:14.861
Bipedal. Naked, large brains.

00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:21.389
Long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:24.806
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:30.151
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:36.112
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.628
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:42.276
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.026
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:50.268
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:54.435
to exchange insight on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:58.140
An exploration made possible by

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.973
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:23.494
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:37.455
- People with synesthesia
experience the ordinary world

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:39.865
in quite extraordinary ways.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.255
For some people when they
look at letters on the page,

00:01:42.255 --> 00:01:44.924
each letter might have
its own distinctive color,

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:47.604
which either appears in
the synesthete's mind eye

00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:49.511
or is perhaps projected onto the page

00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:52.056
on top of the regular text.

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:56.279
For other synesthetes, time
and the calendar for example,

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:58.684
or numbers are seen visio-spatially

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:01.040
as kind of an undulating landscape.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.919
This might serve as a memory aid.

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.933
For example, we see it
in the case of Jill Price

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.389
that was presented earlier.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.402
Not only has she got fantastic
autobiographical memory,

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.428
she perceives the years in terms of

00:02:13.428 --> 00:02:16.345
her own internal landscape of time.

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:19.973
This is one of my first
case studies of synesthesia

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.333
and this is a man who takes words, as he's

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:24.869
listening to me speak
now, each word might have

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.318
its own distinct flavor on his mouth.

00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:31.213
And this is his representation
of the London tube map,

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:34.008
the Underground, and words to him might

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:35.900
taste of celery or of sausage meat.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.389
He grew up in Britain in
the 1960s, where this was

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.198
your quintessential
kind of diet growing up,

00:02:41.198 --> 00:02:45.033
so he's internalized
this in his synesthesia.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:48.011
One of the first case
studies that points to

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:51.424
extraordinary ability in
synesthesia is this book by Luria

00:02:51.424 --> 00:02:53.780
called The Mind of a
Mnemonist, and this is somebody

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.371
who was described as
having an infinite memory.

00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.496
He never forgets things, he can remember

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:01.458
sequences of abstract syllables
that are presented to him

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:04.044
and the recalls them
years later, and also has

00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:07.585
phenomenal autobiographical
memory as well.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:09.257
As well as having amazing memory, he also

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:11.368
had various kinds of synesthesia,

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:14.141
so numbers would elicit colors,

00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.438
the sound of somebody's voice would have

00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:18.901
both colors, taste and touch,

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:22.790
so he had a multiplicity of
different kinds of synesthesia.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.863
And this is a case that
we've already heard about,

00:03:24.863 --> 00:03:28.482
who has both synesthesia
and Asperger's Syndrome,

00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:30.420
high-functioning Autism.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.720
So Daniel could recite pi
to 20,000 decimal places,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.887
a feat which takes
around five hours just to

00:03:35.887 --> 00:03:39.024
say the digits aloud, but what he's doing

00:03:39.024 --> 00:03:41.857
when he's recalling them
is also extraordinary,

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:45.172
because for him the digits
is not just a verbal string,

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:47.449
it's a visio-spatial
string that he reads off

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.250
from his mind's eye, and
this is representation

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.541
of the first 20 digits of pi.

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.395
For him, each digit has
its own particular color,

00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:56.972
and its own particular texture

00:03:56.972 --> 00:03:59.440
and its own position in the
sequence that he reads off

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.057
as he's recollecting the sequence.

00:04:02.057 --> 00:04:03.981
So these are extraordinary cases,

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:06.844
is synesthesia in general
linked to enhanced memory

00:04:06.844 --> 00:04:09.418
and if so, why might this be?

00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:11.269
What we know about synesthetes is that

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.377
they have differences in their brain,

00:04:13.377 --> 00:04:15.339
although theses aren't well-characterized.

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.645
It's more gray matter and more
white-matter organization,

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:22.317
at least patchy within some regions.

00:04:22.317 --> 00:04:24.256
One possibility is that
you could use synesthesia

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:25.989
as a kind of a memory aid.

00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:27.870
IF you see words spelled out, then it

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.136
might help you to remember them.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:33.215
You're using the synesthesia
as a kind of cognitive tool.

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:35.538
The other possibility is
that it's something about

00:04:35.538 --> 00:04:37.997
the brain changes
themselves that give rise

00:04:37.997 --> 00:04:42.109
not only to synesthesia,
but also give rise to other

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:45.758
particular cognitive phenotypes
such as enhanced memory.

00:04:45.758 --> 00:04:47.608
I'll argue in favor of this and present

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:50.290
various lines of evidence.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.591
So first of all, if we
look at the memory ability

00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:54.262
of people with synesthesia,
these are people

00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:56.956
who experience words
and letters as colors,

00:04:56.956 --> 00:04:59.384
and we would give them a
standard recognition memory test

00:04:59.384 --> 00:05:01.577
in which we'd present them
with a sequence of say,

00:05:01.577 --> 00:05:04.206
30 words to remember, and then a test

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:07.053
we'd present them with
60 words, half of which

00:05:07.053 --> 00:05:09.537
they saw before and half
of which they didn't,

00:05:09.537 --> 00:05:13.704
and we made them visually
similar to try and confuse them.

00:05:14.702 --> 00:05:16.285
And of course they were
presented in a random order,

00:05:16.285 --> 00:05:18.317
not consecutively like this.

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:20.155
But at the end of all tests, what strategy

00:05:20.155 --> 00:05:22.122
did he use for memorizing them?

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.692
And actually when we back-sort people

00:05:23.692 --> 00:05:25.610
by the kind of strategy they have,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.317
yes, these kind of semantic associations

00:05:28.317 --> 00:05:30.751
have the best strategy, but
it doesn't make any difference

00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:31.870
what strategy you use.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.333
If you're a synesthete, you do better

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:36.092
on this particular test.

00:05:36.092 --> 00:05:38.111
Another way of doing it
with another group is that

00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:39.548
you actually give them a strategy.

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:41.645
So one is that you can process it deeply,

00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:43.447
you make semantic judgements about words

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:45.148
such as whether it's
living, and the other way

00:05:45.148 --> 00:05:46.567
is that you process it shallowly,

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:48.829
you ask about the letters in the word.

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:50.137
And again, whether or not you process it

00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:54.189
shallowly or deeply,
synesthetes have better memory

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.627
for words here, and they produce fewer

00:05:57.627 --> 00:06:00.672
false alarms, misrecognitions.

00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:02.271
So here, these are verbal stimuli

00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.982
that for these people elicit colors.

00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:08.340
What about if you look at
non-verbal visual stimuli?

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.056
So these are some of the kinds
of stimuli that we presented,

00:06:11.056 --> 00:06:13.416
so again here we would have scenes.

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:16.315
We would present them with,
say, a series of 30 scenes

00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:18.733
and then a test, we'd present
them with the same scenes

00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:22.401
and ones that are very similar,
just a little bit different.

00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.081
Also, fractals or very abstract images,

00:06:25.081 --> 00:06:26.561
which people find very hard,

00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:28.656
they're very hard to recode verbally

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:31.385
or in any other particular way.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.956
Similarly, you can have
regular colored scenes

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:35.611
but you can manipulate them some way,

00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:39.396
you can reverse it, you can
flip the color for example,

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:41.782
or you can make objects
appear or disappear.

00:06:41.782 --> 00:06:44.791
So this is again a difficult memory test.

00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:47.465
What we find here is that
synesthetes outperform controls,

00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:49.395
so here what we've got is effect size.

00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:52.395
This is a measure of
the relative advantage

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:54.864
of synesthetes over controls.

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:57.152
Typically they have medium effect sizes,

00:06:57.152 --> 00:06:58.403
but actually they do much better

00:06:58.403 --> 00:07:01.119
for visual material over verbal material,

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.390
even though the visual
material is not triggering

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.954
any extra experiences for these people.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:09.110
They described thinking in visual images.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.895
For them they think in very sensory ways,

00:07:11.895 --> 00:07:16.062
remembering events like
reliving it in your mind's eye.

00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:18.452
And for some things they
do particularly well.

00:07:18.452 --> 00:07:20.295
Notice for the fractals, that's actually

00:07:20.295 --> 00:07:21.657
one of their best things, and these

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:24.384
are very hard for people
typically to remember.

00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:27.887
They can hold onto visual
patterns very well.

00:07:27.887 --> 00:07:30.541
What I would argue here
is that synesthesia

00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:34.263
is linked to enhanced memory,
but although you might

00:07:34.263 --> 00:07:36.901
sometimes use synesthesia as a memory aid,

00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:38.911
there's probably
something more fundamental

00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:41.325
in terms of the way that
their brain is wired

00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:45.077
in terms of holding onto
visual and sensory information,

00:07:45.077 --> 00:07:47.807
for example, in these stimuli.

00:07:47.807 --> 00:07:49.866
What you will also see
in these studies is that

00:07:49.866 --> 00:07:52.191
synesthetes do well on lab tests of memory

00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:54.280
but actually their memory
isn't so phenomenal

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.087
that they're going to produce
jaw-dropping feats at a party.

00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:00.771
Some of my colleagues
have said, "Well hang on,

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.540
"this means that these exceptional cases

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.602
"that we've talked
about, they're anomalies.

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:06.069
"These are the outliers,

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.238
"something different must
be going on in these cases."

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:10.618
And I've kind of toyed with this idea,

00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:13.198
but actually we don't
necessarily need to look for

00:08:13.198 --> 00:08:15.565
a different explanation for those who have

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:18.827
a small upward shift than for
those who have a large one.

00:08:18.827 --> 00:08:20.427
All we have to do is just think

00:08:20.427 --> 00:08:22.927
about the normal distribution.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:25.824
Here what you've got is a shift of

00:08:25.824 --> 00:08:28.514
half the standard deviation,
so this is at the low end

00:08:28.514 --> 00:08:31.206
of the medium effect size, very much

00:08:31.206 --> 00:08:34.694
the conservative end of what I presented.

00:08:34.694 --> 00:08:37.297
So the synesthetes are
here in the light blue.

00:08:37.297 --> 00:08:38.818
And what you can do is you can slice up

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.592
these normal distributions and ask

00:08:40.592 --> 00:08:43.893
how many people lie in each of these ones.

00:08:43.893 --> 00:08:46.361
Between naught and one
standard deviations,

00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:50.527
you'll find 38% of synesthetes
and 34% of controls,

00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:53.420
so a ratio that favors the synesthetes.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.601
But after you move up,
in face what you find

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.257
is that it's non-linear, the synesthetes

00:08:57.257 --> 00:09:01.410
are very much overrepresented
at the extremes here.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.025
If you exceed this, so if you go up to

00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:06.981
an effect size of 0.8, which
again is not unrealistic

00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:08.974
given some of the data I've presented,

00:09:08.974 --> 00:09:11.855
you see again that it goes
up quite astonishingly,

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:15.932
the amount of synesthetes you
would expect at the high end.

00:09:15.932 --> 00:09:17.431
So if you put it another way,

00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.093
if you were to give me 1000
people and you were to rank them

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:23.617
in terms of their memory
ability from left to right,

00:09:23.617 --> 00:09:25.582
and you asked me, can I find a synesthete

00:09:25.582 --> 00:09:29.033
amongst that distribution,
where would I look?

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:30.972
Well I could look where
the mean is, because that's

00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:33.770
where most of the
synesthetes are numerically,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.036
but the problem with that is that you've

00:09:35.036 --> 00:09:37.186
also got an awful lot of non-synesthetes

00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:39.410
who will be performing at that level.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.950
The best place to look is actually at

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.037
the 1000th person on the
right, and statistically

00:09:45.037 --> 00:09:48.412
that is the person most
likely to have synesthesia.

00:09:48.412 --> 00:09:51.766
And you don't need to do the
experiment with just math.

00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:53.727
The closest experiment
we've done is to take

00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:57.168
a group of people who perform
in memory championships,

00:09:57.168 --> 00:09:59.924
so there are world rankings
for doing bizarre things

00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:04.091
like remembering the order of
a pack of cards in 35 seconds

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:07.968
and so on, and we were
able to test 18 of these

00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:11.388
memory athletes and we
checked using a valid measure

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:13.423
of grapheme-color
synesthesia, the standard one

00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:16.105
in the literature, and
showed that synesthetes

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:20.272
are very significantly
overrepresented with this group.

00:10:21.513 --> 00:10:24.479
The prevalence of grapheme-color
synesthesia is 1 to 2%,

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:26.735
other types of synesthesia push it up,

00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:29.280
and we had a group of controls that we

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.432
tried to select in a similar way.

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:34.302
So we've heard a little
bit about the relationship

00:10:34.302 --> 00:10:35.906
between synesthesia and autism,

00:10:35.906 --> 00:10:37.430
and I came to this quite skeptical.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.851
Why would these two very
different things be related?

00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:42.528
But they are related.

00:10:42.528 --> 00:10:44.973
Simon Baron-Cohen and a group of Germans

00:10:44.973 --> 00:10:47.465
were the first people to
actually show that there's

00:10:47.465 --> 00:10:51.359
an increased incidence of
synesthesia and autism.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.823
They took a group of people with autism

00:10:52.823 --> 00:10:54.841
and looked for synesthesia.

00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:57.711
We also did this ourselves, but
amongst the autistic people,

00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:01.602
we look at those people
who have savant traits

00:11:01.602 --> 00:11:03.243
and those who don't.

00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:05.447
These were all high-functioning
people with autism,

00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:07.541
by the way, so they're not at

00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:11.205
the low end of intellectual disability.

00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:13.992
So what we have here, both
of these groups on the left

00:11:13.992 --> 00:11:17.219
have a clinical diagnosis
of autism, but some of

00:11:17.219 --> 00:11:19.913
the autistic people are
reporting savant abilities,

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:20.947
and this includes things like

00:11:20.947 --> 00:11:23.892
perfect pitch or calendar calculations.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:27.269
These people here are far more
likely to have synesthesia

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.764
than the kind of garden variety of people

00:11:30.764 --> 00:11:32.799
with a diagnosis of autism.

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:34.347
So it is linked to autism, but it seems

00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:36.768
to be linked to special abilities.

00:11:36.768 --> 00:11:39.427
As well as looking for
synesthetic traits amongst people

00:11:39.427 --> 00:11:41.620
with autism, you can
look for autistic traits

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.278
amongst people with synesthesia.

00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:45.999
So one of the things that
we did is that we took

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:48.412
a standard questionnaire measure of autism

00:11:48.412 --> 00:11:50.547
that has 50 questions, and the questions

00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:54.714
are divided into five sub-scales,
so 10 questions in each.

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:58.959
Four of the sub-scales actually
ask about difficulties,

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:01.458
so things like social skills,
which people with autism

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:04.934
find hard, but there's one sub-scale

00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:08.785
that asks about abilities,
and that's attention to detail

00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:11.535
so here this particular
question is reverse coded.

00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:13.331
People with autism are
very good at finding

00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:15.080
the proverbial needle in a haystack,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.492
they do very good Where's
Waldo kind of puzzles,

00:12:19.492 --> 00:12:22.800
detecting parts and wholes and so on.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.571
They do good at this.

00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:28.349
If we give this to a group of synesthetes,

00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:31.925
again what we find, so this
is a score from naught to 50.

00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:36.602
Controls are about 18, synesthetes
are raised significantly.

00:12:36.602 --> 00:12:38.627
They fall quite considerably below

00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:41.313
the average of the not-autistic person,

00:12:41.313 --> 00:12:43.658
but actually even this
shift, what this means

00:12:43.658 --> 00:12:46.104
if you model the tail
end of the distribution,

00:12:46.104 --> 00:12:48.729
is that you would expect at
least twice as many synesthetes

00:12:48.729 --> 00:12:52.423
to be overrepresented
in the tail than that,

00:12:52.423 --> 00:12:56.022
so these small shifts can have
large effects for the tail

00:12:56.022 --> 00:12:59.016
is one of my take-home messages.

00:12:59.016 --> 00:13:00.744
Here, these are the five sub-scales

00:13:00.744 --> 00:13:03.103
and it looks complicated but it isn't.

00:13:03.103 --> 00:13:05.595
In the gray bar we've got
our group with autism,

00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:08.334
so a high score means
you're high on the spectrum.

00:13:08.334 --> 00:13:09.827
In blue you've got your synesthetes,

00:13:09.827 --> 00:13:13.308
and in orange you've got your controls.

00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:15.437
So this is social skills here.

00:13:15.437 --> 00:13:17.521
What we can see is that
for four out of five

00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:19.887
of these particular
things, the synesthetes

00:13:19.887 --> 00:13:22.315
are indistinguishable from the controls,

00:13:22.315 --> 00:13:24.285
they're a little bit above them.

00:13:24.285 --> 00:13:26.146
But for one out of five, the synesthetes

00:13:26.146 --> 00:13:28.573
are indistinguishable
from people with autism,

00:13:28.573 --> 00:13:31.888
and this is in the attention
to detail sub-scale.

00:13:31.888 --> 00:13:33.827
And we've subsequently
confirmed that using

00:13:33.827 --> 00:13:35.739
what's called a change-blindness parallel

00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:38.053
where you have to notice small changes

00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:40.553
in scenes that are flickering.

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:46.386
Autism has been defined in
terms of these impairments,

00:13:46.386 --> 00:13:49.184
but in the most recent
psychiatric definition,

00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.601
they added a sensory symptom,

00:13:52.974 --> 00:13:55.793
and this was sensory hypersensitivity,

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:58.398
and also maybe hyposensitivity.

00:13:58.398 --> 00:14:01.532
Some of the things might
be finding bright lights

00:14:01.532 --> 00:14:04.426
particularly aversive or giving
you a headache and so on.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.306
People have developed
various measures of this,

00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:09.628
again, initially using a questionnaire,

00:14:09.628 --> 00:14:10.879
so this is the one that we used,

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:13.316
the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire.

00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:16.113
What we find here is that synesthetes

00:14:16.113 --> 00:14:19.442
are significantly above
controls, and numerically similar

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.711
to people with autism on this measure,

00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:24.210
despite actually not having many of

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.210
the classic signs of being autistic.

00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:31.067
We looked at this in more
detail, so most of the people

00:14:31.067 --> 00:14:32.578
we've looked at are these people with

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:34.409
grapheme-color synesthesia,
because we have

00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:38.949
very obvious ways of
verifying this in the lab.

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:41.009
But we can also look at
the presence of other kinds

00:14:41.009 --> 00:14:44.134
of synesthesia, so those people
who see time, for example,

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.590
in these kind of spatial calendars.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.003
People who have tastes or
flavors in their mouths,

00:14:50.003 --> 00:14:52.484
people who experience words
spelled out as they listen

00:14:52.484 --> 00:14:55.393
to speech, some people
see it like ticker tape,

00:14:55.393 --> 00:14:59.096
or having visual experiences to music.

00:14:59.096 --> 00:15:02.499
What we can do, in effect,
is we can take people

00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:05.016
and we just say, "How many
of these have you got?"

00:15:05.016 --> 00:15:07.113
And actually, our synesthetes
were asked this question

00:15:07.113 --> 00:15:08.890
often about three or four years ago,

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.502
when they first volunteered
and we've kept a database

00:15:11.502 --> 00:15:13.850
of that information.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.752
So this is what we find in
terms of sensory sensitivity.

00:15:16.752 --> 00:15:19.443
We have a very clear dose effect between

00:15:19.443 --> 00:15:23.100
how many types of synesthesia
somebody has and how much

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.858
they report sensory
sensitivity on this measure.

00:15:26.858 --> 00:15:28.440
This is where people with autism are.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.519
If you've got zero types of synesthesia,

00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:32.119
you're our control group.

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:34.667
These are people with
one, two, three and four.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.239
You can't read this at
the bottom, but these

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:38.341
are just different
combinations of that five.

00:15:38.341 --> 00:15:39.844
You don't need to read it.

00:15:39.844 --> 00:15:41.280
If you have three types of synesthesia,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.447
that is your level of sensory
sensitivity on this measure.

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:49.326
This is the proportion
of people in these groups

00:15:49.326 --> 00:15:52.566
who are at the high end
of the autism spectrum.

00:15:52.566 --> 00:15:55.682
People with autism on this
measure typically have

00:15:55.682 --> 00:15:57.952
a score of 32 or above,
and what you can see

00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:00.382
is it goes up dramatically
with the more types

00:16:00.382 --> 00:16:02.155
of synesthesia you have.

00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:04.371
So there is a clear relationship
between synesthesia and

00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:08.538
autism, but it's complex and
it's to do with the nature of

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:12.509
how synesthetic your brain is.

00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:18.550
So, to summarize, what I
would say is that synesthesia

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.372
is linked to certain abilities,

00:16:21.372 --> 00:16:24.474
it's linked to enhanced memory.

00:16:24.474 --> 00:16:27.190
It's also linked to some
of the traits of autism.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.042
It's linked to sensory sensitivity,

00:16:29.042 --> 00:16:30.000
which I'm not sure whether that's

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.439
a positive or negative trait.

00:16:31.439 --> 00:16:34.484
It's normally cast in
terms of a negative trait,

00:16:34.484 --> 00:16:37.984
but whether or not that has particular ...

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.725
Whether it is linked to other
abilities, I don't know.

00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:43.938
Attention to detail is
a clear ability that is

00:16:43.938 --> 00:16:46.968
probably driving some of
these savant abilities to

00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:51.135
notice patterns, to notice
details in their sensory world.

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:54.938
Although synesthetes
don't necessarily present

00:16:54.938 --> 00:16:57.524
with the triad of impairments

00:16:57.524 --> 00:17:00.596
that classically define autism,

00:17:00.596 --> 00:17:03.802
what seems to happen is
that you have an increase

00:17:03.802 --> 00:17:05.838
of vulnerability of getting that.

00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:10.005
In a way, you buy into having
the advantages of autism,

00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:13.896
but the danger is that
you are more susceptible

00:17:13.896 --> 00:17:16.879
to getting the negative traits as well.

00:17:16.879 --> 00:17:18.518
It's almost as if
synesthetes are occupying

00:17:18.518 --> 00:17:20.843
a very interesting cognitive
niche, where they're

00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:23.577
sliding up the autistic scale a little bit

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:26.082
and getting some of the
benefits, but they're not

00:17:26.082 --> 00:17:27.312
falling over the cliff edge.

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:29.624
But you stand a risk of
doing that, of course,

00:17:29.624 --> 00:17:33.624
just by moving up that
particular genetic niche.

00:17:35.023 --> 00:17:36.686
So to conclude, synesthesia is linked

00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:39.494
to basic differences in brain function.

00:17:39.494 --> 00:17:43.063
We don't fully understand
what those differences are,

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.233
but my best guess is that it's to do with

00:17:45.233 --> 00:17:48.680
differences in plasticity,
in holding on particularly

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.315
to sensory information over time, and also

00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:55.985
to sensory sensitivity, both
subjectively and probably

00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:59.975
again, in terms of cognitive processing.

00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:02.869
Many of these traits
seem to be shared with

00:18:02.869 --> 00:18:05.500
the positive features of autism,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.167
abilities, savant
characteristics and so on.

00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:13.832
Synesthesia is linked to
cognitive enhancements in memory,

00:18:13.832 --> 00:18:16.385
but again, it doesn't seem
that synesthesia is just

00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:19.691
simply a mnemonic device
or a cognitive tool.

00:18:19.691 --> 00:18:21.833
Some people do use their
synesthesia in that way,

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:24.233
but it seems to be a deeper connection

00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:27.981
between synesthesia and
cognitive enhancement.

00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:30.539
And I guess in terms of
a more general conclusion

00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:34.127
from this symposium, is that
even medium-sized effects,

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:36.912
so the fact that synesthetes
are shifted up by a

00:18:36.912 --> 00:18:41.079
medium-sized effect, has profound
consequences at the tail,

00:18:42.135 --> 00:18:44.994
that you really can
overrepresent things at the tail

00:18:44.994 --> 00:18:48.215
because of the way that these
normal distributions go.

00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:50.836
It might be that even though
most synesthetes aren't

00:18:50.836 --> 00:18:53.828
exceptional, actually there's
something about synesthesia

00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:58.237
that is really kind of driving
things at that high tail end

00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:01.020
in the exceptional ability zone.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.088
Thank you very much for your time.

00:19:02.088 --> 00:19:03.808
These are my collaborators, and these are

00:19:03.808 --> 00:19:08.019
some famous synesthetes, none
of whom I've worked with.

00:19:08.019 --> 00:19:10.269
(applause)

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.786
(bright music)
