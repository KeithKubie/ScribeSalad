00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:05.029
Given that x+2 is greater than 5,
x must be greater than 3.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.979
You use the same procedure to solve a
linear inequality for x that you do for

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:13.050
a linear equation,
with one exception that we will show.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.220
So for the inequality x+2 &gt; 5, we just
treat the inequality like an equal sign.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.030
Just like we saw with linear equations,
we're trying to isolate x.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.096
Here we can do that by
subtracting 2 from both sides.

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:31.362
And we get x+0 &gt; 5-2,

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:35.821
which we simplify to x &gt; 3.

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:39.868
When you're done isolating the variable
on one side, you should graph

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:43.930
the solution set on a number line
since it's a range of values.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.950
Our number line should look like this.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.660
The end point is 3.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.650
Our circle is open because 3 is
not part of the solution set.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.810
And our arrow points to the right,
towards positive infinity.
