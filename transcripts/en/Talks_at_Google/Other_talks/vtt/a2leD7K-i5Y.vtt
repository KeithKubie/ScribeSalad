MODERATOR: We are so lucky to
have Sheila Marcelo here today

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.240
to talk to us about
her company, Care.com.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.510
She is the founder, chairwoman,
and CEO of Care.com,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.680
and it's the largest
online destination

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.010
for finding quality care.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.565
You can find care for children,
for seniors, and for pets.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.160
We'll hear more
about this, but I

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.030
think you started this because
you found yourself sandwiched

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.300
between needing to take
care of young children

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.970
as well as ailing
parents, and you just

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.584
had a hard time
finding quality care

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.750
and felt like, gosh, there's
got to be a better way,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.450
and technology has got
to be the solution here.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.560
So I think it's a great fit for
a lot of what we care about,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.900
as well as the technology, as
well as in our personal lives.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.200
And you founded it in
2006, and recently took it

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.970
public this year.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.010
So we can ask her about
that process as well.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.530
I have to say, I'm in
the process right now

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.210
of changing my care at home.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.156
So personally, I've got
a job open on Care.com.

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:13.280
For any of you that are
interested and are thinking

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.440
to yourselves, gosh,
this sounds great,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.280
we have a Google
benefit where we

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550
pay for a premium annual
membership for all

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.230
of our Googlers.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.901
So just go to go/care.com
benefit if you want to check it

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:25.400
out.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.920
One last thing to note
before Sheila comes up

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.620
is that we're so lucky
to have her here,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.890
because she's someone
who's speaking at the state

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.810
level, at the country
level, in a lot of places.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.300
She was a speaker
at Davos last year.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.670
She also presented, alongside
President Obama this year,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.390
on the White House Summit
for Working Families.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.220
And she's also spoken
to heads of state

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.519
in Japan, in the Philippines.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:52.560
And in Japan, there's a
real infrastructure issue

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.630
around child care there.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.390
So she is knowledgeable not
only in running her business

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.580
and as an entrepreneur
and as a mom,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.870
but she's knowledgeable
at the state level

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.720
as well, across the globe.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.630
So with that, welcome.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.055
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:10.880
SHEILA MARCELO: Thank you.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.421
Good morning.

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:15.270
What do you see?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.440
Do you see the bird,
the aspirational view

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.950
of what literally could be
the egg that the painter sees?

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:31.900
What do you see when you look
in the mirror in the morning?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.635
The lion or the cat?

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:38.010
Might depend which
morning it is.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.890
What do you see here?

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.870
Do you see a mother bird
feeding her chicks in the nest,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.550
or do you see a pensive woman?

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.550
Why am I showing
you these images?

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.460
Because it's illustrating
a simple fact--

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.440
you actually see
what you want to see,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.190
or what you're
programmed to see.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.300
We're going to talk a little bit
about the brain this morning,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.196
and why it matters.

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:11.570
Because first,
I'm going to start

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.903
to share some of my own stories.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.305
You're seeing a CEO,
founder, chairwoman.

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:19.470
Thank you for the introduction.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.010
You've got context of who I am.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.120
But what if you don't
have the context?

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.410
I'll share three quick stories.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.400
One morning, I got up, I went
downstairs to the refrigerator,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.640
I opened it to go look for
eggs, milk-- typical weekend--

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.055
and decided I was going to
run to the grocery store,

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:39.180
because we didn't have any.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.400
And I decided I wasn't
going to put any makeup on.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.010
I was just going to put
my hair up on a ponytail,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.760
put some sweat suits on and
just run to the grocery store.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.170
I get to the aisle to pay, and
the woman behind the counter

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.005
said to me, do you want me
to put the items in the bag?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.240
Do you want me to put
the items in the bag?

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.380
And a third time-- do you want
me to put the items in the bag?

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.860
I leaned back and I said,
that would be terrific.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.160
Thank you very much.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.355
She was so taken aback that
I spoke English fluently.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.200
What did she see?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.370
Second story.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.926
When I was a VP at
TheLadders.com--

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:25.910
terrific company--
and we were looking

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.490
at some important software
and meeting with a vendor,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.280
I slid in late to a
meeting, and my team

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.070
had started the meeting already.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.750
There was an empty chair.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.590
And as the vendor
was presenting,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.492
I politely interrupted and
I asked a set of questions,

00:04:40.492 --> 00:04:42.075
because this was an
important software

00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:43.449
and it was an
important decision.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.780
As I was in the midst of
a number of questions,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.340
he paused, and he said to
me, I'm sorry, young lady.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.930
Do you know anything about
the recruiting industry?

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.705
And I ignored it.

00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:59.980
I smiled, and I continued
to ask my questions.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.550
And I think by the
fifth set of questions,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.260
he realized I was the decision
maker in the room with regards

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.750
to the software.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.570
And I continued
to proceed and ask

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.840
the questions I wanted to ask.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.000
A third story-- what did he see?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.170
A third story-- a
very, very recent one.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.830
We just took the company
public, and last year, we

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.305
did a non-deal roadshow as
part of the practice of taking

00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:26.820
a company public, to get
institutional investor

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.910
feedback.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.990
We had been flying around,
and I was exhausted.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.840
I decided to go to
the bathroom quickly.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.320
Get any bio breaks that you can.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.370
And I came into the
meeting and went straight

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.430
for the coffee pot, because
there was very little sleep.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.740
Our CTO was a man.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.370
Our CFO was a man.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.260
Proceeded to sit down, and of
course, I was at the coffee.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.592
And I said to everybody--
I felt like my parents

00:05:52.592 --> 00:05:55.050
and my mom raised me well--
and I offered everybody coffee.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.530
When I went in line and started
making the introductions--

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.570
CTO said, hello,
my name is Dave,

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.890
CFO says, yes, my name
is John-- and then

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.390
when I was about to shake the
institutional investor's hand,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.931
they said, you must
be the assistant.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.240
And I smiled with a big
smile on my face, and I said,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.410
I'm Sheila Marcelo.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.310
I'm founder and CEO of Care.com.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.420
Very nice to meet you.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.725
Thanks for having me.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.900
What did they see?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.730
What did they see?

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.600
A lot of it really
starts up here.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.450
And in those moments, I
put a big smile on my face,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.820
and I have what I call
my Katniss moment.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.970
How many of you have
seen "Hunger Games?"

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.320
It's those heroic moments.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.090
Why do I go back to superheroes?

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.910
I go back to Clark
Kent, the newest one,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.590
Henry Cavell-- really
hot, really cute.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.680
But-- it was easier
to find his picture.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.040
And Angelina Jolie, too.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.410
So why these superheroes?

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.070
Because oftentimes,
superheroes are underestimated

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.390
because of that inner strength
that they have in here.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.650
I'm a huge superhero fan.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.560
I watch all of them.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.190
So the question to
the audience is,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.490
how many times have
you felt like you've

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.690
been underestimated?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.840
Where does it start?

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.410
What do people see in you?

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.785
And so much of it
starts up here.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.550
What's so interesting,
though, is

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.535
that it really starts
within ourselves.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.810
Here, and here.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.962
So much about it is about
reprogramming the brain.

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:28.170
And we're going to talk a
little bit about the brain.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.440
And for a fact, if
you are suspect about

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.580
whether the brain
can be reprogrammed,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.930
there have been lots of studies.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.070
It's broken the myth that
brain development only

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.380
happens with children.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.810
In fact, it's changed.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.135
The studies have now shown
that even in your 40s--

00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:48.760
I'm in my 40s-- you can
reprogram the brain.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.980
There's a study
called neuroplasticity

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.730
that's coming out.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.400
It's being applied
to leadership.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.660
Some terrific books coming out.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.090
Korn Ferry put one out
called "Learning Agility."

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.160
How do you continue to
learn and be flexible,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.847
which is important leadership?

00:08:05.847 --> 00:08:07.430
There's another great
book that I just

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.960
finished, called
"Immunity To Change."

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.960
And it is precisely
about the development

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.950
of the brain from three
phases-- self awareness,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.650
self-authoring the brain
to change the framework

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.400
and how you think about
things, to what we

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.358
call self-transforming.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.140
And we'll talk about those
three phases in a little bit.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.840
So so much of it starts up here.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.810
And I'm going to come back to
what I've had to reprogram.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.900
Everybody has their
vowels and consonants

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.400
of whatever their shortcut is.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.920
I have what I call my three P's.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.610
My three P's are not the
typical MBA positioning,

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.289
packaging, pricing.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:47.065
It is about perfection,
passivity, and pleasing.

00:08:47.065 --> 00:08:49.190
Those are things I've had
to reprogram in my brain.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.065
But I want to come back
to those and describe

00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:53.450
that in a little
bit, after I describe

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.000
some of the things
around the journey

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.240
that I went through to
get to reprogramming.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.450
Here's a quick journey
in describing my story.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.220
A very good friend
of mine at work,

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.650
Erica Scheik, who is our
Chief Brand Officer--

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.200
as we prepare
speeches, sometimes she

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.470
looks for pictures on
Facebook, and I have no idea,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.550
and she puts it up.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.060
And she said, it seems
to me that whenever

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.000
I go on Facebook,
most of your pictures,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.797
you seem to be at the
center of the picture.

00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:23.880
What's going on with that?

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.950
I started to really unpack
what's going on there?

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.840
And I said, there
really is a story.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.820
So guess what?

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.290
The little girl in the
polka dot, peeking out,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.060
in red and white, is Sheila.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.550
So at a very young
age, when I was three,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.270
I got thrown into
the center-- I was

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.810
the fifth of six kids--
thrown into the center,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.350
because we were in
the Philippines.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.230
I was born and raised
in the Philippines.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.890
We became-- a very
brief period-- colonized

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.490
by the Americans, and freed
us from Spanish oppression

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.130
for over 300 years.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.090
So we were so enamored
by American English,

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.170
and of course the
music, and the Beatles,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.104
and so my parents
said, we would love

00:10:12.104 --> 00:10:13.520
for you to learn
American English.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.170
And here I was at
three years old,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.590
and I was forced to read
American newspapers in front

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.770
of all my relatives, starting
when I was three years old.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.270
And constantly
put in the center.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.520
And I learned early to have
my voice at such a young age,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.210
and to public speak.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.530
But like every child,
and especially-- I'm

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.130
making a stereotype, but a
large majority of teenage girls

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.730
go through their insecurity.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:40.730
I went through my own.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.820
In high school, I went
to boarding school.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.732
I was 14, crying
to my sister who

00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:47.940
also went to the same school.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.770
She was three years
older than me.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.180
I was in her room--
typical weekend--

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.950
crying, crying, talking
about this friend talking

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.615
behind my back, and could I
trust them, and what did I do,

00:10:58.615 --> 00:11:00.360
and why was I
perceived this way?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.350
And went on and on and on.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.830
An hour later, my sister, who
was three years older-- at 17,

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.860
very, very wise--
said to me, we just

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.050
spent an hour talking about you.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.650
So obviously, a
majority of your brain

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.240
is spent thinking about you.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.930
What makes you think anybody
else thinks about you?

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.660
Because they think
about themselves.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.410
So get over yourself.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.630
Get over your insecurity.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.340
They've got all other
problems in life.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.644
We spent this entire hour, 90%
of the time, talking about you.

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:39.810
Other people are the same
way, so get over yourself.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.620
Insecure teenager.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.417
Fast forward, when
I get to college--

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:48.750
I went to Mount Holyoke
College, an all women's college.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.490
I moved from the Philippines.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.440
I went to a small liberal arts.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.970
But still, I was an immigrant,
and it was foreign for me.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.575
And I remember, at my very
first Asian American meeting,

00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:03.635
I raised my hand
to ask a question.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.920
I was shaking, and my whole
head was covered in sweat.

00:12:08.932 --> 00:12:09.985
I was so nervous.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.210
Where was the little girl?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.405
What happened to her voice?

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.100
What happened?

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.365
What was going on in my brain?

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.790
Where was all this
anxiety coming from?

00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:25.750
I pose those things
because I think

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.255
so many people have their
own stories of insecurities,

00:12:29.255 --> 00:12:30.630
of things that
are going through,

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.770
whatever-- it's their
upbringing, whatever baggage,

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.930
or anything else.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.430
But there is an opportunity
to reprogram your brain.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:42.240
In my adulthood, I decided
to go on this journey.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.220
I call it the me, you, we.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.660
I haven't written
a book about it.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.659
It's not anything fancy.

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:49.500
There's not any
marketing speak there.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.060
But it's called the
journey of me, you, we.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.980
I'm going to go through
that in a second.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.670
But before I do that, I
wanted to give everybody

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.420
a heads up-- that after I
talk about the journey of me,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.910
you, we, I want
to call two of you

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.600
up here, to share for one minute
with everybody, your Katniss

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.100
moment.

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.750
So think about it for a second,
and then I'll come back to you.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.190
What is this journey
of me, you, we?

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.490
The first part of me
is very narcissistic.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.490
It is about building
self-awareness.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.000
You journal.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.200
You ask yourself, whether it's
in a professional or personal

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.015
environment, what
are my triggers?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.860
What is it in that meeting
that made me talk that way?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.410
What point was I
trying to get across?

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.995
Was I trying to
be a team player,

00:13:38.995 --> 00:13:41.085
or was I trying to shine
and be a superhero?

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.780
And I often ask those I
mentor across the company,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.510
did you inspire
or did you impress

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.130
when you left that meeting?

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.040
Because at the end of the
day, what is it that matters?

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.706
What are those
triggers that we have?

00:13:54.706 --> 00:13:57.330
And I'm talking about something
here in a professional setting,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:57.830
in meetings.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.010
What are my triggers at home?

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.220
What is it that makes
me fly off the handle?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.002
What makes me shut down?

00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:06.085
What is it that makes me
passive, and not engaged?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.800
You actually have
to invest to get

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.310
to the second phase,
of the you phase.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.930
And why is that?

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.350
Because the you phase
is all about leadership.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.040
It's focusing on
others-- not me, but you.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.520
How do I focus on you?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.730
How can I ever focus
on you if I spend

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.870
90% of my brain
thinking about me?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.840
Here's an image.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.260
You're in a meeting.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.920
How are you going
to run the meeting

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.390
to focus on the strategy,
the content, the body

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.700
language, the eye contact,
the subliminal messages that

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.720
are being sent around to
everybody in the room?

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.630
How are you running
that meeting if you're

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.910
spending 90% of your brain
focused on the insecurity of,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.497
am I saying the right thing?

00:14:49.497 --> 00:14:51.455
If I said this thing,
how am I being perceived?

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.940
How could you get
to that journey

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.870
of being a leader that focuses
on others if you're still

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.770
grappling with so many
things related to you?

00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:08.580
So you have to invest
in that self-awareness.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.730
I very much
encourage journaling.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.170
And I've done that quite a bit.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.020
I also very much
encourage meditation.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.560
So it focuses a lot on
controlling your brain.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.570
There's a great Buddhist
monk-- a modern book called

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.990
"Turning Your Mind
Into An Ally."

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.420
I read it every year.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.300
It makes me pause, take a
step back, and really ask,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.230
what is it that's going
through in my brain?

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.000
Is it the reality
of the situation,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.395
or is it just my own stuff?

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.440
So that I can focus on you.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.370
Another advice I
give-- and I often

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.290
give this to
management team members

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.210
who will come and relate a
story to me of something that's

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.220
difficult that's going
on in the company.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.700
A specific management issue.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.082
And I will pause,
and say, let's go

00:15:59.082 --> 00:16:01.040
through-- I listen to
the whole story-- I said,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.760
let's go through
that again, but now,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.490
let's remove you
from the equation.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.200
Let's pretend you
weren't even part

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.620
of the equation of
what happened there.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.550
Let's just focus
on the employee,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.560
and let's repeat
exactly what happened.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.860
And the story fundamentally
shifts, and the thinking

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.760
shifts, in how we're going
to handle that situation.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.300
Because now, it's not about
the actual person relating

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.590
this story, but it is about
the specific individual.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.630
It's the you part.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.180
And it's a powerful
thing to do that.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.840
Another mnemonic I
always give people

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.575
is, when you're in a situation
and your body language starts

00:16:41.575 --> 00:16:43.200
to shift, and your
heart rate, and this

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.616
is that investment
in you, and you

00:16:44.616 --> 00:16:48.210
know your triggers-- what you
do is, you leave your body.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.630
I'm not proselytizing Buddhism.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.740
I'm not Buddhist.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.565
You leave your body
and watch yourself.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.690
You literally watch
yourself, and say,

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.120
what is it that's
going on there?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.909
What is the real conversation
that's happening?

00:17:01.909 --> 00:17:03.950
What are we trying to get
across from each other,

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.859
removing myself
from the equation,

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.245
so I can go solve the problems?

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.400
Now let's talk
about the we part.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.079
And by the way, going
from me to you to we,

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.180
you can go back and forth.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.513
The we part is very Gandhi-like.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.130
It's from what we call
success to significance.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.180
It's a very long
journey in life.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.829
Because you focus on yourself.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.150
You focus on the others, and
the people, and the lives

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.775
that you touch.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.260
The we part is a hard one.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.930
Because how do you impact
the lives of people

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.220
that you don't come
into connection with?

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.600
How do you create an impact
and significance in the world?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.770
How do you focus
on the broader we

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.690
of the things that you
decide to do in life

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.565
or what you represent
in terms of leadership?

00:17:50.014 --> 00:17:51.930
It's a journey I'm still
trying to figure out.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.930
And by the way, this
journey is not an easy one.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.430
You go back and
forth constantly,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.190
learning about yourself, being
better, as a leader, to others.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.037
And then, at the
same time, how am I

00:18:02.037 --> 00:18:03.870
making an impact in the
world, and what am I

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.165
doing every day that
makes a big difference?

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.590
I call that the
journey of me, you, we.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.481
Now, I'm going to call
in a couple people.

00:18:13.481 --> 00:18:15.855
Volunteers are also welcomed,
but sometimes the cold call

00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:17.313
is the only way to
get you up here.

00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:22.100
I'm just kidding.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.040
How did that feel?

00:18:25.787 --> 00:18:26.870
Where was your heart rate?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.965
More importantly, where
was your eye contact?

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.750
You probably were
not looking at me,

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.200
because you did not want
to get cold called on.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.670
So how are you going
to run a meeting?

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.770
It sounds pretty basic, but
how do you master your mind

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.570
to manage the content?

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.595
Worry about perceptions?

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.490
Worry about impressing people?

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.480
It's just so much
to think about.

00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:58.050
And that was just
a simple exercise.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.010
That was just asking for a
minute-long Katniss moment.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.240
It was your own personal story.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.570
Some people are breathing hard.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.361
Here's a technique.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.950
This is my sister.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.090
I shared that story.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.470
This is a technique-- I wish
that I came up with this,

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.030
but this, actually, I
just picked up at a spa.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.030
I went to cure myself.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.600
I talked about the
narcissistic me.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.920
It's called the
4-7-8, and it's one

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.590
of the most important business
techniques I try and teach

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.750
a lot of people.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.140
You breathe in four times.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.740
Do it with me.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.860
You hold for seven, and you
breathe out eight counts.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.530
You do it in cycles
of four times.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.230
Guaranteed, your heart
rate will come down,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.080
and lizard brain will go away,
and you will get centered,

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.672
and you will focus on
whatever it is you're doing.

00:19:42.672 --> 00:19:43.505
You will be present.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.830
I do it all the time.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.750
I'm sitting here
right before I speak,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.190
right before I have to go
on national television,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.730
right before I run a
meeting, when I'm upset,

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.000
pissed off, driving in a car
and a driver is irritating me--

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.330
the 4-7-8 is like magic.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.760
It's how do you create
that present in the moment

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.670
to stay focused and have
control of your brain.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.940
Just a quick example.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.460
There's plenty of
those exercises.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.170
That's one I picked
up at Canyon Ranch.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.520
It's terrific.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.030
Why am I even talking about the
brain, and why does it matter,

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.450
and where is my
story in all of this?

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.200
So now, let's come
back to self-awareness,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.855
and describe me in a second.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.790
Two things-- how did
I let go of these P's

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.640
that I described early
in the beginning?

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.840
The first one is perfection.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.490
Born and raised Asian family.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.150
My mom was a tiger mom,
and I'm very proud of it,

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:44.690
because she was very aggressive
and pushed me to be assertive,

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.470
but also programmed
a lot of things

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.815
in me that I just
really needed to let go.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:56.240
An example of this is-- and
many women might relate to this

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.970
or not-- but why is
it that on weekends I

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.880
have to have the dishes
put away before I even

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.700
enjoy the weekend?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.570
Why do I nag my teenage
boy that the bed

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.870
has to be perfectly made?

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.004
He's giving this look
like, does it matter?

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.170
Because I've got to get
back in it tonight, anyways.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.710
And my husband will come to
me, let's just enjoy the day.

00:21:20.562 --> 00:21:21.770
Why don't you let go of that?

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.110
And I found, psychologically,
it was probably

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.735
the same set of
triggers at work.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.400
Because when I was asked to
be promoted to a director,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.960
I felt like all these boxes
hadn't been checked yet.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.680
So when I got offered to be a
director, I looked at my boss,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.575
I said, are you sure?

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.460
I don't know that I'm ready.

00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:48.860
Of course, a man would get
an offer and say, sure.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.900
I'd take that job.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.560
But it happened, also, when I
got promoted to a VP, to a GM,

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.060
and then when I
asked to be a CEO.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.660
What was it?

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.427
Is it because
that, for every job

00:22:00.427 --> 00:22:02.760
that I take, that I have to
have the perfect experience?

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.000
That I've ticked
off all the boxes

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.460
before I'm ready for that job?

00:22:08.756 --> 00:22:10.360
I knew that's not the case.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.200
I know it seems like I'm using
a simple analogy, like dishes.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.770
But what was it about my
own definition of perfection

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.000
that I had to let go?

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.710
That I had to have confidence
that I could do that job?

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.010
That I could just enjoy the
day and enjoy the moment?

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.600
So much of it really
does start up here.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.630
A second, that was difficult
for me for a long time to learn,

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.510
is, how do I embrace
my strengths?

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:40.362
How do I own that the
differences are my strengths?

00:22:40.362 --> 00:22:41.320
What do I mean by that?

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.570
I am a female leader, and I
do consider myself different.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.220
There's nothing wrong
being different.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.140
Diversity is a great thing.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.340
But there's a big debate
among female leaders

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.650
that if you called yourself
out as a female leader,

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.330
it would mean that
you're different.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.295
But isn't the whole
purpose of parity

00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:01.670
to say that you're
not different?

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.840
That you're perfectly equal?

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.470
I don't think that's what it
means about gender equality

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.520
or parity.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.910
I think it's about owning
that our differences are

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.239
our strengths.

00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:14.905
It's a mouthful.

00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:19.080
Let me say that again-- owning
that our differences are

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.015
our strengths.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.190
That they really are strengths.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.470
And what I call opposing forces.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.630
You can be both
creative and analytical.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.460
And what I used to be insecure
about, as a young leader,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.895
professionally, was, can you
be both tough and nurturing?

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.460
I didn't used to bring
my whole self to work.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.110
At home, if I'm
on the cell phone

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.810
and my son is nagging me to
go play a video game while I'm

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.400
distracted on the
phone, what look

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.566
do you think I'm giving him?

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.080
I'm, like, really?

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.610
Right now?

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.150
But I never question myself
that I can tuck him in bed

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.170
and be loving and nurturing
and still be tough.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.600
Why can't I bring my whole
self to whatever I do?

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.090
That authentic self?

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.300
That those opposing
forces are still me?

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.130
Both sides are me.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.340
Both sides can be strengths.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.720
And there's so many
examples of that.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.590
Back in the book
"Immunity to Change,"

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.880
the self-transforming mind
appreciates those opposing

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.160
forces.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.090
That it's OK.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.340
You don't have to
be one or the other.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.660
You don't have to have one box
checked for that perfection.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.150
Second P-- pleasing.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.607
I grew up with these
designated professions

00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:45.440
that I talked about.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.120
Asian.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.640
So there was a doctor--
there are six of us--

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.572
a doctor, a dentist,
an engineer, a lawyer,

00:24:55.572 --> 00:24:56.155
an accountant.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.534
My younger brother
got away with it.

00:24:59.534 --> 00:25:00.950
He could do whatever
he wanted to.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.450
But I was a designated lawyer.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.390
So I decided to
apply to law school.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.130
I got in.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.390
I didn't enjoy my first
year of law school.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.570
I liked the study
of it, but I didn't

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.550
think that I wanted
to be a lawyer.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.770
So I applied, I got
into business school.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.389
And my parents
really discouraged me

00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:19.180
from becoming an
entrepreneur, because they

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.070
were entrepreneurs.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.840
I was so focused
on pleasing them.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.320
At the end the day,
I followed my heart.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.115
It wasn't an easy task.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.369
Because as an Asian, it
wasn't part of our culture

00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:33.785
to do something different from
what my parents envisioned.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.540
But to this day, I respectfully
said to them, look,

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.200
I will finish law school,
but I will not practice law,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.040
and I will be an entrepreneur.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.495
I followed my heart.

00:25:43.495 --> 00:25:46.130
That was my second P.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.800
The third is passivity.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.800
I talked about being a
child that had a voice,

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.560
but yet, when I started
my professional career,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.940
I went into either
the shyness or it

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.630
took some time to
actually speak up.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.880
Law school certainly helped
for me to go and debate,

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.550
but I had to push
myself in meetings.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.030
And then what ended up
happening-- and some of you

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.520
might nod your head on this--
is I started to, what I call,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.061
over-project.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:16.800
I forced myself so much to
be assertive in a meeting,

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.740
that it sounded
borderline aggressive.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.410
Maybe not even
borderline at times.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.470
I was young on the
management team.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.270
I was in my 20's, and they were
all in their 50's at Upromise.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.669
I was a petite Asian woman.

00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:33.460
I didn't feel like I
was going to be heard.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.000
And there were only two
of us, and the other woman

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.870
was also a petite lady.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.830
And we both just spoke up.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.530
And I called it over-projecting.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.610
And I had to push
myself, because I

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.015
had an inherent
nature to be passive.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.860
Nowadays, when I have young
management team members

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.090
or executives in the company,
I encourage over-projection

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.680
so much that I try
and speak last.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.760
I try and encourage
going around the room

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.090
to try and encourage
people to find their voice.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:06.730
That it's OK.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.610
But how do you conquer that
if you don't practice it?

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.110
How do you conquer and
reprogram your brain

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.810
so that you can feel confidently
listening to yourself?

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.460
You've got to just
put yourself out

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.260
there and let go
of that shyness.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.270
So that's the me three P's.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.914
And everyone has got their
vowels or consonants.

00:27:27.914 --> 00:27:29.580
Whatever summary that
you've got of what

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.913
you think you need to reprogram?

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:32.660
It is very doable.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.160
The second is the you
part, this helping others.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.034
How many of you consider
yourself leaders?

00:27:42.034 --> 00:27:42.700
Raise your hand.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.500
Awesome.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.260
Google is awesome.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.185
How many of you consider
yourself female leaders?

00:27:53.325 --> 00:27:53.825
Half.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.410
It's usually 10% when
I ask that question.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.440
And why is that?

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.100
Again, it's that debate
that I talked about.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.020
What I think really
needs to happen

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.740
is, if you are a female leader,
because there's few of us,

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:15.650
is raise your hand up high
and let other people see you.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.070
We need more role models.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.820
Believe that.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.450
Believe that you
are a role model

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.620
to so many girls
and young women who

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.560
need to follow in your
footsteps, to lead.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.940
But raise it up proudly.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.820
And it's OK.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.460
There's nothing wrong
being different.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.405
It's about diversity.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.210
And I always often
hear the comment

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.806
that women hate going
to women's conferences

00:28:40.806 --> 00:28:42.430
now, because what do
you get out of it?

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.017
It's the power and strength
of meeting other women.

00:28:46.017 --> 00:28:47.850
Not all of them are
effective, I understand.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.030
But if it means being able to
share stories with each other,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.330
to conquer whatever it
is you're reprogramming,

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.950
and to get tips from each other,
I highly, highly encourage it.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.220
That's each to his
own, obviously.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:01.920
Or her own.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.000
So I do think that
that's important.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.110
And then, how do we get
more of these stories out?

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.950
Walter Isaacson of
the Aspen Institute

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.896
just put out the book
on the innovators.

00:29:13.896 --> 00:29:16.520
And I think some of you probably
read the most recent "New York

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.110
Times" article.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.280
I don't know if you know
that Ada Lovelace was

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.680
one of the first who ever
wrote a computer algorithm.

00:29:26.002 --> 00:29:27.710
It's actually in his
forward of his book,

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.570
because his daughter
wrote a paper on it,

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.820
and that's the only time he
even heard of Ada Lovelace.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.400
I don't know if
you've heard of it.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.358
I only read it in the
"New York Times" article.

00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:40.840
And it dawned on
me-- why don't we

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.450
have more stories
of female leaders

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.240
out there, so that we
can create role models?

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.526
More stories about you.

00:29:48.526 --> 00:29:50.350
Get it out there.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.340
Share it with others.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.370
Blog.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:55.370
Not because you're selfish
or you're self-promoting,

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.839
but because you do
want to make an impact.

00:29:58.839 --> 00:29:59.880
Now let me get to the we.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.090
I have not forgotten
the men in the room.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:04.665
I don't want you to think I'm
just talking to the women.

00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:05.664
I'm looking at the guys.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.690
I'm going to talk
about my son, Adam.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.590
He is 14 years old.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.285
He plays nose tackle football.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.695
He's also starting
to really smell.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.960
And shave.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.680
Shower is the constant
debate in our household.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.810
But he is also this.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.380
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.730
[ADAM SINGS]

00:30:52.588 --> 00:30:54.080
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.390
He's also an opera boy.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:57.615
He now sings baritone.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:03.160
That was obviously treble
soprano, and he was younger.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.570
His voice is getting deeper
and deeper, so it saddens me.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.960
But he's also a football player.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.110
One day he comes
home from school,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.300
and I said, how
was your day, bud?

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.880
And he looked pretty troubled.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.500
And he said, Mom,
I have to tell you,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.990
I'm just really irritated
with my football friends.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.715
They don't want me to sit with
my drama friends and kids that

00:31:25.715 --> 00:31:26.215
sing.

00:31:26.215 --> 00:31:28.580
And they're like, why are
you always singing, too?

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.605
Kind of picking on
him, and irritated.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.470
He's 5'10", and
he's kind of big,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.870
so it's hard to pick on him, but
he was really bothered by that.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:42.210
So I was ready to jump in, be
the mom, to solve that moment,

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.550
give him advice, and
he said, I got it.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.390
I got this one.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.690
I said, what do you mean?

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.410
He said, I don't
really care what

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.620
they're saying about
my drama friends.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.530
I love the books we read.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.450
I love the
conversations we have.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.320
They're terrific.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.855
I must tell you, I felt pride.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:07.460
I felt hope that I had
taught my son to woman up.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.905
He had embraced those
opposing forces.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.000
Both the diversity and all
the different strengths,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.785
whether he's learned
it from his dad or me.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.850
And why do I share this?

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.870
Because both men and
women in the room,

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.450
what are we doing to
reprogram our brain?

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.857
What are we doing to woman up?

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:35.930
Thank you for having me.

00:32:37.367 --> 00:32:38.804
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:44.552 --> 00:32:46.010
MODERATOR: How much
of these values

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.509
are you imbuing into the
company that you're leading,

00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:49.550
and that you're building?

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.674
And how are you doing that?

00:32:50.674 --> 00:32:54.000
How are you getting your
leadership team, and all

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.940
of your employees, to embrace
these values that you clearly

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.280
hold so dearly?

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.340
SHEILA MARCELO: Well,
certainly we put out values

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.030
across the board that are gender
neutral for the entire company.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.920
It's there for you--
transparency, humility,

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.170
excellence, respectfulness,
and entrepreneurship.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.070
That's the there part.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.090
So it's important, I
think, to articulate values

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.930
from the very beginning, even
in the formation of the company.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.730
The other thing that I do on
the gender-specific question

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:31.160
is that I very much am
comfortable with naming that,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.280
is there a gender issue
that's going on here?

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.440
And it may or may
not, but at least

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.200
opening the dialogue,
so it's something

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.170
that we can just talk through.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:47.500
I had once one executive
on the management team

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.531
who would sometimes
lose his temper.

00:33:50.531 --> 00:33:51.530
It happened a few times.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.190
And I had to pause in a
101 intermeeting and say,

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.190
is it because I'm
a female leader?

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.010
Let's talk about that.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:04.080
It's not necessarily comfortable
to have those conversations,

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.110
but I think it's
important and it's

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.760
necessary to improve
those relationships.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.580
Because the reality
is, I am a woman.

00:34:11.529 --> 00:34:13.320
When you take your
Myers-Briggs, and you're

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.650
extroverted or introverted,
you're a feeler or a judger,

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.740
or whatever those letters
are, that's who you are.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.239
So if it's impacting the
relationship and the way

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.109
we lead the company,
then we need

00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:26.275
to have those conversations.

00:34:32.442 --> 00:34:34.650
AUDIENCE: Sheila, thank you
for sharing your stories.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.679
I could relate to a lot of them.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.389
One question-- so as you
move from a management career

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:41.360
into entrepreneurship,
could you talk

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.739
a little bit about that journey
and how it went for you?

00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:48.520
SHEILA MARCELO: I think that I
had been an entrepreneur ever

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.130
since I was little,
because I started

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.084
helping my mom in her business
at six or seven years old,

00:34:53.084 --> 00:34:55.090
to answer phones,
and I was known

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.802
to ask lots and
lots of questions

00:34:56.802 --> 00:34:58.010
about how business functions.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.170
Why do we price that way?

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.950
So I think it was just inherent.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.916
But I think-- you can
have entrepreneurship.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.850
And it is, to me, the
values of risk-taking.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.930
The values of testing
and iterating constantly.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.110
To say, it's OK to fail, embrace
that as a learning moment,

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.075
as opposed to being
judged as a failure.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:24.460
So I think that it's
having those set of values

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.990
that makes someone an
entrepreneur, whether you're

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.160
in a large company or where
you're starting something.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.380
It is that embracing
failure, taking risk,

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.705
pushing yourself to disrupt
yourself-- to be innovative.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.010
Just recently, we took
the company public.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.990
But I would say the fall prior
to taking the company public,

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.630
I had asked the
question of everybody

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:51.095
on the management team, how
do we disrupt ourselves?

00:35:51.095 --> 00:35:53.630
Are we the right
team to scale this?

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.890
And I had a few management team
members actually come up to me

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.410
and say, I'm not sure
I'm the right person

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.420
to scale at this level.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.240
And to have that conversation--
because again, it's

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.490
that entrepreneur, to say,
how do we disrupt, how do we

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.810
innovate, even with ourselves,
whenever it's necessary?

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:24.650
AUDIENCE: What advice can you
share when you inadvertently

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.995
intimidate people in
your professional growth?

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.980
SHEILA MARCELO: I think
that the intimidation can--

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.145
oftentime comes across in style.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:44.700
It can also come across in the
intelligence and the quickness

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.370
to get to the
heart of the issue.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:52.240
So it's understanding what
is your style in triggering

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.910
others, and starting
to journal about it.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.820
It doesn't mean
changing who you are.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.420
But it may be the case
that sometimes intimidation

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:07.520
is because you're quick to jump
to exactly what the answer is,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.075
as opposed to bringing and
influencing other people along.

00:37:11.075 --> 00:37:14.570
And posing intelligent
questions that

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.155
allows them to come up with
their own ideas and answers.

00:37:19.139 --> 00:37:20.930
It's less intimidating,
and actually you're

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.440
viewed more as a
leader, because you're

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.790
inspiring them to come
up with their own ideas,

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.900
though you may have
already thought about it.

00:37:31.274 --> 00:37:32.940
And because if you're
intelligent enough

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.700
to know what the answer
is 10 steps later,

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.770
you're also intelligent enough
to understand that sometimes,

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.240
you've got to figure out the
steps to guide them there.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.480
So it really depends on the
situation of the intimidation.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.700
It could be stylistic.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.560
It could be your voice.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.490
It could be the way you dress.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.900
And it's trying to
really figure that out,

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.020
and making sure that
your journaling about it.

00:37:58.545 --> 00:38:02.104
I graduated JD MBA from Harvard,
and I went to a startup,

00:38:02.104 --> 00:38:03.270
and I was a product manager.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:06.000
And whenever I got
introduced, it automatically

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.670
would create this intimidation.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.176
In fact, years ago,
I told my friend

00:38:09.176 --> 00:38:10.550
that when she
applied for a job--

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.160
she was also a JD MBA-- I was,
like, just leave the JD out.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.535
That was really
the wrong advice.

00:38:14.535 --> 00:38:20.990
And now, in hindsight, it's
about altering your style.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.560
Not changing yourself,
but understanding

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.880
how to relate better to other
people to also help guide them.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.520
You don't want to act
dumb if you're not dumb.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.730
You know what I mean?

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:33.650
Be smart.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.300
That's a strength.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.840
AUDIENCE: My question is simple.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.950
I think we focus
on-- we're trying

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:44.630
to look to others to see
how we're influencing them,

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.890
how we're inspiring.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.380
Who actually inspires you?

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.320
Who do you look up to?

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.550
SHEILA MARCELO:
Certainly my mother.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.640
Because when she
was in her mid 20s,

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.790
she had six children already.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:02.755
So when I used to complain--
I would say, I'm so tired,

00:39:02.755 --> 00:39:03.600
I'm doing all this.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.310
My mother would give me
this look-- like, honey,

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.520
you have no idea.

00:39:08.824 --> 00:39:09.990
And she was an entrepreneur.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.990
And they just celebrated-- and
I just shared it with a friend,

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.780
right before this--
they just celebrated

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.070
their 50th anniversary.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.000
And so my parents'
love truly inspires me,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.580
and their loyalty to each other.

00:39:24.855 --> 00:39:25.730
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sheila.

00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:28.780
I had a question
about-- you briefly

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.450
spoke about the
Impostor Syndrome

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.970
that so many women go
through and you even felt.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.960
What are some ways that
you could tell us about,

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.630
or you even go through,
to overcome that?

00:39:41.136 --> 00:39:42.760
SHEILA MARCELO: I
have touched on this.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.570
The Impostor Syndrome, clinical
psychologists have found,

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:48.340
actually skews a lot
higher with women.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.010
This whole
self-doubt, especially

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:54.630
if you're in a specific
position, thinking,

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.815
I'm really not-- what I did
years ago was, I journaled.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.180
You probably have gone
through this instance where

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.096
you're in a meeting and
you thought of an idea

00:40:05.096 --> 00:40:07.330
and you could have shared
it, but then somebody else

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.660
mentioned it 10 minutes later.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:13.330
I started to look
for affirmations

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.466
of, really, my knowledge.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:23.050
Affirmations that
gave me confidence

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.360
that I wasn't really
being an impostor.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.320
If I was an impostor, why
would I come up with that idea?

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.725
Why did I lead that strategy?

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.440
A good friend of mine,
she reminded me years

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.910
ago to write three things
that really went well,

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.720
that patted myself on
the back every day.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.360
Those gratifying moments.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.745
And it's not,
again, to be showy,

00:40:45.745 --> 00:40:47.810
and to drink my own Kool-Aid.

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:51.850
It really is, what three
things meant a lot to me that

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.940
affirmed who I
was, what impact I

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:58.440
was making on the
world and unto others,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.410
and really journaling
about it three times.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.750
And it's a self-fulfilling
thing that just gives you

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.470
a lot more belief
and confidence.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.262
And just keep
going back to that.

00:41:07.262 --> 00:41:09.470
It actually really works in
reprogramming your brain.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:13.270
It's just like exercising
and working out.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.780
And it becomes a behavior
thing that changes.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.070
So that whenever you have
those negative thoughts

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.870
and those impostor thoughts
go in through your brain,

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.370
but because you journal about
it so much and you re-read it,

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.060
you go back and look
at it so that you're

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.434
doing it real time
at that point.

00:41:27.517 --> 00:41:29.100
So you've just
reprogrammed your brain

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.460
to say that negative
thought, that Sheila voice?

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.580
Get out of there.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.230
I don't need it.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.631
I've got other really good
thoughts going on right now.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:38.990
Yes.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:43.050
AUDIENCE: To follow up on that
discussion of the impostor,

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.860
and also having your
Superwoman moments,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.660
you have an amazing resume
and amazing credentials.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.210
So it's really wonderful
to have someone--

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.270
to put them in the their
place, and have someone

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.460
say, oh, you must
be the assistant,

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.990
and then you can turn around
and say, I'm actually the CEO.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.817
How about for women
who need to go

00:42:02.817 --> 00:42:04.400
through certain
amounts of preparation

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.870
or feel like they need to get
certain credentials before they

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.070
can have those moments?

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.910
What advice would you have
for the pre-CEO moment?

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:20.210
And then also,
how do you balance

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.850
between being perfect and
having the preparation

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:28.294
and feeling confident and just
having your Superwoman moment?

00:42:28.294 --> 00:42:30.210
SHEILA MARCELO: That's
a really good question.

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.950
It is that finding
that authenticity

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.160
that-- I actually
went through it.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.450
Of course, everybody
had a pre-CEO moment.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.710
I was a young VP
at Upromise, and we

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.360
had a partnership with
an external partner.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.180
And the VP on the other end was
much more experienced than me,

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.010
and was questioning
whether or not

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.640
my leadership on
this integration

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.830
was the right assignment that
the CEO at Upromise gave.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:02.850
And I remember going to the CEO
in tears-- he still teases me

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:06.620
about this meeting--
in tears, saying,

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.130
how do I handle this situation?

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.088
How do I get respected?

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:13.970
I'm working in my butt off,
and I'm working really hard,

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.167
and why am I not
getting the respect?

00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:17.750
His name is George
Bell, and continues

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:22.120
to be my mentor to this day,
and said to me, you have to--

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.180
and we've heard
this before-- you

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.815
have to earn that respect by not
necessarily-- it's not a stamp.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.360
It's how you carry
yourself from here.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.360
And this, to this day, has
stayed with me, this advice.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.870
How do you bring out that
authentic, bold self?

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.260
That inner confidence?

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.870
Doesn't matter what
your resume is.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.330
That you don't need
to drink the Kool-Aid

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.310
to feel good about yourself.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.560
What is it that's in here?

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.580
And people around you feel it.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.650
They feel this inner strength
and this inner confidence,

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.320
because it's real.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.850
But it is a journey
to get there.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:06.170
And in leadership, people
want to be around you,

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.280
because you're authentic you.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.155
And it doesn't matter
where I went to school.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.700
None of that matters,
because it means

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.590
that I treat everybody the
same way-- with respect.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.620
Listening.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:23.620
And so, it's about
you, and building that.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.000
We've got a young
woman in the company--

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.990
exceptionally bright,
incredibly charismatic.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.690
And I said to her, you bring
so much of that charisma.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.420
But she's over-projecting
right now,

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.245
because she's trying to figure
out, how do I influence?

00:44:38.562 --> 00:44:40.270
And one of the things
we're talking about

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.526
is, what's that inner
authentic boldness?

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.181
Do I have the answers for
you specifically about that?

00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:48.680
No.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.490
You're going to have
to journal about it.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.230
But I've given her
the goal to say,

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:56.895
what is that inner authentic
boldness that's you,

00:44:56.895 --> 00:44:59.860
that comes out and it shines?

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.610
And you'll find that
when you find that,

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.470
you'll have a skip in
your step, and you'll

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:06.670
know that that's you.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.981
And it is a journey.

00:45:08.981 --> 00:45:10.480
And I think some
of you are nodding.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.295
And it's not easy.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.470
But journal about it.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:18.090
Journal about the great moments
when you came out of a meeting

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.440
and say, God, I got that right.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.300
That went well.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.700
That felt good.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.510
Why?

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:24.540
What happened?

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.330
How did you carry yourself?

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.660
How were you listening?

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.430
How did you
summarize the points?

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:30.410
Did you speak last?

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.540
Did you worry less
about what you

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.420
were trying to impress
everybody in the room,

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:41.900
but instead you did such a
great job truly leading it

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.380
that then everybody felt
good, and you felt good?

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:48.880
What are those moments,
and how do you repeat them?

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.840
And they become behavioral
changes in your style.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.847
And that just takes time.

00:45:54.847 --> 00:45:55.680
And it is a journey.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.500
MODERATOR: Sheila, you talked
about moving from success--

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.830
which you've clearly achieved--
to significance, which it seems

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.340
like you're really
doing, by participating

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.890
in these conversations
that you're

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.340
having with leaders
of countries.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.480
I'm curious to learn more
about the White House

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.150
Summit, and what your goals
were in participating in that,

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.965
and anything that you
experienced or learned there.

00:46:20.965 --> 00:46:22.090
SHEILA MARCELO: Yeah, sure.

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:23.990
A friend of mine,
Tina Brown, was

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.020
in the audience-- I just
saw her this past weekend--

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.790
and complimented me
for being on stage

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:34.290
to share our mission at Care.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.180
And it is to
professionalize care giving.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.990
And because I believe
in it so much.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.330
I was born and raised
in the Philippines,

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.930
and so many
caregivers-- and this

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.800
is beyond the Philippines--
but so many caregivers

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.150
are from the Philippines,
and from developed countries

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.590
around the world.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.460
And sometimes I'm in
professional settings,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.310
and I remind people
that these women give up

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.480
their lives and their own
children in their home

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.385
countries to take
care of your children.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.740
And that is a big,
big sacrifice.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.030
And how do we
professionalize that?

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.090
How do we make sure
that they're valued?

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.230
And why do I care?

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.040
Not just in business
terms, but because we

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.380
will have serious
societal issues.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.750
We will have a shortage of care.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.090
But it's also a
great business thing.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:19.130
Because if we have
shortage of caregivers,

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.004
then of course Care.com
is not going to grow.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.620
But it's not the main
reason that I got into this.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.220
I got into this because
I have such this passion

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.490
and this belief of making
sure that we are treating them

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.070
with respect.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:34.930
So with the White House, it is
about everything-- addressing

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.910
minimum wage, specifically, and
professionalizing care giving.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.985
Home Pay, which is the
largest household payroll tax

00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:43.360
company, that we
run at Care.com.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.050
How do we make it
clear that families

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.560
should pay above board, to
provide their caregivers

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.420
benefits?

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.200
And then on the family side,
how do you, as an employee,

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.962
make sure that you're getting
the benefits that you need?

00:47:58.962 --> 00:48:00.670
Because so much-- and
I've explained this

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.660
to world leaders,
and they get it--

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.735
is that, what drives
GDP growth is jobs.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.410
And if you want
more women to work,

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.820
you must invest in a
care infrastructure,

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.450
whether you're the government
or whether you're employers.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.745
If we want diversity in the
workplace, you must have care.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:24.830
Because there is
such a co-dependency.

00:48:26.204 --> 00:48:28.370
You can't go to work if you
don't have peace of mind

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.869
at home.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.550
And you can't afford great
care unless you're working.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.440
They've got to work to make
sure that that happens.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.900
So that combination is something
that-- it's a powerful mission

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.592
that we have at Care.com.

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:51.290
AUDIENCE: You talk about
pleasing, perfection,

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:55.010
and passivity, and it's clear
that your pinayness shows

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.874
through those P's.

00:48:55.874 --> 00:48:57.540
SHEILA MARCELO:
Pinayness is a Filipina.

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.960
AUDIENCE: It's a Filipina.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.770
How are you convincing
pinays to pinay up?

00:49:04.254 --> 00:49:06.170
SHEILA MARCELO: I'm
actually doing quite a bit

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.640
in the Philippines.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.514
I'm on the Philippine
Development Foundation.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:14.200
I also help put
together a female CEO

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.600
group in the Philippines.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.910
We're up about 100 now.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.110
Whenever I go home to
the Philippines, which

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.140
is about three times
a year, we regroup.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.190
I was just there
to talk about it.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:29.390
I'm also convincing
them-- anybody

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.670
who is interested in
working on a project

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:34.590
like this-- to develop-- do
you remember that "Got Milk?"

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:35.560
campaign?

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.210
I'm always advocating this.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:38.810
You have celebrities
to drink milk,

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.430
and the dairy industry can
afford it, and it's great.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:43.150
One of the things
is, the Philippines

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.390
is one of the countries in Asia
with the narrowest gender gap.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:49.672
It's the only Asian
country in the top 10,

00:49:49.672 --> 00:49:51.880
where the Scandinavian
countries are, because there's

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:56.930
a cultural heritage around
a very matriarchal society.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:00.360
And I have heard Japanese
women speak, to say,

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.060
when we see Filipino
women, it inspires us

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.790
that we can ourselves lead.

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:06.730
So one of the things
I'm trying to encourage

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:10.120
the Asian countries,
especially the Philippines,

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.420
is to showcase these role
models of female leadership.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.190
To woman up.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.850
To raise your hand up high.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.086
To develop this "Got
Milk?" campaign.

00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:19.710
We've got an agency
in the Philippines.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:21.250
We're starting to
think about it.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:22.475
It's a fun project.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:27.860
But how do we encourage more
women to help other women?

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.522
As Madeleine Albright
said, there's

00:50:29.522 --> 00:50:31.730
a place in hell for women
who don't help other women.

00:50:35.627 --> 00:50:36.210
MODERATOR: OK.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:39.311
So, I think-- oh, there's
one last question.

00:50:39.311 --> 00:50:39.810
OK.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.930
AUDIENCE: It's clear that
you've gone from one success

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:47.430
to another.

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.720
I'm very curious to
see, what do think of

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.620
as success in your own life?

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.200
What keeps you motivated
to go after the next thing?

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.850
And if you ever
feel like, I'm done?

00:51:00.339 --> 00:51:01.130
SHEILA MARCELO: No.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:04.940
The key drivers for me
is really my family.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.320
The key successes for me is
milestone-- I got pregnant

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.170
at a very young age.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.010
And seeing my son
graduate from college

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.560
is a very big deal for
my husband and I. Seeing

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.169
my parents-- they
also got married

00:51:17.169 --> 00:51:18.210
when they were teenagers.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.780
They hit their
50-year milestone,

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:22.475
and now we're 35 in the clan.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:29.800
Those are the things that keep
my North Star, keep me focused.

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.432
I have this policy that I
don't talk about Care at home,

00:51:34.432 --> 00:51:36.140
and I don't talk about
it with my family.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:39.840
So that I'm not drinking
my own Kool-Aid.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.190
I am just Sheila,
everywhere I go

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:45.262
that I spend time with
my family and friends.

00:51:45.262 --> 00:51:48.667
That it is not about the
company, or the definition

00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:49.500
of what we're doing.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.270
Because at Care,
it is actually what

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:55.177
we're doing for others, as
opposed to some leadership

00:51:55.177 --> 00:51:57.260
position that I'm getting
some fulfillment out of.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.910
[APPLAUSE]
