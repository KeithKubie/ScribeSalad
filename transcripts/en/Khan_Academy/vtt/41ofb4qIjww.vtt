00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
- Your kid, what did
you do today at school?

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.883
Nothing.
- Nothing.

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:04.716
- How was it?

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:06.070
Fine.
- Fine.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.280
- You always hear that, but
if parents can be intentional

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.000
about how they talk to
their kids after school.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.950
I always ask, my kids and
I we have a running thing

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.230
so every day after school I
say, best, worst and weirdest,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.630
and so they have to tell
me their best thing,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.350
their worst thing, and
their weirdest thing.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.810
Which it ends up with
a lot of funny stories,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.060
but it also gives us an
opportunity to kind of dive into,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.280
okay, so something didn't go very well.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.370
Why not?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.310
What was the catalyst
for that not going well?

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.890
Or if something went great,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.650
what kind of strategies did
you use to pull that off?

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.870
I mean, how did you prepare?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.770
How did you study?

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.550
How did you handle that tricky situation

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.450
on the playground or whatever.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.770
But talking to your kids
instead of just, you know,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.050
good job, A on the test.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.500
Ask them, like, how did
you prepare for this?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.350
What kind of learning went into this?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.910
Likewise, if they didn't do so well.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.663
Let's talk about what happened.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.970
So, really helping parents
build that communication

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.145
with their kids about
strategies for learning.

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:09.753
And what works and what doesn't.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.480
Having them draw the link between effort

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.200
and achievement is really important

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.100
so that kids are hearing
it everywhere they go.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.933
- Very good.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.766
Best, worst, weirdest.

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:20.599
I love that.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:21.432
Super cool. (giggles)

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:22.265
Annie.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:23.630
I'm sorry, Sam.
- It's alright.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.860
I think the bottom line to
when it comes to parents

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.383
is they are sending us the
most precious gift they have.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.530
There is nothing worse of a feeling,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.350
than being a parent and
seeing your child struggle

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.690
in reading or struggle in math

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.600
and you want so badly to fix it for them

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.720
but you don't know how.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.460
And so sometimes when
these parents come to us

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.190
and they're frustrated and
they just want it fixed.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.990
They're coming from a place of love.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
We have to train them too,
because they'll come upset.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.410
My child is not a good reader

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.450
or my child's not good in math.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.490
Well, now and yet.
- Right.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.290
- So what are we gonna do?

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.460
There really isn't...

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.480
If you really want to
see the kids just go far.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.150
A strong partnership between the kiddo,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.550
the teacher, and the parent.

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:11.560
You've got a big support
system there to really hold up.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.780
Then it comes down to what
Annie was talking about earlier.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.560
Alright, we've got our
support system holding you,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.870
now let's go for some effort.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.703
- Right, right.

00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:19.870
Exactly.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.240
That sounds like a really strong

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.980
kind of foundation when you have that.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.580
That sounds beautiful.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.320
We have a question from Alyssa B.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.370
How would you recommend
facilitating and encouraging

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.150
other faculty to promote growth mindset?

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.900
So this is a good question of what you do

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.390
kind of in your actual school environment?

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.133
- I think being transparent
and being vulnerable.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.780
Teachers work really hard

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.980
and we do not have a
lot of time in the day.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.930
It's sometimes, it's really
easy to hear something

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.310
and think that's just another thing.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.580
So I think, by being transparent

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.500
and allowing people to
come into your classroom

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.470
or see the fruits of your kid's labor.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.670
Let your kids lead things.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.674
Let your kids be the ones who
go out and talk about things.

00:03:06.674 --> 00:03:09.540
That's where the power lies
and that's where you show

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.010
that these mountains are being moved.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.470
And then I think also being vulnerable,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.530
being able to go to a meeting and say,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.470
guys, I'm really working on growth mindset

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.040
but I really feel like I,
personally, am failing here.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.620
I need some help.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.970
And having those open discussions,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.040
I think, encourage more people.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.050
You know, we talk about
our students feeling safe

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.880
but it's the same thing with the staff.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.180
The teachers, we've got to feel safe too.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.180
To kind of embark on this,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.657
because it's uncomfortable
at the beginning,

00:03:35.657 --> 00:03:38.273
and it's a new way of
thinking and speaking.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.850
There's a big power shift from
the teacher to the kiddos.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.461
That's nerve wracking at the beginning.

00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:50.730
It's such a positive power shift,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.060
but scared to take at the beginning.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.893
- [Interviewer] Right.

00:03:52.893 --> 00:03:55.030
- Getting administrators in on it too.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.170
I really believe it.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.870
Just like people approach things

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.310
with a growth and fix
mindset that a school has a,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.300
organizations have a
growth or fixed mindset,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.690
A lot of times you don't
have to look further

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.870
than the handbook to figure
out what are we valuing here?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.120
Are we valuing growth?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.650
Are we valuing perfection?

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.310
Getting a good gauge on what
is being valued and how.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.820
Are only the kids who are
getting on the A honor roll,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.650
are they the ones that
are being celebrated?

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.013
Do we have ways of celebrating
kids who are making less,

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:29.980
or making incremental steps toward growth?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.120
Do we celebrate that
at all in our culture?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.540
And so, as a teacher, I
think you have a opportunity

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.080
to speak to your admins and say,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.550
we need to refocus and celebrate.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.860
And, like Dave said, this is evidence.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.860
This is research-based.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.820
There is a strong body
of research going back,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.220
what, 30 or 40 years?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.304
- [Dave] Yeah, about that.

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:52.760
- That supports this as a
valuable learning intervention.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.060
Just sharing that and being, you know,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.130
being an advocate for it in your school.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.190
I think, is key to changing

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.850
the culture of the entire school.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.811
- Right.

00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:03.644
Very good.

00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:08.060
- Yeah, the only thing I would
add is just when I've talked

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.200
to teachers who have kind of catalyzed

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.500
these kind of cultural
transformations at their schools,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.060
I think a lot of the
time it's really happened

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.440
with just a handful of teachers
who really started doing it

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.710
and they really started modeling it.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.854
And going and talking to
other teachers about it.

00:05:22.854 --> 00:05:24.990
It just took some time.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.570
It wasn't like a we're all gonna do

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.740
growth mindset all at once.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.620
I think in my experience,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.740
that usually doesn't work very well.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.300
It's usually more that you kind of

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.210
start around this kind of core
crystal group of teachers.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.680
Then it kind of branches off from there.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.340
And as other teachers can see the kind of

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.890
amazing things that can happen.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.850
Then they start to say,

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.770
hey, maybe that could work in my class.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.670
Actually, I'd like to have my kids

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.492
be that inspired or that motivated.

00:05:48.492 --> 00:05:49.325
- That's interesting.

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:50.158
That's very interesting.

00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:51.870
Actually, I'm very curious to know,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.460
for Sam what made you want to try out

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.020
these growth mindset activities?

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.923
What was the catalyst for that?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.090
- It actually stemmed, in
the beginning, it was...

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.820
I noticed that my kiddos
were coming without tools.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.940
At the time I was in fifth grade,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.293
and I had to send my babies
off to middle school.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.730
I wanted them as empowered
and with as many strategies

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.560
as they could possibly
have before they went.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.523
Because middle school can
be really difficult years.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.390
And so I started looking at
things like their perseverance,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.610
how do they speak to one
another, how do they advocate

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.793
for themselves when they need something?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.090
We started little by little
looking at things like that.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.340
I started really, kind
of, trying to research

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.290
and find things to support that.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.710
It's funny, you know, we watch...

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.640
At the beginning of the
year I show my kids a video

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.250
of a really famous quantum theorist,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.040
who he's melded science and
math and he's been working

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.910
on the same equation now for 12 years.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.940
I promised my kids, I
will never make you work

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.873
on an equation for 12 years.

00:06:58.873 --> 00:06:59.706
(all laughing)

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:01.796
But if he can do 12 years
we can do 20 minutes.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:02.629
(all laughing)

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.273
We started trying to build that stamina.

00:07:06.168 --> 00:07:08.390
Then it just kind of grew from there

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.340
and it was kind of the perfect timing.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.735
Annie's book came out, Carol
Dweck's book is coming out.

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.740
PERTS is really on the stage now.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.340
LearnStorm's out.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.070
It feels like a lot of
us were seeking this.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.760
If you look at the manifestation

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.670
of what is really come to the surface.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.930
I think a lot of teachers,
at the same time,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.450
really were feeling the same need.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.283
- Right.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:32.116
That's beautiful.

00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:33.140
Alright.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.980
I'm glad we can help fill that need.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.860
That makes me feel good.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.370
Leigh Ann Morgan from Ontario asks,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.890
are there words and
phrases that foster growth

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.860
that I can include in my
student conversations?

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.630
I think, actually, all of you

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.060
have touched upon this idea of vocabulary.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.623
Let's see if we can try to touch on that.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.220
- I'm a firm advocate of the power of yet.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.500
Anytime they say any kind of negative talk

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.410
I'll point to them, yet.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.550
You know, and then they have to say it.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.710
And then we're big on, alright, now what?

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.440
Or, great, what do you need?

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.020
We practice a lot at the beginning

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.390
of the year building a tool kit of, okay.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.400
I'm stuck now, so what?

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.910
Alright, I can ask for more time.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.610
I can ask to hear it in a different way.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.230
I can ask the teacher to rephrase it.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.570
I can ask, we talk about
what are the different things

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.143
I can do to advocate for myself.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.630
Because, I might not always be

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.150
within these four walls
when I encounter a problem

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.700
and I need to have those intrinsic skills.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.700
And so having that vocabulary
ready for your kids

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.750
and then on the teachers part,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.140
really try and back away
from, good job, that's right.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.840
Or, leave it to the class.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.420
Mathematicians, what do you think?

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.330
This mathematician has proposed this idea.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.163
Thoughts?

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.090
At the beginning, they
just stare at you like,

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.950
is it right or wrong?

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.070
You know.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.960
But they start to learn
and it's so powerful.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.380
And it is so hard as a teacher though,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.860
when somebody throws something
wildly incorrect out there.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.310
But the cool thing is, there's
a lot of grace in that too.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.450
Because when the kids start
debating it and discussing it,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.830
we talk about, do you have
the right to change your mind?

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.530
And the kid will say, oh,
I'd like to change my answer.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.370
I think there's so much
power in how kids speak

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.749
to each other and speak to themselves.

00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:22.980
It's hard for the teacher,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.560
but kind of backing up and just
giving those launch points,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.436
those launching questions.

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:31.960
Then your crowd control at that point.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.130
- [Interviewer] Right, very good.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.940
- I think just being mindful

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.630
of person praise versus process praise.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.710
If we say to a kid who does really well,

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.470
oh, you're so smart.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.160
They equate doing well with being smart.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.390
That it's some inherent,
inborn thing that they have,

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.580
that they can do well.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.810
And then when inevitably
they hit a setback.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.800
Which they will.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.450
And they don't do so well.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.020
Then all of a sudden, it's like a question

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.150
of if I'm not smart then who am I?

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.080
So, just being mindful of praising effort

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.970
and the process that they took to learn.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.400
Like, that was a really
great strategy you used.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.400
Or, I like how you solved that problem.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.610
Or if they breeze through something,

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.100
maybe that wasn't challenging enough.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.280
Let's try to find something else.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.340
So be mindful of that.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.850
Being more robust with your feedback.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.450
I think we like to use stickers
and say good job a lot.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.220
In the book I wrote we call it,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.310
well, I read it somewhere else,

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.470
but they call it Paula-praise.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.371
So like on American Idol.

00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:28.200
If you think back to American Idol,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.660
the first with Simon,
and Paula, and Randy.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.810
Paula would always say good job.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.751
She didn't have any...

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:38.850
And Simon was a lot meaner,
but he was much more specific.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.690
You don't want to be like that, but.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.953
Definitely be specific in the
feedback that you're giving.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.730
I would rather have less
feedback that's more specific

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.670
than generalized praise
that is really meaningless.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.683
So, you want to be mindful of that.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.373
Yeah, just thinking
about that I used to say,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.300
c'mon you can do this, it's so easy.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.780
That was something I said as a teacher.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.190
And I look back and think,
oh my gosh, you know what,

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.200
that wasn't easy for that person.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.000
It was easy for me, or
I thought it was easy.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.430
But it wasn't easy for that person

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.520
and so what I was saying
was actually not helping.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.820
It was counterproductive.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.120
I thought I was being helpful.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.470
Just really be mindful
of what you're saying

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.864
and how that affects the student
that you're working with.

00:11:26.864 --> 00:11:27.990
Is really important.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.379
- Yeah, I really love all those points.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:32.770
I guess, just from a
growth mindset standpoint,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.460
I think that the kinds of language we use,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.060
the kinds of words we use
can be really important.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.060
There are...

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.530
So for example, are you
referring to things as,

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.820
for example, we can talk
about building skills.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.980
Really calling out when
you're doing something.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.930
Like why are you doing it?

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.390
Oh, you're building your skills.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.040
You're becoming a mathematician.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.090
Or you're building your
writing skills right now,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.783
you're becoming a better writer.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.490
Really focusing students
on those processes.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.810
How, the fact that they're
learning, while they're doing.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.830
It's a kind of taking, again,

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.300
taking the focus off of the end result.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.460
Really focusing it on the
thing that the students

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.300
can actually control for themselves.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.950
Which is the process that their doing.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.070
Reminding them and kind
of debriefing with them,

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.410
so that they really understand

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.430
what it is that they're doing.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.380
And that all this effort
that they're doing

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.840
it's not just going into a grade,

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.110
it's going into them leveling up.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.090
Them becoming a writer.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.630
Them becoming a mathematician.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.730
Or a scientist, or whatever that may be.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.655
A great civic thinker.
- Right.

00:12:30.655 --> 00:12:31.910
- Whatever that may be.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.410
They're really developing those skills

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.590
and really making sure to call out

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.050
that learning is a process,

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.700
so they're enacting in your class.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.533
- Right.

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:41.900
So, not just work for the sake of work,

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.830
but work for the sake of
growth and betterment.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.970
I love that.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.803
Alright.

00:12:47.803 --> 00:12:49.810
So we're gonna wrap up.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.990
I'm going to actually throw
you a bit of a curve ball

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.540
and ask you a final question,
but with a challenge.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.270
What is one last piece of advice

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.620
for teachers for fostering growth mindset

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.050
that you would give this year,

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.354
if you can give it in 10 words or less.

00:13:04.354 --> 00:13:05.290
Ho, ho.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.540
I know.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.290
Alright, I'm gonna start with Dave.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.890
- Have a growth mindset about

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.574
building a growth mindset culture.

00:13:14.574 --> 00:13:15.460
Was that too long?

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.488
- I think I did that right.

00:13:16.488 --> 00:13:17.818
- Okay.
(all laughing)

00:13:17.818 --> 00:13:18.651
- Alright, go ahead.

00:13:18.651 --> 00:13:20.950
Annie, one last piece
of advice for teachers.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.950
- I would say, model your
growth and fixed mindsets

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.078
and normalize mistakes in your classroom.

00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:31.340
(giggles)

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.173
- Well done, well done.
- Thank you.

00:13:32.173 --> 00:13:33.006
- I like it.

00:13:33.006 --> 00:13:33.839
Alright, Sam.

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:35.723
Your last turn.
- Okay.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.930
Be vulnerable, be a champion
for your kids and model.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.840
- I love that.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.673
That was very good.

00:13:44.673 --> 00:13:45.560
And all very tweet-able.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.020
Very great.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.950
So I want to think Dave and Annie and Sam

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.300
for joining us today.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.770
I learned something and I
hope that you all did, too.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.150
I want to remind everyone

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.190
that there's still time to sign up,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.530
so if you haven't signed
up, please, sign up.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.400
Like right now.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.650
Today.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.773
But definitely by the end of October.

00:14:05.995 --> 00:14:09.460
If you keep on tagging
your classroom celebrations

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.360
with #LearnStorm on Twitter and Facebook.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.700
We really love seeing in the office,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.780
so please keep on doing that.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.470
Welcome back to the school year, teachers.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.893
Thank you and good bye.
