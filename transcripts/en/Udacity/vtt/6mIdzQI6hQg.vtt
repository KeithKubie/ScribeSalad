00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.410
In, in specifying the signature we have given explicit names to

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.450
the variables Y and X. And we do this because we'd like to be able to refer to

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.000
them in the pre and post conditions by, by some, some name.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.750
Clearly this is simple, similar to what you would do in,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.210
in writing a stub in a programming language like Java. Where you can give

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.070
whatever names you'd like to the arguments as long as you consistently use them.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.210
The other thing to note about this is that, we could apply our SORT program

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
to things other than integers if they ha, satisfy one particular condition,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.020
which is that the basic elements have to be suitable as

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.550
arguments to some kind of ordering operation. So greater than, less than,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.519
and so on, are ordering operations. So we can sort ints, we can sort reals,

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.390
we can sort, strings and lexical graphic order if that's what we needed to do.
