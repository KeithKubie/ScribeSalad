ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
once again to Android

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.830
Design &amp; Action.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.430
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.680
ADAM KOCH: Hey, guys.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.750
My name's Adam Koch.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.280
And today, we have a special
guest joining from London.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.110
NICK BUTCHER: Hey,
I'm Nick Butcher.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.460
It's good to be here in person
shooting a show, rather than

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.070
just a little head across
the Atlantic.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.880
ROMAN NURIK: So today's
episode is about the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.690
onboarding experience,
basically, everything from the

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.530
point in which the user, you
know, downloads, maybe finds

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.830
your app in the Play Store,
installs it, and then

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.340
starts using it.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.260
So basically, just those kind of
initial crucial few moments

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.890
between the point in
which they install,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.430
and they start running.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.470
We're going to talk about ways
to make that optimal, at least

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.140
as optimal as possible.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.710
NICK BUTCHER: The old saying,
you only get one chance to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.690
make a first impression.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.920
This is what this show
is all about.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.670
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly, exactly.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.640
So with that, let's jump
into the slides.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180
NICK BUTCHER: And I'm
particularly proud about this

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.500
title card we have
for onboarding.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.505
Onboarding, get it?

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:55.436
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, like a
snowboard, boarding, you're on

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:56.120
a board, yeah.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.490
[LAUGHS]

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.766
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks
very much.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.590
It's my contribution.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.960
ROMAN NURIK: [LAUGHS]

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.770
So let's get in here.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.490
So the first thing we wanted
to talk about is that last

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.500
week or, I guess, two weeks ago,
we did an episode on our

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.170
top 10 anti-patterns or
common UX issues that

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.320
we saw during review.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.380
And number two, basically one
removed from the last one, was

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.680
a poor onboarding
user experience.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.640
And that included a couple
things, requiring registration

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.520
up front, using splash
screens.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.890
We're going to talk about
all the details here.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.110
But we wanted to spend an entire
Android Design &amp; Action

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.720
episode just talking
about this,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.080
because it's so, so crucial.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.650
So the first thing is about
splash screens.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.390
Adam, you want to talk
about splash screens?

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.610
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.820
So as you mentioned the other
week, don't show them.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.070
ADAM KOCH: Let's remember our
sort of content first

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.830
principles here.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.120
A splash screen is really not
content, it's just another

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.480
roadblock, another hurdle in the
way to the user getting to

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.160
your application and the
actual content in your

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.710
application.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.600
Now, of course, some people say,
well, I really want to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.590
make sure my brand is
recognized, that the user

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.160
knows my brand.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.970
Well, in Android, we still
think brand is very

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.340
important, of course.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.910
But you can use the action bar
icon and, of course, theming

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.230
and selecting that accent color
to really show off your

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.980
brand instead.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.080
And as you see here and in the
screenshots, Google Play is a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.750
pretty good example of using
that icon and this sort of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.570
accent color to really show off
the different silos within

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.350
the different Google
Play Store.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.820
ROMAN NURIK: And I know a bunch
of people might think,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.620
well, a lot of people think,
that splash screens are

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
important for when you have,
you know, content that you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.900
need to load before
you show your UI.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.460
And I'd say my rebuttal to that
is you don't necessarily

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.230
need to block the entire
UI, right?

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.980
There's probably something that
you can show of value.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.450
At least show the top-level
navigation of your app.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.490
You know, you can always show a
loading spinner or a really

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.380
friendly loading spinner,
something that involves your

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.670
brand even.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.290
It doesn't have to be the
built-in loading spinner.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.790
You can show that in place where
content will show up.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.560
You don't necessarily need to
block everything and have the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.800
user sit there patiently
waiting, just looking at your

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.010
pretty logo before actually
showing your UI.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.260
It's actually a good chance to
let them start exploring and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.700
learning about the different
sections in the app rather

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.100
than, you know, just showing
them nothing.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.820
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, even if the
content isn't there, maybe

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.800
they can open the drawer, see
what's available there.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.070
Maybe they can go to Settings
and see what

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.370
settings are available.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.160
They can do other things,
potentially, in the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.265
application.

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:38.175
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:38.630
OK.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.995
NICK BUTCHER: And I think the
worst offenders on the splash

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.110
screens are the splash screens
which decide to go full, full

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.820
screen and completely hide
away the status bar.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.840
That's a double--

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.450
don't do it.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.820
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.060
ADAM KOCH: Or the ones that
are playing sound or

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.340
music in the front.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.750
Argh.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.780
ROMAN NURIK: Yes, exactly.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.680
Actually, one of my favorites is
you have this splash screen

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.260
up, and then you press back or
press home or something,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.330
because you just don't want
to use the app anymore.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.640
And then, you know,
the splash screen

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.740
lasts for three seconds.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.430
But then you press back and,
three seconds later, the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.480
actual next screen just shows up
randomly because the splash

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.650
screen hasn't recognized that
you've backed out of it.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.040
So it's just that there are so
many things that can go wrong

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.010
with splash screens, and they're
just a very poor user

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.480
experience.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.190
Just don't use them at all.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.440
All right.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.280
NICK BUTCHER: I think
we've covered that.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.290
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I think we've
beaten that dead horse,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.880
or whatever.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.050
I'm really bad at idioms.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.530
ROMAN NURIK: All
right, anyway.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.180
Let's move on.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.160
So the next thing we wanted
to cover is tutorials.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.050
So we're going to spend some
time talking about a couple of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.090
main parts to onboarding.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.660
The first will be tutorials,
then we'll

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.960
talk about login flow.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.970
Finally, I think we'll talk
about onscreen overlays.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.340
So for tutorials, one thing,
before we jump into all the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.980
details, we do want to mention
is that there is pretty good

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.460
coverage of a lot of
these things in the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.610
Android Design Guide.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.270
So if you visit this link here,
you'll see the specifics

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.060
on when and when not to
show unsolicited help.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.930
So tutorials are one of those
examples of unsolicited help,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.340
basically help that you're kind
of pushing to the user

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.900
without them actively
requesting it.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.985
So we very clearly kind
of advice against it.

00:05:12.985 --> 00:05:14.770
You know, they're interruptions,
they're usually

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.700
not necessary, and so on.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.370
And so generally, this is
something that's covered in

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.030
our guidelines.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.060
But besides that, we wanted to
kind of add additional color,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.270
I guess, to some of these
guidelines and kind of explain

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.810
some of the reasoning
for them.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.830
So one of the first things you
should think about is there's

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.400
a couple types of tutorials,
right?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.550
There's speedbump tutorials,
mandatory tutorials that you

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.060
need to kind of go through
before you get into the app.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.630
And we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.310
That's the type of thing
that you shouldn't do.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.150
And the reason that you
shouldn't do them is,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.980
generally, that it's a sign that
you actually may need to

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.720
simplify your app.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.970
Maybe there's too
much going on.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.710
Maybe your app is just
not simple enough.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.340
So certainly, its generally a
bad sign if you think you need

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.240
a pretty complex onboarding
flow.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.650
Some ways around using the speed
bump tutorial style is

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.972
using something like
what Google Play

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:13.480
Movies is doing here.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.060
And it's still, you know,
communicating value.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.600
It's still, I guess, expressing
the value

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.315
proposition of the app, but it's
doing so in a very direct

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:24.770
and contextual way.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.700
So info cards is one
of the things that

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.200
Google Play Movies features--

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.440
it's one of the features
that they have.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.200
Basically, you know, when you're
watching a movie, you

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.750
press pause, you actually see
information about the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.730
character onscreen.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.710
But the idea here is that we
could have thrown up a

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.710
tutorial that forces you
to go through it,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.400
but we didn't here.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.560
So the idea here was that once
you get to the point at which

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.920
this starts to become
interesting, like the user may

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.950
start caring about this at this
point, we actually show

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.270
this card or this
tutorial card.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.750
And they can obviously very
easily dismiss it, or they can

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.680
just ignore it.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.170
You know, if they just start
scrolling down, they'll see

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.220
their content.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.830
So it's very passive.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.810
It's not super obtrusive.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.350
But it does communicate the
value, and it does it in a

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.320
contextual way.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.425
If I was in a different section
of the app, perhaps it

00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:19.260
would show me a different
kind of hint that

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.520
there's a feature there.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.170
NICK BUTCHER: I think the key
to this kind of goods

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.260
tutorial, if you will,
is it's non-blocking.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.240
I think anything which is
blocking, especially mobile

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.390
dialogues-- one of my personal
pet peeves--

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.650
anything that's you saying to
user, hey, I know better than

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.980
you what you need to be doing
now, is kind of aggressive.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.870
And it kind of breaks any flow
or any task they're trying to

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.790
accomplish.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.500
So I think, while this is still
unsolicited help, I

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.000
guess, it doesn't have that
blocking feature, which makes

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.040
it so much better.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.740
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.760
So just to specifically talk
about speedbump style

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.080
tutorials, these are the kind
of tutorials where-- you see

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.350
here an example--

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.110
you basically flip through a
couple of pages, and maybe at

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.370
the end there's a sign-up
for something.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.080
But basically, this
is not the app.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.280
This is a separate flow before
you get to the actual app that

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.170
is mandatory.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.140
So this is definitely
something that

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.478
you should try to--

00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:12.810
NICK BUTCHER: I wonder how many
of these screens people

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.748
actually even read, how
many just see this--

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:15.821
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, swipe,
swipe, swipe.

00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:15.840
[LAUGHS]

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.580
NICK BUTCHER: --and immediately
try and home in

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.540
on, how do I get past this,
and just mash that button.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.220
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.050
And actually, I will say that
we should probably admit at

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.740
this point that one of our
reference apps, the Google I/O

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.730
app, has a speedbump.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.870
Not a tutorial, but it's a
different onboarding flow.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.624
And it's definitely something
we should try to address for

00:08:32.624 --> 00:08:34.210
the next release.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.789
But here, you know, some of
the things that you should

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.200
think about.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.679
If you absolutely have to do
something like this, if

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.220
management sends down the word
that you must have this kind

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.360
of tutorial flow, definitely
allow immediately skipping.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.730
So don't force the user to go
next, next, next, next, next,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.800
and then get started.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.330
So give them the option
to skip right away.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.420
Also, and Nick will talk about
this in depth later, but if

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.030
you're going through a couple
screens that tell you about

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.720
the app, and then at the very
end, you have to kind of make

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.220
decisions, like sign up or
register or whatever, that's

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.450
just another way to
stop the funnel of

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.701
engagement with your app.

00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.530
So definitely try to
avoid these kinds

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.270
of speedbump tutorials.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.820
All right, I think we've
talked about speedbump

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.590
tutorials quite a bit.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.970
But there's a couple of other
tutorial type things you can

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.020
do to educate users about your
app, to communicate the value

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.950
proposition.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.730
The first, and this is very
obvious, very simple, is doing

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.740
so via your Google
Play listing.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.940
A lot of the features that are
available in the developer

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.480
console are there so that
you can kind of have a

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.130
conversation with your users
at the perfect time, right

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.950
before they install,
right before they

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.260
start using your app.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.090
So things like the
product video.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.370
That's very important.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.000
Google Keep is actually
a really good example.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.960
When you press Play here, this
actually has a pretty high

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.690
level of prominence on the
page, so it draws your

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.610
attention to this.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.690
This video, you start
pressing play.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.280
And the video that Google
Keep has provided has

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.270
a very strong narrative.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.260
It actually walks you through,
kind of, one flow, one user

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.670
using the app.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.680
It actually talks about the
features, but you actually see

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.990
the person interacting
with the UI.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.500
So actually, it's a nice way to
kind of imagine yourself in

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.830
their shoes.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:24.860
You can kind of fill
in the gaps.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.430
This is how I would probably
use the app.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.300
And then, obviously,
screenshots.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.000
The screenshots are a really
good way to communicate what

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.360
your app does, especially if
your UI design is very good

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.170
and very clear.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.170
You can immediately kind of
understand what the app does

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.260
and how it works just by looking
at the screenshot.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.550
NICK BUTCHER: One thing I would
say on the screenshots

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.180
as well is be careful of the
order you put them in.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.540
Quite often, I'll see
screenshots uploaded for

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.000
application, and it seems like
they're in the order in which

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.280
you might go through
the application.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.400
So in some apps I've even seen
a splash screen uploaded as

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.640
the first screenshot.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.760
And then a login screen.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.540
And then, maybe further down the
line, perhaps once you're

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.870
into the actual content within
the application.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.360
And that's a real shame, because
as you can see here on

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.140
the screenshot from the
web, there's only

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.950
room for one or two.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.790
And this is even more
exaggerated

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.960
when you're on a device.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.630
So you'll probably see the
video and maybe one

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.560
screenshot, perhaps half of the
second one coming in here.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.570
So you really want to be sharing
your hero moments, the

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.790
thing that really, clearly
expresses what this

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.260
application is all about first,
and then forget about

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.960
these other ancillary screens.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.260
ROMAN NURIK: For sure.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.400
ADAM KOCH: And of course
showing screenshots for

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.160
different form factors.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.285
ROMAN NURIK: Yes.

00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:34.520
ADAM KOCH: And don't forget
to do that as well.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.145
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, because, you
know, if I'm on a device,

00:11:36.145 --> 00:11:38.850
if I'm on a 10 inch tablet, I
want to see what it's going to

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.500
look like on my device.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:40.840
ADAM KOCH: Mhm.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:40.860
NICK BUTCHER: Mhm.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.550
ROMAN NURIK: If I'm on a four
inch phone, I want to see

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.500
exactly what it's going to
look like on a phone.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.550
All right, moving on.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.740
Another way to communicate,
again, your value proposition

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.810
or educate your users, give
them a tutorial about your

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.160
content, is through
the empty state.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.830
And this is actually one of my
favorites, not because this is

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.030
specifically my app, but this
is one of my favorite

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.790
opportunity moments, in
the empty states.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.420
So you know, most apps
these days have

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.660
collections of things.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.610
You know, they have screens
where there's collections of

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.530
things, collections of movies,
collections of, in this case,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.615
extensions for a, clock.

00:12:15.615 --> 00:12:18.490
There's lots of different
lists.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.700
Too often we see developers
missing the opportunity of

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.730
that empty state.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.400
When there's nothing in that
list, use that as the

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.160
opportunity to talk
to your user.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.740
Tell them how to add things to
that list, why they should add

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.040
things to that list, actually
put buttons in there in that

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.970
empty state that will let
them take action.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.880
Fix the problem of
the empty state.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.530
Generally, people don't
want an empty state.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.100
They want it to be
populated, right?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.690
So one of the ways in which
you can do that is you can

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.740
just simply use that empty state
for all sorts of things.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.820
In this example, this is the
DashClock app that I wrote.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.590
Before you add any extensions,
you get greeted with this

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.460
screen here.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.000
And then, you can press this
button to add an extension.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.680
As soon as you add something,
you kind of start seeing the

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.230
full populated list.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.750
And it's very easy to do from
a development standpoint.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.683
You basically just provide an
empty view for the list.

00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:09.026
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:10.960
Quite commonly, you might
imagine-- well, quite often I

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.150
see screens which might be like
this on the left, but

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.620
it's just empty screen with
maybe a small plus in the

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.140
action bar.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.180
And it's such a missed
opportunity.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.140
ROMAN NURIK: Right, yeah.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.480
One thing I will say here is
that there's just a bit too

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.730
much text here.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.356
Probably just be very visual,
not really immersive, but just

00:13:26.356 --> 00:13:28.750
be very visual on this
screen if possible.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.950
Here, I kind of didn't
do that.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.590
Anyway.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.190
So let's move on to
the next screen.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.950
Another important way to
communicate your value

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.550
proposition, to explain to users
how to use your app, is

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.850
to pre-populate it with, how you
like to say, bootstrapped

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.850
content, right?

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.460
So this is an example
from Michael Pardo.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.200
It's an app called Quotes
and gives you your

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.690
stock quotes, obviously.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.810
And so one way he could have
designed this app is that when

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.210
you first install it, and you
open it up, it just has no

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.460
quotes in there, right?

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.490
It's a blank list.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.195
And it doesn't show you
any interesting data.

00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:07.290
Maybe it just shows you the
S&amp;P index or whatever.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.810
But what he decided to do here
is he decided to actually

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.330
pre-populate your portfolio
with a couple of

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.450
common stocks here.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.750
They have a CAKE.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.930
I'm not sure if that's like
Cheesecake Factory.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.640
PIZZA, which is probably one
of the delivery services.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.580
And so you kind of immediately
see the value of the app.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.010
You immediately see the data
you're working with.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.280
You know, obviously, you can
very quickly remove them.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.880
You just long press, select
them all, and just remove.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.370
Or you can just add to it.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.590
But it's actually just a very
nice, simple way to just

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.480
immediately get started.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.910
So I think that was
it for tutorials.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.270
Any parting words on tutorials
before we move on, guys?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.620
NICK BUTCHER: No, I think
that's covered it.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:44.890
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:45.310
ROMAN NURIK: All righty.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.330
ROMAN NURIK: Let's do it.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.410
Nick, take it away for
login registration.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.570
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.990
This is one of my pet peeves,
the login experience and

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.480
registration.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.930
So the first thing, let's say,
for a login is that you should

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.040
really be delaying it
until it's kind

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.260
of absolutely necessary.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.280
Just like those speedbump
tutorials that we looked at

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.030
earlier, it's another thing to
do when you already kind of

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.360
quite cognitively loaded.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.630
The first time you run an
application, there's a lot

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.250
going on, right?

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.060
You're kind of getting used to
it, you know, the way it looks

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.200
and feels, the way the
navigation is laid out.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.040
You're understanding what
the app is doing.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.410
And if you're throwing on all
these extra layers of stuff,

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.430
then it's just a lot for the
ease of the process.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.480
So by far and away, I'd
say delay it until

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.720
the last moment possible.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.760
And the second point I wanted
to make here is people are

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.430
probably more likely to actually
complete the login if

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.820
they can clearly understand
why it's necessary.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.993
So an example of this, a great
example of this I was showing

00:15:38.993 --> 00:15:40.840
here, is the Tumblr
application.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.817
So when you install Tumblr, you
get the opportunity to log

00:15:44.817 --> 00:15:46.260
on, but you don't have to.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.140
You can immediately start
using the application.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.880
You can explore different Tumblr
blogs, and you can

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.110
actually take kind of logged-in
type actions.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.890
So for example, here I haven't
actually logged into the

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.120
application, but I've already
been able to go through and

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.050
start following people.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.870
And if I were to then decide
to log in and sign up, it

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.600
would then take all those
actions which I've already

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.940
done and just merge them into
the account I've just created.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.710
So it's a truly wonderful
example.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.520
And in this example
here as well.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.990
So if once I've followed a
blog, if I try to do any

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.190
actions that obviously requires
login, so if I tried

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.290
to like it or comment on
something, at that point, it

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.520
then says, hey, you need to
be logged in to do this.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.110
And I can clearly
understand why.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.740
It's demonstrated it's value
to me already, and I'm much

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.130
more likely, I think,
to complete it.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.630
ROMAN NURIK: It's kind
of like an inherent--

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.340
it's a very contextual almost
direct manipulation in the

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.995
sense that it's very clear that
when I'm pressing this

00:16:38.995 --> 00:16:43.090
and I see a sign in dialogue,
the reason to sign is because

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.880
this won't work without that.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.010
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.590
ROMAN NURIK: Whereas, if you
were to ask somebody to sign

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.855
in in the very beginning as part
of that tutorial flow,

00:16:49.855 --> 00:16:52.830
there's no expression
of value, right?

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.460
It's not clear.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.310
It's very indirect, if it's
even there at all.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.860
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.130
Absolutely.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:16:59.430
OK.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.790
And the next step is when you
do go on to provide logon.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.300
Logging on can be kind of
a painful experience.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.010
It often involves data
entry, which

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.490
isn't always the easiest.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.050
And it's often a pain for you
as well, having to kind of

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.510
manage and secure passwords
and so on and so forth.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.630
So an alternative might be to
consider using some of the

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.910
common logon providers.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.190
People are likely to have a
bunch of accounts on their

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:23.800
device already.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.390
So you might have a Google
account, a Facebook account,

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.790
Twitter account, some of
these common providers.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.780
And they offer much faster and
easier logon services.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.140
Yeah, we're particularly a fan
of the Google+ logon, because

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.290
most Android users, well, every
Android user has a Gmail

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.460
account to sign in to
the Play Store.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.665
So there's a good chance
they'll be able

00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:43.910
to log in with that.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.090
ROMAN NURIK: And another thing
is, you know, even with

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.570
Facebook, right-- a lot of users
have Facebook installed.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.320
When you use their SDK rather
than using a separate,

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.520
web-based flow, when you use the
SDK, you actually benefit

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.030
from the user's account
already on the device.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.640
You don't even have to actually
type in your Facebook

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.600
user name and password or
Facebook email and password.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.530
You basically touch it.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.905
It knows that you already
logged in.

00:18:08.905 --> 00:18:10.360
It asks you to confirm
and so on.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.830
And obviously, with Google+,
it's the same way.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:13.770
It's actually--

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.550
NICK BUTCHER: Pretty seamless.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.760
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it's
very, very, seamless.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.350
Very much worth it.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.600
NICK BUTCHER: Definitely.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.550
Oh yeah, one point we wanted to
make on that is to include

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.420
an email alternative.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.410
Some people just aren't
that comfortable.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.790
You know, they perhaps might be
worried, is this going to

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.300
publish stuff my timeline,
and so forth.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.800
And some people are just
adverse to it.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.860
So you know, while we definitely
recommend this as a

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.857
great way to go, we would
definitely say include an

00:18:36.857 --> 00:18:37.820
alternative.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.580
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.080
NICK BUTCHER: All right.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.190
And as an aside while we're
talking about login, one of my

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.370
favorite things is when you
actually remove the need to

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.990
log in altogether.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.170
And that's offered quite neatly,
I think, by Google+,

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.030
And so if you choose to go
down that route and you

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.920
already have a popular web
property, if the user signs in

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.230
on the web properties in the
same Google+ account, it'll

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.720
actually pop and offer them,
hey, would you like to install

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.250
the Android app at
the same time?

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.950
So it's a great, great
discovery mechanism.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.070
But simply, the greatest thing
is that the user will be

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.160
automatically logged in already
in the Android app.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.000
So you skip the need for
this altogether.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.470
Fantastic.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.150
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it's one
of the best ways to remove

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.770
friction, right?

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.130
NICK BUTCHER: Mhm.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.260
ROMAN NURIK: That's probably
what, you know, the business

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.160
folks are always
thinking about.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.310
It's always about the
funnel, right?

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.565
How do we maximize the funnel?

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:24.780
NICK BUTCHER: Exactly.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.910
ROMAN NURIK: How do
we minimize the

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.230
roadblocks in the funnel?

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.017
And this is one of the
best ways to do that.

00:19:29.017 --> 00:19:30.480
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.760
So that's particularly fun.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.650
So on from login, we're
talking about the

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.670
registration steps.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.660
So I want to say here do offer
to sign up on device.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.850
I find it quite frustrating
when an application hasn't

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.875
implemented a registration step,
so it kind of boots me

00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:48.740
out to a web view or something
like that, which might have

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.800
worse data entry and form
filling capabilities.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.500
So I definitely urge you to
include it within your

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.300
application.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.650
But try to make it as painless
as possible.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.910
So as we were saying, data entry
on mobile devices isn't

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.700
always the most fun experience,
especially at this

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.150
critical time when you're trying
to get someone to sign

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.690
up for your service.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:06.940
Yeah, think of that funnel.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.630
So you want to keep it as
painless as possible.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.300
So here's a kind of concocted
example, which is kind of

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.350
trying to prove the
point like--

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.430
ADAM KOCH: Social
security number?

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.140
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, make it
as simple as possible.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.380
Don't ask someone to enter an
email address on the phone and

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.290
then confirm it.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.930
I mean, that's pretty
painful, right?

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:25.570
And some other step.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.480
So I'm going to walk you through
some improvements to

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.360
this screen here.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.770
So the first thing I'd say is
to remove repetitive or

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.000
nonessential fields here.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.170
So already, this screen is
starting to look a little bit

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.540
better if we got rid of having
to repeat both your email and

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.690
password and some extra
information, which might not

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.170
be completely essential
to sign up.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.390
And you can maybe prompt for
it later on when they

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.760
understand the value proposition
of that or on a

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.180
different kind of meeting.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.320
So already, this is starting to
look a little bit better.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.510
The next step, one of my
personal favorites, here is to

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.050
suggest an email if the user
starts filling it in.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.372
So your Android device knows
a lot about you.

00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:03.100
He already knows the email
addresses, maybe some user

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.440
names that you've entered.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.280
So once the user starts typing--
or you could offer

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.630
this as a pick from list if
you want, then do suggest.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.340
One thing to be wary of--

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.410
I've seen some implementations
of this where they just see if

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.890
there's already an email address
on the device, and

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.020
then they just prefill it.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.590
But they don't let you pick,
which isn't great for users

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.310
who have more than one account
on the device.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.996
So definitely let them switch
between multiple accounts if

00:21:25.996 --> 00:21:26.620
they have that.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.330
But yeah, already, this has
gotten so much easier.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.960
Just with a couple of key taps,
I can just pick from

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.790
this list here.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.180
ROMAN NURIK: And one of the
questions that, actually, we

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.300
discussed earlier was, how do
you actually show this list?

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.440
Right?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:37.850
NICK BUTCHER: Mhm.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.015
ROMAN NURIK: Do you show an
additional affordance to pick?

00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:40.150
NICK BUTCHER: Mhm.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.570
ROMAN NURIK: And certainly,
if you use the Google Play

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.080
Services SDK, there's actually
something called an account

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.990
picker that's a dialogue
that pops up.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.410
And that actually doesn't
require any permissions.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.240
And so if you wanted to show the
account picker dialogue,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.460
you could have an additional
button next to this field,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.700
rather than a drop down.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.760
But if you do decide to go for
a drop down, which is also

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.170
very nice, the way I'd probably
do this is, as soon

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.500
as the text field is focused,
drop down the list.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.560
And then, as it loses focus,
collapse that list.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.230
As an alternative, you could
have a conditional kind of

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.030
spinner type affordance on the
side that pops up the list.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.170
But generally, it's probably
best to just show the list

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:18.310
immediately.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.380
And I think that's maybe how the
autocomplete stuff works

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.970
by default, but I'm
not quite sure.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.230
NICK BUTCHER: Great, cool.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.445
Another side note we've added
here is to prefer email to

00:22:29.445 --> 00:22:30.460
user names.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.270
I don't know about you, but I
just find when I'm forced to

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.510
pick a username rather than just
use my email address it's

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.200
just another thing I'm not
going to remember.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.060
ROMAN NURIK: Right.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.560
NICK BUTCHER: Whereas, it all
comes back to email at the end

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.532
of the day anyway, so you can
reset it and so forth.

00:22:42.532 --> 00:22:42.890
ROMAN NURIK: Mhm.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.080
The worst is when there's a
service where the username is

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.710
your email, and it
says username.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:48.810
Just say email.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.910
Just ask for the
person's email.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.190
NICK BUTCHER: Absolutely.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.090
And yeah, it works really,
really well on Android,

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.680
because you're able to create
a device for [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.180
as well.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.580
So there we go.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.270
So next up, passwords.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.370
So we've said here,
make it optional.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:08.580
So you can just not require
users to enter a password.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.640
You could do something like
auto-generating one, prefill

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.300
it in, and let them cycle it
or something like that.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.240
You could just say
it's optional.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.960
Some users will want to set
it, some users might not.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.330
But my preferred option would
be just to probably omit it

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.210
altogether.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.800
I mean, I'm probably going to
enter something very weak or

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800
very quick anyway.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.955
I'd rather just, it's
in the background.

00:23:26.955 --> 00:23:29.840
It's generated, saying super
secure or something like that.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.520
And I can always just hit the
Forgot Password or Reset

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.705
button, should I really, you
know, want to get access to

00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:38.590
that password or if I've
forgotten it somehow.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.170
ADAM KOCH: And maybe later, when
you're on your desktop,

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.480
when you have a real keyboard,
you can get that email and

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.970
actually fill out a
real password or

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:44.720
something like that.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.280
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, you get the
email like, click here to

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.020
actually set a password,
or something like that.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.450
NICK BUTCHER: So thinking back
to that kind of final analogy

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.060
of how many people are going
to get through this step.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.205
If think back to that first
screen with all those fields

00:23:54.205 --> 00:23:56.910
and so on, rather than just one,
which is going to help me

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.280
fill in the only field anyway by
suggesting something and a

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.060
button to hit sign up, you've
got to imagine that the funnel

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.615
is a lot better than this.

00:24:03.615 --> 00:24:07.020
ROMAN NURIK: One thing I want
to add is with passwords.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.360
One of my biggest pet peeves
is when there are passwords

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.910
that require symbols
and capital letters

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.250
and all this stuff.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.660
And generally, it's
a bad practice.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.340
But a lot of people use
the same type of

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.780
password or the same--

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.300
it might even be a
strong password.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.510
It may be very long.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.380
But you know, people like to
use similar passwords, and

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.520
when you ask them to start
introducing symbols and all

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.080
these arbitrary constraints, it
actually makes them forget

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.920
their password.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.120
I mean, I don't know
how many times--

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.340
I mean, it's a bank password.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.950
But some of my bank passwords,
I mean, I've probably had to

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.780
reset them a bunch of times,
or my account for cable or

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.440
something like that.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.850
Generally, try to enforce it
maybe on minimum size but not

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.740
so much on symbols.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.780
And there's actually a really
funny XKCD about arbitrary

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.850
password restrictions.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.900
Basically, I think the result
was if you have a very long

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.120
string of just regular words
like, hello there, my name is

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.690
John, or something and if
they're completely random

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.140
words with no symbols, no
anything, the entropy of that

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.200
is actually a lot higher than
a very short password, let's

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.080
say eight characters long,
with a whole bunch

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.130
of symbols and stuff.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.560
You know, think about that
before you require people to

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.680
use to provide symbols.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.910
NICK BUTCHER: I think,
generally, just don't get into

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.180
the game of holding passwords
if you can.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.800
I think these social providers,
you know, Facebook,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.900
Google, Twitter, spend a lot of
time and money and thought

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.570
and engineering into keeping
things like this secure.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.920
And if you have the option of
not doing that, that's pretty

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.730
attractive, I think.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.160
You don't want to be the one who
loses someone's database

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.230
of passwords or something.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.040
ROMAN NURIK: Right, exactly.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.450
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, and one other
note, a tiny one here,

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.270
is that you can also help the
user out by replacing where

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.810
the enter key would normally be
on the keyboard with some

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:52.020
kind of text which
is contextual

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.280
to what you're doing.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.290
So you know, you quite program
to type and then hit Next or

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.150
whatever that button is.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.960
And if that actually does
something, and when the user

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.710
hits that and it's the same as
hitting the onscreen sign up

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.630
button, it's just another tiny
thing that will help the user

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.175
to complete this flow easier.

00:26:07.175 --> 00:26:07.580
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.942
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I guess similar
to that as well, in

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:10.770
case there are other fields that
you need to click, like

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.550
maybe a phone number, you can
set the data type on that

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.920
field appropriately so the
keyboard adjusts itself to

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.480
sort of optimize
for that field.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:17.970
ROMAN NURIK: Mhm.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.930
You'll actually notice
that here this is

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:21.980
an email type field.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.570
So you automatically get the
at sign and the dot sign.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:26.390
NICK BUTCHER: And there's
other fields.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.180
We talked about email quite
a lot, that you

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:28.890
can query the device.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.820
All right, I mean there are
other fields you can query for

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.580
for, I think, Ice Cream
Sandwich and beyond.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.400
The device has a concept
of the user's profile.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.800
So with their permission, you
can ask for their first name,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.600
last name--

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.630
ROMAN NURIK: And their
avatar photo.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.700
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
avatar to photo.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.265
You can also get telephone
number--

00:26:43.265 --> 00:26:43.390
ADAM KOCH: Mhm.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.500
NICK BUTCHER: --if you're
on a phone type device.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.820
So each of these will cost you
a permission, but it depends

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.710
if it's critical to your--

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.620
ADAM KOCH: How important
it is, yeah.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.050
NICK BUTCHER: Then that might
ease and increase sign ups.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.060
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
shall we move

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.970
on to onscreen overlays?

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.400
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, sure,
let's do it.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.110
So this is pretty quick,
but onscreen overlays.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.950
So the general rule of thumb
here is avoid them.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.482
NICK BUTCHER: I think I've seen
enough with those kind of

00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:14.040
hand-drawn styled arrows
coming out.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.340
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:14.900
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.750
Yeah, exactly.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.430
In particular, you know, you
should avoid them for common

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.880
UI patterns.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.130
So we're talking action bar.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.670
You really don't need to tell
the user how to use these

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.920
things again.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.780
Yeah, the other thing we
mentioned here was the

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.730
navigation drawer.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.070
And I don't think we mentioned
this yet, but there's actually

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.780
a recommended pattern for
the navigation drawer.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.030
When the user first loads the
app, you can actually open

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.030
that navigation drawer
for them, just for

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.390
discoverability, almost like
a tutorial in itself.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.000
NICK BUTCHER: Animate to open a
drawer, because that teaches

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.720
the gesture.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.790
ADAM KOCH: Exactly.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.920
And then, the first time they
actually go and use the

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.210
drawer, they close it or
open it themselves.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.232
You can set a flag there, and
then you don't need to open it

00:27:54.232 --> 00:27:57.830
again on future times they
open the application.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.750
So you really don't need an
onscreen overlay to sort of

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.870
help the user discover
that Droid can use

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.820
another method like that.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.490
ROMAN NURIK: And generally,
users are learning things like

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:12.010
the drawer, like the action bar
overflow, by using apps

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:16.250
like Gmail, like Google Keep,
like Google Drive.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.940
You know, a lot of these apps
come pre-installed on their

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.130
devices before they ever
install your app.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.330
So they're learning
these patterns.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.700
There's no need to really kind
of educate them further about

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.970
patterns they probably
already know.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.590
ADAM KOCH: Mhm.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.095
When it comes to help, you know,
the perfect place for

00:28:31.095 --> 00:28:32.880
that is the overflow menu.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.495
And I think earlier, Roman
had a link to the Design

00:28:35.495 --> 00:28:37.920
Guidelines, which sort of goes
into a bit more detail on how

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.760
help should be structured
within your application.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.140
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it's
basically like the difference

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.616
between unsolicited help
and solicited help.

00:28:43.616 --> 00:28:44.620
ADAM KOCH: Mhm.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.215
Users crying out for help.

00:28:46.215 --> 00:28:46.390
ROMAN NURIK: Right.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.980
ADAM KOCH: They're going to go
to the overflow and find what

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.230
they need there.

00:28:53.168 --> 00:28:56.040
There are some times where
it's appropriate to have

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.430
onscreen overlays though.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.235
So custom gestures like sort of
very specific gestures to

00:29:01.235 --> 00:29:03.560
your application that are just
very custom an interesting and

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.050
different to other applications,
it can be

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.010
appropriate.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.640
And a really good example of
that here that we have in the

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.050
screenshot is the YouTube
application.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.280
And so in one of the more recent
updates, that YouTube

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.440
application actually allows you
to basically continue to

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.000
browse YouTube while minimizing
the current video

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.250
that's playing.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.060
And so in the bottom right
there, that video would be

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.180
playing right now.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.660
And the first time that you see
this in the new YouTube

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.700
application, it gives you this
little overlay so that you can

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.480
sort of understand the gestures
that you can apply to

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.340
that particular video.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.490
So swiping there to the left
dismisses the video, and

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.260
swiping up actually maximizes
the video back into sort of

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.230
the fullscreen view.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.410
ROMAN NURIK: Mhm, yep.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.090
ADAM KOCH: So I think
this is a really

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.540
good use of an overlay.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.120
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.370
NICK BUTCHER: OK, so I think
that's all we have this week

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.370
on the onboarding experience.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.980
So thanks very much
for joining us.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.140
And as always, I'm your
host, Nick Butcher.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.190
ROMAN NURIK: Roman Nurik.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.710
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.960
See you, guys.
