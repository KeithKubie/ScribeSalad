00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.490
Okay, Michael, you ready?

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.100
&gt;&gt; Alright, what's the answer?

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.110
&gt;&gt; So I was thinking about A before you threw in the B. So let me,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.010
let me not think about B yet. I'll just think about A. So you had said

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.190
in state one, it can go either left or right. And in state four, it can

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.730
go either left or right. So boy, that

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.880
sounds a lot like two times two equals four.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.830
&gt;&gt; Yes that's exactly right. But generally speaking, so actually walk

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.150
me through that again Michael. How did you get two times two?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.360
&gt;&gt; So, well I, I had a little choice about how

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.770
to think about it. One is that in some sense, if you

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.000
go right from one, then you don't really have to make another choice.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.500
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.670
&gt;&gt; But if you go left, then you have this other choice

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.410
to make of either left or right. So it's, you if, if

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.150
you're just writing it down as a mapping from state to action,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.830
you've got two choices at state one, and two choices at state four.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.380
&gt;&gt; Mmhmm.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.310
&gt;&gt; And so that is two times two, right?

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.910
You can make, independently choose each of those.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.790
&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly right. So in

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.450
fact it's important there that even though

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.720
if I can gone right on one, I would never, have to make another choice

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.880
because I can't reach state four. In order to be a strategy, you have

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.800
to basically say what you would do, in all states where you might end up.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.010
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fair.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright so what about B, using that incredible reasoning?

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.320
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah, so B seems a little trickier because

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.320
here it can only ever matter whether you're in like if

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.450
player A sends us down to the left then we have a

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.670
choice of three. If player one sends us down the right, we

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.060
have a choice of one, which is really no choice at all.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.710
&gt;&gt; Mmhmm.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.060
&gt;&gt; You can have any color car you want as long as it's black.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like my Tesla.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.190
&gt;&gt; I was thinking the Model T, but maybe T stands for Tesla.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.670
&gt;&gt; T does stand for Tesla.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.760
&gt;&gt; So, by the definition of how

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.850
many different you know, sort of reachable strategies

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.840
it would be one answer but, if you're defining it the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.550
way you're defining it, it's going to be three times one or, three.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's exactly right. Good Michael.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.230
So, let's actually write down what those strategies are.
