that's my supply which will make sense
 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.320 align:start position:0%

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 align:start position:0%
why he can't use his imagination either
 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
why he can't use his imagination either
because<00:03:22.570><c> he's</c><00:03:22.690><c> already</c><00:03:22.870><c> using</c><00:03:23.620><c> his</c>

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 align:start position:0%
because he's already using his

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 align:start position:0%
though that's what he's doing so it
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
though that's what he's doing so it
would<00:03:31.959><c> make</c><00:03:32.080><c> sense</c><00:03:32.410><c> of</c><00:03:32.590><c> that</c><00:03:32.770><c> anyway</c><00:03:34.050><c> rigueur</c>

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 align:start position:0%
would make sense of that anyway rigueur
