00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.740
Over a 20-year career in post-Civil War New
York, Fredericka “Marm” Mandelbaum is

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.806
estimated to have fenced as much as $10 million
in stolen property (around a quarter of a

00:00:02.806 --> 00:00:03.806
billion dollars when adjusted for inflation).

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:05.480
Sitting at the center of a vast crime web
the spanned large areas of the United States,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.612
Ma Mandelbaum was then known as “the greatest
crime promoter of all time” and “the Queen

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:09.612
of Thieves,” before getting caught red-handed.

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:10.612
Despite this, Marm never spent a day in prison
and lived out her days in luxury.

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:15.860
Emigrating to the United States in about 1850
from Prussia, at the age of 23, Marm and husband

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.050
Wolf Israel Mandelbaum settled in Kleindeutchland
in the Lower East Side.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.870
Struggling for several years as peddlers,
Marm got to know the children who roamed the

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.750
streets, pick-pocketing and looting local
vendors.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.380
Gaining their trust, she soon became what
was much later described as “a female Fagin

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.200
to a team of Artful Dodgers, buying their
wares and reselling them for a profit.”

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.320
Typically never paying more than 20% of a
good’s wholesale value, and with a keen

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.230
eye for estimating, Marm soon had a healthy
savings.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.950
Together with Wolf, said to have been a non-entity
in the whole thing, they opened a dry goods

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.650
store in 1865 at Clinton and Rivington, although
its primary activity was the fencing business

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.460
they ran out of the back.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.500
Reportedly an ugly woman, with Police Commissioner
George Walling describing her as “greasy,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.780
fat, and opulent” and a Pinkerton National
Detective Agency representative stating she

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.410
was a “a gargantuan caricature of Queen
Victoria with her black hair in a roll and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.550
a small bun hat with dropping feathers,”
what she lacked in physical appeal, she certainly

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.260
made up for in shrewd intelligence.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.920
Described as sharp as a tack and an expert
in business, she was also fluent in English

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
and German.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.610
As such, Marm became a favorite among German-speaking
adult thieves, as well as the younger, criminal

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.190
set.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.060
Not content to wait for stolen goods to come
to her, Marm planned, arranged, and bankrolled

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.180
numerous crimes, as well as provided the means
to unload the ill-gotten gains through her

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.771
vast network of thieves, pickpockets, scam
artists, cab drivers, jewelry smiths, police

00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:56.140
officers, and defense attorneys.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.900
Understanding the law, Marm reportedly made
sure she never spoke with more than one crook

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.491
at a time when negotiating a deal- if no one
could corroborate what was said or took place

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:12.030
in a specific meeting, it was simply her word
against theirs, if no physical evidence could

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.030
be recovered.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.370
After Wolf died in 1875, Marm’s criminal
enterprise, as well as her political influence,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.470
continued to grow.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.110
She hobnobbed with New York’s high society,
was friendly with the Thirteenth Ward’s

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.700
police and cultivated relationships with the
judges of the Fifth District Court.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.820
She was even a favorite of the famously corrupt
Tammany Hall.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.940
As the New York Herald noted of her relationship
with the police,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.660
When a man who has lost a $50 watch went to
the police station and offered “$25 and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.990
no questions asked” for its recovery what
could be more profitable for the time consumed

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.610
than for a detective to go to “Mother Braum”
and buy for $15 an identical ticker for which

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.140
the shrewd woman had paid no more than $10?

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.120
To now have to run about among a lot of minor
fences in search of stolen property that once

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.980
could be confidently looked for at the Mandelbaum
place will be very annoying to detectives

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.050
whose habits have become fixed.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.240
It is no wonder that mother Baum had never
before been troubled by detectives.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.060
Shall a man quarrel with his own bread and
butter, particularly when the person who provides

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.810
it gives him occasionally a new dress for
his wife and diamond studs to illuminate his

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.540
own official front?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.180
Realizing that her network was her greatest
asset, Marm is even thought to have opened

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.379
a sort of school for criminals, Grand Street
School, teaching the young how to pickpocket

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.680
and thieve, as well as more seasoned professionals
how to burgle, crack safes, blackmail and

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.040
run various fraudulent schemes.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.600
Among her web of shady friends, Marm counted
the “Napoleon of Crime,” international

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.560
art thief, Adam Worth, and one of the most
famous grifters in history, Sophie Lyons.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.720
Other unscrupulous associates included Queen
Liz, Big Mary, Kid Glove Rose, Black Lena

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.480
Kleinschmidt and Old Mother Hubbard.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.519
Paranoid and prepared, Marm insisted that
sellers remain present and in her sight throughout

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.349
any transaction, and money only ever exchanged
hands after she had the stolen goods safely

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.550
in her possession.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.989
When she went out, one of her children acted
as a lookout, and she was usually accompanied

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.509
by the large Mr. Herman Stoude, her most trusted
confidant, who handled her heavy work.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.569
At home, among other hidey holes, she had
a chimney with a false back hooked up to a

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.620
dumbwaiter for hiding loot.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.699
Through it all, her own hands remained seemingly
clean, despite the efforts of the incorruptible

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.300
members of the police to catch her at something.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.400
As Police Commissioner George Walling stated,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.490
As a handler of stolen goods Marm Mandelbaum
has no peer in the United States…

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.499
We even hired rooms on the opposite side of
the street from her store for the purpose

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:48.749
of obtaining such evidence as would lead to
her arrest and conviction as a receiver of

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:49.779
stolen goods.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.520
Mrs Mandelbaum is a very sharp woman, however,
and is not often caught napping.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.509
Whenever she buys goods off thieves she appoints
a place of meeting where she can confer without

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.520
suspicion.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.129
She will not allow them to come to her store
under any consideration.

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.289
To handle criminal charges, Marm kept the
law firm of Howe &amp; Hummell on retainer (with

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.520
an annual retainer of $5,000, approximately
$100,000 today) and maintained a defense fund

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.360
for her associates who were otherwise unable
to pay their own legal fees.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.199
Of course, putting up these funds for their
defense not only helped keep some of her best

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.320
thieves out of prison, making sure they were
out making her money, but also earned their

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.099
gratitude and a tidy profit in that they were
required to pay the funds back at a premium,

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.430
giving her an extra measure of control over
their future actions.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.680
Finally fed up with the failures of the local
police to catch this well-known criminal at

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.169
anything illegal, in 1884 the New York District
Attorney, Peter Olson, hired the famous Pinkerton

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.740
Detective Agency to pierce Marm’s criminal
veil.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.599
Using the alias Stein, Pinkerton’s Gustave
Frank was able to trick Marm into fencing

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.139
stolen silk that had been marked.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.979
After she received it, but before she could
pass it on, Marm’s property was raided,

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.330
and she, Stoude and her son, Julius, were
arrested.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.219
During the raid, it was noted that in her
personal stash, “There seemed to be enough

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.319
clothes to supply an army.

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.210
There were trunks filled with precious gems
and silverware.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.719
Antique furniture was stacked against a wall.”

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:20.930
And that, “It did not seem possible that
so much wealth could be assembled in one spot.”

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.279
After being arrested, Marm issued an official
statement,

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.939
I keep a dry goods store, and have for twenty
years past.

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.740
I buy and sell dry goods as other dry goods
people do.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.990
I have never knowingly bought stolen goods.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.689
Neither did my son Julius.

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:37.490
I have never stolen anything in my life.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.619
I feel that these charges are brought against
me for spite.

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:43.770
I have never bribed the police, nor had their
protection…

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.999
I and my son are innocent of these charges,
so help me God!

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:52.619
Though the authorities were initially hesitant
to let her go, through significant effort

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:59.589
by her attorneys, Marm was ultimately released
on a bail of a whopping $100,000 (about $2.7

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.020
million today).

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.499
She was, however, followed at all times, with
detectives setting up shop across the street

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:08.029
from her home and tailing her if she left.

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.619
The New York Herald reported the scene at
the day of her trial,

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:14.839
Rows and rows of stiff backed, rusty seats
were crowded with people who had come to see

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:19.580
Mother Mandelbaum, the protectress of thieves,
brought to the bar of justice.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.089
There were bankers and bank burglars elbowing
each other in the eager chattering throng.

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:27.889
Bewhiskered policemen and dusty old-court
loungers were jammed together.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:33.429
Lawyers, actors, pickpockets, clergymen, merchants
and clerks by the score strained and jostled

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:36.409
and whispered in the most democratic fashion.

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:41.699
And in the midst of it all sat lawyer Howe
with his legs crossed and a look of peace

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.080
in his eyes.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.099
There were only three empty chairs in the
courtroom and when one man tried to take one

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:50.620
he was smartly told it was for one of the
defendants.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.649
Detective Frank and Pinkerton lolled sleepily
in their chairs.

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:57.659
The District Attorney and his assistants were
brimming with enthusiasm.

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:00.810
But yet the lawyer with sparkling diamonds
looked happy.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.389
Nor could all the detectives and District
Attorney’s disturb the beautiful serenity

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:07.319
of his rosy countenance.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:10.909
The Herald then reported what happened next
when the court was called to order,

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:13.219
Lawyer Howe arose and looked around the court
carefully.

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:18.099
His eyebrows went higher and higher up his
peaceful brow as his gaze wandered back to

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:20.590
the troubled visage of District Attorney.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.110
Then a very red hand, that glimmered and shone
with jeweled gold, was swung on high.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.809
“I am forced to confess that the defendants
are not here,” he said.

00:08:28.809 --> 00:08:31.279
“No, they are not.”

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:34.750
Marm and her co-defendants had managed to
slip the noose.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.750
How?

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.770
Rumor had it that she paid off her neighbor,
who had rented the house to the detectives,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.550
to keep her informed of the detectives’
comings and goings.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.460
At an opportune moment, she supposedly used
a decoy of herself in the form of one of her

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.570
servants to impersonate her.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.490
Once the detective on duty was off following
the decoy, she vacated her home, reportedly

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.140
managing to smuggle about $1,000,000 (about
$27 million today) along with her.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.190
Whether this is really how she managed her
escape, she did elude the detectives who were

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:06.000
supposed to be tracking her every move and
subsequently turned up in Ontario, Canada,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.230
where she purchased a large home and set up
shop selling women’s clothing and certain

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.180
fine items, living an apparently crime-free
life from that point on.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.520
Of course, she was tried twice while in Canada
for smuggling lace and jewellery (many items

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.280
in her store were reportedly imported from
New York at a bargain), but in both instances

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.650
managed to be acquitted.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.800
Unsuccessful efforts were also made to lure
her back across the border by undercover police

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.080
officers looking to purchase such things as
diamonds from her.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.480
(The authorities knew well where she was;
she never hid her whereabouts.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.340
But there was little they could do to get
her back to the U.S. where she could be arrested,

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.010
despite their sincerest efforts.)

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.460
Marm frequently lamented having to remain
in Canada, even to the media, and implored

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.970
her legal team at Howe &amp; Hummell to try and
find a way to allow her to come back to the

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.530
U.S. without risk of her being sent to prison.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:58.780
Marm also reportedly confided to a friend
that she “would gladly forfeit every penny

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.860
of my wealth in order to once again breathe
freely the atmosphere of the 13th Ward.”

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.280
However, there were occasional rumors of Marm
being sighted in New York, particularly when

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.050
her daughter, Anna, fell seriously ill and
died.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.430
It’s not surprising from all this that when
she died in February of 1894, some at the

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.710
time thought she must have faked her own death
to allow her to return to the U.S. under a

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:51.290
new identity, with no one now looking for
the deceased Marm Mandelbaum.
