00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through the answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I run this program, we start out with x being 0,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and then this while loop says as long as True is true, keep incrementing x.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So now x is 1, it's 2, it's 3, it's 4, it's 5,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we never actually get to this line about the print.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So does this program print 0? Not so much.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Control flow goes here, here, here, then back,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and we stay in this while loop forever.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It doesn't print out this huge number 4,294,967,296,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is, I think, pretty close to, let's say, 2 to the 32.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is a reasonable guess if you think,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
"Oh, the integer is going to max out at some value based on computer hardware." But no.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There's a thought that it raises an exception.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Some badly made Python interpreters might raise an exception on this, but it should not.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we had lots of computing resources, this would run forever.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And similarly, it also never prints out -1.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The correct answer is none of these things. It loops forever.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
All right. So if this program naturally loops forever and we're writing an interpreter

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that exactly simulates this program by following all of its steps,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
our interpreter is also going to loop forever.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If someone had written this program in JavaScript

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and put it in the middle of a web page, our web browser would loop forever

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and never actually render the resulting web page.
