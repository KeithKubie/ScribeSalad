00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.500
I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but all of our discussions about ethics so far have had one thing in common: God.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:24.680
Divine Command Theory, for example, argues that what’s good, and what’s not, are determined by a deity, whether that’s the God of Abraham, or a panoply of gods who come up with ethical rules by committee.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.360
And the Theory of Natural Law, as advanced by Thomas Aquinas, says that morality comes from us but only because we were made by God, who preloaded us with moral sensibilities.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.320
But many other thinkers have argued that humanity’s moral code doesn’t come from some supernatural force.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.020
18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, for one, thought religion and morality were a terrible pairing, and if anything, the two should be kept apart.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.460
Instead, Kant argued, in order to determine
what’s right, you have to use reason.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.640
And a sense of consideration for other people.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.920
And – at least the way I’m teaching it
today – chom-choms.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:07.720
[Theme Music]

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.000
Kant took morality pretty seriously, and he thought we should, too – all of us – regardless of our religious beliefs, or lack thereof.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.420
Because, he knew that if we look to religion for our morality, we’re not all going to get the same answer.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.409
But he thought morality was a constant, in
an almost mathematical sense.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.330
Two plus two equals four, whether you’re
a Christian, Buddhist, or atheist.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.500
And for Kant, the same went for moral truths.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.080
But he made a distinction between the things we ought to do morally, and the things we ought to do for other, non-moral reasons.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.179
He pointed out that, most of the time, whether or not we ought to do something isn’t really a moral choice – instead, it’s just contingent on our desires.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.319
Like, if your desire is to get money, then
you ought to get a job.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.299
If your desire is get an A in class, then
you ought to study.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.539
Kant called these if-then statements hypothetical
imperatives.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.959
They’re commands that you should follow
if you want something.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.380
But hypothetical imperatives are about prudence,
rather than morality.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.280
So, if you don’t want money, you can always
choose not to work.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.040
And if you don’t care about getting a good
grade, studying becomes totally optional!

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.060
It’d be a terrible option, in my opinion
as an educator, but still: optional.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.511
But Kant viewed morality not in terms of hypothetical imperatives, but through what he called categorical imperatives.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.180
These are commands you must follow, regardless
of your desires.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.120
Categorical imperatives are our moral obligations, and Kant believed that they’re derived from pure reason.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.300
He said it didn’t matter whether you want to be moral or not – the moral law is binding on all of us.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:42.920
And he said you don’t need religion to determine what that law is, because what’s right and wrong is totally knowable just by using your intellect.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.020
OK, so how do you figure out what’s moral?

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.880
Kant said the categorical imperative can be
understood in terms of various formulations.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.840
Basically, different ways of phrasing or looking
at the same essential idea.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.049
And he came up with four formulations of the
categorical imperative.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.111
Let me tell you about the two most popular
ones.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.140
The first formulation of the categorical imperative
is often known as the universalizability principle.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.880
And Kant phrased it this way:

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.700
“Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.”

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.239
OK, Kant. Pretty wordy guy.
So let’s unpack what he was saying.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.180
A maxim is just a rule or principle of action.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.090
And a universal law is something that must
always be done in similar situations.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.709
So, as a Kantian, before I act, I would ask
myself, what’s the maxim of my action?

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.109
In other words, what’s the general rule that stands behind the particular action I’m considering?

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.480
Let’s say you forgot your wallet in your
dorm this morning.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.689
You don’t have time to go get it between
classes, and you’re really hungry.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:48.029
You notice that the student working the snack kiosk in the union is engrossed in a conversation, and you could easily snag a banana and be on your way.

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.009
Sorry. Chom-chom.
I mean: chom-chom.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.189
You could easily swipe that chom-chom and
be on your way.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.040
Is it ok, morally, for you to do this?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.720
Well, the particular action you’re considering – taking a chom-chom from a merchant without paying for it – is stealing.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.859
And if you approve the maxim of stealing – which you’re doing, whether you admit it or not – then what you’re actually doing is universalizing that action.

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.329
You’re saying that everyone should always
steal.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.319
If you should be able to do it, then – everyone
should be able to do it.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.850
The thing is, this leads to a contradiction
– and remember:

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.410
Kant’s wording specifically says that moral
actions cannot bring about contradictions.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.000
The contradiction here is: no one would say
that everyone should steal all the time.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.240
Because, if everyone should always steal,
then you should steal the chom-chom.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.400
And then I should steal it back from you, and then you should steal it back from me, and it would never end and no one would ever get to eat any chom choms.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.800
Therefore, stealing isn’t universalizable.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.640
So what Kant’s really saying is that it’s
not fair to make exceptions for yourself.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.800
You don’t really think stealing is ok, and by imagining what it would be like to universalize it, that becomes clear.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.830
Now, Kant’s view that moral rules apply
to everyone equally sounds nice and fair.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.830
But it can sometimes lead to some pretty counterintuitive results.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.620
To see how this formulation can go awry, let’s
visit the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.160
Let’s say, one morning, Elvira and Tony
are having breakfast.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.080
Then a stranger comes to the door and asks
where Tony is, so he can kill him.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.980
Obviously, Elvira’s impulse is to lie, and say that Tony isn’t around right now in order to protect him from this would-be murderer.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.280
But Kant says that she can’t lie – not
ever, not even to save Tony’s life.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.480
Here’s his reasoning:

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.100
Suppose she’s at the front door, talking
to the stranger.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.470
At the time, she thinks Tony’s in the kitchen,
where she left him.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.460
But it turns out he was curious about the caller, so he followed her into the living room, and heard the stranger make his threats.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.060
Fearing for his life, Tony slipped out the
back door.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.380
Meanwhile Elvira, in her desire to save him, tells the stranger that Tony isn’t there, even though she thinks he is.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.940
Based on her lie, the stranger leaves, and runs into Tony as he rounds the corner heading away from the house, and kills him.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.700
Had she told the truth, the stranger might have headed into the kitchen looking for Tony, which would have given Tony time to escape.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.780
But she didn’t.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.280
Now, by Kant’s reasoning, Elvira is responsible
for Tony’s death, because her lie caused it.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.340
Had she told the truth, only the murderer would have been responsible for any deaths that might have occurred.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.080
Now, she could have refused to answer the
stranger altogether, or tried to talk him out of it.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.720
But the one thing she is never permitted to do is violate the moral law, even if others are doing so, even for a really good cause.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.140
Poor Tony. Very sad.
But thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.480
So, the first formulation of the categorical imperative is about the universality of our actions.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.240
But the second formulation focuses on how
we should treat other people.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.530
And it goes this way:

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:38.330
“Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end, and never as a mere means.”

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.580
Again, we have to define some terms here to
figure out what this is all about.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.240
To use something as a “mere means” is to use it only for your own benefit, with no thought to the interests or benefit of the thing you’re using.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.520
Now, we use things as mere means all the time.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.480
I use this mug to hold my coffee, and if it would stop benefiting me – like if it got a crack in it and started leaking, I wouldn’t use it anymore.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.140
It’s perfectly fine to use things as mere
means – but not humans.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.440
This is because we are what Kant called ends-in-ourselves.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.980
We are not mere objects that exist to be used
by others.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.780
We’re our own ends.
We’re rational and autonomous.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.720
We have the ability to set our own goals,
and work toward them.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.060
Coffee mugs exist for coffee drinkers.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.860
Humans exist for themselves.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:31.860
So, to treat someone as an end-in-herself means to recognize the humanity of the person you’re encountering, to realize that she has goals, values, and interests of her own, and you must, morally, keep that in mind in your encounters with her.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.000
Now, Kant pointed out that we do use people,
all the time, and that’s ok.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.830
Because, most of time time, we use other people
as a means for something, but not as a mere means.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.510
We still recognize their humanity when we
use them, and they agree to being used.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.130
So, for example, you are using me right now
to get information about Kantian ethics.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.890
I am using Nick and Nicole to help me get
that information to you.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:08:00.880
Kant said that you and I, and Nick and Nicole – we all we deserve to not be used as mere means, because of our autonomy.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.260
Unlike other things in the world, we’re
self-governed.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.460
We’re able to set our own ends, to make our own free decisions based on our rational wills.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.960
We can set goals for ourselves, and take steps
to realize those goals.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:21.040
This imbues us with an absolute moral worth, Kant said, which means that we shouldn’t be manipulated, or manipulate other autonomous agents for our own benefit.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.040
And this means that things like lying and
deception are never OK.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:32.400
Because if I’m being deceived, I can’t make an autonomous decision about how to act, because my decision is based on false information.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.659
For instance, I might agree to loan you money so you can buy books for school, but I wouldn’t agree to loan you money so that you can get a new Xbox.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.020
I’m sorry, but no.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:46.580
So when you lie to me about what you’re gonna be doing with the money you’re asking for, you rob me of my ability to autonomously decide to help you.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:52.320
You’ve treated me as a mere means to accomplish your goals, with no thought to my own goals and interests.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.840
And that’s a violation of Kant’s second
categorical imperative.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:05.640
So! Kant argued that proper, rational application of the categorical imperative will lead us to moral truth that is fixed and applicable to all moral agents.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.180
No God required.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.540
Of course, not everyone agreed with him.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.900
So next time we’re going to check out a theory that is in many ways the antithesis of Kantianism: utilitarianism.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.060
Today we learned about Kant’s ethics.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:28.640
We talked about hypothetical and categorical imperatives, the universalizability principle, autonomy, and what it means to treat people as ends-in-themselves, rather than as mere means.
