00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.590
&gt;&gt; All right, all right.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.010
I think that you're
ready for our next author

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.350
because Miss Agra Deedy
has written a book called

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.430
"The Rooster Who Would
Not Be Quiet."

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.820
She was born in Havana, Cuba.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.670
And when she was still a kid,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.750
she moved with her family
to the United States.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.520
They moved here as refugees.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.510
They settled in Decatur, Georgia,
which is where she lives today.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.590
Carmen grew up loving stories.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.190
In fact, she has said,
I cannot remember a time

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.210
when I did not love stories.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.170
One of her favorite books as
a child was "Charlotte's Web."

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.250
And Kate Dicamillo talked about
"Charlotte's Web" earlier today.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.300
That's a common theme.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.550
Because she has a deep
love for animals.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.620
And her latest book combines
that love for animals

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.610
with her superb storytelling and
a message of bravery and courage.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.530
Miss Deedy will sign copies of
her book from 1:30 to 2:30 PM.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.510
Please allow me to introduce
Miss Carmen Agra Deedy.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.060
[ Applause ]

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670
&gt;&gt; Carmen Agra Deedy: They're
the ones that make us sound good.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.000
Thank you so much.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.300
Hola.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.340
&gt;&gt; Multiple Speakers: Hola.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.640
&gt;&gt; Carmen Agra Deedy: That
was kind of pitiful, people.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.000
Hola.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.600
&gt;&gt; Multiple Speakers: Hola.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.640
&gt;&gt; Carmen Agra Deedy: And I grew up
in the South, so it's hola y'all.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.840 position:56%
When I was a little girl, I came to
the little town of Decatur, Georgia.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.790
And I know you all just heard
that bit, but if you didn't, well,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.760 position:56%
it bears repeating because it was,
as for many refugees and immigrants,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.110
it can be a very interesting
childhood.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.530
It's like when the Hmong
refugee end up in like Wisconsin.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.770
Well, Cubans in Decatur, Georgia.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.940
When I was 6 years
old, I started school.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.850
And I want to tell you just about
that much about that experience.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.080
I remember my mother
braiding my hair.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.870
And when I was done,
[foreign language spoken].

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.070
Why I got go to go
to stinking school?

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.610
I'm just fine right here.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.360
How you going to do
stuff without me, huh?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.810
Because I was my mother's helper.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.110
And my mother said,
[foreign language spoken].

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.810
You don't have to help me;
you have to help yourself.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.690
You have to go to school.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.890
[Foreign language spoken],
needs no translation.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.910
And then we walked, we
walked the block and a half,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.850
down the broken old sideways,
which every town had back then,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.600
along a line of sweet poplars
and up the tired, well,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.260
they were stone steps,
but they were worn.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.180
Other reluctant leather soled shoes
had preceded mine by many decades.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.910
When we walked in,
we took a hard right.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.280
The old water fountain, had
the rust stain down the middle,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.400
black and white checkered linoleum.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.780
And there standing next to a
door, this is the boring part,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.130
stay with me, was a enormous door.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.890
There were construction
paper autumn leaves.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.150 position:56%
The sentinel that stood by this door
was a long woman, kind of gamey,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.130
hair sprayed into a
perfect football helmet.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.370
It was 1966.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.270
She was beautifully upholstered
like a couch in oak or tweed,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.000
kitten heels, Agnes Scott ring.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.650
I didn't know what it was at
the time, but I would learn.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.030
And when she greeted us, she
greeted us in the dulcet tones,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.770
so familiar in that time.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.520
Well, how are you, Miss Carmen?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.270 position:56%
We're so glad you're here, precious.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.890
The whole class is going
to learn about Cuba today.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.190
My mother looked at me, this
is [foreign word spoken].

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.680
You can't leave me here.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.130
You don't even know this woman.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.720
My mother was mortified.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.460
I am so sorry.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.760
Let me talk to her for a moment.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.700
And then my mom pulled me
over to that water fountain.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.060
Listen to me.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.400
I'm listening to you.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.260
[Foreign language spoken],
you behave yourself

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.530 position:56%
and do not make the nice lady crazy,

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.690
which opened up a whole
world of possibility.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.000
And then my mother
squeezed my hands.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.320
And that's when I realized that
her hands were as moist as my own.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.850
She kissed the top of my head
and said, I will be back at 3:00.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.150
You better.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.340
And then, as she walked away,
she called back, I love you.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.130
I can tell.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.430
And she was gone.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.180
Click, click, click, click.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.630
And I turned back.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.990
Don't worry, sugar,
said my new teacher.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.290
You're going to love it here.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.410
I don't think so.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.160
This didn't look promising to me.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.460
I knew home.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.760
I knew my mother.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.060
I was a kid who was refugeed at 3.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.750
I wasn't big on change.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.080
My new teacher, back then,
they didn't have ESL.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.820
They didn't prepare teachers
for this sort of thing.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.700
Student and teacher,
it was sink or swim.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.410
And there were a lot of drownings.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.420
She leaned low and said,
Carmen, now prepare yourself.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.660
And that's when I figured I'd
better stop this right now.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.830
Some of you children know
sometimes you just have

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.160
to get straightened out, you know,
everything out from the get go,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.460
as they say in the South.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.190
And I talked to my teacher
and I said, wait, wait,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.060
wait, lady, listen, listen.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.360
My name is not lady.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.660
You're not a lady?

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.140
No, I am a lady, but
my name is not lady.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.310
My name is Miss Burns.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.150
It was marvelous that she could
get that much air in her mouth

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.070
and it would synthesize
in such a strange way.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.410
And I said, Miss Burns.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.710
No, Burns.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.010
Burns. Never mind.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.310 position:56%
See, that's the problem right there.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.000
That's what I was trying
to tell you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.390
Carmen, we don't -- No see, Miss
Burns, my name is not Carmen.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.690
It's Carmen.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:55.960
Those little pencil thin eyebrows
flew up like little apostrophes.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.990 position:56%
She tried to run her fingers through
her hair, but it'd been like,

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.970
you know, it was like a helmet.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.540
And she shook herself for a moment
as if to shake out the confusion.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.560
And then this marvelous woman took
a deep breath, worried her lip

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.920
for a minute, leaned low.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.720
I could smell the evening in Paris.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.770
And she said, putting that
Spanish name in her southern mouth.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.610
It's a true story, so I'm so sorry.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.150
Things are going to happen
the way they'd happened.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.360
Carmen. You got hair in your nose.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.660
She straightened up.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.960
I think I heard her garter snap.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.840
And she said, that's
enough, Miss Carmen.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.290
My mama uses the little scissors.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.590
That's enough.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.890
I don't need to hear
what your mother said.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.190
Give me your hand.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.800
She took my hand, this
wonderful woman,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.300 position:56%
and we walked into first grade with
all the attendant sights and smells.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.170
There was a blackboard that was.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.820
There were enormous windows, and
those windows had deep seals.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.350
They would soon hold
little paper cups with seeds

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.530
that would never ever grow.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.340
There was a coat closet.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.560
There were chairs in tidy rows,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.300
and there was an enormous
ocean of a desk.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.350
And next to it, a little tiny desk.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.040
All the children watched.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.220
This is 1966 for those of
you who know your history.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.770
They weren't sure what
to do with us.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.750
So they sort of just
let us wander in

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.750
and they'd figure out
where to put us.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.970
The children looked at me.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.020
I looked at them.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.320
Can I go home now?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.250
Stop. Girls and boys,
this is our new student.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.550
I told you about her today.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.250
Remember, we talked about Cuba.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.730
We were late, of course, which is
why the other children had already

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.110 position:56%
learned about me before I'd arrived.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.260
And for those of you that are more
politically correct than I am,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.820
I have to tell you,
I love my people,

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.850
but we tell time by a sundial.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.150
And so, it was no surprise

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.670
that by the time I
arrived, an hour had passed.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.510
And all the children
were expecting me.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.210
And when she had me
introduce myself,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.890
my name is Carmen, I
saw their lips move.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.590
Now what do we do?

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.890
Follow me.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.150
Go back to your work, please.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.080
I wrote on the board
what I want you to copy.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.380
Continue your work.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.680
They all had D'Nealian paper.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.980
It was standard issue.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.310
Still is in a lot of schools.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.860
We went to her desk.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:27.390
And as she pointed to my new place
in the classroom, I didn't like it.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.700
Children, sometimes you
just have to speak up.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.040
Excuse me.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.720
Excuse me, Miss Burns.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.020
What's wrong?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.420
How come I got to sit over here?

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.950
That's your desk for a while,
until you get used to class.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.900
Yeah, but how come all the other
kids are sitting over there?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.770
I love codes.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.540
Well, darling, because
you're special.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.840
That means I'm stupid.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.600
No, we don't use that
word in first grade.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.210
Can we use it -- No,
we don't use it at all.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.330 position:56%
See, the kids are laughing and
y'all are like, oh, she said stupid.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.220
And look, the kids up here,
they're like, oh, yeah.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.520
They love that word.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.390
It's a horrible word,
but they love it.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.350
Sometimes they pick
it up like a rock.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.200
I looked at my teacher and
said, but it doesn't --

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.280
And then she just seemed
so frustrated.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.520 position:56%
She did everything but pearl clutch.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.350
And then she said two words.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.250
And girls and boys and big
people, I mean, you're here too,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:27.510
but you're sort of -- Well,
you're incidental to this story.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.480
She said, Overton Crooms.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.740
I thought she was cursing.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.960
And then a boy jumped up out of the
front row, and he was a big kid.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.310
He'd seen first grade
more than once.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.970
This boy had tenure.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.350
He had overalls on.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.080
His hair was slick bad.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.760
He had on a pair of work boots,
and he kind of ambled over

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.160
and he said, yes ma'am, Miss Burns.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.200
Please take this desk and
put it in front of your own.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.740
Thank you very much.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.040
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.510
He looked at me and
went, and I went ha ha.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.810
He's cute.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.730
He put the desk down.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.030
I sat down.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.330
Miss Burns started to speak.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.900
And as soon as she began to
speak, I couldn't hear anything

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.460
because phonemes for
me were never clear.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.780
So remember Charlie Brown?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.490
Well, that's the way
I heard language.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.080
I'm an aural dyslexic.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.220
It would be another -- I was
28 before I was diagnosed.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.930
All I knew is I couldn't
understand her.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:30.300 position:56%
And meanwhile, next to my right ear,
a voice had grown quite intimate.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.920
Hey, girl.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.190
What? Girl, say your name again.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.640
What? Your name, fool.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.410
Say your name again.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.280
Carmen. I heard him.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.980
And I said, oh yeah,
say your name again.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.800
This boy goes Overton Crooms.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.100
Yeah, you laughing at me?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.400
I don't think so.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.490
Rather than be offended,
he did what you just did.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.790
He started to snort and laugh.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.710
And I looked over and his
shoulders were down on the desk

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.410
and he was jiggling up and down.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.190
And by now, guess whose
attention we'd garnered?

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.760
This is storytelling,
the interactive art.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.130
That is not rhetorical.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.980
Who is coming our way,
do you suppose?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.590
Miss Burns.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.460
Oh, yes, yes, with those
long, stork-like legs.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.170
She is cutting right
across the classroom.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.150 position:56%
And she is shouting, Miss Agra, Mr.
Crooms, is there something you would

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.580
like to share with
the rest of the class.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:33.720
Now you people know the answer
to that, which is no, nothing.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.510
You would not have survived
in Miss Burns' first grade,

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.810
let me just tell you right now.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.990
But see, Overton knew
because, like I said,

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.600
he was a veteran of first grade.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.900
He didn't say a word.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.200
What do I say?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.500
Oh, no. We doing fine.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.050
You go back to doing
whatever you was doing.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.250
I was air born, gently, of course.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.590
She took me by the elbow.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.950
She marched me outside.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.550
She sat me in a little chair.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.130
How she knew, I don't know.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.400
It seemed to have just
been waiting for me.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.340
And she said, you sit out here,
you think about what you've done.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.640
Children, when I was a child,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.790
parents loved to say
things like that to us.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.460
And you know when you've done
something kind of rotten,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.960
but you really enjoyed it?

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.550
They shouldn't tell you that.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.740
I sat in my chair and I began
to sing because I was bored.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.720
And I'd just recently seen
a movie about Cinderella

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.470
in our black and white console.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.900
And so, in my Cuban accent, I song,
in my own little corner, in my --

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.310
Inside the classroom, a voice
said, most sternly, no singing.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.600
[ Humming ]

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.900
No humming.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.840
[ Whistling ]

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.760
She was out there and
on me in a tick.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.560
She lifted me out of that
chair and she said, children,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.420
we're going outside,
which is what they did

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.400
when they didn't want to kill you.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.700
And so, she gathered
up these first graders.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.420
And we tried to make a
line, but we couldn't.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.720
We were a herd of cats.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.890
And so, she finally, in some form
of a herd, she got us outside.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.270
And we went out to the playground,

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.750
which was an amazing thing
back then, the playground.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.860
In Georgia, it was
packed red Georgia clay

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.230
that would kill a child.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.130
And on top of this, they put
metal playground equipment.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.750
And on that equipment, the children
played, and some of them didn't.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.050
It was Darwinian.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.780
If you survived the
playground, you deserved to live

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.480
and your line would go on.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.700
If not, like the Carruthers,
you went down on the monkey bars

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.760
and they never saw you again.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.060
Look at the kids.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.540
They're like, is that true.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.140
No, well. All the girls
went this way.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.090
All the boys went that
way, and I was by myself

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.390
because I looked funny,
I talked funny,

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.690
and my mother dressed me funny.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.990
That's what happens to refugees.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.290
Don't for feel sorry for me.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.590
My life turned out okay.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.290
Meanwhile, back in the
story, hello, tree.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.540
You are my friend and
I shall call you tree.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.600
Because, right, like we
make friends where we can.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.900
So who sashays up?

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.060
He was a sashayer from
way back, Overton.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.050
It's a thing, sashay.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.190
He said, arms akimbo.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.950
Great word, akimbo, right.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.470
Hope you're listening
for these words.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.830
What you doing hugging that tree.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.520
You look like a idiot.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.090
He was plain spoken.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.390
I said, it's my friend.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.690
Just stop that.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.480
Stop it. How come you ain't
playing with them girls.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.300
Well, I wasn't about to
tell him they didn't ask me.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.480
Please, a little pride.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.550
I don't want to.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.850
They didn't ask you, huh?

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.480
You got nothing else to do kid?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.540
And then he told me that he
was going to teach me something

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.300
and every kid on that playground
was going to want to play

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.600
with me, the girls anyway.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.900
Oh yeah, right.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.200
You got fairy dust?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.500
I got something better.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.800
Follow me.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.100
I followed him.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.280 position:56%
Went around behind the sycamore
tree and he said, put your hands up.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.980
And I said, whoa, it's a hold up.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.200
No. He didn't live in
my neighborhood clearly.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.500
Those are free.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:54.790
And he started to sing, in
dulcet southern tones, see,

00:14:54.790 --> 00:15:00.560
see my playmate, come
out and play with me,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.120
and bring your dollies three.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.980
Climb up my apple tree.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.280
Do you remember it?

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.580
Slide down -- Come on.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.570
Slide down my rain barrel
onto my cellar floor.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.130
And we'll be -- what?

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.670
Jolly friends forever more, more.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.990
Oh, man, it took about 20
times, but I learned it.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.640
See, see my playmate.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.000
What are you doing?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.300
You don't dance.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.600
It's the way of my people, baby.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.340
Finally, he just said
go get them, get them.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.640
Well, I ran down there.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.940
I found those girls.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.240
I taught them see, see my playmate.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.230
And they played with one another.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.170
Hey, I can play.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.000
I taught you.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.300
I marched right back.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.600
Hello, tree.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.100
What happened?

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.710
I shrugged.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.010
He scratched the back of his head.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.530
Now it hasn't occurred
to me at this point,

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.900
and it probably most likely
hasn't occurred to you

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.450 position:56%
as you hear this story, to think why
Overton isn't playing with the boys.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.370
Well, you see, the two border
dwellers had found one another.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.240
And he said, want to
go on the monkey bars.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.070
Monkey, no, no, [foreign
language spoken].

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.910
I don't even know what you
just said, but come on.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.220
It's fun. Well, the monkey
bars were on the far end

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.870
of the playground, near the woods.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.310
There was another place to play.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.640
Half the time, we didn't come
back and they never looked for us.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.950
I know. I'm sorry, children.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.590
You will never experience
a feral childhood.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.220
And I for one want to
apologize to you for that.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.520
You all should clap.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.920
Do you remember feral
childhood, people?

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.700
You'd come home when the
streetlights come on.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.760
We hoped you lived.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.950
Well, we were out there
and we were swinging

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.470
on the monkey bars
and it's fabulous.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.110
And I have like three
minutes to close up,

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.150
so let me tell you what happened.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.000
We never heard the eternal call
of teachers, [clapping] right.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.500
Even back in the dark ages when
the stones were soft, kids,

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.460
when I was kid, that
was how they called you.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.760
Well, it was the first
day of school.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.060
I didn't know, and
Overton didn't care.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.940
And so, Mr. Overton, Miss Carmen.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.570
Now we're down to Miss first
names and Mr. first names.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:07.870
We fell to the ground.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.170
I lost a shoe.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.470
I was digging around for it.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.280
She stood in front, towered
really, casting a long shadow.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.240
Miss Carmen, did you
hear me calling you?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.800
Well, I didn't know
what to say, y'all.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.690
I figured I'd just use a strategy

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.330
that had worked for
my mother before.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.810
I think you'll understand.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.120
I don't speak no English.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.710
I thought I saw her laughing.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.590
She just bit down on her tongue
and she said, move, move.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.730
And she gave me a little
shove, none too gentle.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.970
And as I walked away, ran
really, I heard over my shoulder,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.270
so wonderful, and you Mr.
Overton, what is your excuse.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:51.310
And that precious boy said, I
don't speak no English neither.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.970
And there were two little chairs
outside Miss Burns' classroom

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.270
that afternoon.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.570
It was wonderful.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.070
I even taught him in my own
little corner, in my own.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.880
Why am I telling you this story?

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.800
Because it's a story.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.880
It's a story about
voice, the irrepressible,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.440
exhausting voices children
can have, the voice all of us

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.160
in this room once had, the ones
many of us buried long ago.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.450
And in the name of
civilization, I'm all for it.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:27.050
We wouldn't have the grand
buildings, the laws, the civility.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.930
But there's something else
that comes with voice.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:34.390
Do you remember when
it was strong and true?

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.930
Who would you be if you hadn't
become the person everyone

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.830
around you eventually
believed you were?

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.950
What would you speak?

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.250
What would you dream?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.050
My new book, "The Rooster
Who Would Not Be Quiet,"

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.380
is about a little village who,

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.010
for reasons that seem
practical, outlawed singing.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.250
It became very quiet, until a noisy
little rooster who knew nothing

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.420
of their laws, as most children
don't when they first arrive

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:09.330
into our civilized society, he
began to sing qui-qui-ri-qui.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.560
And he never lost his voice.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.320
So here's the thing.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.330
If you have it, keep it.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.870
If you lost it, be of strong heart.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.680
It's never gone.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.590
It's still in there.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.600
And to say goodbye, please say
with me, on the count of three,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.330
qui-qui-ri-qui, Spanish
onomatopoeia for cock a doodle doo.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.680
One two three, qui-qui-ri-qui.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.980
Check out my new book.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.560
I won't tell you the end, but
children, the rooster turns

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.510
out all right in the end.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.970
[ Applause ]

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.850
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
