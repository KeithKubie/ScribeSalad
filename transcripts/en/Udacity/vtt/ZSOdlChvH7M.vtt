00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.482
I'm going to get you started on this
problem, and then I want you to finish it

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:07.398
out. I have 2/5 of a candy bar. I need to
share it with three others and myself, so

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.839
I'm really sharing it among four people.
So I take 2/5 and divide it by 4.

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:14.773
Remember, you need to change something
here. When we divide by a number we could

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:18.136
do the same thing as multiply by the
reciprocal. So we're going to have 2/5

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:21.791
times 1/4. Okay. You finish this one now.
