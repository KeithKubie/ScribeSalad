00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.149
Astronomers have it pretty easy when we talk
to the public. I may be biased, but I think

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.590
astronomy is the most beautiful of all sciences.
Sure, other fields of science have lots of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
eye candy, but all I have to do is pull out
a shot of Saturn, and I win. Because Saturn.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.840
It’s ALL gorgeous. Planets, moons, stars,
clusters…but of all of them, you just can’t

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.690
beat a nebula. Why?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.030
Because nebulae.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.020
“Nebula” is Latin for “cloud” and
for once in astronomy we have a name that

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.630
actually describes the object accurately.
Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust in space.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.940
I’ve already talked about them a bit. For
example, stars form from nebulae; our Sun

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.170
did 4.6 billion years or so ago. When a medium-sized
star dies, it blows off winds of gas, then

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.379
lights them up as the white dwarf core of
the star is revealed, creating a planetary

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.110
nebula. Also, when a high-mass star explodes
it catastrophically vaporizes itself, becoming

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.829
a violently expanding cloud of gas. Nebulae
are literally part of the births, lives, and

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.090
deaths of stars.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.979
So, besides being beautiful, they’re also
pretty versatile.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.179
There are a lot of ways of categorizing nebulae.
One way is by how we see them. For example,

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.909
if a cloud of gas is blasted by light from
a nearby massive star, the gas in it becomes

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.499
excited; the electrons in its atoms jump to
a higher energy level. When the electrons

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.469
drop back down, they emit light. The gas glows,
and we call this an emission nebula.

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.990
The color of an emission nebula depends on
the gas in it and how hot it is. Hydrogen,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.859
for example, glows most strongly in the red,
and we see that color in most emission nebulae.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.739
Oxygen tends to glow green, but to a
lesser extent it gives off blue light too.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.499
Other elements span the spectrum
in colors they give off.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.919
And these colors aren’t limited to visible
light. Hydrogen can emit infrared and even

00:01:55.919 --> 00:02:00.479
radio light, and if it’s energized enough
it’ll emit in the ultraviolet, too. That’s

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.909
true for many elements.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.119
Although most emission nebulae look substantial,
they’re actually incredibly tenuous. A typical

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.069
density in a gas nebula is only a few thousand
atoms per cubic centimeter. Mind you, in the

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.060
air you breathe there are about 10^19 atoms
per cubic centimeter, a thousand trillion

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.920
times denser than a typical nebula! Really,
a nebula is barely more than a vacuum.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.610
The reason they look so cloudy is that they’re
big. Really, really big. A decent sized nebula is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.209
several light years in diameter, and that’s
a LOT of centimeters. That much gas adds up,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.459
and so some nebulae can be pretty bright.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.959
While EMISSION nebulae glow due to their own
light, REFLECTION nebulae are bright because

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.310
— can you guess? — they reflect the light
of nearby bright massive stars. In this case

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.310
though the nebula isn’t made of gas, but
is instead mostly dust.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.950
I don’t mean like the hair and skin flake
dust bunnies you find under your couch either.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.519
When astronomers talk about dust, they mean
tiny grains a micron across. Just so you know,

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.939
a human hair is 100 times wider than that!
These tiny grains contain things like things

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.099
like silicates, aluminum oxide, and calcium.
And in many cases this dust is laced with

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.519
complex molecules called polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons.

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.959
While I love that fancy name for them, you
might know them better as… soot. Yup. When

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.719
you light a match you’re pretty much making some
of the same stuff that lurks between the stars.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.340
Dust doesn’t emit visible light. But it
can affect the visible light from stars if

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.739
they’re inside the dust cloud or nearby.
Turns out,

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.010
dust is very good at scattering light. That
means that when light hits it, the light gets

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.129
sent off in some other direction. This scattering
is highly wavelength dependent, so blue light

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.510
is scattered very strongly, while red light
can go right through.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.579
We saw this in the last episode; the dust
surrounding the Pleiades star cluster is a

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.760
reflection nebula. The light from the stars
in the Pleiades is scattered by the nearby

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.170
dust, and the blue light light gets sent in
every direction, including toward us. The

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.129
red light doesn’t scatter nearly as well,
so we don’t see it; it never gets sent toward us.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.469
Thick dust is also very good at absorbing
visible light. If a star is embedded in enough

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.109
dust, the light from it is dimmed considerably.
If the cloud is dense enough or big enough

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.319
the dust can completely extinguish the light
seen from a star.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.840
At the same time, if the dust is at the right
density, the blue light from a star inside

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.199
a dust cloud gets scattered, while the red
light can get through. This effect reddens

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.090
starlight, and in some dust clouds it provides
a striking view: Stars outside the cloud look

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.860
normal enough, but closer in they get redder
and redder, and then fade out entirely. The

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.960
result is a fuzzy, red-edged hole in space.
Pretty cool.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.900
You can see that effect in Barnard 68, a small
dust cloud, just half a light year in size.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.560
These are also sometimes called molecular
clouds; they’re cold enough that atoms can

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.900
stick together to form molecules. Their cores
can be hundreds of degrees below 0 Celsius.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.289
Some dust clouds like this are relatively
small, but others get downright huge. We call

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.800
these giant molecular clouds, because why
not. These can be incredibly massive, with

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.620
thousands or hundreds of thousands of times
the mass of the Sun, and stretch for hundreds

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.680
of light years.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.620
And that brings us to one of the most glorious
objects in the sky: the Orion Nebula. This

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.610
is an emission nebula located just below Orion’s
belt. It’s actually a naked-eye object,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.699
visible in modestly dark skies. It looks like
a star by eye, but even binoculars reveal

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.040
it to be fuzzy, and through a telescope, or with long
exposure images, you get unmitigated majesty.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.760
The Orion Nebula is a star-forming factory;
a bunch of stars have been born in it. Some

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.919
of them are very massive and incredibly luminous.
The entire nebula is lit by four stars located

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.729
in its heart, collectively called the Trapezium.
These are four brutes; huge, brilliant stars

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.160
that are each far more massive than the Sun.
Their light is so fierce it illuminates the

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.610
entire nebula, which is about 20 light years
across.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.409
And here’s a funny thing about Orion: What
you’re seeing is not just a gas cloud in

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.690
space. It’s actually just a bubble sitting
on the edge of a much, MUCH larger molecular

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.530
cloud, hundreds of light years across. That
cloud is cold and dark, and so we don't see

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.770
it by eye. The Trapezium stars formed inside
that cloud, very near the edge. When they

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.629
turned on, fusing hydrogen into helium, they
started blasting out a mind-numbing amount

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:23.139
of ultraviolet light, which began eating away
at the gas and dust. Eventually, they blew

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.470
a hole in the side of the cloud, like a weak
spot in a bicycle tire blowing out.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.530
What we see as the magnificent Orion Nebula
is just a dimple, a cavity, in the side of

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.080
the cloud, filled with gas heated to glowing
by the stars.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.820
There are still stars forming there today, too.
I mean literally, right now. We can see it happening!

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.039
In Episode 9, I talked about the solar system,
and how it starts off as a flattened disk

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:51.740
of gas and dust. When we look at the Orion
Nebula with Hubble, WE SEE THOSE DISKS. They’re

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.120
called protoplanetary disks and they’re
so dense they absorb almost all the light

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.849
from the stars forming inside them, so they’re
dark, and we see them in silhouette against

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:02.509
the brighter gas of the nebula.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.979
Unless you look in the infrared. That kind
of light can pierce the dark disk, and when

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:12.470
we use infrared telescopes we can see the
protostars forming in the centers of those

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.750
disks. Take a good look: THOSE ARE BABY STARS,
literally stars that are forming right this

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.930
very minute. They’re still hot due to their
contraction, but in a few million years they’ll

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.439
ignite fusion in their cores, and become real
stars. They’ll blow away the remaining material

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:31.080
around them, revealing themselves, and perhaps
any planets orbiting them as well.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.210
In fact, once stars start forming inside a
nebula, its days are numbered. The Eagle Nebula

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.360
is another star factory, with active star
birth going on inside of it. Some of these

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.930
are massive, luminous stars, and give off
so much ultraviolet light it erodes away at

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.849
the surrounding nebula, in a process called
photoevaporation. However, dense knots of

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:55.060
material forming new stars can resist that
erosion better, and protect the material behind

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.900
them, in essence shadowing it.
This results in long fingers of material we

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.539
see in silhouette against the hotter gas,
like sandbars in a stream. Observing their

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:07.060
infrared light, we can also see the stars
embedded inside them.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.520
There are several of these giant towers in
the Eagle Nebula, three of which have been

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.219
called the Pillars of Creation. Stars are
forming at their tips. Eventually, though,

00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:19.659
the light from the massive stars will win,
zapping away at the structures, dissolving

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:23.590
them. There’s also some very hot gas in
the nebula that might be the result of a star

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.650
that has already exploded; if so, then the
pillars REALLY don’t have long to live.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.760
In a few thousands years they won’t be eroded
away, they’ll be BLASTED away.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.820
In a lot of nebulae there’s no sharp edge;
they just kinda fade away. Sometimes that’s

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.670
because the gas thins out, so there’s not
enough stuff there to get lit and see. Other

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:46.520
times it’s because there’s just one or
maybe a few stars lighting up the whole cloud,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.750
and at some distance from them the starlight
fades and can’t illuminate the gas anymore.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:56.240
But sometimes nebulae do have sharp edges.
That usually happens when a gas cloud is expanding,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.700
like in a planetary nebula or supernova. The
gas slams into the much thinner gas that is

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.390
strewn between the stars, what we call the
interstellar medium. The expanding gas piles

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.350
up like snow in a snowplow, getting denser
and glowing more brightly.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:14.680
Gas inside a nebula can be in turmoil, too.
Winds from stars compress the gas, shock waves

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.550
form when stars explode and when they’re
born. These can create lovely sheets, tendrils,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.240
and filaments in nebulae as well.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.550
All of these factors can come together to
create great beauty. Not too far from the

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:31.300
Orion Nebula in the sky is another dark nebula,
superposed on a bright emission nebula. By

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.340
coincidence, the dense dark material is shaped
like a gigantic chess piece, and it’s called

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.900
the Horsehead Nebula. It’s being eroded
by a star called Sigma Orionis, off the top

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.520
of the frame here, and that’s also making
the gas behind it glow in that sharp ridge.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.320
One of my favorite nebulae in the sky is Barnard’s
Loop, a huge arc of material that’s formed

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.880
either by the expanding gas from supernovae
or the winds of all the massive stars being

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.470
born in the Orion complex. It’s also the
outer edge of a huge bubble surrounding a

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.380
substantial amount of real estate in the constellation
Orion. In this image you can see both the

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:10.300
Orion and the Horsehead nebulae; the Loop
is so big you could fit 25 full Moons across it!

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.560
One more thing: I’ve been talking about
bright and dark nebulae, but that’s an old

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.130
fashioned way of thinking of them. I’ve
also mentioned that infrared light can get

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.280
through them, but remember from Episode 24
that the kind of light an object gives off

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.720
depends on its temperature. Clouds of dust
that look dark to the human eye are actually

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.350
glowing if you observe them in the far infrared,
well outside the colors our eyes can detect.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.430
But we have telescopes that can see at these
much longer wavelengths.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:42.380
In Orion, there’s a reflection nebula called
M 78. Between M78 and Earth are long filaments

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.250
of very cold and dark dust, blocking the light
from the reflection nebula behind and looking

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.340
like dark rivers running through it. But when
you use a telescope that can see light with

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:57.780
a wavelength of a millimeter or so, that dust glows 
brightly, threading through M78 like ribbons of fire.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.740
Like so much else in life, what you see really
depends on how you see it. If there’s a

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.740
life lesson there, feel free to take it.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.870
Today you learned that nebulae are clouds
of gas and dust in space. They can glow on

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.640
their own or reflect light from nearby stars.
When they glow it’s usually predominantly

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.390
red from hydrogen and green from oxygen, and
when they reflect and scatter light it’s

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.370
from massive hot stars, so they look blue.
Stars are born in some nebulae, and create

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:27.670
new ones as they die. Some nebulae are small
and dense, others can be dozens or hundreds

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.940
of light years across.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.610
Also? They’re incredibly beautiful.
