WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.910
Where they're not going to know the world that we knew when we were kids.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.530
No Internet,
no fake tits.
Sometimes people were just on attractive.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.950
No one knew anything about diet.
Nobody worked out.
Nobody worked out.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.200
When I was in high school and we fuck them worked,

5
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.880
dudes would like bench press and shit,

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.580
but you know like how many women lifted weights?

7
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.000
We were in high school and that the cheerleaders were in good shape.
Yeah,

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.480
for a little while.
Yeah,
for a little while and they got nobody.
Don't,

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.330
nobody kept going.
Did Rocky really start like the big movement started my boots.

10
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.151
I've read about it,

11
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.880
but I don't know how true it is because I was too way too young.
Dude.

12
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:36.210
When rocky came out,
I think I was seven and a,

13
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:40.480
I drank raw eggs and ran around the block and I told Sylvester Stallone that,

14
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.970
that,
that one single bit I 100% did.
I was like,
Holy Shit,

15
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:47.400
I want to be a fighter.
I started drinking eggs and running.

16
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.480
I never ran was seven years old,
man.
Fuck,
am I doing running?
Maybe I was eight.

17
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.900
I had no such effect on top onto to doctor,
to doctor,
to doctor.

18
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.930
Oh was like we're running,
I'm not good.
Right on was amazing.

19
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.680
He goes eight.
I didn't know how old I was,
but I remember it when it came out.

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.880
Never been more inspired for something in my life.
I'm moving change the world.

21
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.850
People don't even understand how good it was.
He lives on my street.

22
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.250
That's really,
yeah he does.
He's come on time driving his range rover with a,

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.370
with a big cockatiel on his shoulder.
I'm like,
well that's Kinda cool.

24
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.600
There he is running around fucking weights at his hand and shit.

25
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.750
Run with converse all stars.
One of the reasons why I them to this day,

26
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.180
they might not be all stars.
They might be kids.

27
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.910
They might be like some cheap Walmart version.
Who knows?

28
00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:36.790
But this is some fucking epic shit.

29
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.010
In the 1970s what year was this movie?
What?

30
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.720
Let's take a guess.
What year do you think it was?

31
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.140
I wanna say it was like 79 76 76 the spirit of 76 was the rematch.

32
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.830
No,
there was 76,
because that was when Apollo creed six.
Yeah.

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.410
I don't middle as exactly doing one nighters across,
uh,
uh,

34
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:05.270
I believe it was Alabama.
We and uh,
he drove a 1970,

35
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.430
he drove the bicentennial Vega.
Right.
So it was a Vega.

36
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.450
The 76 Vega had said 76,
you know,

37
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:17.210
some things they're doing,
it would,
you know,

38
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.340
celebrate the sesquicentennial or whatever it was the,
um,

39
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.540
no,
so you probably 200 years,
I guess.
I don't know.
I don't know.
A long time.

40
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.600
I was nine years old when this movie came out.

41
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.130
And so that's exactly how old I was.

42
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.370
I gotta tell you these techniques aren't that good.

43
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.400
So it needs to tighten up on his swing.

44
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.500
Like the ways throwing punches like three he need needed a coach.

45
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.550
He needed a coach.
Well,
he got one and Carl weathers,
this was,
uh,

46
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.810
in rocky two,
rocky to Carl weathers became his Po.

47
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.050
Was it rocky three?
Three.
Right,
because that was when he fought ms teen.
Yeah,

48
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.260
that's right.
Right.
Yeah.
For his day.
A woman you're willing to say,
man,

49
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.140
ain't got no heart.
I bet just stay up every night was she had a real man.

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.000
Bring your pretty little self holding my apartment tonight and I'll show you a

51
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:11.430
real man.
You probably would have to,
oh,

52
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.890
I couldn't believe he was saying that to rocky.
Right,
right.

53
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.110
It was like if he was saying that to a Wahoo McDaniel.
Yeah,
man.
