WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.940
So one of the things that I think is fascinating about all of what we're talking

2
00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:11.810
about here is that it's not just about gender and sex and sexuality,

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.260
but this is also leaking into all sorts of other things,

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.430
talking about ethnicity and color of skin and all of that.
Uh,

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.250
you've written a bit about this.

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.310
<v 2>I have,
yeah.
I wrote about how a university applications,</v>

7
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:30.900
and particularly Harvard has been discriminating against Asians for decades.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.130
Um,
and how to the point where Asians when they apply to university,

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.160
will want to hide their ethnicity in hopes of that.

10
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:40.560
That's going to give them a fair chance of actually getting into the school.

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.590
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
all right,</v>

12
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.140
so somebody that's watching this right now that doesn't know about this,

13
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:45.160
they're gonna go,
wait a minute.

14
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.090
Why would Harvard discriminate against Asian people?

15
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.380
<v 2>Cause apparently there are too many Asians there.</v>

16
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.300
If it's based solely on sat scores and meritocracy,
um,

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.720
there's a very high proportion of Asian students.

18
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:04.070
And so in the name of quote unquote diversity and inclusion,
um,

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.690
Asian students get penalized.

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.870
<v 1>So this to me is the most blatant example of why this diversity stuff is</v>

21
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:17.390
complete nonsense.
Because people on face value,
it seems nice.

22
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:18.980
We want to help people,

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.590
we want to help groups that maybe have struggled more for whatever reason we

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.180
should.
And,
and there's probably many good ways to do that.

25
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:29.650
Maybe investing in more education or whatever else.
I'm,
I'm happy to hear your,

26
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:30.530
your thoughts on that,

27
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.060
but what they take as a good thought then they don't think all the way through,

28
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:35.960
which means,
okay,

29
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:40.400
now we're going to have to punish people who have worked very hard and done

30
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:43.190
everything right.
And by and large,
the Asian community,

31
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:45.680
whether it's Chinese or Japanese or Korean or whatever else,

32
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.490
have worked really hard and put a focus on education and family.

33
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.000
And then what is the result of that?
It's now harder,

34
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.720
if not almost impossible at some level to get into Harvard.

35
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.760
<v 2>And the craziest thing,
I don't understand why people think this is acceptable.</v>

36
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.440
And even when I wrote that column,

37
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.130
I had a number of Asians reach out to me and say,
you know,
don't,

38
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:11.180
don't be used as a token for the far right.
And I'm totally okay with this.

39
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.270
This is fair.
And I'm thinking,
you know,
what are you on?

40
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.290
<v 1>What was it about the times do an op Ed I think by an Asian woman from around</v>

41
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.153
the state.

42
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.730
<v 2>Yeah.
Saying that this is okay.
And I,
I just,
I mean,</v>

43
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.680
<v 1>what do you do with,
I don't know,</v>

44
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.060
what do you do with that you are fighting for true.
We're quality.
Yeah.

45
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.280
That is simply not what they're fighting for.

46
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.240
<v 2>I think it's indoctrination at some level.</v>

47
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:36.660
I think especially for the kids who are applying to these schools and who are

48
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:41.430
okay with having to score much higher on the sat in order to get a fair chance.

49
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.760
I think they've just been told,
you know,
this is how it has to be.
Um,

50
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.400
but this idea that it should be equality and equality of outcome as opposed to

51
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:55.260
opportunities is silly and it doesn't actually deal with actual,

52
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.010
um,
differences in terms of opportunity.
You know,

53
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.720
terms of the differences that we see and the reasons why there are these

54
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:03.910
differences,
they're not actually being addressed.

55
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.350
<v 1>Please tell me that you got some nice support from members of the Asian</v>

56
00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:11.630
community,
that it wasn't just sort of brainwashed lefties that were,

57
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.590
<v 2>I didn't,
no,
I didn't.
I got across the board of,
of you know,
many races,</v>

58
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.110
so I was grateful for that because I wasn't sure how people were going to

59
00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:21.020
respond to that piece,
but I felt very strongly that I had to say something

60
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.700
<v 1>as Harvard issued a response to any of this or do we even know where they're at</v>

61
00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:29.630
with all this?
No,
as far as I know that the lawsuit is still ongoing.
Yeah.

62
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.590
It's just,
it really is just crazy.
So I,
are you with me on this?

63
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:37.490
I sense that there's some massive minority groups that are breaking right now.

64
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.880
I think the Asian community,
because of the,
I hate saying community,
but you know,

65
00:03:40.881 --> 00:03:42.710
you have to use some words to describe some of this,

66
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.780
but I think the black community is breaking.

67
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:47.330
This is what a lot of what Candice Owens is talking about.

68
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.670
I sent to this happening in the gay community.

69
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:52.850
I sent to this happening in the Jewish community on very similarly because of

70
00:03:52.851 --> 00:03:56.660
the Asian community because of hard work and an education and all that.

71
00:03:56.661 --> 00:03:58.060
And so then we decided,
yeah,

72
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.880
we have to put you at the bottom of the oppression Olympics.
Um,

73
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.420
so there's an interesting like strange alliance now,

74
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.670
now building up or are you seeing that?

75
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.660
<v 2>I could say,
yeah,
I see it coming.
I see.</v>

76
00:04:11.661 --> 00:04:13.790
Well we were talking about the bit about this earlier,

77
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:17.930
about how the left is going to eat its own until there is only one person left.

78
00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:21.290
So it's only a matter of time really.
We're all going to find each other and say,

79
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:24.980
yeah,
we've had enough of this.
I mean,
gay men,
you guys don't count.

80
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.030
It doesn't count to begin anymore.
So,
um,

81
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.040
<v 1>cause I never wanted extra credit.
I wanted equality,
equality.</v>

82
00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:34.520
I wanted equal credit.
Not Extra credit.
Yeah.
So I'm know in a weird way,

83
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:38.390
I'm actually okay being thrown out in that regard of this pyramid because I

84
00:04:38.391 --> 00:04:42.620
don't want to play that game.
But I think actually finally,

85
00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:45.770
some gay men,
especially gay white men,
because now they're,

86
00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:48.050
they're fully thought of as the enemy.
I mean,

87
00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:53.051
I've even seen things on college campuses where LGBT organizations are saying,

88
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:53.211
well,

89
00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:57.200
you can't be a gay white man and be the president of the organization because

90
00:04:57.201 --> 00:05:01.670
you're,
you're one of the bad guys.
I mean that,
that's really dangerous thinking.

91
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.901
<v 2>Well,</v>

92
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.170
I saw what you had to deal with too at that professor who said that the LGBT

93
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.000
community doesn't want you at the,
was it the University of

94
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.690
<v 1>University of New Hampshire?
Yeah.
Do you know that?
So I didn't know at the time,</v>

95
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:14.660
so I think much of my audience will,
we'll know what you're referring to.

96
00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:17.210
But I spoke at University of New Hampshire and there were all these heckler's

97
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:21.350
there,
and there was a trans woman who I did not know was a professor.

98
00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:24.670
I didn't know that until literally two months later who was,

99
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.040
was screaming at me how much I hate trans people and all this.
And I kept saying,

100
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.060
I want you to have equality under the law and I want you to be treated with

101
00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:34.610
decency and respect and I hope you find someone that loves you.

102
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:36.200
And all of the things I would want for anyone else.

103
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.600
I just don't want the government using a dictating what pronouns I can use to,

104
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.490
to uh,
refer to you.
And you know,

105
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:45.680
basically she was calling me alt right and all that it too.

106
00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:48.950
And of course it turns out she's a gender studies professor.
Yeah.

107
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.570
I should never be a surprise anymore,

108
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.290
but there's going to be no discipline at the school or anything like that.

109
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:57.650
I mean,
I could probably make more of a hey at it and see what happens.
It's like,

110
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.980
<v 2>yeah,
you know,
you handled it amazingly well.</v>

111
00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:03.340
And I mean it's only a matter of time.
Like I see with feminism,

112
00:06:03.341 --> 00:06:07.270
they're turning on white women now too.
So it's insane.

113
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.510
<v 1>Is that the only logical outcome of these disciplines because they are not held</v>

114
00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:16.000
to the scientific standard of everything else that we discussed here in the

115
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.330
first half that you are held to

116
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.140
<v 2>scientist.
Yeah.
I think because everything is,</v>

117
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.180
there's so much based in subjective feeling and validating people's experiences.

118
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.980
You apparently can't question someone's experience so someone's offended or they

119
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:36.830
don't like you.
What can you say?
So I could see that and it's,

120
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:40.070
it's very much rewarding people for being emotionally driven instead of,

121
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.810
I think the best way to have a debate as to remove emotion and just try to look

122
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:48.980
at the facts as objectively as you can no matter what the issue is.
So,
um,

123
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.640
it's that is that they don't really have any sort of method to how they do
their,

124
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.550
even their research is,
I mean,
it's kind of a joke.

125
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.150
<v 1>Yeah.
But are we kind of hearing that even the methods now we're a part of the</v>

126
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:03.530
patriarchy and all of those things.
Objectivity,
you're using facts.

127
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.320
They,
they,

128
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.320
they don't want facts to actually count because they believe in this postmodern

129
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:10.520
dribble that,

130
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:14.750
that facts have been arrived to by mechanisms that they don't believe in.

131
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.180
That's a,
that's a tough thing to trick somebody out of.

132
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.010
<v 2>Yeah.
But,
you know,
I think on some level,</v>

133
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.730
I think some of these scholars know that what they're doing is very lucrative

134
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.120
and so they're just basically trying to shut people down in any way they can.

135
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:30.140
They can't really justify it,
but,
you know,
they just keep screaming about it.
And,

136
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.270
uh,
academics who have better things to do,

137
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:36.860
like actually do real research and they've got their courses and their students

138
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:39.050
and a million other things and their 80 hour work weeks,

139
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.520
they don't have time to deal with this.

140
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:45.140
So this is why there's such a lopsided discourse in terms of what you see coming

141
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:48.050
out of the universities.
And there are some institutions that,
you know,

142
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.170
they won't allow academics to engage with the media without permission for us.

143
00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:53.930
So that,
that's part of it too.
It's just,

144
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.750
it's really an unfair battle right now that's being fought.

145
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.600
<v 1>Yeah.
How do you think we get to a place where specifically related to sexuality</v>

146
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.370
topics related to gender and sex,

147
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.700
where we will be able to talk about it in a in a better way.

148
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:12.440
So for example,
the me too movement where everybody every,

149
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.330
I think basically thinking person understands that there were some really bad

150
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.970
people here that did some really bad stuff.

151
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:24.110
Obviously Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and some people that really,

152
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.210
that that drug people in that you know,

153
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.230
years of history of doing all this and then there's all sorts of other people

154
00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:34.550
who seem like they're just getting swept up in it or basically accused all that.

155
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:39.230
Now you can be for the idea of the me too movement without being,

156
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:42.470
for taking down all of these other people also,

157
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.730
and I guess what the real issue is is litigating everyone's history where we

158
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:51.410
could all look back and go,
I did this,
someone did that to me,
this,
that,

159
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:54.950
the other thing,
college kids now have an assigned things before they hook up.

160
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.560
I mean really where we're creating this situation where our interpersonal

161
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:03.260
relations are going to have almost nothing to do with the stuff that's hard

162
00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:05.370
wired into us at the step that you study.

163
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.710
<v 2>[inaudible] I think me too probably started as something honorable.</v>

164
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.640
And I do agree that women and men have been dealing with harassment for far too

165
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:16.460
long and that it doesn't get taken seriously sometimes,

166
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.310
but it's to the point now where relations are so strained,

167
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:21.380
especially between men and women.

168
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.450
I sense men are terrified and that's not going to be helpful across the board

169
00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:31.010
for anybody.
Um,
I think especially when you look at shades of gray,

170
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.780
well,
I mean there's so much I could say on this.

171
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.760
I'm trying to think of what's the best place to start would be.
Um,
with consent.

172
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:42.470
Say,
I think one message that's been missing is women.
I've written about this.

173
00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:46.610
Women need to advocate for themselves.

174
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.970
And that's not to say if you are experienced harassment or if you were assaulted

175
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:54.740
that you are at fault.
I'm not advocating victim blaming.

176
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.660
But I think what's missing from this narrative,

177
00:09:56.661 --> 00:10:00.680
women are portrayed as though they're helpless and if something happens to them,

178
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.680
they're helpless.
And that,
uh,
they're basically,

179
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.100
they have no say in terms of how men behave towards them.
And you know,

180
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:11.510
I've written about sexism in the sciences and how women are basically being

181
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.411
scared off.

182
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:17.411
I think of going into the field as someone with a phd in a science field.

183
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.140
Yeah.
You deal with sexism and it's unpleasant.

184
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.650
But I still got my degree and now I'm speaking out about it.

185
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.470
So if you want to achieve something,
you can,

186
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:30.890
a sexism is not so terrible in the world that women can't achieve what they
want.

187
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.960
So going back to consent,
you know,
I think women need,

188
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
young women especially need to be told,
you know,
you have a say in this.

189
00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:40.880
If you don't like something or if you don't want to do something,
say so.
Don't,

190
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.540
don't feel like it's on the man to,
um,

191
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.930
I know read your mind and I feel like I'm going to get in so much trouble for

192
00:10:47.931 --> 00:10:52.220
saying this,
but I think that empowers women instead of telling them,

193
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.850
you know,
just really hope that this doesn't happen to you.
And if it does,

194
00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:59.390
then get on Twitter and use the Hashtag and talk about how men are terrible and

195
00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:03.680
men are trash.
Men are not terrible.
They're lovely men in the world.
I love men.

196
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:07.100
You know,
there are some bad men,
but you can't generalize to all men.

197
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.250
<v 1>Yeah.
But we love the generalization thing,
right?
That's easy.
I mean,</v>

198
00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:12.770
you even see this,
the amount of articles where I see,
you know,

199
00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:16.400
we have to take down white.
It's always white men.
Yeah.
We have to take down or,

200
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.210
or now it's women's turned to rule the world or all of these things.

201
00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:24.980
And it's like,
well a woman could be president or a woman could be,

202
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.810
you know,
anything that a man could be,
but it shouldn't be because she's a woman.

203
00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:33.560
It should be because she's just qualified,
capable.
But,

204
00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:37.940
but we've seen this sort of hysterical reaction to it and I think that that now

205
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.540
is just another one of these places where we're on this crazy pendulum just

206
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:42.620
bouncing back and forth.

207
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.600
<v 2>Yeah.
I'm hoping it's going to come back to the middle.
Um,</v>

208
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.470
and hopefully not too much damage will be done before that happens and that the,

209
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:49.860
you know,

210
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.100
relations between men and women aren't going to be so terribly strained.
Um,

211
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.860
I do think we're reaching that point though because there are only so many men

212
00:11:56.861 --> 00:12:00.070
left who haven't been accused of a me too moment.
So yeah,

213
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.330
it was only a matter of time.

214
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.450
<v 1>You know what's interesting,</v>

215
00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.140
I have a running joke with some of my friends that I know a lot of great

216
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.490
straight girls in La that are single [inaudible] lot of straight great girls.

217
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.040
I don't know a lot of straight guys that I think are great.
Like,
I know,

218
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.350
I know some straight guys that are kind of whatever,

219
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.890
but I don't know like a lot of straight guys that kind of have their shit

220
00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:25.160
together that are,
so I have all these girls and they're like,
okay,

221
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.610
you set me up with a guy.
And I'm like,
not the guys I know,

222
00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:32.600
which does show that there's sort of a crisis I think in masculinity or

223
00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:36.320
something.
And,
and obviously Jordan Peterson is addressing this at some level,

224
00:12:36.321 --> 00:12:37.550
although now I've spent so much time with him.

225
00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:39.050
I think he's addressing it in a certain way.

226
00:12:39.051 --> 00:12:40.520
You almost equally for men and women,

227
00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:44.000
although people only focus on the male part.
But do you know,

228
00:12:44.001 --> 00:12:49.001
is anyone doing research on sort of what is happening to young men in particular

229
00:12:50.001 --> 00:12:50.834
right now?

230
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.160
<v 2>Hmm,
that's a good question.
I know that,
uh,</v>

231
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.120
levels of testosterone are lower on average more recently.

232
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:01.980
So I don't know if that has something to do with it and know what that,

233
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.890
what the reasoning for that is.
Could be.
Maybe there's more estrogens that are,

234
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:10.420
that we're putting into our bodies.
Um,
trying to think of what I can give you,

235
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:13.620
cause that's an interesting,
so how old are your friends?
I'm curious.

236
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.700
<v 1>Um,
this sort of set of friends that I'm talking about.</v>

237
00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:21.050
These girls usually are in,
they're sorta like early thirties.
Yeah.
Kind of thing.

238
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:24.770
And there,
and they're single,
which,
you know,
most often cases,
a lot of them,

239
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:26.990
their friends are married already and like they're,

240
00:13:26.991 --> 00:13:29.960
they're on the hunt and they've got good jobs and they look good and they take

241
00:13:29.961 --> 00:13:31.310
care of themselves and all of those things.

242
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.670
And I just don't see the equivalent here.
I don't know,

243
00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:38.450
maybe there's an odd subset of,
because La is like a little bit of an odd place.

244
00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:40.700
Maybe there's more gay people are,
I don't know.
Exactly.

245
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.490
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean I could say the average age for people getting married as 28,</v>

246
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.840
so I don't want to,

247
00:13:45.841 --> 00:13:49.640
I don't want to generalize and say that across the board are you sciences that

248
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.470
it's incredible.
I want to be fair.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I mean,

249
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:57.471
it could be that for guys who are a certain age and there's a reason,

250
00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:59.220
but at the same thing for women of a certain age,

251
00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:02.700
and not to say live your friends of course,
but um,
you know,

252
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:06.990
if you're focused on your career and maybe you're not used to giving your time

253
00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:09.350
to someone else,
that could be part of it.
Yeah.

254
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.910
<v 1>Do you think that the feminist movement,
which I know we sort of,</v>

255
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:17.410
we've sort of ancillary been talking about it this whole time that they really

256
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:22.411
did give up something very special by putting so much focus on work and success

257
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:26.710
in that way.
I mean,
you know,
I think back to my childhood now,

258
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:29.260
which I think I in retrospect was so amazing.

259
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:34.060
My mom was home for most of it.
She,
she worked before.

260
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:34.930
I'm the oldest of three.

261
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:38.530
She worked before I was there and then she didn't work all the years that she

262
00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:41.800
was raising us and then went back to work after.
Um,

263
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.730
and that having someone at home that was cooking and taking care of us and

264
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:47.500
making sure we got to school.
And all of those things,

265
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.890
like that's like the greatest thing that anyone could do.

266
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.880
It happens to more often be the woman.
But that's a,
that's a pretty great thing.

267
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.240
That's often been sacrifice.
Now we're thought of it.
It's marked in a way.

268
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.360
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean I've always been atypical in terms of I've,</v>

269
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.110
I've always been felt more masculine.
I've always been very focused on my career.

270
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.920
Um,

271
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.920
but I definitely think that feminism and for some people it or some proponents

272
00:15:13.921 --> 00:15:14.754
of feminism,

273
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.030
they will denigrate female typical roles and motherhood and wanting to be,

274
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.030
uh,
you know,
at home with your family.
And I think,
you know,

275
00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:25.280
I've heard from women who say,

276
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.530
I've been told that the path to happiness is for me to focus on my career and to

277
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.030
neglect my personal life.
And then they reach a point where they realize,
no,

278
00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:33.990
I do want those things.

279
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.440
And I don't think there should be anything wrong with that.
And the same thing,

280
00:15:37.441 --> 00:15:39.990
you know,
I've written about how there's such an emphasis for,

281
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.830
for girls to be like boys.
Now I saw you tweet about babies.

282
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:49.790
And underlying that is the sexism that it says that girls need to be like boys

283
00:15:50.071 --> 00:15:53.430
in order to be equal or worthy of respect.

284
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.360
And no one's talking about that where people are just saying,
yeah,
for sure.

285
00:15:57.361 --> 00:15:58.530
Let's just,
you know,

286
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.290
tell girls that they have to be the same as boys and women have to be the same

287
00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:01.690
as men.

288
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.240
<v 1>Yeah.
So the article you're referring to,
there was this piece,</v>

289
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:09.330
I think it was a Newsweek that these parents are raising their twins as Fabian's

290
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.420
t h e y babies,
babies.
Uh,
because,

291
00:16:13.421 --> 00:16:16.840
and they're going to let them pick their gender and it's like,

292
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.300
you're going to create more psychological problems then you were trying to hide

293
00:16:22.301 --> 00:16:25.120
them from most likely,
I think.

294
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.920
<v 2>Yeah.
And it goes back to biology again and,
and hormonal exposure in utero.
You,</v>

295
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.873
I think it's great.

296
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.530
<v 1>He might've been NBC news.
I think that,</v>

297
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.470
<v 2>okay.
Yeah.
Newsweek.
Okay.
Yeah.
But yeah,</v>

298
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:36.870
we think there are a couple outlets that were so excited about this.

299
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.060
<v 1>Well,
that's what it,
that was why I wrote about it.
Not because of the thing,</v>

300
00:16:40.061 --> 00:16:41.710
you know,
these parents can do whatever they want.

301
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.230
That's what I followed up with immediately after computers can do whatever they

302
00:16:44.231 --> 00:16:46.000
want and then when the children are of age,

303
00:16:46.001 --> 00:16:50.540
they can either decide my parents were crazy or not and just talk like this on

304
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.740
the parents.
Right.
And all that.
But that wasn't the issue for me.

305
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:56.890
It was that the way these headlines are always written,
it's like this.

306
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.900
It was like this is the new thing and the implicit piece of that is you better

307
00:17:02.081 --> 00:17:07.081
do this to be a good parent and get tolerant parent to be a progressive parent.

308
00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:11.920
And that's what an open minded person and that to me is the danger here.

309
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.490
Not The little isolated case necessarily have these people that are doing

310
00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:17.170
something that's an outlier thing.

311
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.780
<v 2>Yeah.
And the thing is,</v>

312
00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:21.480
I've heard stories now where people are terrified of giving their daughters

313
00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:24.240
dolls and which is what's really funny is you have some of these really

314
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.910
progressive parents who raise their girls.

315
00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:30.720
They only have gender neutral toys or they give them boys toys and then the girl

316
00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:34.950
obviously goes to school and sees girl typical toys and wants to play with them,

317
00:17:34.951 --> 00:17:36.630
and the parents were horrified and they think,
oh,

318
00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:41.490
this is the patriarchy coming in
the patriots,
just biology.

319
00:17:41.491 --> 00:17:43.320
And we shouldn't be afraid of that and we shouldn't.

320
00:17:43.321 --> 00:17:46.260
We shouldn't shame girls for wanting to be female.
Typical.

321
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.280
<v 1>Yeah,
but this is why when people say,
I think to a of us that are in this space,</v>

322
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:52.890
this,
oh,
you guys are overstating what this thing is.

323
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:57.240
It's just a bunch of angry activist or whatever.
It's like we've seen it.
In fact,

324
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.930
academia would you addressed already?
We've seen it,
in fact,

325
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:02.850
the home and how you're supposed to raise your kids.

326
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.220
Even just thinking about this now,
it's like,

327
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.070
I think I read something on this and I,
and if not,

328
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:11.790
there's definite proof of it that Disney made a decision along the way.

329
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.950
Now that they have star wars and marvel,

330
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.270
that star wars was going to be more marketed to girls and marvel was going to be

331
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:19.081
the boy's thing.
Now,

332
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:23.070
I'm a big star wars guy and I would see these commercials and it was all girls,

333
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.640
you know,
girls in the ships and girls with the lightsabers.
All right.

334
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.980
I have no problem with that.
Obviously uh,
Ray,

335
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.630
but leading character and last one is a girl.

336
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.310
It's all good that girls can do anything want but,

337
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.300
but pushing marketing on them seems odd to me.
And,

338
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.070
and although I'm sure there are many girl girls out there that want to be a

339
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:45.450
Jetta I,
there's obviously more boys.
So the way that we even market,

340
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:48.600
and I suspect they're marketing in a way that's hurting their bottom line in the

341
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:53.250
name of
tolerance in the name of what I dunno.

342
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.490
<v 2>Yeah.
So I mean how did the boys feel about that?</v>

343
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.731
<v 1>Right,
right.</v>

344
00:18:56.731 --> 00:18:59.370
So you're going to get this odd thing then when eventually after enough

345
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.580
marketing boys are going to want to play with the girl thing and then feel weird

346
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:04.910
about it.
God,
that's

347
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.990
<v 2>messed up too much time.
Did you have too much time on their hands?
Yeah.</v>

348
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.061
I just say like,

349
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:13.470
kids do what they want and acknowledge that as long as you give them free

350
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:16.290
choices,
you probably won't have too much say at the end of the day.

351
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.510
But at least you know,
they,
they'll be happy.

352
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.050
<v 1>Yeah.
Uh,</v>

353
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.120
is there anything else that you're researching at the moment or that's been on

354
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.550
your mind that,
uh,
that we haven't covered?

355
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.500
<v 2>Uh,
the only thing I would say is so with wrong speak,</v>

356
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.970
we are going to be launching our second,
we just launched our first season.
Yeah.

357
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.280
Last month.
Um,
so we spoke with James [inaudible],
Lindsay Shepherd.

358
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.100
We also did an episode on rapid onset gender dysphoria.

359
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:42.030
So it's this phenomenon of adolescent girls who were suddenly saying their

360
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:42.661
transgender,

361
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:46.440
even though they've had no previous signs of gender dysphoria and actually their

362
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:47.970
problems have nothing to do with gender.

363
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.910
<v 1>So,
so what are the problems?</v>

364
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:53.210
That's just societal stuff or pressure or wanting attention or what?

365
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.770
<v 2>All of the above.
Usually autism as well.</v>

366
00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.120
So they either will be diagnosed by a mental professional,

367
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:02.530
but the person will say,
I can't say that I have to,
you know,

368
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.650
affirm your child's gender.
Um,

369
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:07.710
because they can otherwise get into a lot of trouble and lose their jobs if they

370
00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:10.740
don't.
Um,
wait,
can you repeat that?

371
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:14.190
I got to get one right so that they will lose their jobs if they know,

372
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:17.540
but they have to affirm their,
they see,
oh,

373
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.270
they have two clinicians nowadays have to affirm these kids.

374
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:23.280
If a child says they're transgender and you have to,

375
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.990
they'll lose their jobs otherwise.

376
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.370
<v 1>So,</v>

377
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:31.370
so technically a therapist or a clinician could feel that this is some other

378
00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:33.890
issue going on.
Nothing.

379
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.470
But they have to actually affirm what the child says.
Yeah.

380
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.360
The parents and in all the documents.
Yeah,

381
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.780
because they will lose their job because

382
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.540
<v 2>they're terrified.
And so in Toronto,
what happened?
What the Preston case was,
uh,</v>

383
00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:48.900
my colleague Kenneth Zucker,

384
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:54.430
I had a clinic where he saw gender dysphoric children and people said that he

385
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:56.530
was practicing conversion therapy.
He was not.

386
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:59.320
So conversion therapy I do not stand for,

387
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.720
it's trying to turn gay children straight,

388
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.240
but sexual orientation is not the same thing as gender.

389
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.320
So gender and young children is flexible and it becomes more stable with age.

390
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.520
So when he,
when patients would come to him and say,
you know,

391
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.620
I want to be the opposite sex,
he would say,
okay,
what,
what

392
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.350
<v 1>underlined you?
Just a rejection.
When you say gender is flexible,</v>

393
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.180
you don't mean the amount of genders.

394
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:21.760
You mean the feelings that you have related to gender?
Is that yes.

395
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.900
I just want to be clear.
There are two genders.
Let's be clear.
The Ebi I very by,

396
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.700
no,
not as much to jump on that.
Okay.

397
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.620
<v 2>Um,
so if you have an example you've been using,</v>

398
00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:33.440
if you have a little boy who says he's a girl,

399
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.270
he will likely be a gay man and he will likely grow to be comfortable in his

400
00:21:38.271 --> 00:21:42.710
male gender identity.
So for 99% of us are biological sex is our gender.

401
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.350
<v 1>Man,
this,
this thing,
it's a,
it's a real monster.
Yeah.</v>

402
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.230
<v 2>There's a lot of misinformation out there.</v>

403
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.930
So now what I was saying with my colleague has clinic got shut down.

404
00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:56.270
He wasn't doing anything unethical.
But because of that,

405
00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:57.770
it's set this cello across the field.

406
00:21:57.771 --> 00:22:01.850
Now clinicians do not do not want to have the same thing happen to them cause

407
00:22:01.851 --> 00:22:02.900
activists will go after them.

408
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.570
<v 1>Yeah.
So there's no one really practicing,
uh,</v>

409
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.840
or anyone sort of thought of as legitimate that's practicing conversion therapy

410
00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:14.550
anymore.
Is there,
I hope not.
I hope all the sciences against it,
like the,

411
00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:15.900
that it just never worked.

412
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:20.610
Like it was just something that I guess is sort of twisted idealogue was

413
00:22:20.611 --> 00:22:25.611
practicing not using real evidence or science and yeah,

414
00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:27.330
I mean it just fizzled out basically.

415
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.320
<v 2>Yeah.
I do think there are some practitioners who are still doing it.
Not,</v>

416
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:32.760
I wouldn't call them legitimate,

417
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.110
which it makes me very uncomfortable when I see that.
Um,
but yeah,

418
00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:39.660
definitely sexual orientation is biological.

419
00:22:39.661 --> 00:22:42.120
It's genetic and it can't be changed.

420
00:22:42.121 --> 00:22:44.720
So conversion therapy is completely okay.

421
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.620
<v 1>Uh,
useless.
Yeah.
Well it's nice.
I'm glad we got there.
At least I think.</v>

422
00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:51.930
I think most people won't be angry at you on that one.
Well,

423
00:22:51.931 --> 00:22:56.020
I guess maybe some people on the right,
maybe might be angle on that one

424
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.360
<v 2>maybe,
but you know,</v>

425
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.990
I'm all about presenting the data and speaking to facts and the science and

426
00:23:00.991 --> 00:23:02.250
standing up for sex research,

427
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.530
whether it infuriates people on the left or the right.

428
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:09.630
<v 1>Yeah.
Science facts reason pretty much,</v>

429
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.050
pretty much all that.
All sort of package within,
within the free speech thing.

430
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.920
Yeah.
That,
can I call you a member of the intellectual dark web?
Please do.

431
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.220
I don't know that I have that power,

432
00:23:20.221 --> 00:23:23.340
but I'm going to go back to the clubhouse later and I'm going to get me a

433
00:23:23.341 --> 00:23:25.710
membership.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know,
we have to vote on it.

434
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:30.120
It's a weird thing and we can be a white man some days.
Oh,
right.

435
00:23:30.121 --> 00:23:32.640
That was the thing.
It was like the,
you know,
whatever.

436
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.250
All these idiots that are writing all these nonsensical pieces about,

437
00:23:35.251 --> 00:23:36.880
it's all white men and it's like,
come

438
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.350
<v 2>on,
there are a bunch of us that are not white,
but I mean they call him,</v>

439
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.350
I've been called a white supremacist.
I've been called a Nazi.
So,
you know,

440
00:23:43.351 --> 00:23:45.980
that's the level that we're at right now,
and they have else.
So I think

441
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.040
<v 1>it's a good sign.
In a weird way.
It absolutely is a good title.</v>

442
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:52.580
It's been a pleasure.
I'm so glad that we finally got to do this.
So much fun.

443
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.790
Yeah,
we will.
We will do.
I sent,
these issues are not going away,

444
00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.290
so we're going to have to do this again.
All right,
very good.
