00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Hi everyone.

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:05.100
My name's Mike Hebrew, I'm on the local author's
team.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.680
We're always looking for volunteers so if
you are interested or have ideas we're always

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.530
looking for new ideas.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.400
Also we have a new talk on Monday.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.170
Nick Mason of Pink Floyd will be here, so
that should be very cool.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.380
I met Craig about a year ago?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380
Two years ago?

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.420
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Get it right.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.420
[Laughter]

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And I started

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.420
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: A year and a half

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.980
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I started working out with him.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.790
It's definitely changed my life.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.250
I feel better about everything in general
and, so, even if you don't learn anything

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.500
he's very entertaining so
[Laughter]

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.410
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So everyone welcome Craig Ramsay.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.410
[Applause]

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.930
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Thank you, Mike.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.750
Well hopefully you will learn a lot which
I will make you but thank you, Mike.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.450
And yeah, Mike and his wife Christy have been
clients of mine for about a year and a half

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.750
and I've been so impressed with Mike's transformation
over the past year and a half.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.189
Not just his physique but what he's capable
of doing with his athleticism, it's really

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.229
impressive.

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.529
And he's such a good example of when you have
those physique goals in mind and you reach

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:16.670
them, your whole life changes.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.109
It's not just about your body it's about your
body, your mind, your spirit, your work, your

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.020
family, your relationships, your future, your
present, everything.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.509
And, also, I have today my assistant, Kevin,
who is also a client of mine and his success

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.799
story is incredible and is very impressive
to me and other clients.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.959
He's been a great motivator and a great example
and walking billboard of what the message

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:50.959
can provide.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.649
Here, give us a walking billboard back and
forth runway walk, Kevin.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:55.649
Here we go.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.270
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: There we go.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.270
Kevin, how much have you lost?

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.899
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Um, as of this morning I've lost
78 pounds.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.729
&gt;&gt;audience members: Wow!

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.319
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: 78 pounds in a short, how
long has it been?

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.319
&gt;&gt;Kevin: 10 months.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.462
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: 10 months but you have to
understand; when Kevin first saw me he couldn't

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:15.459
do a push up and couldn't even walk on an
incline on a treadmill.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.129
And when someone comes to me, unathletic,
unlike this one that just walked in that seems

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
to be jacked and go to Venus Gold's everyday
which is great,

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.799
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Welcome.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.569
Then if someone is unathletic when they come
to see me, a lot of times there's no hope

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.129
in hell in their eyes or in their mind.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.490
And my message is it doesn't matter how old
you are, it doesn't matter what obstacles

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.700
you're up against, doesn't matter if you're
in a wheelchair, once we tackle the mind,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.209
we tackle the body.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.540
And what Kevin's been able to do is incredible.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.620
And this is the message and the message is
in this book, "The Anatomy of Muscle Building."

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.560
Which all of you have and I have a more impressive
one cause it's the hard cover.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.930
[Hitting book]
[Laughter]

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.370
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Um, yeah, and actually great
introduction is this short video that we have

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.269
which explains not only the book but me as
the author and what I put into it.

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.530
Here we go.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.530
[Music plays]

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.150
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay in video: My training history
started in Canada.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.209
I was a hockey player turned contortionist,
turned ballet dancer, turned Broadway performer.

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.220
[Music plays]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Nice shorts, right?

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.220
[Laughter]

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.390
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay in video: Ten years ago my
mother was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.389
I was able to learn about my mom's condition
and change her life and pretty much save her.

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.780
Nice Vicky, this is really good!

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.739
What brought me to training and changing people's
lives stems from that.

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.019
[Music plays]

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.469
&gt;&gt;male #1 on video: You're here because?

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.049
&gt;&gt;female #1 on video: I'm here with Craig
Ramsay and we're gonna do a workout for this

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.049
area right here.

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.049
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: You're pretty good.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.049
&gt;&gt;female #1: Don't need a workout?

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.719
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: You don't need a workout.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.719
[Music plays]

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:07.349
&gt;&gt;male #2 on video: This really is a fantastic
exercise to engage all core and abdominal

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.470
muscles, you can see with Craig here.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.701
&gt;&gt;female #2 on video: If someone wanted to
lose weight versus build muscle is there a

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.560
different way you would approach the strength
training program?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: There's no difference.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560
&gt;&gt;female #2 on video: Really?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.639
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: There truly is no
difference.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.560
If you want to drop unhealthy weight you have
to incorporate a resistance training program.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.330
[Music plays]

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:58.490
&gt;&gt;male #3 on video: Craig's book which we
have here is Anatomy Muscle Building and it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.150
is available now.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:19.232
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: It's also available
on my website.

00:05:19.232 --> 00:05:20.232
[Music plays]

00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:21.232
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Kevin Rhodes.

00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:22.232
[Music plays]

00:05:22.232 --> 00:05:23.232
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: My training is like
a slap in the face followed with a loving

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:24.232
hug.

00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:25.232
[Laughter]

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:30.379
&gt;&gt;Jackie Warner on video: All of you are going
to find your inner athlete today.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.629
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: Hop!

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:32.629
Hop!

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:33.629
Hop!

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:34.629
Hop!

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:35.629
Go!

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:36.629
[Girl panting]

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:37.629
&gt;&gt;Jackie Warner on video: Sprint it back you
guys!

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.629
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: Come on hot girl!

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:39.629
This way then you're gonna sprint it out.

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:40.770
[Music plays]

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.340
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: Keep that strong
run, Mandy; you've got to power this.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.340
On!

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.630
&gt;&gt;female #3 on video: I met Craig Ramsay on
a reality fitness show and he changed my life.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.630
[Music plays]

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:06.940
&gt;&gt;female #3 on video: Craig has this amazing
ability to make you wanna work hard and make

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.569
you believe in yourself.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:09.620
[Music plays]

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.849
&gt;&gt;male #3 on video: My name is Joe.

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.790
I live in L.A. and I'm 35.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.259
I earn my living as an event producer.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:25.180
I have worked with everyone from Diane Von
Furstenberg to Doctor Dre.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:33.380
[Music plays]

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:51.680
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: Eat for fuel not
for fun.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:04.699
Follow the love I have for you until you find
it for yourself.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:05.930
You got this!

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:12.110
&gt;&gt;female #4 on video: Craig, I swear I'm gonna
puke!

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.060
If I vomit I'm gonna vomit on you!

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.421
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay on video: That's what soap
and water's for.

00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:22.421
Hate me now, love me later.

00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:23.421
[Music plays]

00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:24.421
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay, so now you know me.

00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:25.780
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Probably too much.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.389
So I really wanna concentrate, obviously,
cause it's a book club but on the book, "The

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:36.100
Anatomy of Muscle Building" and why I wrote
this specific book and why I chose this as

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.360
my first book.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.759
Let me let you in on a little secret that
fitness books are written by fitness professionals

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.889
for other fitness professionals.

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.949
I've read the majority of them out there and
they annoy me.

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:57.580
And the reason why they annoy me is because
they preach and all they do is tell you, "Okay

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.150
this is the program you need to do."

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.990
But most people don't know what that program
is or even how to start.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.879
And the gym and fitness is a very vulnerable
experience.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.010
And the majority of people, there's one that
knows the gym too, hey!

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.550
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So it's my job to analyze

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.050
a body and I'm like, "Okay he spent this many
years in the gym.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.050
This is what he does.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.050
This is his program.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.070
He's underdeveloped here."

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.229
And all that, so if you see my eye wandering
don't worry I'm not really judging

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:27.199
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: It's more out of love and

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.159
care for you.

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:35.580
So, I was saying the gym is a very vulnerable
place to be and, for all of us, even people

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.130
that know what they're doing.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.140
You still have to grow and you have to change
and you need to move past plateaus.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.700
And you need to be vulnerable enough to ask
for help with that.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:53.080
So anytime anyone reaches out to me from the
show, or just from the reputation I have,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.430
I just always feel so blessed and I tell them
what a great place that is to start from.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:04.290
And I wrote this book so I'm forcing them
to reach out by reaching out to them.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:10.620
I'm from Canada, from a small town in Canada
and I, unfortunately, have not been able to

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:16.410
spend as much time and love and attention
to my family and friends over the last ten

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.640
years because I've been in New York and L.A.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.120
So this book is able to reach the masses and
take the message of technique.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.940
Technique is so important when you go into
the gym and you have to know everything for

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.800
your body and that machine.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.920
You have to be one with that machine.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.900
So if you're doing some lame program in another
fitness book, not to demean other fitness

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.900
books by any means
[Laughter]

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.570
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: but if you're doing a lame
and program and it says, "Oh lat pull down"

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.370
okay women are saying, "What the hell is a
lat pull down?

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.880
What's the seat adjustment?

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.230
How much weight should I be using?"

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:59.830
All of that, this outlines that for you and
it really sets a program in motion.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.730
Um, let me see my notes.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.740
I have Doctor's handwriting by the way.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.740
It's horrible.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.660
I'm sure all of you do too, right?

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.180
You don't have to write, you type.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I'm behind the ages.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.890
Um, so I wanted to discuss because Google
is such an impressive company to me and I

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:26.320
admire all of you very, very much and I admire
Mike and I know the long hours, the hard hours

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.710
that he puts in to work and I wanna compare
the workouts in this book to what your work

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.920
schedule is like.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:40.750
You know how there's those days when you have
like a moderate work day where you can't really

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:46.500
give it all, all day but you're still giving
it and you're getting work done and it's taking

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.000
8 to 10 hours?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.650
So that's your moderate day, the same thing
goes with a moderate workout day.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:11:00.480
And let's talk about cardio, a moderate cardio
workout would be just slightly elevating the

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.980
heart rate for a long period of time, so like
40 minutes to an hour.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.420
That's a way of burning fat off the body and
it's a body builder's way of working out without

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:17.160
hurting his tendons and his ligaments because
his body is so expanded, so that's your moderate

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.190
workout, cardio wise, that's gonna burn fat.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:25.500
Now, when you have a deadline and you have
to work your ass off at work, the same thing

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.120
applies to the gym.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.070
That's called interval training.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.670
So it's when you give and then you have to
hold back and catch your breath and then you're

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.670
like, "Oh my gosh!"

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.420
You get your mind together and then you give
again.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:43.730
That go and pull back, pull, go and pull back
is the goal at the gym for that and in the

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.770
book is you raise your heart rate as quickly
and aggressively as possible and then you

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.190
lower it down as quickly as possible.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.580
So you wanna work against that adrenaline
rush that you're gonna feel and that's called

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.300
interval cardio which for most of you, I'm
really impressed, jeeze, Google's doing something

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.840
right cause ya'll are in shape.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.040
It's great.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.230
But interval cardio's gonna work for you then.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.570
That's what you wanna focus on.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:16.950
Putting it in terms of the book, the body
building aspect of this book is interval training.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:23.350
So it's lifting heavy for, you know, 30 seconds,
you're doing 30 second hard lifting and that's

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:28.680
gonna raise your heart rate up more than most
cardio will and then you take your break.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.720
Taking that break lowers the heart rate and
then you go back into it.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.250
All of that is outlined in the book.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:40.320
Now women, we've already talked a bit about
this like 10 minutes before hand when I should've

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.200
saved it for the presentation
[Laughter]

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:47.980
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So I'm sorry to bore you all
with it but women are very timid in starting

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:56.730
a resistance training program and unless you
have an auto immune disorder like PCOS or

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:02.020
you have, you know that you have higher testosterone
levels or if you're taking testosterone then

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:09.470
you don't have to worry about that, unfortunately,
because, Christy and Mike can vouch for this,

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.510
women have to restrict and men have to indulge.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.210
So I'm letting you in on the secret.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.350
Our goals are different.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.170
And unfortunately when I have a couple that
comes to me and I'm like, "Okay, great."

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.900
So your goal for the man is to be able to
eat the buffet and enjoy it and utilize it

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.900
on your body.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.520
And the woman, you're gonna have to restrict
cause you don't wanna be bulky, you don't

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:38.520
want to have all that kind of calorie intake
so we're gonna deplete your calorie per meal

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.050
and you're gonna have to sit there and watch
your husband just enjoy and indulge in all

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.760
of this amazing pizza.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.870
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So it's always tough to do

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.550
that and it's a tough balance.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.640
But the goals are there and they're different,
we have to understand that.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:14:00.410
Also, Mike took me on a little tour and I
have to say I'm so impressed with what Google

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:07.580
has offered you as far as snacks and as far
as meals go, wow, it's so impressive, the

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:13.380
choices that you have, the options, so obviously
all of you are already utilizing that and

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.270
the gym you have, they know what they're doing
you all look fantastic.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:23.670
Some tips that are mentioned in the book that
I would like to talk to you about is if you're

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:31.350
incorporating fitness into your work day then
how do you do it without looking like a total

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.920
jackass and a sweaty mess?

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.860
And there's tricks to this.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.540
So, after your workout, wear a black shirt
after it cause you will sweat for a couple

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.220
hours after your gym workout.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.880
You guys are able to work out during the day,
right?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.880
How does that work?

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.570
Are you, do you have certain breaks during
the day or you can just go in when please?

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.930
&gt;&gt;Male #1: We wait til our bosses are gone.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.930
[Laughter]

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:55.930
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Oh, okay, nice.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.230
&gt;&gt;Male #2: It's pretty flexible as long as
we go to the meetings we have to go to

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.930
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay, where do I apply to
work at Google?

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: This is great.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:12.540
Well, that is so supportive and I'm so impressed
with that cause breaking up your day with

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.030
workouts, even if it means like doing two
workouts like, "Okay I'm gonna separate my

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.490
cardio" you have cardio machines here too,
"Cardio and then later in the day I'm gonna

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.220
do my weights."

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:28.280
So impressive that you guys are able to work
on your physiques while you're able to work

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:34.110
and I know you guys have trainers that are
top notch and your equipment is fantastic

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.290
and it's a little different than what you'll
see in the book here but the technique is

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.290
correct.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.920
And if you're debating if they are right or
if I'm right, I'm right.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.120
Just so you know.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.060
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I'll play the video again,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.060
okay?

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.670
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: But the reason why I say that

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:54.220
is because my background with having been
a contortionist and now being a medically

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.990
trained fitness professional for twelve years
is the body has to be in correct alignment

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.280
when you execute all of these workouts.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.990
And that's what the book has.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.850
That's what the book repeatedly and annoyingly
will go over you know, feet shoulder width

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:15.330
apart, bent knees always, tuck the pelvis,
this is protecting your hip flexors and then

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.600
the chest is always elevated.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.510
The shoulders are sort of pushed down and
back which is gonna now protect your rotator

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.870
cuffs, guys that's the number one injury in
the gym for us and elbows in as much as possible,

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.230
good punching wrists.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.620
Now, taking it a step further, past the anatomy
of muscle building which it does mention,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:38.510
is then going into a body building program
which has a fall script.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.420
All this stuff will be explained once you
read the book in further detail, but fall

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:47.720
script utilizes the forearms and the arms
as well as the primary muscle of the chest

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:53.390
when you're doing, say, pushups or barbell
press.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.950
You have to know where you fit into that program
and you have to be honest with yourself.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:03.330
That's why the book outlines that and it says,
"Okay, if you can do even one day a week this

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.659
is what you do, a full body workout."

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:10.089
If you have two days a week we wanna separate
that into upper body and lower body.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:16.750
Now, I'm guessing, because all of you are
in fairly good shape, you guys do utilize

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.069
the gym?

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.419
Put up your hand if you utilize this gym.

00:17:20.419 --> 00:17:21.579
Yeah?

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:25.439
If you don't do you guys have gym options?

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:26.650
Do you work out at the gym?

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.910
&gt;&gt;Male #3: No.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.170
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: No?

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.990
Well, A you're doing really good you must
have some sort of sports background and you

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:38.850
eat properly, obviously, but what's in the
anatomy of muscle building, the pushups, the

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.230
triceps exercises, all of that can be done
from home.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.350
And if you Google Made Man, is that right
Kevin?

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.559
Made Man dot com?

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:51.299
I do an amazing jug workout.

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:54.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I handle some really heavy

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.860
jugs and I take you through a routine that
can be done from home.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.679
So there just is no excuses cause even if
you're in shape and you feel in shape the

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:09.519
benefits of putting lean muscle mass on you
are incredible.

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:12.230
They help with every aspect of your life.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:17.190
I preach it until no one wants to hear me
anymore.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:22.120
Women in the gym, and I mention this in the
book, and other trainers may tell you differently

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:29.710
but they're wrong, women have to look their
best in the gym in order to have a great workout,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.860
in order to feel their best.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:38.610
Please, even guys, don't have that mindset
of, "Oh, I'm gonna wake up and look like hell

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.770
and go into the gym."

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:44.270
Doesn't work, doesn't work like that cause
you don't feel your best, you don't look your

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.670
best and you're gonna be aware of that.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:52.870
If, dress up, I'm not saying you're gonna
be in full beat with eyelashes out to here

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.450
and you're gonna be doing "Chicago" the musical
but you definitely have to wear something

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.799
that's appropriate that makes you feel good,
even guys, it does aid in your workouts.

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:05.779
First off, does anyone have any questions
so far?

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:06.779
Don't be shy.

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:07.779
Yep?

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:08.779
&gt;&gt;female #1: Could you actually talk a little
bit more about the nutrition differences that

00:19:08.779 --> 00:19:09.779
you just got into between men and women?

00:19:09.779 --> 00:19:21.200
I know some of it can be a little more specific
when we started working together

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.659
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah.

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:30.019
&gt;&gt;female #1:there's carbs after a certain
time and things like that and the way men,

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:31.019
sort of, need to eat after a workout.

00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:33.549
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: And before, yeah, let's start
with breakfast first.

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:37.679
Is these snack bars open right in the morning
for you guys?

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:40.159
&gt;&gt;audience member: We have a full kitchen.

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.879
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Excuse me
[Laughter]

00:19:41.879 --> 00:19:43.710
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: this is amazing.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.279
Can I just get a Google pass at least?

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:48.029
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Venice Gold's, I'll just come

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:49.450
a little bit early and have a buffet
[Laughter]

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.289
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: It's great.

00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:57.120
I have the oatmeal options you have and fruit,
you have fresh fruit, correct?

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.380
So that's an incredible start to your morning.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.651
If there's protein options, didn't I see hardboiled
eggs?

00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:03.970
&gt;&gt;audience member: Yeah we usually have hard
boiled eggs.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.360
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Perfect.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.840
So starting your breakfast off, when you wake
up in the morning you should have it within

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.769
a half hour of waking up.

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:17.830
If you don't and you don't eat you're slowing
down your metabolism.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.139
Also, if you're taking a sip of coffee prior
to putting food in your system you're slowing

00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:23.960
down your metabolism.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:29.690
That ring around here is near impossible to
get rid of unless you have those fitness model

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.049
tips.

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:34.450
And how many of you drink coffee in the morning
on an empty stomach?

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.500
Yeah?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:42.529
That's slowing down your metabolism like crazy
and it packs on fat around the mid section.

00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:47.120
The same with going without eating for 3 hours
and I'm not saying you should indulge every

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.120
3 hours.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.320
As we talked about with men and women, especially
women, you have to break up your meals as

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.970
if they're snacks.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.100
And I don't like to get in the habit of calorie
counting because women can be obsessed with

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.380
that.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:06.090
What you should know is the good foods and
the bad foods and the ugly and the ugly is

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.090
sugar.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.120
Sugar is just not a necessity and if you think
fake sugars like Splenda and all of that are

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.210
gonna be fine, they're not because they're
gonna drive you insane mentally because it's

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.039
gonna perpetuate more sugar cravings.

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:22.169
So you just need to cut out that crap.

00:21:22.169 --> 00:21:23.820
Unfortunately there's just no way around it.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:30.559
You can have it every 10 days or so, a cheat
meal is fantastic and once you're at the fitness

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:35.310
level of most of you, actually to be honest,
then you can have a cheat day and then we

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.230
just go crazy on it and we love it, right?

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:44.210
But the trick is to get back on track after
you have that horribly indulgent day.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:49.470
That's where your body gets back into a shock
mode where it's like, "Oh, alright, then we

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.720
don't need to store into this fat."

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.090
We deplete it and we're back on track.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.950
And you do that every 10 days, it's a health
thing.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.480
It has nothing to do with just the mind, it's
a mind and body thing that's necessary to

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.740
do.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.999
So women, the breakfast, ideally you have
it right here.

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:12.220
Your oatmeal, your eggs, your fresh fruit
and peanut butter, peanut butter is gonna

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.549
be your best friend, women especially.

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:21.539
When we incorporate a good fat like peanut
butter and avocados with really good carb

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:23.490
it slows down the digestion of carb.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:29.249
So, say I had peanut butter with oatmeal,
normally that would take 40 minutes to shock

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:33.299
my system and it would be depleted, right?

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:38.450
And then we could get hungry sooner and we'll
have ups and downs.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.730
You'll find a chemical change in your body.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.029
If you have peanut butter with that it slows
down the digestion of that carb.

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:51.070
So now you're being fed, slowly, food over
a two hour period instead of 40 minutes.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.960
So that's why they say eat good fats to lose
weight.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.070
It's good fats with carbs.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.980
One online training client, cause I offer
online training through fit orbit, and all

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:07.200
of that is outlined with, they utilize the
book by the way, the workouts in the book,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.330
but the food program one client reached out
to me and she said I've actually gained some

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.490
weight and all I'm having is, and she showed
me a picture of a chicken and avocado at night

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.289
and I said, "Oh, honey, you're taking initiative
too much."

00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:26.399
Follow exactly what it is because you're taking
in more than 44 grams of protein in one sitting

00:23:26.399 --> 00:23:29.299
and anytime we do that we store it as fat.

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:34.039
So if you think, "Oh, I'm gonna have that
Atkins and I'm gonna go crazy on protein,

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:37.690
well if you, your body can only digest so
much at once.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:42.410
That's why we break it up into meals every
two to three hours of small portions.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:46.799
If you indulge like that it's stored as fat
and then she's having avocado but there's

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:51.450
no carb to slowly digest it so she's shocking
herself with fat too.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:56.789
So the poor girl's trying to do well but she's
taking too much initiative.

00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:58.880
What else?

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.140
&gt;&gt;female #1: And the timing of that, like
at night maybe but throughout the day starting

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.200
with breakfast.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.559
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah, well carb depleting
because a lot of people will be like, "Oh

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:12.840
I wanna lose weight and I gotta cut carbs
out of my diet."

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.340
No, carbs is energy, protein is repair.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.929
So remember that, where do you need most of
your energy?

00:24:17.929 --> 00:24:24.740
In the morning and afternoon, I'd be surprised
if you're running marathons at night but if

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.379
you are then your training's gonna be slightly
different where you're gonna need those carbs

00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:32.779
for energy, and any marathon runner knows
this, is you're gonna have those carbs later

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:33.779
in the evening.

00:24:33.779 --> 00:24:35.960
Otherwise, what you wanna do is restrict them.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:41.720
Same thing with losing weight or gaining muscle,
you still don't need to have that excessive

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.840
carbs after like 3 pm.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.460
So you wanna start cutting them out.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:54.600
Snack, women definitely, and men, you want
nuts, you want, you want to have a carb like

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.539
a multi grain cracker with humus, perfect,
great.

00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:59.659
Vegetables, do you guys have those options
here?

00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:01.070
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yeah.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.480
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.679
What other options, what do you guys like
to eat in the snacks here?

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:08.080
&gt;&gt;Female #2: [inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.620
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay, cut the bananas, no
more bananas.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.159
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Bananas are way too high in

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:19.669
sugar and unless you're eating it before you
workout, great, you're gonna utilize that,

00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:24.889
that sugar for energy, otherwise stick with
berries, blueberries, stuff like that.

00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:29.080
My big guy in the back, how often are you
hitting the snack bar?

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:35.039
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I sit by the junk food thing
[Laughter]

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.039
&gt;&gt;Male #4: it's often but it's not

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:37.039
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So the junk food is like what?

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.039
Sugar stuff?

00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:39.039
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Yeah, it's like candy bars

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.039
&gt;&gt;Male #5: there's only one

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:41.039
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Oreos

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.039
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay and when do you work
out during the day?

00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:43.039
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Usually in the morning.

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.350
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Usually in the morning?

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.429
So if someone works out, and you lift heavy?

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:48.789
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Sometimes.

00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:50.159
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah?

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:56.580
If someone is working out to intensity and
they aren't having as much food, this should

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.169
not go on video by the way
[Laughter]

00:25:58.169 --> 00:26:01.059
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Cause I'm telling you how
to live an indulgent life

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:04.340
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: But you can have more sugar

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.340
intake.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.490
So the less food you have the more sugar you're
able to have.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:14.879
I don't wanna promote that and unless you
have a really healthy existence with incredible

00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:17.169
workouts then you can go down that route.

00:26:17.169 --> 00:26:22.789
That's why when you go over to Venice Gold's
you'll see cookies and you'll see brownies

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:26.009
being sold and you're like, "What the hell
is this?

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:27.710
This is a health gym."

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:32.659
Well it's because they need that sugar for
energy because if they went starving for 3

00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:36.809
hours, we don't wanna have a brown rice and
chicken meal cause it's gonna be too slow

00:26:36.809 --> 00:26:41.879
to digest, we want that fast acting sugar
to give us a sugar rush to be able to hit

00:26:41.879 --> 00:26:43.640
our workout really hard.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:50.980
Let me look at the book, I wanna get back
to the book and discuss these options in here.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.990
I have no skin!

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.990
Ah!

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.360
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: The stretching.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.179
We're gonna talk about stretching quickly.

00:26:59.179 --> 00:27:03.759
It's fine if you have cramp and you're like,
"Oh I need to stretch" or before you do that

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:06.710
exercise you can lightly engage in a stretch.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.119
Do not over do it.

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:11.539
Your body is like an elastic band, if you
overstretch that you're not gonna be able

00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:13.960
to get a proper contraction in your workouts.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.960
And what this book promotes is a proper stretch
and a proper contraction which you always

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.299
have to have with every single rep, every
single set.

00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:24.980
If you don't, then you're not changing the
shape of your body.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.159
So make sure you stretch.

00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:29.879
If you're stretching aggressively it's after
your workout.

00:27:29.879 --> 00:27:34.910
Now women, the exception is if you wear high
heels, but there's no dress code of high heels

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.910
here right?

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:36.989
No, we're pretty laid back?

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:39.269
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Well, if you do wear high

00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:44.450
heels often you wanna stretch out those calves
before you begin any kind of cardio program,

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.669
okay?

00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:51.070
Warm ups, always warm up the body, what you
wanna do is send blood flow to the body, that's

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:57.299
gonna help you prevent injury, that's why
we warm up for anywhere from five minutes

00:27:57.299 --> 00:28:02.320
to 20 minutes prior to any kind of weight
resistance but you always wanna combine both

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320
of them.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320
Yes?

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.830
&gt;&gt;Male #6: So you have a note here that the
best form of cardio is running the stairs

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.830
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yes.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:13.830
&gt;&gt;Male #6: If you could compare those to elliptical

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.830
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Oh gosh, I'm gonna get in
trouble again.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:15.960
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Christy might know what I'm

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.600
talking about.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:23.730
I have to say my opinion with this and it's
the correct one, remember we talked about

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:24.730
that?

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.340
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: But the elliptical machine

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:32.279
is absolutely useless unless you have a knee
or an ankle or a lower back injury.

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:38.580
The reason is I go into a gym and I look at
these people that will, and I'm not judging

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.700
them, please don't think that it's a judgment,
but if you gravitate towards the elliptical

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:49.200
machine it means one of two things, either
you're injured and you know what you're doing

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.619
or you don't know what you're doing, you're
insecure and you jump on the elliptical machine

00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:58.780
for 40 minutes and call it a day because it's
the easiest machine to get started and it's

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.350
the easiest machine to do.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:07.330
So you're choosing the easiest machine in
a gym which is gonna give you the least results,

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.330
but guess what?

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.559
You're there and you're putting the time in
anyways you may as well go crazy on it and

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:17.749
go for what's going to challenge you the most
cause that's gonna change your body the most.

00:29:17.749 --> 00:29:23.619
An elliptical machine takes the weight off
of the legs and the whole idea and point of

00:29:23.619 --> 00:29:27.620
cardio, proper cardio program, is utilizing
the weight you have.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:34.169
Like for instance Kevin, his weight loss journey,
lugging around extra weight when you need

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:37.149
to get rid of it, that's hard to do.

00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:44.110
It's equivalent to me giving one of you skinny
fit people a 45 pound plate and hold onto

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.510
it and do the same cardio.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.909
You're gonna be exhausted.

00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:49.590
That's what an obese person feels like.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:56.720
But you put them on a stairs and their going,
lugging it around it's gonna be a much harder

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.360
workout with incredible, quicker results if
you attack the stairs.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.389
Stairs, treadmill incline, if you feel like
you're having a lazy day go on the steepest

00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:13.019
incline possible and try not to hold on, only
10 seconds of every minute hold on, otherwise

00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:15.730
just dig your heels down and climb that mountain.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.309
It's gonna do you a world of good.

00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:19.559
Do not take the easy route.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:21.039
Always challenge yourself.

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.899
Does that answer it?

00:30:22.899 --> 00:30:24.110
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Yep.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.320
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.549
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Related to that you were talking
about interval training with weights.

00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:32.244
What would you recommend for interval training
with, say, running?

00:30:32.244 --> 00:30:33.244
Pumping up the feet?

00:30:33.244 --> 00:30:34.244
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: For the cardio?

00:30:34.244 --> 00:30:38.759
Yeah, what you wanna find is the amount of
time that it takes to really elevate your

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:39.759
heart rate.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:43.120
So I'm guessing for you it'd be like a 30
second sprint.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.309
So say you're just on a treadmill, do you
run?

00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:47.019
Are you okay with running?

00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:48.840
Knees good, all that?

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.700
Okay, well let's use first treadmill as an
example.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.360
So treadmill and this is in the book as well
it'll talk about it, you know the treadmill

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.049
with handles on the side?

00:30:58.049 --> 00:31:02.929
So we start with a two minute just easy walk
and then we bump it up to a fast speed that's

00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:04.450
gonna really elevate your heart rate.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.340
So I'm guessing like 6.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:12.009
5, 7.0 for you, so you're running for 30 seconds,
you find the sides and you hop off carefully.

00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:17.299
And that hop off is forcing you to catch your
breath which is lowering your heart rate.

00:31:17.299 --> 00:31:18.950
So you calm yourself down.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.330
Don't get wrapped up in the analyze, women
analyze everything in life too.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.109
I'm a huge feminist so don't worry I'm not
attacking any of you but what you do is you

00:31:27.109 --> 00:31:31.220
analyze the situation, you go in your body
and you make yourself miserable.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.390
And what you need to do is separate that,
think about other things, trust the technique

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:40.710
you have because you're studying my book and
then, then you can get through that program

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.309
without over analyzing.

00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:43.730
Over analyzing will exhaust you.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:48.590
And then you grab onto the sides and you hop
back on for 30 seconds and then you do it

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.590
again.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.590
You repeat.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.830
That's a perfect way of interval training.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:57.510
If 7.0 isn't giving your heart enough of a
challenge, the heart rate, then you have to

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.830
bump it up, bump it up, bump it up, bump it
up all the way to 12 speed.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:06.350
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Do you recommend waiting a length
of time for the heart rate to go down or does

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.510
it lower right away?

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:11.299
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I'm guessing for you that
it would take 30 seconds after hopping off

00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:12.299
to catch your breath.

00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:16.710
If it takes longer then I think those intervals
are too aggressive, then you need to lower

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.039
the speed.

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:24.059
So raise it up and lower it down and monitor
it and you can control your heart rate to

00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:25.059
lower.

00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:29.100
If you relax the jaw slightly when you're
working out, and it talks about this in every

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.090
single exercise of the book, always have that
space in the jaw which is gonna allow you

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:39.129
to relax the back of the neck, which is gonna
allow you to breath properly.

00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:45.350
The majority of people in the gym don't know
how to breath, believe or not, and we don't

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.200
wanna seem vulnerable and out of breath so
we hide it, right?

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:54.289
If you're forced to breath properly and your
diaphragm to work, if you relax that jaw it's

00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:57.279
gonna actually lower your heart rate quicker.

00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:58.980
So it's a trick of the trade.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.380
150 dollars please, that's my consultation.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: fee.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.480
Any other questions?

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.480
I like questions.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:12.379
Also, if you relax the jaw and the diaphragms
working properly it's gonna take the tension

00:33:12.379 --> 00:33:13.379
out of the neck.

00:33:13.379 --> 00:33:18.131
You know how women, you're always saying,
"Oh, I don't wanna build big traps, my neck

00:33:18.131 --> 00:33:19.131
muscles."

00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:20.131
All that?

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:23.580
It'll be out of the equation if you do that
and then it will relax the shoulders which

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.690
will protect the rotator cli, uh, rotator

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:26.690
&gt;&gt;audience member: Cuff.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:31.110
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Cuff, thank you and it will
also allow your diaphragm to work so you'll

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.730
be able to sing some great notes
[Laughter]

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.759
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: like that while you're working
out.

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:35.970
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Any other questions?

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:36.970
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Now everyone's shy.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.519
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah, don't be shy.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.970
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Oh, here we go.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.899
&gt;&gt;female #3: So, um, about routine.

00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:45.369
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah.

00:33:45.369 --> 00:33:49.659
&gt;&gt;female #3: How often should you change your
routine cause there's always these talks about

00:33:49.659 --> 00:33:50.659
muscle confusion.

00:33:50.659 --> 00:33:55.220
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Of course, yeah, when you
become familiar with it which usually takes

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.600
6 to 8 weeks when it becomes boring.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:03.029
Usually women get bored with programs sooner
than guys cause women are more capable of

00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:06.980
processing those things and perfecting them
quicker.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.980
No offense guys.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.330
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Just saying it like it is,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.810
I'm one of ya, sorta.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.400
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So with you you're gonna need

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.430
to change every 6 to 8 weeks.

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:21.650
And what you always wanna do is make sure
you're still combining a cardio and a resistance

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.650
program.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:27.540
If it's only cardio you will get in a routine
as a woman to only burn calories from that

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.950
day and not change the shape of your body.

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:34.840
If you're a woman that thinks, "Oh I'm just
gonna do cardio" you're only burning calories

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840
from the day.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.880
You are not changing your physique.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.750
And it's all about the ego people.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.590
There's not one person that comes to me and
if they are they're lying if they say, "I'm

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:51.030
really concerned about my health and I really
would like to breath better and have balance

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.030
and all that."

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.390
I know, it's, am I allowed to say bullshit?

00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:55.891
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: It's bullshit.

00:34:55.891 --> 00:34:56.891
It's all about the ego.

00:34:56.891 --> 00:35:00.440
You wanna look better and then that will change
and improve your life and, of course, your

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.600
health.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.340
Just being honest.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.340
Any other questions?

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:10.340
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Sorry this is a question, other
sort of cardio interval routines you can do

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.770
not just on the treadmill but maybe some of
the other machines.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.810
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Absolutely.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:25.350
One of my favorite cardio weight training
combination exercises is on a stationary bike,

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.840
combining dumbbell training with the bike.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:35.850
So if you only have 20 minutes, 30 minutes,
this is the perfect form of cardio interval

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.600
training for all of you in this room.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:46.890
Stationary bike, dumbbells and a routine of
30 second intervals, you're gonna do shoulder

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:52.411
presses 30 seconds, shoulder front raises
30 seconds, side push outs 30 seconds, bicep

00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:58.540
curl 30 seconds, triceps behind the head 30
seconds and then you rest for a minute.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.540
That's your rest, that's lowering your heart
rate and then you go back into it.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.100
That routine in combination will shred your
body.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.330
Absolutely shred your body and pack on upper
body mass for guys because we do have the

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:16.320
ability to raise testosterone levels in our
body, unlike women, so we can build our upper

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320
body.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.680
Women, you don't have to worry about that.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.620
When the man does a bike in the high resistance
and we're talking for women it's anywhere

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:31.410
from 8 to level, 8 to level 10, for men it's
12 to 20.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:37.920
If you're doing resistance training with the
legs and cardio with a really high resistance

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.820
you're bumping up your natural testosterone.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:46.140
Testosterone is what makes our body composition.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:51.170
It's gonna tell us how big and how cut and
how much fat we're gonna be able to lose so

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.640
you wanna give yourself a fighting chance
by raising those testosterone levels.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.740
So that, again, goes back to our cardio, why
choose elliptical when you can work the leg

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:05.310
muscles and actually raise your natural testosterone
levels with stairs or with the bike on heavy

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.500
resistance?

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:11.030
Same thing with weight training, guys you
always wanna do legs once a week even though

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.030
we dread them.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:16.250
The reason why we dread them is cause we have
that testosterone rush which makes us have

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.250
that fight or flight.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:21.180
So it's panicky where you're like this and
that's relaxing the jaw, calming yourself

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:26.050
down and focusing and removing yourself from
the body to be able to get through the program.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:31.770
Then any body part that is deficient for guys
that you're like, "Oh, I have small shoulders"

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:37.240
well then on the shoulder day you always incorporate
a leg exercise to the extreme, that's raising

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:43.970
your testosterone levels which are gonna enable
that underdeveloped body part to build.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.440
Another 150 dollars please.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.570
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: That's a really good tip and

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.770
it's in the book
[Laughter]

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.630
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: "The Anatomy of Muscle Building"

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.090
&gt;&gt;Male #8: So I actually have a quick question.

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:58.250
So on a leg day, would you still do cardio
on that day?

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.320
What would you suggest?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.080
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Really, really good question.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:08.930
You only, I only advise a warm up of like
6 minutes or so just to get the blood flowing

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.160
to the body and no cardio on that day.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:18.280
Doing legs is such a cardio experience anyway
with the elevation of your heart rate going

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.920
up and down and up and down that it's not
worth it.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:28.070
It's over training and you're not taking in
enough calories to justify that kind of workout.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:33.301
&gt;&gt;female #4: Just for men?

00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:34.301
Or women and men?

00:38:34.301 --> 00:38:39.290
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: For men it's also, yeah it
would be for women and men but for men it's

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.650
also a testosterone thing, they're gonna collapse.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:47.520
They're not gonna have enough, what's called,
creatine and ATP levels in their body.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.300
They don't have enough so they're actually
gonna fall down.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.670
A woman is never gonna fall down, by the way.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.830
This is my difference with training men and
women, men will inform me of when they're

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:02.040
exhausted and when they're gonna collapse,
a woman will go until her bicep rips.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.210
And then all she'll do is go, "Oh, I'm kind
hurt a little bit.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.410
Do you think I should be concerned?"

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:10.980
And her like bicep's down here.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So that's just the difference

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.460
between men and women.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.690
Women aren't taking in enough calories to
justify that kind of workout.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.770
If you're spending too much time in the gym
it's useless.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:25.670
You need to really focus and do it to intensity
and you make sure you eat before and after.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:32.380
Another eating tip, especially for men, men
that body build you wanna eat a white starchy

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:37.620
carb before your workout and afterwards for
energy.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.850
That's okay, we work out hard to indulge in
life.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:46.250
So all this crap, and I can say bullshit,
so the bullshit of not having white potatoes

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:51.510
and not having pizza and all that stuff, it's
not true, your workouts just have to be intense

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:57.640
like in "The Anatomy of Muscle Building" that
justify that and utilize it.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.490
That's what we wanna do; we wanna work out
hard to utilize that.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:01.490
Yes?

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:03.660
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Does it matter what time of day
you work out?

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.760
Whether it's before breakfast or dinner or
whatever?

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:11.640
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Never before breakfast because
it's actually only, okay let's explain it

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:19.080
this way, you never get in a car without having
proper gas in it, right?

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.430
So your body, if it's not fueled, what is
it running on?

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:28.330
It's not running on calories, it's not running
on food intake, so what happens to our bodies?

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.740
Is anyone under 23 years old here?

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.740
No?

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:39.030
Great, so everyone 23 and older, what happens
to our body is we tap into muscle.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.580
Unfortunately we don't tap into fat when we
work out on empty stomach.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.690
We're too old everyone.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.000
I hate to break it to ya, I'm with you though.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.270
We're too old to do that nonsense so we eat
away at our muscle mass that we're trying

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.150
to put on and we convert it into fat.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.420
That's a good way of thinking about it, smaller
here, bigger here.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.560
You need food to work out properly.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.040
So what was the exact question again?

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.430
&gt;&gt;Male #9: What time of day is best?

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.860
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: What time of day.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.990
When you're eating properly you wanna make
sure you have enough calories in your system,

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:14.510
and I'm not saying eat a buffet before you
work out because if you're new to the gym

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.620
that will make you nauseous, definitely.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:23.140
So at least an hour or two before your workout
is fine and a healthy meal of maybe 500 calories

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:28.210
for guys, 300 calories for women, around that
range and whenever you're gonna have the most

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.210
energy.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:30.210
Everyone is so different.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:35.140
Or with the demands of work, if you can't
work out until the evening well then that's

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.770
your workout.

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.680
And if that's the case then we're gonna adjust
your carbs and we're gonna make sure that

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.320
you still surround yourself with carbs so
you have proper energy to work out.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.790
If it's in the morning after your breakfast,
great, if it's twice in day like here we talked

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:54.190
about, if you could do half hour or 20 minutes
of cardio and then quickly change and go,

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.200
is that same fit guy or another fit guy?

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.790
&gt;&gt;audience: Same fit guy.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.840
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: He's just going, yeah, he's
going in circles.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.300
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Good observation.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.031
He's part of the running group isn't he?

00:42:06.031 --> 00:42:08.500
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Just around the block.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:14.170
So, yeah, cardio broken up and then you go
back and you do your heavy weight lifting.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:19.380
Ideal, incredible, if you guys could do that,
wow, I told you I'm signing up to Google.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.990
Can you get me an application, Mike, afterwards?

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.990
Thank you.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.630
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I don't know if you'll have

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:25.630
me but
[Laughs]

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.050
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: After this
[Laughs]

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.410
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: we'll see.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.910
Any other questions?

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:34.210
Do you guys have fitness groups here?

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.770
Yep?

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:41.640
&gt;&gt;Male #10: So you mentioned you were a contortionist

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.940
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Do you want me to prove it?

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.940
[Laughter]

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.940
&gt;&gt;Male #10: No, that's alright, I believe
you.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.300
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: My next book is a stretching
book that comes out May 15th and it's the

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.350
first time ever that I actually get to show
that off.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.050
So I'll see you back after May 15th and we'll
do that.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.050
[Laughter]

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.850
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Sounds good, I was actually wondering
what part that plays in, you mentioned don't

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:01.840
stretch a lot before you work out, but I wondered
what part being flexible plays in actually

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.120
not getting injured kind of in general.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.040
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Absolutely you have to have
a flexible body but you have to know when

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.320
to properly stretch those muscles.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.010
As I said, working out with weights and cardio
is a contraction.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.830
If you elongate that muscle too much you're
gonna be flopping all around.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.830
And I trained a lot of Broadway shows, I did
a hand full of Broadway and I was the go to

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:28.410
guy in Broadway and let me tell you, every
single dancer I have I have to change their

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.280
mind frame, their mind of thinking.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.390
You know how we talked about elliptical; people
gravitate toward ellipticals for 40 minutes?

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:39.480
Dancers gravitate just toward just holding
their leg straight up and stretching, overdoing

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.330
it because that's their insecurity.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:44.380
They don't know what they're doing so they're
gonna stretch cause they know they do it well

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.110
and they're gonna get a date out of it as
well, right?

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.270
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: It depends on what gym but,

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:54.240
so, with you, you still have to obtain a flexible
body.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:01.260
If you work out to intensity and you don't
have time to at work here and stretch there,

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.470
then even at the office, in my next book and
I think there's a couple of stretches in here

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:10.800
but, again, we don't wanna look like a jackass
at the workplace and have our leg up in our

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.020
cubicle, what we wanna do is very discrete
private stretches which can be done from the

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.700
comforts of your own chair.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.040
Which will be in the next book which I'll
definitely talk about when we return, absolutely,

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:28.430
and if you have a hard workout, in a hot bath
where you're raising your body temperature,

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:33.440
ideal way of stretching over your legs and
being able to break up that acid that makes

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.270
your hamstrings really tight.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:43.420
After the workout, yeah, always, always, always,
please.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.900
Any other questions?

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.090
Yes, Sir?

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:53.250
&gt;&gt;Male #11: So I came in late so just tell
me if I missed this question but I noticed

00:44:53.250 --> 00:45:02.150
when stretching with a trainer my leg can
go so far back but if I just relax and let

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:07.320
them push instead of a pulsating motion it
keeps going farther and farther back but if

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.250
I myself am trying to do it it's a very limited
motion.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:15.090
And it was mentioned that that was mainly
just a frame of mind thing that the muscle

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:20.670
is actually capable of tremendous kind of
relaxation when it's relaxed.

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.130
What's your thoughts on the matter?

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.740
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay, that's a PNF stretch.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.910
So that's an assisted stretch that he's doing,
correct, with you?

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:28.910
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Yeah.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:32.480
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: It's a different form of stretching;
you need to do all types of stretching.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.900
There's static, there's dynamic and there's
a PNF stretch which is where a trainer will

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:43.640
assist you and he'll even ask you for, um,
to resist him then he'll take you a little

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.370
further, that's just a different form of stretching
which you can do on your own with a towel.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:53.060
So one of those hand towels, if you're on
your back and your leg is extended up, you

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:57.660
can do the exact same thing holding the towel
underneath your leg and then pushing against

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:03.050
it for a good 10 seconds and then releasing
it for another 20 to 30 seconds and that will

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:08.010
take the range of movement further which is
a great form of stretching but it should be

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:15.890
usually advised or with someone that's a professional
or a friend utilizing my next book "The Anatomy

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.370
of Stretching" on May 15th
[Laughter]

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.370
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: which will guide you through
that.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.160
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Does that cross over, does that
help for other kinds of range of motion where

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.930
you are physically moving your leg or is that
independent?

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.580
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Oh yes, your intimacy in the
evening, is that what you're talking about?

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.260
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Or am I going to a place that's

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.790
inappropriate at Google?

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.900
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: It helps in all forms of your

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.820
life to have a flexible body, yeah.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.721
It helps with your relationships
[Laughter]

00:46:41.721 --> 00:46:47.330
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: It helps with your daily life;
sitting in a chair, repetitive movements,

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:51.890
having a flexible body is such a necessity.

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:59.060
And your lower back, you know your problem
areas and we forget to move and to make our

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.060
bodies feel good.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:05.880
So taking a 15 second stretch break is gonna
make all the difference with, even with your,

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.220
your blood flow, your circulation.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.290
Standing up and giving a stretch where needed.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:17.280
If you hold your body correctly, that this
book really addresses, then you will have

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.590
less injury and less tightness in your muscles.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:23.590
Any other questions?

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:24.590
Yes?

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.490
[Audience member mumbles]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Oh, Mike has the mic.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.490
[Laughs]

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.350
&gt;&gt;Male #12: So most of the exercises

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.010
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I thought that joke, I'm sorry;
I thought that joke would've gone over better

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.130
with you guys at Google.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Mike with the mic.

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.460
[Laughter]

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.460
&gt;&gt;Male #12: It took me a second.

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.460
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.460
[Laughs]

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.260
&gt;&gt;Male #12: So most of the exercises in here
are actually using free weights, what's your

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:45.740
thoughts on sort of like belt or cable driven
machines?

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.960
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: You guys have cable machines
correct?

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.830
They're incredible, they're great.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:58.690
I think that the dumbbells and barbells are
a really good way to start and to gain your

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:00.620
stability.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:06.080
They help with stability and your technique
before you move to cables because cables can

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.340
help you cheat a little bit more by range
of movement.

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:16.030
But, all exercise is great and there's not
one way, like I'm not judging weights and

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:20.570
cables as much as I'm judging the cardio,
still a good question.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.770
But if it's done properly, the cable machines
are fantastic.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:30.960
And machines in general are really good to
do but no one program is advised or should

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.790
be advised and, like you said, we need to
mix it up and we need to change it up.

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:41.600
So I'll take my clients through working a
set of dumbbells and then they'll do a barbell

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.730
press and then we'll do cable machines and
then we'll do seated, guided smith machines,

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:47.790
things like that.

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:50.120
Yeah, utilize everything that you have.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:54.330
If this is what you have here don't judge
it just do it, if that makes sense.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:49:00.920
If you don't have anything and you're at home
you can get, ah, my ultimate perfect workout

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.920
DVD.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.080
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: which I'm the perfect push

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:09.120
up demonstrator guy so, now it's at Costco
and stuff like that.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.370
My DVD's there utilize the proper push up.

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:17.970
If you even do pushups in the correct form,
you're working all of these secondary muscles

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:21.490
more that what most people do as primary muscles
in the gym.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:27.390
Meaning, if you have proper form, your whole
body's gonna be built from that pushup.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:28.910
Any other questions?

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:33.070
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I have a question.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.910
Can I get a Google shirt after this?

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.080
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I really like them.

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.940
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I want the gay one though,

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.840
with the rainbow flag that's there.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.840
[Laughter]

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.840
&gt;&gt;audience member: That's just the regular
one.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.840
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Oh, it is?

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.840
[Laughter]
[Claps]

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.840
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yay!

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.840
Google!

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.590
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Good Company.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.620
Yeah, this is the it gets better campaign
for Google.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: That's what I need.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.251
I'll do a PSA for Google.

00:49:56.251 --> 00:49:57.251
Great.

00:49:57.251 --> 00:49:58.251
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I think that's

00:49:58.251 --> 00:49:59.251
&gt;&gt;Male #13: We could get you a Google circle
shirt.

00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:04.010
They have these white shirts with different
colored circles.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.250
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Well I love that.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.290
I'm Canadian so we love our free shit so keep
it coming, that's great thank you.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.440
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: I'm gonna eat buffet snacks

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.620
after this, trust me.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: You'll be missing oatmeal

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.990
for a week.

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.990
[Laughter]

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:19.420
&gt;&gt;Male #14: So I have another question about
nutrition.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.420
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.880
&gt;&gt;Male #14: What should you eat to gain or
not to lose weight?

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:32.830
Whenever I eat healthy I have too few calories
at the end of the day and I'm losing weight

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:38.370
and at the same time I don't wanna eat, like,
that my blood sugar spikes too much.

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:43.520
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Right, of course, so glycemic
index, have you heard of that?

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Yeah.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.520
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Yeah.

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:51.730
So Google those and make sure that you're
eating the most appropriate calorie consuming

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.490
foods possible.

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:59.710
That will help you in losing weight if someone's
goal is to lose weight, if your goal is to

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:05.830
gain weight what you're improperly doing,
if you're not seeing results and you're eating

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:09.830
a lot, is your workouts aren't intense enough
and you're not lifting heavy enough.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:15.230
A guy has got to lift heavy in order to pack
on muscle mass cause you're ripping the muscle,

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.230
right?

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:19.200
You're ripping the fibers and then you're
healing them with your food.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:23.030
So if you're not ripping them properly with
the proper stretch and a contraction with

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:29.150
every single movement then we're not changing
the shape of the muscle and we have to fill

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:33.800
that, uh, the damage that we do with proper
eating so you have to make sure that you're

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.570
not having breaks in your day and you have
to eat every three hours.

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:45.510
Think of it as meal, snack, meal, snack, meal,
snack, like you can do this, please don't

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:51.240
get in the habit of thinking that a protein
shake or a protein bar is a meal, right Kevin?

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.240
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.630
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Kevin just buried his head.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.940
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: His food log with often have,

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:02.660
"Oh I had a Myoplex shake for dinner" and
I'm like, "It's not a meal, that's a snack!"

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:10.400
There's not enough healthy material in that
food to process things out of your body.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.250
It's gonna get stuck, you need to have foods,
you need to have fiber, you need to have salad.

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:16.760
Is that answering your question?

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760
Yeah?

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.770
Ask me something more specific with it.

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.820
Like for you, that pertains to you.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.470
Ask me something like what; just ask me something
that's more specific.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:33.150
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Well, I mean, like in general
I'm trying to, like I'm cutting out white

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:39.110
rice, potatoes and more bread to prevent that
my blood sugar spikes too much and then I'm

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.110
losing

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.410
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Do you have a problem with
that?

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:42.410
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Yeah.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:43.410
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:44.410
That's fine.

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:47.410
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Yeah, so I've just been like losing
weight and weight like constantly.

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:49.440
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So more protein sources.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:53.510
Your protein levels, do you know how much
protein you're having per meal?

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:54.510
Have you broken that down?

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:55.510
&gt;&gt;Male #14: No.

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:56.510
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: No?

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:57.760
Start paying attention to that.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:03.880
&gt;&gt;Male #14: But I mainly, by now, I'm eating
like meats with vegetables all the time.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:10.260
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Okay, I mean, that's great
and you will lose muscle mass if you're not

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.680
having a proper carb intake but if that's
a medical issue then you need to address that

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.360
before you need to address your physique,
if that makes sense.

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:24.720
I would get that on track and then you can
sustain your muscle mass with more protein,

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.390
more proper proteins, so just more often,
every two hours.

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:29.650
You're not eating every two hours, correct?

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:30.650
&gt;&gt;Male #14: No.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:31.650
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Right, so if you have

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:32.650
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Sometimes I'm skipping meals

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:35.580
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: See, that's what's gonna do
it to you.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.580
You're gonna lose weight.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:40.560
Even if you work out hard and you don't eat
properly, it's not gonna change the shape

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.650
of your body.

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.180
Food has to be a given.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.140
You know how people say you should start with
food or food has to be included?

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.950
No, food is a given.

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.810
It's like talent on Broadway, talents a given.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.440
It's, then it's the other things that are
important.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.110
So the same thing with you, every two hours
you're gonna have to have protein sources.

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:01.730
Hard boiled eggs here, grab hard boiled eggs
every two hours, just start feeding into that.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:06.930
It gets boring but try and separate yourself
with that relationship with food and that

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:12.080
10 days, that's where I want you to go shit
crazy on it without any carb, obviously.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.940
So have those options, okay?

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:21.560
&gt;&gt;Male #15: You're much too young to have
this concern but have you noticed any change

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:28.000
of how you metabolize and build and maintain
muscle as you get older?

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: The majority of my clients
are 40 plus and the best results that I've

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.120
had with clients are heading into their 50s
or their 50s.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.170
How old are you?

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:41.970
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Is that a,

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:43.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Write it down on a piece of

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.380
paper.

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.490
&gt;&gt;Male #15: Old enough to know better.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:46.490
[Laughter]

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:52.030
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: So, the body changes, the
workouts have to change as you go into a different

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.080
phase.

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:59.850
A lot of guys go back to old school, what
worked for them in their twenties, the same

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:03.280
as women always judge themselves with how
they looked in high school, "Oh but I was

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.540
this weight in high school and I fit into
this."

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.540
You can't do it.

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.340
Your body has been around and been lugging
itself around and climbing up stairs.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.770
Your muscle density is different so you're
never ever gonna weigh that same but your

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:18.140
physique can be the same cause muscle will
condense and look tighter.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:23.650
So for guys, we have that mentality of working
out the same way we did back in the day and

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:24.650
you can't.

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:31.050
As soon as you hit a point about 45, 50, I
find, this is a stereotype, but it exists

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.960
enough that I can recommend that you change
it to a burn program.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:40.440
We have pumps and we have burns and what I
mean by that is, say in this, "Anatomy of

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:45.690
Muscle Building" it will say okay you're doing
12 heavy sets, no, for you it's gonna be a

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.890
minute, how many can we get in a minute by
lowering the weight?

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:53.440
So you're doing rows like this and it's more
of a pumping rather than when you go through

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.680
the motion, when you body build, pump, pump,
your heart rate is elevated for the whole

00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.020
duration of the exercise.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.800
Remember how I talked about intervals, cardios
great for you guys?

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:08.030
Not the same for someone that is heading into
that age bracket, what we wanna do is your

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:12.500
workouts, heart rate elevated the whole time
which means you have to work out like you're

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.500
23.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.330
You've gotta kill it.

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:16.330
Right Kevin?

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:17.330
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Kevin how old are you?

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:18.330
&gt;&gt;Kevin: 48

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:22.130
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: 48 and he changed his life
around this last year.

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:27.633
Completely, he looked like his father before
and now he looks like his own son, like it's

00:56:27.633 --> 00:56:28.633
incredible.

00:56:28.633 --> 00:56:29.633
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: You look great.

00:56:29.633 --> 00:56:30.633
&gt;&gt;Kevin: I'd like to add, um, I was never
ever an athlete at all and I'm probably more

00:56:30.633 --> 00:56:31.633
fit than I ever was in my entire life.

00:56:31.633 --> 00:56:40.260
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Is that mainly the diet or exercise.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:47.490
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Has to be, the diet has to
be a given, has to be a given.

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:53.150
And, especially my online training, it outlines
that but what Kevin's talking about with his

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:59.370
workouts is even the other day when I had
him in, uh, in training, his workouts have

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:04.160
to be as intense in his body as the fitness
professionals.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.170
There's too much babysitting by trainers.

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:09.180
Trainers don't like me for saying this stuff
but it's true and this is why I wrote this

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:13.540
book is, this is your trainer, now your motivator
is you.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:17.820
And that energy has got to be there, you have
to work out like the trainers work out for

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:19.340
themselves.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:22.750
All day long I see trainers that are training
their clients and doing functional training.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:24.540
Do you know what that means, functional training?

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:29.070
It just means like improving their daily life
for their work, for their work, for their

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.280
sports, whatever it is and I say bullshit.

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.810
I say what you need to do is work out for
a physique that's cover, Men's Health cover

00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:38.810
worthy.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:41.900
And if you have that intensity into it, change
happens.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:45.010
So your work outs have to be intense.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:46.010
Don't kill yourself.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.510
I'm not trying to say that but it has to be
the proper program.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.510
And that's in this book.

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:53.820
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Alright, well, it's 2 o'clock
so I think this is over.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.320
Craig will be around to talk, I think, afterwards
so thank you for coming in.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.320
&gt;&gt;Craig Ramsay: Thank you guys.

00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.320
Thank you so much.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:57:59.321
[Applause]
