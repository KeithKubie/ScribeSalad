[Intro music]

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.780
The team of creators of Psych2Go

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.300
would like to recognize and praise

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.620
the overwhelming support
and sense of community

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.460
that we have seen among our viewers.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.100
On previous videos,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.600
many brave viewers have
shared their own experiences

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.240
with mental illness
or abusive relationships,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.840
and have been met with kind words

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.300
and advice from others.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.780
We hope to encourage a safe
and supportive environment for all.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.260
And we would like to thanks our viewers

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.440
for making this possible.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.460
We hope to see
a similar response to this video,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.960
7 ways to deal with
abusive parents.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.840
1. Contact a resource.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.220
The National Domestic Violence Hotline

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.020
is available to anyone
at 1-800-799-7233.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.480
There are always
local resources you can find

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.300
by means of a quick phone call
or internet search.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.800
And in an emergency however,
always call 911.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.740
We'll include several helpful resources
in the description box below!

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.240
2. Talk to someone.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.160
Whether you're wanting an intervention

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.000
or simply someone to lend an ear,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.180
talking to a counselor, therapist

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.600
or even a friend can help.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.920
Someone else can
help you find resources

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.300
if you're unable to.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.120
Or they can be there
to cheer you on in rough times.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.080
3. Find a safe space.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.980
If you feel in any way unsafe
or uncomfortable at home,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.320
look out for other places
where you do feel safe and sane.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.680
Keep these places in mind

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.335
when you need a moment to yourself

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.040
and consider if these are places
you can go in an urgent situation.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.040
4. Don't blame yourself.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.480
No matter what your parent may say
or try to show you,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.780
their behavior is not your fault.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.860
Abusing a child is never okay
under any circumstances,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.940
no matter how much

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.280
the child may misbehave
or provoke their parents.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.900
You deserve every bit of help you can get.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.200
So please don't be afraid
to ask for it.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.620
5. Keep a journal.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.240
It's not uncommon
to unconsciously block out

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.340
or forget traumatic moments in the past.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.480
So it may be helpful
to make a journal

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.680
of all incidents, thoughts,
and feelings you have.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.440
Journaling may also be a helpful
emotional release for you,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.300
and it's up to you whether you share your writing or not.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.300
6. Don't provoke your parent.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.140
When possible, it is in
everyone's best interest

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.840
to avoid abusive and violent situations.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.120
If certain behaviors tend
to provoke an abusive parent,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.480
try to avoid these triggers if you can.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.860
7. Trust yourself.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.220
If you don't feel safe,
it is okay to leave the situation.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.980
Go to your safe space
or contact one of your friends

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.440
in your circle of support.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.880
Trust your guts instincts

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.660
when it comes to reading
possibly abusive situations.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.340
Remember that
your safety comes first.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.900
We would like
to thanks our sponsor,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.080
Online counseling is a great way

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.420
to get yourself the help you need,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.940
even if you aren't ready
to see anyone in person.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.140

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.500

story or advice.
