00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For this question, you're asked to define a function, pick_one,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which takes as its input a Boolean and a Boolean can be the values True or False.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If the value of the Boolean is True, you're going to return the first input.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm going to call that true_response.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If the it's false, you return the second input--false_response.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I've named them like that so I don't forget which way around they are.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In order to define the procedure, I'll call the first variable boolean, with a lowercase b.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't forget the colon.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What we need is we need something that happens when the Boolean is true,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and if I do if boolean, then the code underneath this is executed when boolean is true.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In that case, I want to return true_response.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.082
Otherwise, when the boolean is false, I want to return false_response.
