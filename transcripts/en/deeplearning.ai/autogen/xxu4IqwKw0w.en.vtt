so welcome Andre I'm really glad you

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.260
so welcome Andre I'm really glad you
 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.930
so welcome Andre I'm really glad you
could join me today yeah thank you for

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:06.940
could join me today yeah thank you for
 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.539
could join me today yeah thank you for
having so a lot of people already know

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549
having so a lot of people already know
 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.910
having so a lot of people already know
your work in deep learning but not

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920
your work in deep learning but not
 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.609
your work in deep learning but not
everyone knows your personal story so

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:14.619
everyone knows your personal story so
 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.560
everyone knows your personal story so
like to Austin start by you know telling

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570
like to Austin start by you know telling
 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.779
like to Austin start by you know telling
us how did you end up doing all this

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789
us how did you end up doing all this
 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.120
us how did you end up doing all this
work in deep learning yeah absolutely so

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130
work in deep learning yeah absolutely so
 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.400
work in deep learning yeah absolutely so
I think my first exposure to deep

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410
I think my first exposure to deep
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.689
I think my first exposure to deep
learning was when I was an undergraduate

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699
learning was when I was an undergraduate
 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.849
learning was when I was an undergraduate
at the University of Toronto and so Jeff

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859
at the University of Toronto and so Jeff
 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.109
at the University of Toronto and so Jeff
Fenton was there and he was teaching a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119
Fenton was there and he was teaching a
 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.939
Fenton was there and he was teaching a
class on be performing and at the time

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949
class on be performing and at the time
 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.259
class on be performing and at the time
it was a restricted Boltzmann machines

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269
it was a restricted Boltzmann machines
 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.780
it was a restricted Boltzmann machines
trained on amnesty Jets and I just

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790
trained on amnesty Jets and I just
 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.790
trained on amnesty Jets and I just
really like the way I'm kind of Jeff I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800
really like the way I'm kind of Jeff I
 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.230
really like the way I'm kind of Jeff I
talked about training the network like

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240
talked about training the network like
 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.940
talked about training the network like
the mind of the network and he was using

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950
the mind of the network and he was using
 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.890
the mind of the network and he was using
these terms and I just thought it would

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900
these terms and I just thought it would
 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.590
these terms and I just thought it would
there was a kind of a flavor of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
there was a kind of a flavor of
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.060
there was a kind of a flavor of
something magical happening when when

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070
something magical happening when when
 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.000
something magical happening when when
this was training on those digits and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
this was training on those digits and
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.110
this was training on those digits and
and so that's kind of like my first

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120
and so that's kind of like my first
 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.580
and so that's kind of like my first
exposure to it although I didn't get

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590
exposure to it although I didn't get
 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.380
exposure to it although I didn't get
into it in a lot of detail at that time

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390
into it in a lot of detail at that time
 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.000
into it in a lot of detail at that time
and then when I was doing my master's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010
and then when I was doing my master's
 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.280
and then when I was doing my master's
degree at University of British Columbia

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290
degree at University of British Columbia
 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.320
degree at University of British Columbia
I took a class with meta decorators and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330
I took a class with meta decorators and
 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.880
I took a class with meta decorators and
that was again on machine learning and

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890
that was again on machine learning and
 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.560
that was again on machine learning and
that's the first time I kind of dealt

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570
that's the first time I kind of dealt
 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.300
that's the first time I kind of dealt
kind of deeper into these networks and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310
kind of deeper into these networks and
 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.660
kind of deeper into these networks and
so on

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670
so on
 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.910
so on
and kind of what was interesting is that

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920
and kind of what was interesting is that
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.919
and kind of what was interesting is that
I was very interested in artificial

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929
I was very interested in artificial
 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.179
I was very interested in artificial
intelligence and sweat two classes and

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189
intelligence and sweat two classes and
 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.679
intelligence and sweat two classes and
artificial intelligence but a lot of

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689
artificial intelligence but a lot of
 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:11.849
artificial intelligence but a lot of
what I was seeing there was just very

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859
what I was seeing there was just very
 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.260
what I was seeing there was just very
not satisfying like it was a lot of kind

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270
not satisfying like it was a lot of kind
 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.910
not satisfying like it was a lot of kind
of you know death or surge breadth-first

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920
of you know death or surge breadth-first
 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.719
of you know death or surge breadth-first
search

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.069

alpha beta pruning and all these things

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079
alpha beta pruning and all these things
 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.419
alpha beta pruning and all these things
and I was like not understanding out

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429
and I was like not understanding out
 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.789
and I was like not understanding out
like I was not satisfied and so when I

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799
like I was not satisfied and so when I
 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.989
like I was not satisfied and so when I
was seeing neural networks for the first

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999
was seeing neural networks for the first
 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.730
was seeing neural networks for the first
time like and in machine learning which

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740
time like and in machine learning which
 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.020
time like and in machine learning which
is kind of this term that I think is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030
is kind of this term that I think is
 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.940
is kind of this term that I think is
more technical and not as well known in

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950
more technical and not as well known in
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.410
more technical and not as well known in
kind of you know most people talk about

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
kind of you know most people talk about
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.489
kind of you know most people talk about
artificial intelligence machine learning

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499
artificial intelligence machine learning
 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.469
artificial intelligence machine learning
was more kind of a technical term I

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479
was more kind of a technical term I
 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.569
was more kind of a technical term I
would almost say and so I was

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579
would almost say and so I was
 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.379
would almost say and so I was
dissatisfied with artificial

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389
dissatisfied with artificial
 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:35.849
dissatisfied with artificial
intelligence and when I saw machine

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859
intelligence and when I saw machine
 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.679
intelligence and when I saw machine
learning I was like this is the AI that

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689
learning I was like this is the AI that
 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.690
learning I was like this is the AI that
I want to kind of spend time on this is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700
I want to kind of spend time on this is
 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.419
I want to kind of spend time on this is
what's really interesting and and that's

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429
what's really interesting and and that's
 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:43.529
what's really interesting and and that's
kind of what took me down those

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539
kind of what took me down those
 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.879
kind of what took me down those
directions is that this is kind of

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889
directions is that this is kind of
 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.709
directions is that this is kind of
almost a new computing paradigm I would

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719
almost a new computing paradigm I would
 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.949
almost a new computing paradigm I would
say because normally humans write code

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959
say because normally humans write code
 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.590
say because normally humans write code
but here in this case we write the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600
but here in this case we write the
 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.510
but here in this case we write the
optimization rights code and so you're

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520
optimization rights code and so you're
 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340
optimization rights code and so you're
creating input-output specification and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350
creating input-output specification and
 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.719
creating input-output specification and
then you have lots of examples of it and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729
then you have lots of examples of it and
 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.279
then you have lots of examples of it and
then the optimization rights code and

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289
then the optimization rights code and
 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.599
then the optimization rights code and
sometimes it can write code better than

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609
sometimes it can write code better than
 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.609
sometimes it can write code better than
you and so I thought that was just a

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619
you and so I thought that was just a
 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.830
you and so I thought that was just a
very new kind of way of thinking about

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840
very new kind of way of thinking about
 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.779
very new kind of way of thinking about
programming and that's what kind of

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789
programming and that's what kind of
 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.699
programming and that's what kind of
intrigued me about it then through a

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709
intrigued me about it then through a
 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.830
intrigued me about it then through a
work one of the things you've come to be

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840
work one of the things you've come to be
 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.140
work one of the things you've come to be
known for is that you are now the human

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150
known for is that you are now the human
 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.970
known for is that you are now the human
benchmark for the image net

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
benchmark for the image net
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.089
benchmark for the image net
emission classification competition how

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099
emission classification competition how
 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.890
emission classification competition how
did that come about so basically their

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900
did that come about so basically their
 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.470
did that come about so basically their
image net challenge is kind of a it's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
image net challenge is kind of a it's
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.850
image net challenge is kind of a it's
sometimes compared to kind of the world

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860
sometimes compared to kind of the world
 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.199
sometimes compared to kind of the world
cup of computer vision so a lot of

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
cup of computer vision so a lot of
 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.280
cup of computer vision so a lot of
people kind of care about this benchmark

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290
people kind of care about this benchmark
 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.649
people kind of care about this benchmark
and number our error rate kind of goes

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659
and number our error rate kind of goes
 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.539
and number our error rate kind of goes
down over time and it was not obvious to

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549
down over time and it was not obvious to
 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.430
down over time and it was not obvious to
me in kind of where a human would be on

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440
me in kind of where a human would be on
 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.140
me in kind of where a human would be on
the scale and I've done a similar

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150
the scale and I've done a similar
 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.910
the scale and I've done a similar
smaller scale experiment on see part 10

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920
smaller scale experiment on see part 10
 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920
smaller scale experiment on see part 10
dataset earlier so what I did then see

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930
dataset earlier so what I did then see
 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.270
dataset earlier so what I did then see
part 10 is I just was looking at these

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280
part 10 is I just was looking at these
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.920
part 10 is I just was looking at these
32 by 32 images and I was trying to

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
32 by 32 images and I was trying to
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.600
32 by 32 images and I was trying to
classify them myself at the time this

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
classify them myself at the time this
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.130
classify them myself at the time this
was only 10 categories so it's fairly

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140
was only 10 categories so it's fairly
 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.899
was only 10 categories so it's fairly
simple to create an interface for it and

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909
simple to create an interface for it and
 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.819
simple to create an interface for it and
I think I had an error rate of about 6

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829
I think I had an error rate of about 6
 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.880
I think I had an error rate of about 6
percent on that and so that was and then

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
percent on that and so that was and then
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.229
percent on that and so that was and then
based on what I was seeing and how hard

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239
based on what I was seeing and how hard
 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.420
based on what I was seeing and how hard
task was I think I predicted that the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
task was I think I predicted that the
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.039
task was I think I predicted that the
lowest error rate we've achieved would

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049
lowest error rate we've achieved would
 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.069
lowest error rate we've achieved would
be like okay I can't exactly merge I

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079
be like okay I can't exactly merge I
 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.539
be like okay I can't exactly merge I
think I guess like 10% and we're now

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549
think I guess like 10% and we're now
 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.599
think I guess like 10% and we're now
down to like 3 or 2% or something crazy

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609
down to like 3 or 2% or something crazy
 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.610
down to like 3 or 2% or something crazy
so that was my first kind of a fun

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
so that was my first kind of a fun
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.089
so that was my first kind of a fun
experiment of like human baseline and

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099
experiment of like human baseline and
 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.339
experiment of like human baseline and
and I thought it was really important

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349
and I thought it was really important
 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.780
and I thought it was really important
for the same purposes that you kind of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
for the same purposes that you kind of
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.890
for the same purposes that you kind of
point out in some of your lectures I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900
point out in some of your lectures I
 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.970
point out in some of your lectures I
mean you really want that number to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980
mean you really want that number to
 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.420
mean you really want that number to
understand you know how well humans are

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430
understand you know how well humans are
 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.920
understand you know how well humans are
doing in so we could compare machine

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
doing in so we could compare machine
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.720
doing in so we could compare machine
learning algorithms to it and for

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730
learning algorithms to it and for
 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.039
learning algorithms to it and for
imagenet it seemed that there was a

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049
imagenet it seemed that there was a
 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.509
imagenet it seemed that there was a
discrepancy between how important is

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519
discrepancy between how important is
 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.979
discrepancy between how important is
mention was and how much focus there

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989
mention was and how much focus there
 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.900
mention was and how much focus there
wasn't getting a lower number and us not

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
wasn't getting a lower number and us not
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.449
wasn't getting a lower number and us not
understanding even how humans are doing

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459
understanding even how humans are doing
 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.370
understanding even how humans are doing
on this benchmark and so I created this

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380
on this benchmark and so I created this
 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.379
on this benchmark and so I created this
a JavaScript interface and I was showing

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389
a JavaScript interface and I was showing
 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.420
a JavaScript interface and I was showing
myself the images and then the problem

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430
myself the images and then the problem
 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.559
myself the images and then the problem
with image net is you don't have just

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569
with image net is you don't have just
 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.089
with image net is you don't have just
ten categories you have a thousand and

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099
ten categories you have a thousand and
 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.920
ten categories you have a thousand and
so it was call most like a UI challenge

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930
so it was call most like a UI challenge
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.809
so it was call most like a UI challenge
of obviously I can't remember a thousand

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819
of obviously I can't remember a thousand
 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.819
of obviously I can't remember a thousand
categories so how do I make it so that

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829
categories so how do I make it so that
 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.309
categories so how do I make it so that
it's something fair and so I listed out

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319
it's something fair and so I listed out
 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.449
it's something fair and so I listed out
all the categories and I gave myself

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459
all the categories and I gave myself
 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.339
all the categories and I gave myself
examples of them so for each image I was

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349
examples of them so for each image I was
 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.690
examples of them so for each image I was
crawling through a thousand categories

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700
crawling through a thousand categories
 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.780
crawling through a thousand categories
and just trying to kind of you know see

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790
and just trying to kind of you know see
 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.339
and just trying to kind of you know see
based on the examples I was seeing for

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349
based on the examples I was seeing for
 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.960
based on the examples I was seeing for
each category what this image might be

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970
each category what this image might be
 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.259
each category what this image might be
and I thought it was a just an extremely

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269
and I thought it was a just an extremely
 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.879
and I thought it was a just an extremely
instructed exercise by itself I mean I

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889
instructed exercise by itself I mean I
 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.650
instructed exercise by itself I mean I
was not I did not understand that like a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660
was not I did not understand that like a
 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.330
was not I did not understand that like a
third of omission at his dogs and like

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340
third of omission at his dogs and like
 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.430
third of omission at his dogs and like
dog species and so that was kind of

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440
dog species and so that was kind of
 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.229
dog species and so that was kind of
interesting to see that the network

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239
interesting to see that the network
 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.939
interesting to see that the network
spends a huge amount of time caring

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949
spends a huge amount of time caring
 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.229
spends a huge amount of time caring
about dogs I think a third of its

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239
about dogs I think a third of its
 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.000
about dogs I think a third of its
performance comes from dogs and yeah so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010
performance comes from dogs and yeah so
 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.129
performance comes from dogs and yeah so
this was kind of something that I did

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139
this was kind of something that I did
 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.509
this was kind of something that I did
for maybe a week or two I put everything

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519
for maybe a week or two I put everything
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.710
for maybe a week or two I put everything
else on hold I thought it was kind of a

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720
else on hold I thought it was kind of a
 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.899
else on hold I thought it was kind of a
very fun exercise I got a number in the

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909
very fun exercise I got a number in the
 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.550
very fun exercise I got a number in the
end and then I thought that one person

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560
end and then I thought that one person
 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.060
end and then I thought that one person
is not enough I wanted to have multiple

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070
is not enough I wanted to have multiple
 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.470
is not enough I wanted to have multiple
people and so I was trying to organize

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480
people and so I was trying to organize
 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.990
people and so I was trying to organize
within a lab to get other people to kind

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000
within a lab to get other people to kind
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.580
within a lab to get other people to kind
of do the same thing and I think people

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590
of do the same thing and I think people
 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.640
of do the same thing and I think people
are not as willing to contribute say

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650
are not as willing to contribute say
 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.200
are not as willing to contribute say
like a week or two of like pretty

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210
like a week or two of like pretty
 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.010
like a week or two of like pretty
painstaking work you know just like yeah

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020
painstaking work you know just like yeah
 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.330
painstaking work you know just like yeah
sitting down for like five hours and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340
sitting down for like five hours and
 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.470
sitting down for like five hours and
trying to figure out which dog treat

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480
trying to figure out which dog treat
 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.150
trying to figure out which dog treat
this is and so I was not able to get

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160
this is and so I was not able to get
 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.790
this is and so I was not able to get
like enough data in that respect but we

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800
like enough data in that respect but we
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.590
like enough data in that respect but we
got at least like some approximate

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600
got at least like some approximate
 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.780
got at least like some approximate
performance which I thought was was fun

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790
performance which I thought was was fun
 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.270
performance which I thought was was fun
and then this was kind of picked up and

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280
and then this was kind of picked up and
 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.190
and then this was kind of picked up and
it's uh it wasn't obvious to me at the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200
it's uh it wasn't obvious to me at the
 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.480
it's uh it wasn't obvious to me at the
time I just want to know the number but

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490
time I just want to know the number but
 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.030
time I just want to know the number but
this became like a thing and people

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040
this became like a thing and people
 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.470
this became like a thing and people
really liked the fact that that this

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480
really liked the fact that that this
 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.780
really liked the fact that that this
happened and I'm referred to jokingly as

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790
happened and I'm referred to jokingly as
 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.850
happened and I'm referred to jokingly as
like the reference human and of course I

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860
like the reference human and of course I
 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.520
like the reference human and of course I
that's kind of a hilarious to me yeah

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530
that's kind of a hilarious to me yeah
 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.950
that's kind of a hilarious to me yeah
well you what were you surprised when

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960
well you what were you surprised when
 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.080
well you what were you surprised when
you know software defense finally

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090
you know software defense finally
 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.620
you know software defense finally
surpass your performance absolutely so

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
surpass your performance absolutely so
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.880
surpass your performance absolutely so
yeah absolutely

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890
yeah absolutely
 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.150
yeah absolutely
um I mean especially I mean sometimes

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160
um I mean especially I mean sometimes
 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.590
um I mean especially I mean sometimes
it's really hard to see in the image

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600
it's really hard to see in the image
 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.850
it's really hard to see in the image
where it is is just like a tiny blob of

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
where it is is just like a tiny blob of
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.920
where it is is just like a tiny blob of
like a black black dog is obviously

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930
like a black black dog is obviously
 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.270
like a black black dog is obviously
somewhere there and I'm not seeing like

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280
somewhere there and I'm not seeing like
 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.430
somewhere there and I'm not seeing like
you know I'm guessing between like 20

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440
you know I'm guessing between like 20
 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960
you know I'm guessing between like 20
categories and the network just gets it

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970
categories and the network just gets it
 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.460
categories and the network just gets it
and I don't understand how that comes

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470
and I don't understand how that comes
 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.950
and I don't understand how that comes
about so there's some super humanists to

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960
about so there's some super humanists to
 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.590
about so there's some super humanists to
it but also for the I think the network

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600
it but also for the I think the network
 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.940
it but also for the I think the network
is extremely good at these kind of like

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950
is extremely good at these kind of like
 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.530
is extremely good at these kind of like
statistics of like four types and

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540
statistics of like four types and
 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.930
statistics of like four types and
textures and just I think in that

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940
textures and just I think in that
 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.910
textures and just I think in that
respect I was not surprised that the

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920
respect I was not surprised that the
 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.860
respect I was not surprised that the
network could better measure those fine

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
network could better measure those fine
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.490
network could better measure those fine
statistics across lots of images in many

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500
statistics across lots of images in many
 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.230
statistics across lots of images in many
cases I was surprised because some of

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240
cases I was surprised because some of
 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.760
cases I was surprised because some of
the images required you to read like

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770
the images required you to read like
 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.170
the images required you to read like
it's just a bottle and you can't see

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180
it's just a bottle and you can't see
 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.340
it's just a bottle and you can't see
what it is but it actually tells you

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350
what it is but it actually tells you
 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.260
what it is but it actually tells you
what it is in text and so as a human I

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270
what it is in text and so as a human I
 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.760
what it is in text and so as a human I
can read it and it's fine but the

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770
can read it and it's fine but the
 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.140
can read it and it's fine but the
network would have to learn to read to

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150
network would have to learn to read to
 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.400
network would have to learn to read to
identify the object because it wasn't

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410
identify the object because it wasn't
 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.100
identify the object because it wasn't
obvious just from from it um you know

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110
obvious just from from it um you know
 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.420
obvious just from from it um you know
one of the things you've become

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430
one of the things you've become
 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.980
one of the things you've become
well-known for and that the deep

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990
well-known for and that the deep
 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.540
well-known for and that the deep
learning committee has been grateful to

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550
learning committee has been grateful to
 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.250
learning committee has been grateful to
you for has been your teaching the Santa

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260
you for has been your teaching the Santa
 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.800
you for has been your teaching the Santa
Clause and putting now online tell me a

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810
Clause and putting now online tell me a
 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.170
Clause and putting now online tell me a
bit about how that came about yeah

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180
bit about how that came about yeah
 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.240
bit about how that came about yeah
absolutely so I think I felt very

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250
absolutely so I think I felt very
 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.650
absolutely so I think I felt very
strongly that basically this technology

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660
strongly that basically this technology
 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.630
strongly that basically this technology
was transformative and that a lot of

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640
was transformative and that a lot of
 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.830
was transformative and that a lot of
people want to use it it's almost like a

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
people want to use it it's almost like a
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.780
people want to use it it's almost like a
hammer and what I wanted to do I was in

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790
hammer and what I wanted to do I was in
 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.060
hammer and what I wanted to do I was in
a position to randomly kind of hand out

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070
a position to randomly kind of hand out
 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.190
a position to randomly kind of hand out
this hammer to a lot of people and I

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200
this hammer to a lot of people and I
 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.200
this hammer to a lot of people and I
just found that very compelling it's not

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210
just found that very compelling it's not
 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.970
just found that very compelling it's not
like necessarily advisable from the

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980
like necessarily advisable from the
 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.350
like necessarily advisable from the
perspective of a PhD student because

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360
perspective of a PhD student because
 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.740
perspective of a PhD student because
you're putting

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750
you're putting
 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.120
you're putting
research on hold I mean this became like

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130
research on hold I mean this became like
 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.410
research on hold I mean this became like
hundred and twenty percent of my time

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420
hundred and twenty percent of my time
 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.210
hundred and twenty percent of my time
and I had to put all of research on hold

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220
and I had to put all of research on hold
 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.010
and I had to put all of research on hold
for maybe I mean I taught the class

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020
for maybe I mean I taught the class
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.240
for maybe I mean I taught the class
twice and each time it's maybe four

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250
twice and each time it's maybe four
 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.280
twice and each time it's maybe four
months and so that time is basically

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290
months and so that time is basically
 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.690
months and so that time is basically
spent entirely on the class so it's not

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700
spent entirely on the class so it's not
 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.160
spent entirely on the class so it's not
super advisable from that perspective

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170
super advisable from that perspective
 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.960
super advisable from that perspective
but it was basically the highlight of my

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970
but it was basically the highlight of my
 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.430
but it was basically the highlight of my
PhD is not even likely related to

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440
PhD is not even likely related to
 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.720
PhD is not even likely related to
research I think teaching the class was

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730
research I think teaching the class was
 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.220
research I think teaching the class was
definitely the highlight of my PhD just

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230
definitely the highlight of my PhD just
 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.680
definitely the highlight of my PhD just
just seeing the students just the fact

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690
just seeing the students just the fact
 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.600
just seeing the students just the fact
that they were really excited it was a

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610
that they were really excited it was a
 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.790
that they were really excited it was a
very different class normally you're

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800
very different class normally you're
 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.200
very different class normally you're
being taught things that were discovered

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210
being taught things that were discovered
 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.670
being taught things that were discovered
in 1800 or something like that

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680
in 1800 or something like that
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.810
in 1800 or something like that
but we were able to come to class and

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820
but we were able to come to class and
 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.250
but we were able to come to class and
say look there's this paper from like a

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260
say look there's this paper from like a
 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.990
say look there's this paper from like a
week ago or even like yesterday and

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000
week ago or even like yesterday and
 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.490
week ago or even like yesterday and
there's new results and I think the

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500
there's new results and I think the
 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.810
there's new results and I think the
undergraduate students and any other

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820
undergraduate students and any other
 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.700
undergraduate students and any other
students they just really enjoyed that

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710
students they just really enjoyed that
 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.110
students they just really enjoyed that
aspect of the class and the fact that

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120
aspect of the class and the fact that
 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.320
aspect of the class and the fact that
they actually understood so there's not

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330
they actually understood so there's not
 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.400
they actually understood so there's not
you know so you don't have to this is

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410
you know so you don't have to this is
 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.260
you know so you don't have to this is
not nuclear physics or rocket science

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270
not nuclear physics or rocket science
 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.430
not nuclear physics or rocket science
this is like you need to know calculus

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440
this is like you need to know calculus
 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.690
this is like you need to know calculus
and linear algebra and you can actually

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700
and linear algebra and you can actually
 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.490
and linear algebra and you can actually
kind of understand everything that

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500
kind of understand everything that
 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.020
kind of understand everything that
happens under the hood and so I think

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030
happens under the hood and so I think
 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.150
happens under the hood and so I think
just the fact that it's so powerful the

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160
just the fact that it's so powerful the
 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.460
just the fact that it's so powerful the
fact that it's that it keeps changing on

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.470
fact that it's that it keeps changing on
 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.960
fact that it's that it keeps changing on
a daily basis if people kind of felt

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:37.970
a daily basis if people kind of felt
 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.830
a daily basis if people kind of felt
like they're on the forefront of

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840
like they're on the forefront of
 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.240
like they're on the forefront of
something big and I think that's why

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250
something big and I think that's why
 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.340
something big and I think that's why
people like really enjoyed that class a

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.350
people like really enjoyed that class a
 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.740
people like really enjoyed that class a
lot yeah and and and you've really

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750
lot yeah and and and you've really
 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.630
lot yeah and and and you've really
helped a lot of people and a lot of

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:46.640
helped a lot of people and a lot of
 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.600
helped a lot of people and a lot of
hammers yeah you know as someone there's

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610
hammers yeah you know as someone there's
 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.360
hammers yeah you know as someone there's
been and doing deep learning for quite

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:52.370
been and doing deep learning for quite
 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.580
been and doing deep learning for quite
some time now

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:53.590
some time now
 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.830
some time now
the field is evolving rapidly a bit

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840
the field is evolving rapidly a bit
 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.320
the field is evolving rapidly a bit
crazy here how is your own thinking how

00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.330
crazy here how is your own thinking how
 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.610
crazy here how is your own thinking how
is your understanding of deep learning

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:00.620
is your understanding of deep learning
 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.770
is your understanding of deep learning
change over these you know many years

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:02.780
change over these you know many years
 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.260
change over these you know many years
yeah it's basically like when I was

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.270
yeah it's basically like when I was
 

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.490
yeah it's basically like when I was
seeing we're circling Boltzmann machines

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:06.500
seeing we're circling Boltzmann machines
 

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.860
seeing we're circling Boltzmann machines
for the first time on digits it wasn't

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:08.870
for the first time on digits it wasn't
 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.270
for the first time on digits it wasn't
obvious to me how this technology was

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280
obvious to me how this technology was
 

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.830
obvious to me how this technology was
going to be used and how big of a deal

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840
going to be used and how big of a deal
 

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.360
going to be used and how big of a deal
it would be and also when I was starting

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.370
it would be and also when I was starting
 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.860
it would be and also when I was starting
to work on computer vision convolutional

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:14.870
to work on computer vision convolutional
 

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.360
to work on computer vision convolutional
networks they were around but they were

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.370
networks they were around but they were
 

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.070
networks they were around but they were
not something that a lot of the computer

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080
not something that a lot of the computer
 

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.540
not something that a lot of the computer
vision community kind of anticipated

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:19.550
vision community kind of anticipated
 

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.780
vision community kind of anticipated
using anytime soon the I think the

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:22.790
using anytime soon the I think the
 

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.430
using anytime soon the I think the
perception was that this works for small

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440
perception was that this works for small
 

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.080
perception was that this works for small
cases but would never scale to large

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.090
cases but would never scale to large
 

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.630
cases but would never scale to large
images and that was just extremely

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:28.640
images and that was just extremely
 

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.070
images and that was just extremely
incorrect and so basically I'm just

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080
incorrect and so basically I'm just
 

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.050
incorrect and so basically I'm just
surprised by how general technology is

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.060
surprised by how general technology is
 

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.000
surprised by how general technology is
and how good the results are that was my

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010
and how good the results are that was my
 

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.829
and how good the results are that was my
largest surprise I would say and it's

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839
largest surprise I would say and it's
 

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.320
largest surprise I would say and it's
not only that so that's one thing that

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.330
not only that so that's one thing that
 

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.640
not only that so that's one thing that
it worked so well and say like imagenet

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:42.650
it worked so well and say like imagenet
 

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.990
it worked so well and say like imagenet
but the other thing that I think no one

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000
but the other thing that I think no one
 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.430
but the other thing that I think no one
saw coming or at least for sure I did

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440
saw coming or at least for sure I did
 

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.810
saw coming or at least for sure I did
not see coming is that you can take

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:46.820
not see coming is that you can take
 

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.430
not see coming is that you can take
these pre train networks and that you

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440
these pre train networks and that you
 

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.990
these pre train networks and that you
can transfer you can fine-tune them on

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000
can transfer you can fine-tune them on
 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.820
can transfer you can fine-tune them on
arbitrary other tasks because now you're

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:51.830
arbitrary other tasks because now you're
 

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.110
arbitrary other tasks because now you're
not just solving imagenet and you need

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120
not just solving imagenet and you need
 

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.150
not just solving imagenet and you need
millions of examples this also happens

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160
millions of examples this also happens
 

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.450
millions of examples this also happens
to be

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:55.460
to be
 

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.430
to be
very general feature extractor and I

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440
very general feature extractor and I
 

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.660
very general feature extractor and I
think that's kind of a second inside

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:58.670
think that's kind of a second inside
 

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.320
think that's kind of a second inside
that I think fewer people saw coming and

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.330
that I think fewer people saw coming and
 

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.130
that I think fewer people saw coming and
you know there were there were these

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140
you know there were there were these
 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.480
you know there were there were these
papers that are just like here all the

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:04.490
papers that are just like here all the
 

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.680
papers that are just like here all the
things that people have been working on

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:05.690
things that people have been working on
 

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.570
things that people have been working on
in computer vision I seen classification

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:07.580
in computer vision I seen classification
 

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.850
in computer vision I seen classification
and action recognition object

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:09.860
and action recognition object
 

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.730
and action recognition object
recognition you know face attributes and

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:12.740
recognition you know face attributes and
 

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.020
recognition you know face attributes and
so on and people are just kind of

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.030
so on and people are just kind of
 

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.730
so on and people are just kind of
crushing each task just by fine-tuning

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:15.740
crushing each task just by fine-tuning
 

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.190
crushing each task just by fine-tuning
the network and so that to me was very

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200
the network and so that to me was very
 

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.510
the network and so that to me was very
surprising

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:21.520
surprising
 

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.340
surprising
yeah and somehow I guess supervised

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:24.350
yeah and somehow I guess supervised
 

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.230
yeah and somehow I guess supervised
learning gets most of the press and even

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240
learning gets most of the press and even
 

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.570
learning gets most of the press and even
though retraining fine tuning transfer

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:28.580
though retraining fine tuning transfer
 

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.260
though retraining fine tuning transfer
learning is actually working very well

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.270
learning is actually working very well
 

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.060
learning is actually working very well
people seem to talk less about the

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.070
people seem to talk less about the
 

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.240
people seem to talk less about the
episode right yeah yeah I think what has

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.250
episode right yeah yeah I think what has
 

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.620
episode right yeah yeah I think what has
not worked as much as some of these

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:38.630
not worked as much as some of these
 

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.850
not worked as much as some of these
hopes are on unsupervised learning which

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:39.860
hopes are on unsupervised learning which
 

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.490
hopes are on unsupervised learning which
I think has kind of been really why a

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:42.500
I think has kind of been really why a
 

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.020
I think has kind of been really why a
lot of researchers have gotten into the

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.030
lot of researchers have gotten into the
 

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.050
lot of researchers have gotten into the
field in around 2000 in 2007 and so on

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.060
field in around 2000 in 2007 and so on
 

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.810
field in around 2000 in 2007 and so on
and I think the promise of that has

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:49.820
and I think the promise of that has
 

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.490
and I think the promise of that has
still not been delivered and I think I I

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:51.500
still not been delivered and I think I I
 

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.290
still not been delivered and I think I I
found that I find that also surprising

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:53.300
found that I find that also surprising
 

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.610
found that I find that also surprising
is that the supervised learning part

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:54.620
is that the supervised learning part
 

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.560
is that the supervised learning part
worked so well and the answer prize

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.570
worked so well and the answer prize
 

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.960
worked so well and the answer prize
learning is still kind of in a state of

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:58.970
learning is still kind of in a state of
 

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.820
learning is still kind of in a state of
uh-huh yeah it's still not obvious how

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:00.830
uh-huh yeah it's still not obvious how
 

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.100
uh-huh yeah it's still not obvious how
it's going to be used or how that's

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.110
it's going to be used or how that's
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.060
it's going to be used or how that's
going to work even though a lot of

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.070
going to work even though a lot of
 

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.710
going to work even though a lot of
people are still deep believers I would

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720
people are still deep believers I would
 

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.280
people are still deep believers I would
say to use the term in the in this area

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.290
say to use the term in the in this area
 

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.840
say to use the term in the in this area
so I know that you know one of the

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:10.850
so I know that you know one of the
 

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.250
so I know that you know one of the
presidents wasn't thinking a lot about

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.260
presidents wasn't thinking a lot about
 

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.070
presidents wasn't thinking a lot about
the long-term future of AI share your

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:15.080
the long-term future of AI share your
 

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.020
the long-term future of AI share your
thoughts on that so I spent the last

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.030
thoughts on that so I spent the last
 

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.000
thoughts on that so I spent the last
maybe year in a half at opening I kind

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.010
maybe year in a half at opening I kind
 

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.070
maybe year in a half at opening I kind
of thinking a lot about these topics and

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.080
 
 

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.440
 
it seems to me like the field will kind

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:26.450
it seems to me like the field will kind
 

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.740
it seems to me like the field will kind
of split into two trajectories one will

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:29.750
of split into two trajectories one will
 

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.140
of split into two trajectories one will
be kind of a kind of applied AI which is

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.150
be kind of a kind of applied AI which is
 

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.010
be kind of a kind of applied AI which is
kind of just making these neural

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.020
kind of just making these neural
 

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.080
kind of just making these neural
networks training them mostly with

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.090
networks training them mostly with
 

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.070
networks training them mostly with
supervised learning potentially

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:36.080
supervised learning potentially
 

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.050
supervised learning potentially
unsurprised learning and getting better

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.060
unsurprised learning and getting better
 

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.240
unsurprised learning and getting better
say image recognizer zones or something

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.250
say image recognizer zones or something
 

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.760
say image recognizer zones or something
like that and I think the other will be

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:42.770
like that and I think the other will be
 

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.900
like that and I think the other will be
kind of artificial general intelligence

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:43.910
kind of artificial general intelligence
 

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.580
kind of artificial general intelligence
directions which is kind of how do you

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:45.590
directions which is kind of how do you
 

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.790
directions which is kind of how do you
get neural networks that are entire kind

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800
get neural networks that are entire kind
 

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.380
get neural networks that are entire kind
of dynamical system that thinks and

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:50.390
of dynamical system that thinks and
 

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.850
of dynamical system that thinks and
speaks and can do everything that a

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:51.860
speaks and can do everything that a
 

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.620
speaks and can do everything that a
human can do and as intelligent in that

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:53.630
human can do and as intelligent in that
 

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.920
human can do and as intelligent in that
way and I think that what's been

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:56.930
way and I think that what's been
 

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.970
way and I think that what's been
interesting is that for example in

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:57.980
interesting is that for example in
 

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.170
interesting is that for example in
computer vision the way we approached it

00:10:59.170 --> 00:10:59.180
computer vision the way we approached it
 

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.460
computer vision the way we approached it
in the beginning I think was wrong in

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:00.470
in the beginning I think was wrong in
 

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.110
in the beginning I think was wrong in
that we tried to break it down by

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120
that we tried to break it down by
 

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.670
that we tried to break it down by
different parts so we were like okay

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680
different parts so we were like okay
 

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.740
different parts so we were like okay
humans recognize people humans recognize

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:05.750
humans recognize people humans recognize
 

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.750
humans recognize people humans recognize
scenes you can recognize objects so

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760
scenes you can recognize objects so
 

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.190
scenes you can recognize objects so
we're just going to do everything that

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200
we're just going to do everything that
 

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.410
we're just going to do everything that
humans do and then once we have all

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:11.420
humans do and then once we have all
 

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.550
humans do and then once we have all
those things and now we have like

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560
those things and now we have like
 

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.720
those things and now we have like
different areas and once we have all

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:13.730
different areas and once we have all
 

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.680
different areas and once we have all
those things we're gonna figure out how

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:14.690
those things we're gonna figure out how
 

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.390
those things we're gonna figure out how
to put them together and I think that

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:16.400
to put them together and I think that
 

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.890
to put them together and I think that
was kind of a wrong approach and we've

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:17.900
was kind of a wrong approach and we've
 

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.540
was kind of a wrong approach and we've
seen that how that kind of played out

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:19.550
seen that how that kind of played out
 

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.240
seen that how that kind of played out
historically and so I think there's

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.250
historically and so I think there's
 

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.380
historically and so I think there's
something similar that's going on

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.390
something similar that's going on
 

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.880
something similar that's going on
slightly on the higher level of with AI

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:24.890
slightly on the higher level of with AI
 

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.250
slightly on the higher level of with AI
so kind of people are asking well okay

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:27.260
so kind of people are asking well okay
 

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.680
so kind of people are asking well okay
people plan people do experiments to

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:29.690
people plan people do experiments to
 

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.180
people plan people do experiments to
figure out how the world works or people

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:31.190
figure out how the world works or people
 

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.410
figure out how the world works or people
talk to other people so when you

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:32.420
talk to other people so when you
 

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.610
talk to other people so when you
language and people are trying to

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:33.620
language and people are trying to
 

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.890
language and people are trying to
decompose it by function accomplish each

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:35.900
decompose it by function accomplish each
 

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.360
decompose it by function accomplish each
piece and then put it together into some

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:37.370
piece and then put it together into some
 

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.190
piece and then put it together into some
kind of brain and I just think it's kind

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200
kind of brain and I just think it's kind
 

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.800
kind of brain and I just think it's kind
of a just incorrect approach and so what

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:41.810
of a just incorrect approach and so what
 

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.600
of a just incorrect approach and so what
I've been a much bigger fan of is having

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:45.610
I've been a much bigger fan of is having
 

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.980
I've been a much bigger fan of is having
not decomposing that way but having a

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:47.990
not decomposing that way but having a
 

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.960
not decomposing that way but having a
single kind of neural network there is

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:49.970
single kind of neural network there is
 

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.250
single kind of neural network there is
the complete dynamical system that

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:51.260
the complete dynamical system that
 

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.020
the complete dynamical system that
you're always working with a full agent

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.030
you're always working with a full agent
 

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.910
you're always working with a full agent
and then the question is how do you

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920
and then the question is how do you
 

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.980
and then the question is how do you
actually create objectives such that

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:56.990
actually create objectives such that
 

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.350
actually create objectives such that
when you optimize over the weights to

00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360
when you optimize over the weights to
 

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.120
when you optimize over the weights to
make up that brain you get intelligent

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.130
make up that brain you get intelligent
 

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.760
make up that brain you get intelligent
behavior out and so that's kind of been

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:03.770
behavior out and so that's kind of been
 

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:04.660
behavior out and so that's kind of been
something that I've been thinking about

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:04.670
something that I've been thinking about
 

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.190
something that I've been thinking about
a lot at opening I I think there are a

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200
a lot at opening I I think there are a
 

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.740
a lot at opening I I think there are a
lot of kind of different area ways that

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:08.750
lot of kind of different area ways that
 

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.760
lot of kind of different area ways that
people have thought about approaching

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:09.770
people have thought about approaching
 

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.400
people have thought about approaching
this problem so for example going in a

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:12.410
this problem so for example going in a
 

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.020
this problem so for example going in a
supervised learning direction I have

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.030
supervised learning direction I have
 

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.060
supervised learning direction I have
this essay online it's not an essay it's

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.070
this essay online it's not an essay it's
 

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.470
this essay online it's not an essay it's
kind of a short story that I wrote and

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480
kind of a short story that I wrote and
 

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.090
kind of a short story that I wrote and
the short story kind of tries to come up

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:19.100
the short story kind of tries to come up
 

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.500
the short story kind of tries to come up
with a hypothetical world of what it

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:20.510
with a hypothetical world of what it
 

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.900
with a hypothetical world of what it
might look like if the way we approach

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:22.910
might look like if the way we approach
 

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.640
might look like if the way we approach
this AGI is just by scaling up

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:24.650
this AGI is just by scaling up
 

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.110
this AGI is just by scaling up
supervised learning which we know works

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120
supervised learning which we know works
 

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.280
supervised learning which we know works
and and so that gets into something that

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:30.290
and and so that gets into something that
 

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.690
and and so that gets into something that
looks like Amazon Mechanical Turk or

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:31.700
looks like Amazon Mechanical Turk or
 

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.250
looks like Amazon Mechanical Turk or
people association to lots of robot

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:33.260
people association to lots of robot
 

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.350
people association to lots of robot
bodies and they perform tasks and then

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360
bodies and they perform tasks and then
 

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.610
bodies and they perform tasks and then
we train on that as a supervised

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:36.620
we train on that as a supervised
 

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.170
we train on that as a supervised
learning data set to imitate humans and

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:38.180
learning data set to imitate humans and
 

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.120
learning data set to imitate humans and
what that might look like and so on and

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.130
what that might look like and so on and
 

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.640
what that might look like and so on and
so then there are other directions like

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:42.650
so then there are other directions like
 

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.010
so then there are other directions like
on surprised learning from algorithmic

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:45.020
on surprised learning from algorithmic
 

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.770
on surprised learning from algorithmic
information theory things like a ixi or

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:47.780
information theory things like a ixi or
 

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.600
information theory things like a ixi or
from artificial life things that look

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:49.610
from artificial life things that look
 

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.400
from artificial life things that look
more like artificial evolution and

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.410
more like artificial evolution and
 

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.550
more like artificial evolution and
that's kind of where I spend my my time

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560
that's kind of where I spend my my time
 

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.930
that's kind of where I spend my my time
thinking a lot about and I think I had a

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:55.940
thinking a lot about and I think I had a
 

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.490
thinking a lot about and I think I had a
correct answer but I'm not willing to

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:57.500
correct answer but I'm not willing to
 

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:04.840
correct answer but I'm not willing to
reveal it here so you've already given

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:04.850
reveal it here so you've already given
 

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.800
reveal it here so you've already given
out a lot of hammers and today there are

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:08.810
out a lot of hammers and today there are
 

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.810
out a lot of hammers and today there are
a lot of people still wanting to enter

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:10.820
a lot of people still wanting to enter
 

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.600
a lot of people still wanting to enter
the field of AR entity learning so for

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:13.610
the field of AR entity learning so for
 

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.180
the field of AR entity learning so for
people in that position what advice do

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.190
people in that position what advice do
 

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.510
people in that position what advice do
you have for them yeah so I think when

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:19.520
you have for them yeah so I think when
 

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.670
you have for them yeah so I think when
people talk to me about CS 231 and and

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680
people talk to me about CS 231 and and
 

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.110
people talk to me about CS 231 and and
why they

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120
why they
 

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.790
why they
thought it was a very useful course what

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800
thought it was a very useful course what
 

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.170
thought it was a very useful course what
people what I keep hearing again and

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:25.180
people what I keep hearing again and
 

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.360
people what I keep hearing again and
again is just people appreciate the fact

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.370
again is just people appreciate the fact
 

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.950
again is just people appreciate the fact
that we got all the way to the low-level

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:28.960
that we got all the way to the low-level
 

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.690
that we got all the way to the low-level
details and they were not working with a

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:30.700
details and they were not working with a
 

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.850
details and they were not working with a
library they saw the route code and they

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:32.860
library they saw the route code and they
 

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.260
library they saw the route code and they
saw how everything was implemented and

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:34.270
saw how everything was implemented and
 

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.390
saw how everything was implemented and
implemented chunks of it themselves and

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:36.400
implemented chunks of it themselves and
 

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.519
implemented chunks of it themselves and
so just going all the way down to the

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:38.529
so just going all the way down to the
 

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:40.470
so just going all the way down to the
and understanding everything under you

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480
and understanding everything under you
 

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.019
and understanding everything under you
and never it's really important to not

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:43.029
and never it's really important to not
 

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:44.340
and never it's really important to not
abstract away things like you need to

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:44.350
abstract away things like you need to
 

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.870
abstract away things like you need to
have a full understanding of the whole

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880
have a full understanding of the whole
 

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.519
have a full understanding of the whole
stack and that's where I learned the

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:47.529
stack and that's where I learned the
 

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:48.930
stack and that's where I learned the
most myself as well when I was learning

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:48.940
most myself as well when I was learning
 

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.190
most myself as well when I was learning
this stuff it's just implementing it

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:50.200
this stuff it's just implementing it
 

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.420
this stuff it's just implementing it
myself from scratch was the most

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:51.430
myself from scratch was the most
 

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.019
myself from scratch was the most
important it was the piece that that I

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:55.029
important it was the piece that that I
 

00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:57.840
important it was the piece that that I
felt gave me the best kind of a bang for

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:57.850
felt gave me the best kind of a bang for
 

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.490
felt gave me the best kind of a bang for
the buck in terms of understanding so I

00:13:59.490 --> 00:13:59.500
the buck in terms of understanding so I
 

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.050
the buck in terms of understanding so I
wrote my own library it's called comm

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:01.060
wrote my own library it's called comm
 

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.610
wrote my own library it's called comm
Nijs it was written in JavaScript and

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:02.620
Nijs it was written in JavaScript and
 

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.870
Nijs it was written in JavaScript and
implements convolutional neural networks

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880
implements convolutional neural networks
 

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.190
implements convolutional neural networks
that was my way of learning about back

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:05.200
that was my way of learning about back
 

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.950
that was my way of learning about back
propagation and so that's something that

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:07.960
propagation and so that's something that
 

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.250
propagation and so that's something that
I keep advising people is that that you

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260
I keep advising people is that that you
 

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.510
I keep advising people is that that you
not work with tensorflow or something

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:12.520
not work with tensorflow or something
 

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.190
not work with tensorflow or something
else you can work with it once you have

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:14.200
else you can work with it once you have
 

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.900
else you can work with it once you have
written it something something yourself

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:15.910
written it something something yourself
 

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.370
written it something something yourself
on the lowest detail you understand

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:17.380
on the lowest detail you understand
 

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.540
on the lowest detail you understand
everything under you and now you are

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:18.550
everything under you and now you are
 

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.550
everything under you and now you are
comfortable to you know it's possible to

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560
comfortable to you know it's possible to
 

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.450
comfortable to you know it's possible to
use some of these frameworks that

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:21.460
use some of these frameworks that
 

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.070
use some of these frameworks that
abstract some of it away from you but

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.080
abstract some of it away from you but
 

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.960
abstract some of it away from you but
you know what's under the hood and so

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:24.970
you know what's under the hood and so
 

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.190
you know what's under the hood and so
that's been something that helped me the

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:26.200
that's been something that helped me the
 

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.480
that's been something that helped me the
most that's something that people

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:27.490
most that's something that people
 

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.280
most that's something that people
appreciate the most when they take 231

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:29.290
appreciate the most when they take 231
 

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.630
appreciate the most when they take 231
and and that's when I would devise a lot

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:30.640
and and that's when I would devise a lot
 

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:36.060
and and that's when I would devise a lot
of people yeah yeah and it's some kind

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.070
of people yeah yeah and it's some kind
 

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.769
of people yeah yeah and it's some kind
of a sequence of layers and I know that

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:37.779
of a sequence of layers and I know that
 

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:39.180
of a sequence of layers and I know that
when I add some drop out layers it makes

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.190
when I add some drop out layers it makes
 

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.860
when I add some drop out layers it makes
it work better like that's not what you

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:40.870
it work better like that's not what you
 

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.170
it work better like that's not what you
want in that case you're you're not
