00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.240
We are out here

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.679
for about 3 hours a week

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.279
we've got about 25 kids

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.210
who are freshmen through seniors

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.500
every kind of different concentration

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.439
from anthropology and archeologists

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.539
some from computer science and government

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.019
I have never taken any archeology courses before

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.029
so this is my first

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:42.320
excavation

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.910
What do you think? I like it.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.060
it's very very cool

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.079
I've been excavating over by Massachusetts Hall 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.830
for most of the time

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.280
and we've been coming up with a lot of cool stuff
so I really, it's been really cool for my first time

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.780
to be able to find so much stuff too.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.080
Like what? A lot of pottery and ceramics

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.840
and a lot of pipe stems

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.360
and actually a lot of bones too, like a lot of

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.520
we're thinking they're probably cow bones

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.050
maybe from like the garbage from a kitchen or somethinglike that

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.699
so that's been really interesting

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:17.250
finding that kind of stuff

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.960
I did an excavation in Jordan and one in Germany

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.600
but they were very different sites from this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.189
so it's interesting to do historical archaeology

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.920
for the first time

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.570
because everything else I've done has been
pretty historical.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.940
I think it would be really neat to find 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.800
remnants of the Indian college

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.810
or just some material that you can identify

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.500
as ,like, used by the students

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.829
you know that would be really exciting.
