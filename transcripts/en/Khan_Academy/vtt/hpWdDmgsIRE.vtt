00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:02.050
Let's say there are
a couple of herbs

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.500
that people believe
help prevent the flu.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.690
So, to test this, what we
do is we wait for flu season

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.890
and we randomly assign people
to three different groups.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.480
And over the course
of flu season,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.150
we have them either in
one group taking herb one,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.780
in the second group taking herb
two, and in the third group

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.691
they take a placebo.

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:23.940
And if you don't know what
a placebo is it's something

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.029
that, to the patient or to
the person participating,

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.320
it feels like they're taking
something that you've told

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.420
them might help them,
but it does nothing.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.050
It could be just a sugar pill,
just so it feels like medicine.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.591
The reason why you would even
go through the effort of giving

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.530
them something is because
oftentimes there's

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.946
something called a placebo
effect, where people get better

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:43.899
just because they're being
told that they're being given

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.440
something that will
make them better.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.570
So this could, right here,
just be a sugar pill,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.520
and a very small amount
of sugar so it really

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.250
can't affect the actual
likelihood of getting the flu.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.270
So over here we have a
table, and this is actually

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.590
called a contingency table.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.580
And it has on it in each group
the number that got sick,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.180
the number that didn't get sick.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.080
And so we also can from this
calculate the total number.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.150
So in group one, we had
a total of 120 people.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.840
In group two, we had a total
of 30 plus 110 is 140 people.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.630
And in the placebo group, the
group that just got the sugar

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.250
pill, we had a
total of 120 people.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.000
And then we could also
tabulate the number

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.780
of people, the total number
of people, that got sick.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.790
So that's 20 plus 30
is 50 plus 30 is 80.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.940
This is the total
column right over here.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.580
And then the total people
that didn't get sick over here

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.130
is 100 plus 110 is
210 plus 90 is 300,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.220
and then the total
people here are 380.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.684
Both this column and this
row should add up to 380.

00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:04.350
So with that out of
the way, let's think

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.140
about how we can use this
information in the contingency

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.310
table and our knowledge of
the chi-square distribution

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.880
to come up with some conclusion.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.960
So let's just make
a null hypothesis.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.140
Our null hypothesis is
that the herbs do nothing.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.940
Let's just assume-- let me
get some space here-- so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.240
let's assume the null hypothesis
that the herbs do nothing.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.880
And then we have our
alternative hypothesis,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.130
or alternate hypothesis,
that the herbs do something.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.664
Notice I don't even care
whether they actually improve.

00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:43.080
I'm just saying
they do something.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.370
They might even increase your
likelihood of getting the flu.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.000
We're not testing whether
they're actually good.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.960
We're just saying, are
they different than just

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.750
doing nothing.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.650
So like we do with all
of our hypothesis tests,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.950
let's just assume the null.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.600
We're going to assume the null
and, given that assumption,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.590
figure out if the
likelihood of getting data

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.140
like this or more
extreme is really low.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.080
And if it is really
low, then we will

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.920
reject the null hypothesis.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.120
And in this test, like
every hypothesis test,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.720
we need a significance level.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.100
And let's say our significance
level we care about

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.580
for whatever reason
is 10% or 0.10.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.890
That's the significance
level that we care about.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.605
Now to do this, we
have to calculate

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:34.875
a chi-square statistic for
this contingency table.

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.750
And to do that, we do
it very similar to what

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.291
we did with the
restaurant situation.

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:42.130
We figure out, assuming
the null hypothesis,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.570
the expected
results you would've

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.440
gotten in each of these cells.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.262
You could view each of
these entries as a cell.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.720
You know that's
what we do with it.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.553
You call each of those
entries in Excel also

00:03:52.553 --> 00:03:54.640
a cell, each of the
entries in a table.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.420
What we do is we figure out
what the expected value would

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.970
have been if you do assume
the null hypothesis.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.430
Then we find the
squared distance

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.960
from that expected value, and
we, I guess you could call it,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.780
normalize it by
the expected value.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.320
Take the sum of all
of those differences,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.454
and if those squares
differences are really big,

00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:18.620
the probability of getting
it would be really small,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.839
and maybe we'll reject
the null hypothesis.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.530
So let's just figure out how
we can get the expected number.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.410
So we're assuming
the herbs do nothing.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.940
So if the herbs do
nothing, then we

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.880
can just figure out that
this whole population just

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.570
had nothing happen to them.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.870
These herbs were useless.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.555
And so we can use this
population sample--

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:38.180
or I shouldn't call
it the population--

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.120
we should use this
sample right here

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.610
to figure out the
expected number of people

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.260
who would get sick or not sick.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.210
And so over here, we have 80
out of 380 did not get sick.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.662
And I want to be careful, I
just said the word population,

00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:54.370
but we haven't sampled
the whole universe

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.661
of all people taking this herb.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:57.300
This is a sample.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.860
So I don't want to confuse you.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.470
I was using population in more
of the conversational sense

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.630
than the statistical sense.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.680
But anyway, of our sample--
and we're using all of the data

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.191
because we're assuming
there's no difference.

00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.440
We might as well just use
the total data to figure out

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.540
the expected frequency
of getting sick and not

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.200
getting sick.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.780
So 80 divided by 380
did not get sick.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.130
And that's 21%.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.360
21% did not get sick.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.690
So let me write that over here.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.760
So 21, and that's
21% of the total,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.830
and then this would be 79% if
we just subtract 1 minus 21.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.620
We could divide 300 by 380,
and we should get 79% as well.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.810
So you would expect--
one would expect--

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.800
that 21% of your total,
based on the total sample

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.700
right over here, that our
best guess is that 21% percent

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.560
should be getting sick and 79%
should not be getting sick.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.740
So let's look at it for
each of these groups.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.880
If we assume that 21%
of these 120 people

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.620
should have gotten
sick, what would

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.740
have been the expected
value right over here?

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.630
So let's just multiply
21% times 120.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.340
So let's just multiply
that times 120.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.320
That gets us to 25 point--
I'll just round it--

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.660
25.3 people should
have gotten sick.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.360
So the expected-- so let
me write it over here,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.660
I'll do expected in yellow-- so
the expected right over here.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.010
If you assume that 21% of each
group should have gotten sick

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.000
is that you would have expected
25.3 people to get sick

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.260
in group one, in herb one group.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.540
And then the remainder
will not get sick.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.260
So let's just subtract
or I could actually

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.620
multiply 79% times 120, either
one of those would be good.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:58.680
But let me just take 120 minus
25.3, and then I get 94.7.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.070
So you would have expected
94.7 to not get sick.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.290
So this is expected again.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.580
94.7 to not get sick.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.020
And now let's do that
for each of these groups.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.730
So once again, group
two, you would've

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.250
expected 21% to get sick.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.550
21% of the total people in
that group, so that's 140,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.390
so that's 29.4.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.080
And then the remainder--
let's see, 140 minus 29.4--

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.270
should not have gotten sick.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.530
So that gets us this right here.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:41.430
We have 29.4 should have gotten
sick if the herbs did nothing.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.240
And then, over
here, we would have

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.145
110.6 should not
have gotten sick.

00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:50.270
And these are pretty close.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.280
So, just looking
at the numbers, it

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.230
looks this herb doesn't
do too much relative

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.240
to the total, all of
the groups combined.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.757
And then in the placebo
group, let's see what happens.

00:07:58.757 --> 00:07:59.715
Let's see what happens.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.960
We expect 21% to get sick,
21% of our group of 120.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.250
So it's 25.2.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.110
So this right over here.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.315
And actually, this should be 25
point-- since we're rounding,

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:20.440
actually, these will be
the same number over here--

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.800
so I said 21%, but it's 21 point
something something something.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.810
The group sizes
are the same, so we

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.870
should expect the same
proportion to get sick.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.560
So I'll say 25.3 just
to make it consistent.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.659
The reason why I
got 25.2 just now

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.500
is because I lost some of the
trailing decimals over here.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.130
But since I had
them over here, I'm

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.010
going to use them
over here as well.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.130
And then over here
in this group,

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:49.707
you would expect
94.7 to get sick.

00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:51.540
So if you just actually
relied on this data,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.270
it looks like herb two is
actually, to some degree,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:59.380
even worse than the-- oh.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.520
No, no, I take that back.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.650
It's not worse because you would
have expected a small number,

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.910
and a lot of people
got sick here.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.911
So this is the placebo--

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:06.951
Well anyway, we don't want
to make judgments just

00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:07.990
staring at the numbers.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.200
Let's figure out our
chi-square statistic.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.620
And to do that, let's
get our statistic,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.990
our chi-square statistic.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.030
I'll write it like
this, maybe, for fun.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.400
Or maybe I'll write it as a
big X because it's really,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.574
this random variables
distribution,

00:09:25.574 --> 00:09:27.365
is approximately a
chi-square distribution.

00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:28.836
So I'll write it like that.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.460
And, well, we'll talk about the
degrees of freedom in a second.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.640
Actually, let me write
it with the curly X,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.556
just so you see that
some people write it with

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:36.100
the chi instead of the X.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.930
So our chi-square
statistic over here.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.960
We're literally just going
to find the squared distance

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.360
between the observed
and expected.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.150
And then divide it
by the expected.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:58.630
So it's going to be 20
minus 25.3 squared over 25.3

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:06.580
plus 30 minus 29.4
squared over 29.4-- I'm

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:14.010
going to run out of space--
plus 30 minus 25.3 squared

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.149
over 25.3.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.190
And then I'm going to have
to do these over here,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.950
so let me just continue it.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.626
You could ignore
this H1 over here.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:29.430
So plus 100 minus
94.7 squared over

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.760
94.7 plus-- I think you
see where this is going--

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.950
110 minus 110.6
squared over 110.6.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:49.310
And then, finally,
plus 90 minus 94.7--

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.800
let me scroll to the
right a little bit--

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.219
squared, all of that over 94.7.

00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:56.760
So let me just get
the calculator out

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.225
to calculate this.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:00.160
Take a little bit of time.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.330
So we have-- I have to
type on the calculator

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:11.620
for these parentheses-- so
we have 20 minus 25.3 squared

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:22.790
divided by 25.3 plus, open
parentheses, 30 minus 29.4

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:37.710
squared divided by 29.4 plus,
open parentheses, 30 minus 25.3

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.590
squared divided
by 25.3-- halfway

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.320
there-- plus 100,
open parentheses,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:53.330
this is the tedious part,
100 minus 94.7 squared

00:11:53.330 --> 00:12:00.695
divided by 94.7 plus 110
minus-- I'll let you type

00:12:00.695 --> 00:12:02.570
it out, we can do a lot
of these in our head,

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:09.000
but let me just do it--
110 minus 110.6 squared

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.090
divided by 110.6-- and
then last one, homestretch,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.340
assuming we haven't
made any mistakes--

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:25.830
we have 90 minus 94.7
squared divided by 94.7.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.990
And let's see what we get.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:34.130
We get 2.528, so let's
just say it's 2.53.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.500
So our chi-square
statistic-- always

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.680
have trouble saying that-- our
chi-square statistic, assuming

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:51.860
the null hypothesis is
correct, is equal to 2.53.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.360
Now, the next
thing we have to do

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.180
is figure out the
degrees of freedom

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.940
that we had in calculating
the chi-square statistic.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.440
And I'll give you
the rule of thumb,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.439
and I'll give you a little
bit of a sense of why

00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:04.220
this is the rule of thumb for
a contingency table like this.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.178
And in the future, we'll
talk a little bit more

00:13:06.178 --> 00:13:08.490
deeply about degrees of freedom.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.770
So the rule of thumb
for a contingency table

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.270
is you have the number of
rows, so you have rows,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.070
and then you have your
number of columns.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.236
So here we have two rows,
and we have three columns.

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:19.680
You don't count the totals.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.600
So you have three
columns over here.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.420
And the degrees of freedom,
and this is the rule of thumb,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.420
the degrees of freedom
for your contingency table

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.820
is going to be the number of
rows minus 1 times the number

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.450
of columns minus 1.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.750
In our situation, we have
2 rows and 3 columns.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.550
So it's going to be 2
minus 1 times 3 minus 1.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.830
So it's going to be 2
minus 1 times 3 minus 1,

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.350
which is just 1
times 2, which is 2.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.539
We have 2 degrees of freedom.

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:55.080
Now, the reason that
that should make

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.663
a little bit of
intuitive sense, we'll

00:13:56.663 --> 00:13:58.860
talk about this in more
depth in the future,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.324
is that if you assume
that you know the totals.

00:14:02.324 --> 00:14:04.240
So let's just assume
that you know the totals.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.430
So if you know all of this
information over here,

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.771
if you know the total
information-- or actually,

00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:13.020
if you knew the parameters
of the population as well--

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.603
but if you know the
total information,

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.390
and if you know
this information,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:22.080
or if you know r minus 1 of
the information in the rows,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.630
the last one can
be figured out just

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.490
by subtracting from the total.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.270
So for example, in this
situation, if you know this,

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.760
you can easily figure out this.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.020
This is not new information,
it's just the total minus 20.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.340
Same thing, if you know
this one right over here,

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.760
this one over here is
not new information.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.790
And similarly, if you know
these two, this guy over here

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.170
isn't new information.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.090
You could always
just calculate him

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.720
based on the total
and everything else.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.350
So that's the sense of
why our degrees of freedom

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:54.510
are the columns minus 1
times the rows minus 1.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.270
But anyway, so our
chi-square statistic

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.140
has 2 degrees of freedom.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.160
So what we have to do is
remember our alpha value-- let

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.610
me get it up here,
we had it right

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.860
over here-- our significance
level that we care about,

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.550
our alpha value is 10%.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.380
Let me rewrite it over here.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.640
So our alpha is 10%.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.960
So what we're going
to do is figure out

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.820
what is our critical
chi-square statistic that

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.340
gives us an alpha of 10%.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.454
If this is more
extreme than that--

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:23.870
if the probability
of getting this

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.870
is even less than that
critical statistic--

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.820
it'll be less than
10%, and we'll

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.580
reject the null hypothesis.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.400
If it's not more
extreme, then we

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.887
won't reject the
null hypothesis.

00:15:32.887 --> 00:15:34.470
So what we need to
do is to figure out

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.860
with the chi-square distribution
and 2 degrees of freedom, what

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.450
is our critical
chi-square statistic.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.110
So let's just go back.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.870
So we have 2 degrees of freedom.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.880
We care about a
significance level of 10%.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:16:00.530
So our critical
chi-square value is 4.60.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.510
So another way to
visualize this.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.210
If we look at the chi-square
distribution with 2 degrees

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.570
of freedom, that's this
blue one over here,

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.710
at a value of-- I'm trying
to pick a nice blue to use--

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.920
at a critical value of 4.60.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.150
So 4.60-- this is 5-- so 4.60
will be right around here.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:27.550
At a critical value of
4.60, so this is 4.60,

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.950
the probability of getting
something at least that

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.300
extreme, so that extreme
or more extreme, is 10%.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.010
This is what we care about.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.830
Now, if the chi-square
statistic that we calculated

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.350
falls into this
rejection region,

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.890
then we're going to reject
the null hypothesis.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:50.340
But our chi-square
statistic is only 2.53.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.380
It is only 2.53.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:57.240
So it's sitting someplace right
over here is actually ours.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.180
So it's actually not
that crazy to get it

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.530
if you assume the
null hypothesis.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.569
So based on our data
that we have right now,

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.750
we cannot reject
the null hypothesis.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.069
So we don't know for a fact
that the herbs do nothing,

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:17.060
but we can't say that they
do something based on this.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.819
So we're not going to reject it.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.420
We won't say 100%
that it's true,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.440
but we can't say that
we're rejecting it.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.239
So at least from
this point of view,

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:27.030
it doesn't look like
the herbs did anything

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.320
that would make us
believe that they're

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.917
any different than each other.

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:33.750
And one of the herbs
is obviously a placebo.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:37.070
So any different than a
placebo or each other.
