00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.250
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady: Good afternoon.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.430
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.080
and to this event, Saving
Libraries During a Time of War.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.490
The Hill Museum and
Manuscript Libraries [inaudible]

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.310
to preserve manuscripts threatened
by war and cultural trafficking.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.690
My name is Kenneth Nyirady.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm a reference specialist
in the European Division.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.550
The Library is pleased
to sponsor today's event,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.760 position:56%
and we do so in partnership with the
Embassy of the Republic of Malta,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.680
the Embassy of Italy, the
Italian Cultural Institute

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.480
and the European Union
National Institutes of Culture.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.180
We are also pleased to have as our
guest speaker Dr. Daniel K. Gullo,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.120
the Joseph F. McCullough Curator
of the Malta Study Center.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.830
In just a minute, I will ask
our specialists for both Italy

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.160
and Malta, Ms. Lucia Wolf,
to introduce the speaker.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.340
Before that, let me say that
the Library of Congress is proud

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.080
of its extensive collections
on both Malta and Italy.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.750
If you have any questions
about using these collections,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.540
be sure to contact Ms. Wolf.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.270
We hope you enjoy Dr.
Gullo's presentation

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.240
and that you will come back
to use our collections.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.500
I thank all who have
made this event possible.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.630
Of course, I must ask you to
please silence all cell phones

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.590
and portable electronic devices.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.890
This presentation will be webcast,
and there will be a question

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.970
and answer period at the end.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.400
And by asking a question, you're
giving the library permission

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.670
to webcast your image
and your voice.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.580
I now ask Ms. Wolf to the podium.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.540
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolf: Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.910
I'm Lucia Wolf.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.140
I am thrilled to have you
here today for this event

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.500
that touches upon a topic
that is vital for the future

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.810
of libraries and museums.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.820
Libraries are not static
institutions.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.200
They shift with the transformations
of society and cultural communities

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.540
of which society is made.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.890
In spite of changes,
library's missions

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.020
and goals remain fundamentally
unchanged.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.450
The preservation of cultural
heritage for future generations

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.560
and the promotion of
new cultural venues.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.010
As the writer, [inaudible]
poignantly said,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.110
"Libraries are systems in which
the various eras organize the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.220
[inaudible] as well as
the [inaudible] text."

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.030
Food for thought.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.080
Before introducing our speaker,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.460
I would like to acknowledge
the presence of some guests.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.820
Well, he was going to be here,
but I will just say it anyway.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.740

the Republic of Malta [inaudible].

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.890 position:56%

It's an honor to have you here.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.530

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.500
of your diplomats from the
embassy, Mr. [inaudible]

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.690
and Mr. Peter Heely
[assumed spelling].

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.320 position:56%
I would also like to thank the
Honorable Ambassador Peter Selfridge

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.160
[assumed spelling], maybe not
yet here, Chief of Protocol

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.530
at the U.S. Department of State.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.380
Thank you to Dr. Constance
Whiteside for being here.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.680
Thank you very much.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.250
Dr. Constance Whiteside is a senior
outreach officer of the delegation

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.400
of the European Union
to the United States.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.730
Thank you, my friend [inaudible],
the cultural attache of the Embassy

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.010 position:56%
of Italy in Washington, D.C. I would
like to ask the Ambassador for --

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.480
at the end of the Q and A if you
would like to make the conclusions

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.660
and [inaudible] wants
to say a few words

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.770
after the Ambassador maybe also
about the program about the --

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.300
okay, finally I need to
acknowledge Dr. John [inaudible],

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.290

whose support was essential

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.890
for holding this event
in this beautiful venue.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.190
Thank you.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.630
Incidentally, I would like to bring
your attention to a small display

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.190
that I have tried to curate a
little bit in a hurry because I

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.730
like researching the collections
very widely, and I get lost

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.620
in the research, but back there we
have some rare books, some maps,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.940
Ambassador, and anyone else
you're welcome to go in at the end

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.760
of the lecture and take a look.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.860
The items out there are about
Malta or published in Malta,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.270
and in different languages.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:38.980
So now I will introduce

His specialty is the history
of monasticism and book culture

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.210
in late Medieval and
early modern Europe.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.240
I'm sorry, I'm reading,
a big agitated --

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.500
with a particular interest in
the history of religious orders

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.380
and the kingdom of Aragorn during
the 15th and 16th centuries.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.510
Dr. Gullo, the floor is yours.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:17.190
[ Applause ]

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Daniel Gullo: Good afternoon,
and thank you all for coming

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.430
on this exceptionally wonderful
day here in Washington,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.340
D.C. I've been coming to D.C.
now regularly for the last couple

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.040
of years and staying many different
neighborhoods across the city,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.890
and I can tell you that
I've become more enamored

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.620
with Washington as time goes by.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.430 position:56%
I want to thank Dr. Ambassador
[inaudible] of the Republic of Malta

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.060
and in her absence, Dr. Patricia
Borge [assumed spelling],

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.020
for providing me with
the opportunity

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.290
to represent their
wonderful country.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.030
This is our third partnership
over the last two years,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.810
and I hope we can continue working
together for many years to come.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.890
I would also like to briefly
express my sincere thanks

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.340
to Ambassador Armando [inaudible]
and the Embassy of Italy,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.930
the Italian Cultural Institute, the
European Union National Institutes

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.380
for Culture and the Library
of Congress for organizing

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.800 position:56%
and sponsoring this important series
on the need to preserve culture

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.860
and libraries during
times of war and conflict.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.840
Now my discussion today will center
on the history and activities

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.420
of the Hill Museum and
Manuscript Library and its 50 years

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:35.610
to preserve culture across
the world to first microfilm

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.940 position:56%
and then digitize endangered library
conductions, the Multi-Study Center,

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.230
as part of HMML has contributed to
this effort for 43 of the 50 years

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.140
of its existence and
to my knowledge,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.040
remains the longest
self-sustained continuing effort

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.780
to photographically
preserve manuscript culture

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.890
in the world today.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:04.900
I will discuss the historical
legacy of HMML and how it emerged

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.500
in response to the
destruction of libraries,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.880
particular Medieval manuscripts in
World War II and then quickly turn

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.950 position:56%
to our current preservation efforts,
which will include not only some

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.610
of the older microfilm history

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.160
but also our current
digital photography.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.420 position:56%
I will also end with a brief display
of our new digital collection,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.600
which we have recently released
online in August, virtual HMML,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.270
which will be sharing our
preservations with the world.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.000
I hope to leave plenty of time
for discussion because I think

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.440
in many instances a
discussion of HMML is best done

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.530
with your questions, and there
are many questions that can arise

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.970
from the preservation of libraries.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:54.750
If I might indulge a little
brief personal history,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.920
I'd like to place the context
of HMML's organizational efforts

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.150
within Benedictine history and in
particular Benedictine monasticism

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.250
in Europe so that we can understand
how St. John's [inaudible]

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.500
in Central Minnesota became the
leading pioneer of microfilm

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:17.130
and digitization of endangered
library collections in the world.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.250
My first story, and I will
limit it to two brief stories,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:26.220 position:56%
begins with my own research on the
Benedictine Monastery of [inaudible]

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.900
and the efforts of two 18th
century historians, one a jesuit,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.260
Raymundo Diosdado Caballero, who
was living in Rome and the other,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.820
the Augustinian Francisco Mendez
living in Madrid were attempting

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.670 position:56%
to uncover the early printing
history of Spain of the 15th century

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.510
as they engaged in a historical
debate at the close of the 18th.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.600
They were particularly
interested in the printing press

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.990
that [inaudible] operated by
[inaudible] between 1499 and 1500.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.750
[Inaudible] not only boasted one

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.320
of the finest Medieval manuscript
collections in Europe at the time

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.430
but also one of the best
rare book collections.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.650
It was also one of the most
important early prolific centers

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.620
of printing at the end
of the 15th century.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:22.460
Now being good historians, both
of them, unable to travel wrote

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:28.690
to the archivist at Montserrat,
Friar Benet Ribas i Calaf

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.290
who was asked to provide them
any type of information he could

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.520
from their manuscripts and archives
regarding the printing press.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.280
Friar Benet who was an exceptional
historian himself dug deep

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.990
into the manuscript archive

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.110
and actually found the original
contracts that were written

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:51.820
by Garcia [inaudible]
and Johann Luschner,

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.570
the printer who had taken
his press to the [inaudible].

00:11:54.570 --> 00:12:01.680
He found those documents, and he
first transcribed and sent them

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:09.860 position:56%
to [inaudible] in Rome and later
again to Madrid to Francisco Mendez.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.480
Those two historians in
turn printed selections

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.520
of those letters [inaudible]
in different versions

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.300
in their own respective books.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.270
The fact that both historians
recorded distinct original

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:28.370
transcriptions that is a copy of
original documents provided me

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.920
as a young scholar with
this amazing opportunity

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.980
if I could only find those
original manuscripts.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.290
My dissertation would
have been complete

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.950
in much less time than it was.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:46.460
Sadly, however, Montserrat's
library was destroyed.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.060 position:56%
Between 1808 and 1812, major battles
took place during the Peninsula War

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.390
and Napoleonic troops burned the
library to the ground in 1812.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.210
And as a result, over
10,000 manuscripts

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.630
and early printed books
went up in flames

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.920
and countless manuscript
archival records no longer exist

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.290
and were destroyed.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.420
Everything that we know about the
printing press of Johann Luschner

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.150
and its operations all

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.450
of the manuscripts recorded those
activities are now only preserved

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.120
in copies found in
18th century books.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:28.090
The second Benedictine one is
probably more famous to you.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.970
These very famous pictures,
of course, of the destruction

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.560
of Montecassino from 1944.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.470
It was at this time, of course,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.830
that something really
remarkable was happening.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.490
Libraries, of course, in Europe
during World Wars had been

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.070
vulnerable to destruction.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.350
One only has to remember what
happened to the University Library

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.770
in [inaudible] which was
destroyed in World War I.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.820
Here there was an interesting
debate that took place in 1944

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.950
when two German officers
showed up at the [inaudible]

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.900
and basically begged the monks to
relocate their library in order

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.440
to preserve it because of the
threat of allied bombing raids.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.450
Maltese archivist librarian at
the time, Father Mauro Inguanez

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.850
who was born in the
city of [inaudible],

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.160
argued that the library
should not be moved.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.390
In fact, he was very
worried because of the rumors

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.910
that the Germans had been
confiscating libraries

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.580
and deporting them to
Germany never to return again.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.480 position:56%
His [inaudible] at the time, Tommaso
Leccisotti, argued on the contrary

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.230
and said that we must move them,
that he wasn't really confident

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.250
in allied bombing, particularly
because of the evidence

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.550
of what had taken place

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.430
in the southern Italian
peninsula at the time.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.130
Fortunately for us, the
group got together, the monks

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:41.820
and their chapter, and they voted
to move the library to [inaudible]

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:49.410 position:56%
in 1944 and as a result, the state
and Monastic library that was housed

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.290
at Montecassino was preserved.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:57.310
Father Maurio Inguanez was,
of course, extremely happy

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.690
about the preservation
of the library

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.620
and the stroke of luck that he had.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.790
In fact, we singularly owe
him the existence of the ashes

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.840
of [inaudible] which he had put
into his own duffle bag and hidden

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.730
in a secret part of the library
and then transported them

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.050
to the British Embassy
after the war.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.570
This is a fun little story to add.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.880
The destruction of the libraries
we can see here, of course,

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.470
was a great tragedy, although
the books were preserved.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.950
Father Maurio Inguanez left to
the United States to raise funds

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.030
for the construction of a new
library and then went to Malta

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.250
in 1948 where he became the Chief
Librarian of the Royal Library

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.510
of Malta until his death in 1955,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:43.030
a point which I will
return to in a few minutes.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:49.630
It is actually a result of the
destruction of Montecassino

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.790
and its effect upon
Benedictines throughout the world

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.390
that we can probably trace
the history of the Hill Museum

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.160
and Manuscript Library, which
was the result of a conversation

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.960
which took place in Rome in
Italy probably in the late 1950's

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.860
or early 1960's between Father
Barry Colman and the Pontif.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.650
It was at this time that it was
decided that Father Barry Colman

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.180
or Father Colman Barry
would actually try to engage

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.610
in the process of microfilming all

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.120
of the Benedictine
manuscript libraries in Europe.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.830
Now it's not as if these type
of projects were unheard of.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.550
We already had the
Knights of Columbus working

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.670
on microfilming the Vatican
Library and the Lutheran Churches

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.720
of America had begun filming
the works of Martin Luther

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.120
and the early Protestants
in Germany and Austria.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.860
But there was no organization
that had dedicated itself

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.170
to the preservation of
small and remote libraries

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.180 position:56%
that were vulnerable not only to the
fact that the libraries might close

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.130
but also to the fact that these
libraries were often neglected

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.900
for conservation purposes.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:59.640
Father Colman at this time enlisted
his -- to help with this endeavor.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.710
His [inaudible] Oliver Kapsner
who was at this time the librarian

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.770
at Catholic University of America
and also research librarian

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.110
at the Library of Congress.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.740 position:56%
Father Oliver Kapsner had
firsthand witness of the destruction

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.490
of Europe having been a
chaplain in World War II

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.610
in the European theater
of operations.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.390
I believe he was at
the Battle of the Bulge

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.400
and therefore could see
firsthand the greatest destruction

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.380
of European culture that took
place during that campaign.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.230
These two gentlemen, of
course, first went to Italy.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.890
It was a logical place for them to
begin their preservation efforts,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.030
but initially their
work was frustrated

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.110
and Montecassino did not open
their doors to their preservation.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.740
Instead, they went to
Austria and later to Germany.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.850
Austria was a obvious place to go.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.470
Not only did it have
some of the greatest

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.270
and most beautiful Benedictine
libraries in the world,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.010
but at this time it was sandwiched

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.680
between both the Warsaw
Pact and NATO.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.720
Austria was vulnerable to invasion

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.440
because it wouldn't immediately
trigger the NATO alliance.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.850
You have to remember this was,
of course, taking place in 1964

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.810
and 1965 at the height
of the Cold War.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:19.830 position:56%
And it was at this time in 1965 when
the [inaudible] opened his doors

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.240
to Father Kapsner and began
the microfilm project,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.520
which has now been going
strong for over 50 years now

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.820
that we are using digital
technology.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.150
This early work that was undertaken
by Father Oliver Kapsner in Austria

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.290
and Germany lasted
until the early 1970's.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:44.340
And it was at this time that the
then director, Dr. Julian Plant,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:49.810
envisioned HMML's work
into something much bigger.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:54.270 position:56%
What began as the monastic
manuscript microfilm project quickly

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.870
became the Hill Monastic
Manuscript Library.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.950
And it was at this time in
discussions first with Ethiopia

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.230
with Emperor [inaudible] and then
in Spain and then, of course,

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.630
with Malta that the Hill
Museum began a worldwide effort

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.210
to preserve endangered
library collections.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.510
The first one, of course,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.440
that expanded beyond Europe
was actually in Ethiopia.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.820 position:56%
His holiness [inaudible] and Emperor
[inaudible] were very worried

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.110
about the state of Ethiopian
libraries in particular

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.440
in the cultural trafficking
of objects.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.220
They were also worried about
an uprising and some form

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.090 position:56%
of communist revolution in Ethiopia,
and therefore thought it imperative

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.820
to start preserving their
libraries before it was too late.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:45.830
It must be remembered that in 1973
Spain, of course, was still dealing

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.320
with the idea of what might
happen if Franco had passed away.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.990
Given the complexity and
violence of the Spanish Civil War,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:57.880
destruction of the Spanish cultural
heritage was in obvious peril.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.290
Malta, of course, in 1973 was
going through its own transition.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.350
It was strategically
located in the Mediterranean

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.250
and with the conflicts
going on in the world,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.930 position:56%
one would not know what would happen
if it became an object of conflict

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.580
as a competition between the
Warsaw states and also NATO.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.620
To kind of put this
into perspective,

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.910
you can imagine what was going
through the people's minds

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.010
at HMML in the early 1970's.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:28.190
The University of Complutense
in Madrid between 1936

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:35.670
and 1939 lost 80,000 books,
80,000 in one single institution.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.600
Malta itself received more
bombs between 1940 and 1943

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.090
in a geographical area than
any other place in Europe.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.150
What might happen to those library
collections if war began again?

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:55.040
To kind of put all of this into
perspective, I'm going to focus

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.670
on a few unique objects,
which thanks to the efforts

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.720
of HMML we now can actually trace.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.290
One of them was a microfilm
of this 18th century Bible.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.770
It's actually not a complete
Bible but selections photographed

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:13.700
in the 1970's known as EMML 7014.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:18.960
This Bible disappeared only to
resurface several years later

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.610
at the National Library of Norway.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.220
And thanks to our microfilming
process,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.820
you can see I've actually flipped
into the modern era already.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.830
Thanks to our microfilming process,
we are actually able to identify

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:34.270
and locate this Bible and
create a strong connection

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.750 position:56%
between its original owners in
Ethiopia and also maintain its place

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.950
in the National Library of Norway.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.940
Therefore, what began as a project

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.530 position:56%
to preserve cultural heritage helped
us actually locate trafficked --

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.040
illegally trafficked manuscripts.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.240
This is something that
continues to today.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.560
One can only turn to Ebay
and see the cultural heritage

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.390
from around the world, Ethiopia,
Syria, Egypt, the Middle East,

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:08.830
Afghanistan, the market for
manuscripts is ever increasing

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.080
and because of their uniqueness ,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.080
hey are objects of
desire on the market.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:21.000
A second example which I
find even more interesting

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.580
to my mind is this really
unique cover that you can see

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.230
from our 2010 newsletter,
Illuminations.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.930
You can see here an the
11th century Latin Bible

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.770
that was produced in Spain.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.630
It's remarkable because this
Bible was actually destroyed

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.140
in the [inaudible] Library in 1937.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.880
What you see in color is the
one fragment that remains

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.380
from this very rare
[inaudible] manuscript.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.500
In 2010, Dr. Hugh Hone [assumed
spelling] contacted HMML

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.990
and wondered, "Did we have a
microfilm of this manuscript?"

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.590
Which seemed a bit odd because
we hadn't actually done any work

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.460
in the 1930's, but he
wondered if somehow

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.890
or another there was
anything that we had.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.570
There were some plates floating
around, but he really wanted

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.020
to know was there something.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.990 position:56%
And in fact what ended up happening
is in 1979 unbeknownst to all of us,

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.820
Dr. Julian Plant had
engaged in this process

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:19.230
of buying individual microfilms to
support HMML's overall collections,

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.940
trying to find copies of
all of the [inaudible]

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.520
so that people could
study the manuscripts

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.530
and not just the plates at HMML.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.120
In so doing, he actually purchased
a film from the [inaudible]

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.390
in Madridin 1979, which
was Kodak's 31 [inaudible]

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:42.680
which was taken before
the Spanish Civil War

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.990
and housed in the national library.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.860
The National Library of
Madrid or the National Library

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.740
of Spain sent us there one
unique [inaudible] instead

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.180
of making a duplicate.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.350
So we have the only microfilm of
the world of this lost manuscript,

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.200
which was now being
able to be studied

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.380
and put together with the original.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:09.520
My third and final example which
I can smile at my colleage,

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.600 position:56%
Dr. Karen Ruff, over there to the
left is actually now found in Malta.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.390
This, of course, is
a digital manuscript,

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.960
which we photographed
earlier this year.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.670
This manuscript was discovered
in a drawer upstairs and found

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.380
within a collection of
manuscript fragments donated

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:31.780
to the cathedral archives by the
family of Friar Maurio Inguanez

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.580
who remember was the librarian
and archivist of Montecassino.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:42.270
This very rare 11th or 12th
century manuscript includes

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.370
within it a unique
blend of Beneventan

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.570
and Carolingian paleography.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.220
And it is to my mind probably no
doubt made provisionally at least,

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.590
provisionally made at the
[inaudible] of Montecassino

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:59.430 position:56%
and brought to Malta by Father
Inguanez after he went to the island

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.760 position:56%
in 1948 probably as part of
maintaining and preserving some link

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.610
to his [inaudible]
after he left and went

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:13.590
to the National Library of Malta.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.990
From these extremely humble
beginnings, we can actually think

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:21.340
about 50 years of preserving
the patrimony of humanity.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.160
On over four continents
now, the Hill Museum

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.490
and Manuscript Library has been
preserving collections throughout

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.990
the world.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.530
Today we are working on
four distinct continents,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.780
and what I would like to
take a moment to speak

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.860
about our culture efforts first
looking at those in the Middle East

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.580
and then in Africa at
the [inaudible] and Malta

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.460
because all together
they encompass our effort

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.560
to preserve endangered collections.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.660
And so we've just added
one in Washington,

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.510
D.C. in the upper left hand corner
thanks to the Catholic University

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.810
of America who last week
opened their collection to us

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.380 position:56%
to help preserve the border of
Malta's collection at their library.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.910
They're a very beautiful
and wonderful collection.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.940
I'm going to begin
with a brief discussion

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:11.860
of our preservation efforts
in Syria, which began in 2004

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.730
with an inheritance of a project
begun by Brigham Young University.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:21.840
Our work in these libraries went
from 2004 to 2012 focusing largely

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.480
on the collections
and homes in Olimpo

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.330
but also few other smaller
collections in the country.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:32.370
These projects of course have
been suspended, but in addition

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.380
to our work there, several
of these collections

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.470
at least we believe might
have been relocated.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.400
We simply do not know at this time.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:45.580
What we do know is that we have
preserved nearly 3000 manuscripts

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.930
which may or may not have been
destroyed from the city of Olimpo,

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.860
the surrounding villages and homes.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:56.400
All of these collections are
now being kept digitally at HMML

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.610
and remain an important
cultural repository

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.470
for the work not only done
by the librarians at the time

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:08.820 position:56%
but by the continuing efforts of
our catalogers throughout the world.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:15.530
A second collection,
of course, is Iraq.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:21.220 position:56%
We began filming in Iraq in 2003 and
filming and digitization continues

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.850
to take place primarily in
the city of [inaudible].

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.440
Our preservation efforts began
in Mosul and in [inaudible],

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.160
two cities which of
course now remain

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.840
under occupation by
the Islamic state.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.000
We did work in other cities
in Iraq and also in Baghdad,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.260 position:56%
but primarily our effort is
focused on the Christian communities

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.270
which have been located in
their endangered collections

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.660
in northwestern Iraq in
the province of Ninevah.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.520 position:56%
This effort is largely being carried

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.880
out by Father Najib
who's a Dominican

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.830
who now is continuing
work in [inaudible].

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.320 position:56%
He's a rather remarkable man because
he spends his mornings taking care

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.710
of the refugees who are living
in [inaudible] and his afternoons

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.770
and evenings as you can see here
preparing these extremely beautiful

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.960
manuscripts for digitization.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.330
This project is being
done in concert

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.370
with the Centre Numerique
des Manuscrits Orientaux,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.290
the [inaudible] project
and as I'll show you

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.890
in just a few moments it has done
some of the remarkable digitization

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:30.040
in both Turkey and in
Iraq over the last decade.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:36.540
A third major project, our largest
project, is taking place currently

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.590
in Mali in the city of [inaudible].

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:44.030
That is because in 2012 there
was the Taureg Rebellion

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.600
which invaded the city.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.100
Many of you might be familiar
with the recently published book,

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.910 position:56%
the [inaudible] Librarians of
Timbuktu, which recounts the efforts

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:56.560 position:56%
of the local population of
librarians to transport over 50,000,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.500
some even say up to 300,000
manuscripts from Timbuktu

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.510
to [inaudible] in order to
preserve those manuscripts.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.190
Now, the Hill Museum and
Manuscript Library has been working

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:12.650
with several organizations
in Mali and in [inaudible].

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.710
Here you can see the wonderful
chess that were created

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:20.450
to ship these manuscripts
to the capital.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:25.950
We have now 12 cameras operating
in the city funded by a variety

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:29.010
of different organizations
including the Arcadia Fund,

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.310
the Prince Claus Fund, the
Juma Al-Majid Center of Culture

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.610
and Heritage all working
with SAVAMA-DCI

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.640
to preserve these manuscript
collections.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.780
We are, of course, working
in Malta, and I know Malta

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.490
of course is not currently
underneath any formal threat of war

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.930
or invasion, but it still suffers
from the tremendous effects

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.370
of World War II upon the island.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.940
And here I am speaking
of the Notarial archieves

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.550
in St. Christopher
Street in Valetta.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.610
The remarkable effort being led

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.150
by Dr. Jonah Bella [assumed
spelling] the Notoarial Research

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:09.320
Council to basically help restore
literally thousands and thousands

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.200
and thousands of manuscripts dating
back to the 15th century in Malta

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.320
which were buried underneath
the city and forgotten as a part

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.230
of their attempt to preserve those
records during the bombing raids

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.950
of Valetta in world War II.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.870
The Hill Museum and Manuscript
Library pioneered a project

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:31.750
with the Notarial archieves between
2010 and 2014, and the register

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.620
which you see here, register 202,

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.210
which is a 16th century Notarial
document, has shrapnel holes

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.420
in it made by 200 pound
bomb dropped by [inaudible]

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.070
on top of Valetta in 1943.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:48.330
So you can actually see those are
the bomb fragments that helped --

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.840
that damaged the manuscript.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.930
Thankfully, the European Union

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.350
and the European Council have
recently rewarded the Notarial

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.450
archives with a significant grant

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.120
to not only help preserve these
manuscripts but to catalogue them

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.790
and make them available
to the public.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:12.610
Another major collection in Malta,
which was discovered in 2010

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.190
which was part of our work with
the National Archives of Malta

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.490
between 2007 and 2015 were
an important collection

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:25.120 position:56%
of documents located in
[inaudible] at the front of Valetta.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:33.340
Here in [inaudible] 2010 literally
probably somewhere around 10,000

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.150
to 15,000 manuscript documents were
found at the bottom of a cistern

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.280
where they were dumped
or put in order

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.600
to protect the documents during
the bombing raids of World War II.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.710
As you can see, here's a beautiful
40 mm [inaudible] which was located

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.100
about 50 meters away from where
these documents were found.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.120
Obviously, a target for any
German bomber at the time.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.590
These manuscripts were discovered
in 2010 and were in such a state

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.890
that the Army, the Maltese
Army needed to be brought

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.720
in using chemical suits to remove
the documents from the cistern

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.270
and through the efforts of the
National Archives were able

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:15.840 position:56%
to be cleaned and preserved, and the
Hill Museum and Manuscript Library

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.480
and Malta Study Center
helped catalogue

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:25.320
and digitize these records
in the fall of 2015.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.440
Currently in Malta, we
are working with a project

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.720
of Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti to
help preserve private libraries.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.780
Private libraries are extremely
vulnerable not simply to forms

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:43.080
of war, but in particular
to sell disbursement

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.530
or through issues of
climate control.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.860
We will be engaging over
the next three to five years

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.040 position:56%
in the digitization and preservation
of these vast collections

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.620
of libraries, primarily the
repositories of noble families.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.090
We're currently working at
the [inaudible] in Valetta

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:05.270
where we have found over 400
manuscripts and 300 archival boxes

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:09.100
with manuscripts dating
from the early 15th century

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.510
through the 20th century.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.760
These collections are not
simply Maltese collections

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.260
but European collections
as the family --

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.340
the [inaudible] family held
important positions in France,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.300
Italy and in the Mediterranean
as Naval captains,

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.690
and they chart the history
of the Mediterranean.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:30.220
One of the most amazing
documents that we were able

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.970
to find was this beautiful
collection of Lebanese documents

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.730
that were suing the knights
of Malta in the 1730's

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:40.430 position:56%
to have their cargo restored to them
after it had been illegally seized

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.740
in their minds by Maltese
[inaudible].

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.730
The [inaudible] family being
quite wise bought the legal suit

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.200
from the Lebanese family and
proceeded to win the case in court.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.770
Some 30,000 [inaudible]
were delivered

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.120
to the [inaudible] as
part of the process.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.870
This is actually an image as a
part of the legal proceedings

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.820
where they're trying to chart
the Maltese ships hitting --

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.710
about to capture that poor
Lebanese sailing vessel.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:12.210
Before I move on, I want to
say that all of this done --

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:16.050
all of the work we've done should
be reminded that every library

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.670
that we worked in, whether
it was vulnerable to war

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.070
or not remains vulnerable.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:27.450
We did microfilm the Cologne
State Archives back in the 1980's,

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:30.940
and as a great tragedy, I
believe according to a gas leak,

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.890
the Cologne State Archives
collapsed in 2009.

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:35.940
And thanks to our microfilming
efforts,

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.610
we preserved the Medieval
collection which by

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.670
and large was destroyed during
the collapse of the building.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.510
What does this all mean?

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.490
It means a significant amount
for the preserving of culture

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:56.500
of our patrimony or
patrimony of humanity.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.730
Results from our work
in Iraq and Syria alone,

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:04.210
we've preserved ten collections and
nearly 2000 manuscripts in Mosul,

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.230
846 manuscripts in Baghdad.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.470
In Aleppo itself, nearly
3000 manuscripts.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.860
Between Iraq and Syria,

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.080
8000 manuscripts have
been digitally preserved

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.540
that have been vulnerable to war.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:24.120
If we put that into the larger
context of the Middle East,

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.310
if we add Lebanon and
Jerusalem, Turkey and Egypt,

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:32.380
nearly 21,000 manuscripts
dating back

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.520
to the middle ages have
been preserved by HMML.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:43.590
If we think about this in
perspective, what this means

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.260
as a repository of
humanity, and I'm sitting here

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.010
in probably the world's
greatest repository of knowledge

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:57.400
that there is, we have
36,600 digitized manuscripts

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.120
from the Middle East,
which is larger than all

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.570
of western libraries combined
in Europe and North America.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:10.170
If we think about the
Syriac collection alone,

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:15.910
13,500 manuscripts are now being
preserved and catalogued at HMML

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.020
where all of the European libraries

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.550
and North American
libraries preserve only 3400

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:24.100
within their repositories.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:30.510
For Islamic culture, the
numbers are no less remarkable.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.200
31,992 manuscripts and growing.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.930
We think we'll have nearly
100,000 manuscripts preserved

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.340
in the next five years alone.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:48.130 position:56%
It will be the largest collection
of Islamic manuscripts in the world.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:51.590
Malta is a significant
contributor to this project.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:57.470 position:56%
We've been working in Malta since
1973, and as I say, uninterruptedly.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.250
If we think about the cathedral
itself which was largely

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.210
in microfilm, 15,000 manuscripts
charting the history of Malta

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.150
through the 15th century
through the 20th century

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.540
and parish archives had
been preserved by HMML.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.580
This is extremely important because
the Maltese population dispersed

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.970 position:56%
after World War II largely as a
result of the poverty of the country

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.720
as it suffered from
the effects of the war.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.420
I had received daily letters
from Maltese, from Australia,

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.500
through Canada, through South
America all looking to us

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.890
for their parish records in order
to trace their family history.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:36.380
The National Library of Malta,
nearly 3500 manuscripts.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.090
And you can see from
the digital collection,

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.370
we now have 3000 manuscripts
themselves.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:42.920
This, of course, is a bit deceiving

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.250
because we're largely
preserving archival documents

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.380
and archival documents
are much larger

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.490
than a traditional manuscript.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:53.350
So if we can think of nearly 21,000
manuscripts, it's probably closer

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:57.600
to 42,000 manuscripts preserved
of Maltese cultural heritage.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.710
It's the largest repository
of Maltese culture outside

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.590
of the island in the world.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:06.000
To this, I can add nearly 90
documents that we preserved

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.600
at the Catholic University
of America last week.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.980
So how does this all play
out in our world today?

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:18.650
If this is the mission of HMML,
to make sure that we preserve all

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.650
of the culture that we have in
the world regardless of creed,

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.710
regardless of place, regardless
of society, these very,

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.770
very valuable manuscripts, the
Hill Museum and Manuscript Library

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.750
of course located in
central Minnesota,

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.800
which is a wonderfully
safe place for one to be

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.070
in the northern part
of the United States.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.370
If you wish to come visit us,

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.990
it is one of the most
beautiful locations also.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.050 position:56%
St. John's University and St.
John's Abbey is great in the summer.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.320
Maybe February is a
little more difficult,

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.300
but the summer is actually one of
the most beautiful places to be.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.810
Our library is newly renovated.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.820
It is a state of the
art research facility.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.040
We hold guest quarters
at the Abbey guest house.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.240
People can come and stay
and apply for fellowships

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.310
to reward their research.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:09.740
We have nearly 50,000
reference books dedicated solely

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.550
to the research of manuscripts,

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.390
one of the largest
research reference libraries

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.940
in North America.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.510
We are a library of libraries.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.810
If you want to think about
our digital collections alone,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.430
it's nearly 200 terabytes
of digital data

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.170
for those librarians
and those [inaudible].

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:28.680
They understand what this means.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.970
This is a significant
collection which has

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.700
to constantly be updated
and preserved.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.410
50 million images and counting.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:40.180
Malta is about -- I would think
at this point is about 10 million

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.110
of those 50 million manuscripts,

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.400
a significant portion
of the collection.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.130
135,000 microfilmed
manuscripts are currently housed

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.400
in our condition and in our vaults.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.360
We tape everything
on our local drives.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.820
We have local tape.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:01.200
We backed up on a second server
and then we have a third location,

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.470
believe it or not, located in Utah

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.980
in a secret underground
granite vault where we keep all

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.230
of our digitized collections.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.870
I believe, I think if -- this is
not to quote me exactly on this --

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.840
it can withstand a 50
megaton nuclear bomb.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.730
So the world manuscript
culture is well preserved.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.770
It's just outside of New York
-- not New York, Salt Lake City.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.250
I'm being from New York
and thinking about that.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.400
I shouldn't because
I grew up in Utah.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.480 position:56%
It's just outside of Salt Lake
City, and it's near where the Church

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:38.810
of Latter Day Saints, of course,
keeps its geneological records.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.350
All of this, of course, is great,

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:45.870
but how do we actually make
this available to the public?

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.510
I'm very happy and very pleased
to announce that as of August

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:54.000
of this year, two years of
efforts have been finalized

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.620
where we can now start sharing
all of these collections with you.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:02.350
This is a free online site, and it
will become the largest repository

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:07.210
if not the largest repository
of manuscripts in the world.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:08.930
As of this morning,
I think I looked.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:15.260
We have 5576 fully
digitized manuscripts located

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.810
in our virtual HMML.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.500
If we think about this, over the
course of time if we are able

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.450
to complete our projects,
if we just stop the projects

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:28.630 position:56%
that we are doing today, with
Timbuktu and every other manuscript,

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:35.220 position:56%
this will be over 100,000 digitized
manuscripts located in virtual HMML.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.940
I want to give a shout out here to
the Library of Congress [inaudible]

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.640
because of their work that
dates back almost 200 years now,

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.500
over 200 years in establishing
authorities because one

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.020
of the greatest things
that's happening

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:54.910
for our collections today is we are
now instituting both [inaudible]

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.810
and [inaudible] authority
control over our collections.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:02.590 position:56%
If you take a moment real quick, I'm
going to pop out of my presentation

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:07.250
and -- this is the live
site of virtual HMML,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.550
and I'm currently logged in.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.830
I'm going to just make it
just a little bit smaller.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.130
That's too small.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.840
A little bit bigger on
the screen for you to see.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.560
We can go ahead and
just take a quick look

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.160
at reading room where
we do our search.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.260
This is a very simple interface
that works on an elastic search,

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.470
and you can do very simple things
with this, and here I'm just going

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.730
to narrow my search
to digital collections

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.370
and type in the word Syria.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:38.630
And you can see a fully
detailed view of all

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.930
of our Syria collections.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.870
We only have 237 records in it,

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:46.550
but we'll be adding records
over the course of time.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.410
If I open up the record,
you can see here

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:54.690
on the left loading the image
here, there's actually an early --

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:59.690
I love this one because it shows
you early manuscript image taken

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:03.270
in microfilm so that we can
compare what the manuscript looked

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.330
like when it was microfilmed over
50 years ago to the digital copy

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.030
that was taken less
than a decade ago.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:13.640
[Inaudible] of course are
being put in on this level,

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.170
and if we go to the
full description,

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.100
you can start seeing
how we're moving

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.760
down into [inaudible] controls

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:25.540
and language both native
script and in English.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.740 position:56%
Our work here, of course, is so that
scholars can see the manuscript,

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.080
and take a good look at the
manuscript in their own home doing

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.590
as much research as possible.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:41.590
This very elaborate system which
was put together by the Hill Museum

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:42.890
and Manuscript funded

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:46.160
by the [inaudible] Foundation
[inaudible] Foundation and money

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.980
from the Arcadia grant
is being put in place

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.400
so that we can realize the idea
that access should not be limited

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.980
to our own local site at
HMML but the recognition

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.020
that our responsibility is to the
people who open these collections

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.160
to us who might never
be able to travel

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.740
to the United States to see these.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.800
We're talking about millions of
displaced people, people displaced

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.180
into Europe into Asia
within their own countries

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:16.070
who might never have access to
their own collections again.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.080
This, of course, creates
other issues,

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.980
issues like how do we provide these
people with internet access itself,

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.500
but in the least this
free and open access

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.190
to these collections will
provide a repository for them

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:32.710
to see their culture as it
is transferred to the world.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.350
It's not simply about an issue of
opening this up for scholarship.

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.890
I, myself and my colleague,
Dr. Ruff, have been working

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:42.080
on Latin fragments that
we've been finding in Syria,

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.740
fragments that date back to
the 11th century potentially.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.890
We found a [inaudible] manuscript
in Aleppo believe it or not

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.930
of the Bible as a fragment
from the numbers I believe.

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:57.530
These fragments are really the
patrimony of humanity and not just

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.900
for scholars but for
the people themselves

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:03.980
because if I may just speak a
little bit extemporaneously here,

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.780
most of the work that we are
preserving are [inaudible] works

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:13.430 position:56%
and religious works that are used by
the people in their churches today.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:16.310 position:56%
The fact is that these are not
simply repositories that we're going

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.600
and helping save, but
living, breathing libraries.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.790
Most of the manuscripts
coming from the 18th,

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.450
19th and early 20th centuries.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:31.020
I kind of want to conclude with
some of our kind of projects.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.250
We hope to continue our
work over the next decade

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.350
in a variety of different places.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.890
In Europe, we're opening
up places in the Balkins,

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:42.940
which of course was ravaged
by war during the 1990's.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.220 position:56%
Ukraine, of course, which is
undergoing conflict even though it's

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.050 position:56%
in kind of a tense cease fire today.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.280
In Malta, we'll be working
with University of Malta

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.720
and Heritage Malta in
the coming years we hope.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.670
In the Middle East, we hope to
start working again in Lebanon,

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:03.860
in Syria if things hopefully soon,
we can go back to the country

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.520
and also in Yemen, which
is in a state of war today.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.730
Afghanistan and India have
also opened their doors to us

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.560
and we are currently in discussions
with them in order to work there.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.500
So our work is actually
expanding and it is an expansion

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.220
that is happening largely due
to the support of the public --

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:27.130
the Republic of Malta and
in particular for my sake

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.200
with the National Archives and
the National Library of Malta.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.180
They've been helping me
personally over the last few years.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.640
Its been a wonderful project.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.120
I've been involved with
it for two years now.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.500
This is actually my first public
presentation on HMML as a whole,

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.840
but I will go ahead and
end my discussion now

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.230
and to take your questions.

00:46:48.510 --> 00:47:05.510

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:11.110

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:15.510
I have a gentleman in the back.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:35.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.540
I'll be honest with you.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:43.050
I'm not really a specialist on what
might have happened in Central Asia

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.800
at the time and in the Middle East.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.590
I do know that there's
a substantial collection

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:50.110
of Persian manuscripts both

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.350
in Northern India,
Afghanistan, Pakistan.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.940
These collections are spectacular.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.240
I believe the National Library

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.320
in Kabul itself has
the largest collection

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.370 position:56%
of Persian manuscripts in the world.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:07.240
I know that we're in discussions
in India right now to work on them.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.700
Our previous work in India
was in southern India

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:15.640
with the Syria communities that
have migrated there previously.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.670
But to the extent and size of
the Persian collections that are

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.390
in Northern India, I'm sorry,

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.710
I don't have that knowledge
with me now.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:27.880
I would be surprise if they
were not substantial, however.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:42.170
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:46.440
It's actually rather remarkable
-- if I can smile at my colleague,

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:52.260
[inaudible], Catholic
University at the moment.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:56.090
It's a small 90 pound box.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:49:00.810
We basically use a 20
megapixel Canon digital camera,

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:06.320
and a camera stand and two strobe
lights and a laptop computer

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.320
and a bunch of handmade handy
dandy get in and get out materials

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.710
which have been perfected
by my colleague,

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:15.010
Wayne Torborg [assumed spelling].

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:18.880
An entire studio itself, we can
move in and set up in what we do

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.020
in about an hour and a half?

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.810
More or less an hour and a half
we can set up an entire studio.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:29.250
The studio itself cost I
believe less than $6000 depending

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:33.790
on the quality of the camera that
we use which is the major expense,

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.780
which are actually
becoming more affordable

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.410
as we improve in the technology.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:43.950
So literally, it's a 3 foot by
2.5 foot box, weighs 90 pounds.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:48.730
We can set up a studio in 1.5 hour,
takes about an hour to tear it down

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:52.120
and within 10, 15 minutes
of setting it up,

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.630
we can be fully digitizing
the collection.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:56.970 position:56%
It's a remote self-contained studio.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:03.220
It's a simple Canon EOS
ESLR 20 megapixel camera.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.620
For very large manuscripts,

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:12.210
I use a D810 Nikon 36.3
megapixels, but that's it.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:13.700
It's that simple.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.280
I wish it was more complicated,
and I can get into details.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:23.510
But it really is that simple.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:46.360
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.580
Fortunately, the European Union
has engaged in tremendous efforts

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.640
to provide for its own
color digitization projects.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.070
One of the things that we've done

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:57.990
with our new system is
we have a direct link

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:01.000
where we can link our
older microfilm collections

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
to the new collections in Europe.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.320
HMML's primary mission is to
work with endangered libraries

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.330
and libraries which are
vulnerable to climatic change

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:13.870
which is really one of the
primary instances in Malta.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.150
Getting proper climate control

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:19.400
in an island environment
is extremely difficult.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.480
The European libraries know -- I
mean, I work in Italy and because

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.190
of my work with the order
of the Knights of Malta,

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:28.880
we do work with European
collections.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.130
And of course, in the Balkins
which we hope to open up this year.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.880
But no, we won't be going back

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.470
in systematically doing
those collections

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.160
because they're doing it
themselves, and we don't need to.

for example, is a remarkable project

and archives portal Europe, and we
will be linking our older records

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.250
to their records as a part
of our project ourselves.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:10.380
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:16.500
We, through HMML and St.
John's Abbey and the community

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:22.540
that supports HMML have been
providing assistance to refugees

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.020
in Iraq as part of our mission.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.840
It would be irresponsible for us
to simply care about the libraries

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.160
and not the people themselves.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.270
As much as it is important
for me to be caring --

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.570
taking care of tradition,
these are people

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:39.850 position:56%
who are living in these camps today.

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:43.870
We certainly do what we
can within our institution.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:47.680 position:56%
One thing that should be stated here
is that all of our projects are run

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.640
by local people paid through HMML.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.820
Therefore, in the least we're
providing employment opportunities.

00:52:54.820 --> 00:53:00.140 position:56%
We do not take our librarians and go
to these facilities to do the work.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.510
We train them locally.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.640
We provide the equipment and
then we support those efforts

as they continue.

question both with regard to Malta

and the world as a whole.

00:53:55.930 --> 00:54:00.940
Let me talk about Malta first and
then the world because it's just --

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.220
simply because it's a little
bit more familiar to me.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:07.540 position:56%
If you want to think about this, and
I'm speaking here as a historian,

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.390
Malta is in the Mediterranean,
but it's also in an area

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.900
where earthquakes are prone
and it's close to [inaudible]

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.210
which could have some dramatic
effect upon the island.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:21.010
I have to think to myself
every time I go there,

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.210
if I knew that I had 12
months to digitize something

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:26.910
on this island, what do I do?

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.110
You can make an argument that I
can go to the [inaudible] Cathedral

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:33.320
in Valetta where they have the
most precious [inaudible] produced,

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.180
these beautifully illuminated
Italian and French

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:41.340
in different areas for the
grand masters or do I go

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.020
to the national archives?

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.620
[Inaudible] which chronicle
primarily the slave trade in Malta

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.180
that took place during the
regime of the Knights in Malta.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:52.410
And if I have 12 months,
what do I do?

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:54.810
Because on the one hand if I
preserve the great culture,

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.200
we can talk about these
great archistic achievements

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.160
of European civilization.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.570
On the other hand, if
I take a decision not

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:04.270
to do the records [inaudible],
we might not know

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:07.240
that the slave trade had been
there or how prolific it was.

that were there who might be looking

to those records to
trace their ancestry

after slavery was abolished in 1798.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:18.970
It's a very big question.

confronts us as an institution

when we think about what we may or
may not be doing in the world today.

could look at Latin America

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:35.540

place which may be vulnerable

People by and large have
attempted to approach us.

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:49.300
We do have within our own mission
statement to provide access

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.350
to collections which we already
have, meaning that the work

that we're doing in the Middle
East, this grand heritage

European heritage and to think

of them as not collaborating

with each other is just
simply illogical fallacy.

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:21.250 position:56%
of our mistakes, of our discoveries.

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:28.270
We would lose much of
humanity, would lose our love.

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:36.200
And at the same time, I
thought to myself, I said,

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:41.150
"How much work is going
on unnoticed?"

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:46.340
If you just think about
[inaudible] as you mentioned,

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:50.090
things which I myself did not know.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:55.600
And which you are preserving
forever is gone.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:04.190 position:56%
I think there is a bit of
responsibility in this for all of us

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:11.880
for these people whop are
protecting our past for our future.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:17.020
So I'm extremely grateful
and there's no other place

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:21.850
to say these words in here, and
I'm extremely proud and humbled

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.450
to be here in the Library
of Congress of all places

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:27.130

only tell you how much

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:40.400

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:46.120
I was -- but I would not have
missed this for my life believe me.

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:51.650
I learned a lot of things,
and greatly grateful for this.

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:55.200

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:26.510
[ Applause ]

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:30.210
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.740
&gt;&gt; A few words [inaudible]
a few words.

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.320
Not a long speech.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.620
Don't worry.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.480
I don't to stop you seeing
the beautiful exhibition

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.780
in the [inaudible].

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.890
I thank you Dr. Gullo.

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:41.190
Really thank you.

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:42.490
You opened the door.

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:43.990
You know what I mean open the door?

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:50.030
And I know -- [inaudible]
embassy would be here,

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:52.640
is here now because they
[inaudible] they would like just

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.070
to explore another item about
library about preserving,

01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:06.010
and I know the Embassy of Malta
has a lot of secrets under the door

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:13.320
because next time we really have to
approach that submarine archeology.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.620
This is another item.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.520
It's really, really interesting.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.820
Do you know what?

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:23.400
When in Italy [inaudible] was
[inaudible] to do it a team instead

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:29.220
of events, events, events, events,
what doesn't make any sense.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.890
We have to do a team
and the team that came

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.480
in my mind was protecting
our [inaudible]

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:47.750
and now this is the 22nd event that
we dedicated in D.C. to this team

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:50.580
and each one opened door.

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.970
It's unbelievable.

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:58.030
I will have -- next Tuesday, I will
have another exhibition in New York

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.590
with Columbia University dedicated
to protecting our [inaudible],

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.170
and [inaudible] is with us.

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:06.870
So we have only to
shake and we have only

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:09.810
to do something -- to do something.

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:12.850
It's incredible because you
mentioned before [inaudible].

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:23.120
You don't know many people
are really not protecting our

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.610
[inaudible] in our daily life.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:32.650
They used to buy Ebay, items after
items [inaudible] shame on them.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.060
Absolutely in our daily life.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.380
We have to find out what
we can do in our daily,

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.970
daily life to protect our heritage.

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:44.750
I'm doing for example next year
I'm doing a project with a school,

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:50.720
first grade, second grade, third
grade in United States Maryland,

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.370 position:56%
and I will ask to the boy and girls,

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.910
what do you like to
preserve in your life?

01:02:56.910 --> 01:03:02.460
So the idea of preserving is
something that you have to put

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:09.160 position:56%
like a seed in their mind and the
first response was a really, really,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.710
really, really unbelievable.

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:15.520
I would like just to preserve
my [inaudible] coming home.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.630
I'm going to preserve the
story of my grandma told me.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:28.210
I would like to preserve smell,
smell -- perfume, story, book,

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:31.870
items, all of this is preserving.

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:34.150
All of this is our duty.

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:38.290
Just as you said, and as you
said for the next generation.

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:41.970
So [inaudible] think about --

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:45.880
contact me because
[inaudible] our team

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.850 position:56%
of protecting our heritage will last
another three years so we have time

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:53.630
to explore it to open
door after door.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.510
