00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.630
So now you've seen a pretty extensive
tour of the features offered by

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.860
Android Wear.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.990
We explained how wearable APKs
are distributed by the Play store.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.780
You also learned how an Android Wear
device is basically a complete Android

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.950
implementation supporting the same APIs
as what you're already familiar with.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.620
We have added data items and messages to
allow you to easily send data between

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.220
devices without having to implement
your own network communications.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.840
Simplifying the development
of wearable apps.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.064
Wearable devices also have different
displays than previously available.

00:00:30.064 --> 00:00:33.849
So, we learned how to support round and
scroll outs.

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:38.255
And also, how to take advantage of
Android Wear's Always on Display feature

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:42.040
to provide easily glanceable
information at any time.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.630
Now you know all the important
information necessary

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.100
to implement a complete
Android Wear app.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.800
&gt;From designing the initial
layout to packaging it up and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.320
distributing it to your users.
