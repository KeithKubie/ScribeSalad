could see that morphologically existed
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.499
could see that morphologically existed
in the cells so the machinery was

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
in the cells so the machinery was
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.320
in the cells so the machinery was
unknown and how the system was working

organism with one cell and he was

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180
organism with one cell and he was
 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.090
organism with one cell and he was
interested in understanding things under

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100
interested in understanding things under
 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.330
interested in understanding things under
the microscope so the first problem he

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340
the microscope so the first problem he
 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.950
the microscope so the first problem he
wanted to tackle was whether or not

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960
wanted to tackle was whether or not
 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.370
wanted to tackle was whether or not
these yeast cells had a coffee chief so

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380
these yeast cells had a coffee chief so
 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.859
these yeast cells had a coffee chief so
he created a really ingenious way of

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869
he created a really ingenious way of
 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.949
he created a really ingenious way of
studying them he developed cells that

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959
studying them he developed cells that
 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.280
studying them he developed cells that
didn't degrade proteins in the lysosome

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
didn't degrade proteins in the lysosome
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.070
didn't degrade proteins in the lysosome
and he reasoned that if he could stop

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080
and he reasoned that if he could stop
 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.020
and he reasoned that if he could stop
the degradation process he could see an

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
the degradation process he could see an
 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.740
the degradation process he could see an
accumulation of of the atashi machinery

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
accumulation of of the atashi machinery
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.710
accumulation of of the atashi machinery
in these cells so he looked at yeast

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
in these cells so he looked at yeast
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960
in these cells so he looked at yeast
cells under the microscope and he

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
cells under the microscope and he
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.180
cells under the microscope and he
subjected them to starvation that

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190
subjected them to starvation that
 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.730
subjected them to starvation that
induces ecology and he could see an

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740
induces ecology and he could see an
 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.240
induces ecology and he could see an
accumulation of a phagosome in the cell

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250
accumulation of a phagosome in the cell
 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.160
accumulation of a phagosome in the cell
so he could look at this end of the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170
so he could look at this end of the
 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.130
so he could look at this end of the
microscope in these they were these this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140
microscope in these they were these this
 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.750
microscope in these they were these this
machinery was moving under the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760
machinery was moving under the
 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.640
machinery was moving under the
microscope you could see them visually

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650
microscope you could see them visually
 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.860
microscope you could see them visually
so that was the first step then when he

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870
so that was the first step then when he
 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.240
so that was the first step then when he
had a system where he could see an

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
had a system where he could see an
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.270
had a system where he could see an
accumulation of at egg effect auto

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
accumulation of at egg effect auto
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.759
accumulation of at egg effect auto
phagosome x' in the cell he could then

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769
phagosome x' in the cell he could then
 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.780
phagosome x' in the cell he could then
study these yeasts by inducing a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
study these yeasts by inducing a
 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.720
study these yeasts by inducing a
chemical that led to mutations and he

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
chemical that led to mutations and he
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.520
chemical that led to mutations and he
reasoned that if he could mutate the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530
reasoned that if he could mutate the
 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.570
reasoned that if he could mutate the
genes that were important for otology he

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580
genes that were important for otology he
 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.870
genes that were important for otology he
may be able to then identify genes that

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880
may be able to then identify genes that
 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.780
may be able to then identify genes that
regulated this process so he could

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790
regulated this process so he could
 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.930
regulated this process so he could
scream these yeast cells that were

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940
scream these yeast cells that were
 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.979
scream these yeast cells that were
chemically modified and he identified 15

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
chemically modified and he identified 15
 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.100
chemically modified and he identified 15
genes that were important for the auto

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110
genes that were important for the auto
 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.460
genes that were important for the auto
 process for etapa gene he then

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470
 process for etapa gene he then
 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.759
 process for etapa gene he then
went on in the third step to clone the

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769
went on in the third step to clone the
 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.460
went on in the third step to clone the
gene products and he could study the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470
gene products and he could study the
 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.370

this process was response

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
this process was response
 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.949
this process was response
distress starvation and that involved a

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959
distress starvation and that involved a
 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.990
distress starvation and that involved a
cascade of proteins that came together

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000
cascade of proteins that came together
 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.320
cascade of proteins that came together
in complexes and he could study these

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330
in complexes and he could study these
 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
in complexes and he could study these
protein complexes and how the auto

protein complexes and how the auto
 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.910
protein complexes and how the auto
phagosome was formed and how that was

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920
phagosome was formed and how that was
 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.550
phagosome was formed and how that was
used with the lysosome and how the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560
used with the lysosome and how the
 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.850
used with the lysosome and how the
contents of the auto phagosome were

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860
contents of the auto phagosome were
 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.460
contents of the auto phagosome were
degraded in the cells since to me this

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470
degraded in the cells since to me this
 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.210

waste dump was in the south but what he

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380
waste dump was in the south but what he
 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.500
waste dump was in the south but what he
showed was that it wasn't a waste dump

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510
showed was that it wasn't a waste dump
 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.710
showed was that it wasn't a waste dump
it was a recycling plant this was a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720
it was a recycling plant this was a
 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.080
it was a recycling plant this was a
really sophisticated machinery that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090
really sophisticated machinery that
 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.560
really sophisticated machinery that
recycled damaged or long-lived proteins

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570
recycled damaged or long-lived proteins
 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.760
recycled damaged or long-lived proteins
and they were reused so if you think of

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770
and they were reused so if you think of
 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.930
and they were reused so if you think of

this example every day we need to
 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.670
this example every day we need to
replace about two to three hundred grams

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680
replace about two to three hundred grams
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.520

we're eating proteins every day about 70

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580
we're eating proteins every day about 70
 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.190
we're eating proteins every day about 70
grams of protein but that's not enough

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200
grams of protein but that's not enough
 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.110

we're able to rely on some of our own

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210
we're able to rely on some of our own
 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.420
we're able to rely on some of our own
proteins maybe the damaged proteins or

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430
proteins maybe the damaged proteins or
 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.980
proteins maybe the damaged proteins or
the long-lived proteins and they're

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990
the long-lived proteins and they're
 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.379
the long-lived proteins and they're
recycled with the sophisticated

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389
recycled with the sophisticated
 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.740

machinery so that we can sustain and we

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750
machinery so that we can sustain and we
 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.540
machinery so that we can sustain and we
don't and we survive also this crisis or

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550
don't and we survive also this crisis or

Physiology or medicine so

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630
Physiology or medicine so
 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.060
Physiology or medicine so
what would be the medical implications

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070
what would be the medical implications
 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.820
what would be the medical implications
on this recite that this award is for

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830
on this recite that this award is for
 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.130
on this recite that this award is for
fundamental physiology that's right but

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140
fundamental physiology that's right but
 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.860
fundamental physiology that's right but
it really has a very strong implication

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870
it really has a very strong implication
 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.830
it really has a very strong implication
for different diseases so for example we

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840
for different diseases so for example we
 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.320
for different diseases so for example we
can think of with starvation

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330
can think of with starvation
 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.120
can think of with starvation
we need this process to survive

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130
we need this process to survive
 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.220
we need this process to survive
starvation because we can have a self

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230
starvation because we can have a self
 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.410
starvation because we can have a self
renewal of our own proteins so we can

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420
renewal of our own proteins so we can
 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.720
renewal of our own proteins so we can
survive that's one thing we also need

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730
survive that's one thing we also need
 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.090
survive that's one thing we also need
this process for embryogenesis

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100
this process for embryogenesis
 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.730
this process for embryogenesis
we need this process for cell division

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740
we need this process for cell division
 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.250
we need this process for cell division
we need this process to be functioning

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260
we need this process to be functioning
 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.620
we need this process to be functioning
for normal physiology there's examples

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630
for normal physiology there's examples
 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.370
for normal physiology there's examples
of where this process is important to

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380
of where this process is important to
 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.920
of where this process is important to
ward off diseases for example if you

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
ward off diseases for example if you
 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.530
ward off diseases for example if you
have a bacteria or a virus that infects

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540
have a bacteria or a virus that infects
 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.530
have a bacteria or a virus that infects
a cell we need this machinery to be able

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540
a cell we need this machinery to be able
 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.520
a cell we need this machinery to be able
to ward off viral infections the

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530
to ward off viral infections the
 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.620
to ward off viral infections the
machinery is also important for diseases

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630
machinery is also important for diseases
 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.500
machinery is also important for diseases
associated with aging so for example if

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510
associated with aging so for example if
 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.260
associated with aging so for example if
we have damaged or toxic proteins they

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270
we have damaged or toxic proteins they
 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.700
we have damaged or toxic proteins they
need to be handled if they're not

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710
need to be handled if they're not
 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.830
need to be handled if they're not
handled correctly they can build up and

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
handled correctly they can build up and
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.990
handled correctly they can build up and
that can lead to diseases like neuro

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000
that can lead to diseases like neuro
 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.450
that can lead to diseases like neuro
generative diseases Alzheimer's

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460
generative diseases Alzheimer's
 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.450
generative diseases Alzheimer's
Parkinson's maybe diabetes if you have

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460
Parkinson's maybe diabetes if you have
 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.220
Parkinson's maybe diabetes if you have
too much etapa genes that may be

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230
too much etapa genes that may be
 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.560
too much etapa genes that may be
associated with cancer and the tumor

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570
associated with cancer and the tumor
 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.790
associated with cancer and the tumor
cells may survive so too much is not

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800
cells may survive so too much is not
 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.840
cells may survive so too much is not
good and too little is not good as well

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850
good and too little is not good as well
 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.440
good and too little is not good as well
so if you need to turn to our attention

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450
so if you need to turn to our attention
 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.100
so if you need to turn to our attention
