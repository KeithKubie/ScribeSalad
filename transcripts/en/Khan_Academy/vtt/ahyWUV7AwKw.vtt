00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.900
Lucio wants to test whether
playing violent video

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.110
games makes people more violent.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.790
He asks his friends whether
they play violent video games

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.660
and whether they have been
in a fight in the last month.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.890
He recorded the results
in the table shown below.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.280
Fill in the table to show
the fraction of each group

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.680
of students who have
been in a fight.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.780
Then decide whether
there is an association

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.520
between violent video games
and getting in a fight

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.819
amongst Lucio's friends.

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.360
So let's see what
they're doing here.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.920
So students who
play video games--

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.645
fractions who have been in a
fight, fraction who haven't.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:35.520
Students who don't play
violent video games--

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.460
fraction who have been in a
fight, fraction who haven't.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.090
So let's answer the
first part of this.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.200
Students who play
violent video games.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.990
So let's look at those students.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.300
So the students who play
violent video games--

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.000
it looks like Ellen plays
violent video games.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.690
Actually, let me just focus on
the data that we care about.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.560
So Ellen.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.500
So let's look at all the people
who play violent video games.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.422
So let's see.

00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:01.880
This column is
violent video games.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.290
So we have a yes here.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.550
So actually, we have both
of these right over here.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.170
And then we have down here.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.460
And then that's all of them.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.470
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 people
who play violent video games.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.495
Now what fraction of them
have been in a fight?

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:24.760
Well, it looks like 1 out of
the 5 have been in a fight.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.910
The rest of them have
not been in a fight.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.490
So we could say 1/5--
let's just write that down.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.040
So 1/5 have been in a fight.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.640
Fraction who haven't-- 4/5.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.930
So that's all these other nos.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.340
They play violent
video games, but they

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.340
haven't been in a fight.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.740
1, 2, 3, 4-- 4/5.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.720
So students who don't
play violent video games.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.340
Well, that's everyone else.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.352
And let's see how many
data points that is.

00:01:48.352 --> 00:01:56.720
That is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.040
So there's a total
of 15 students.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.620
And how many of them
have been in a fight?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.260
So let's see.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.810
We have 1.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.350
And then let's see,
1, and 2, and 3.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.100
So 3 out of the 15
have been in a fight.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.360
So 3 out of 15 is the
same thing as 1 out of 5.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.720
Those are equivalent fractions.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.400
And then the
fraction who haven't?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.890
Well, that's just going
to be everyone else.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.800
That's going to be 12
out of 15 or 4 out of 5.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.670
So based on Lucio's data-- and
this wasn't a huge sample size,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.360
obviously.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.830
He only found 5 kids who were
playing violent video games.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.413
And 1 of them had
gotten into a fight.

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:43.350
So this isn't a
super rigorous study.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.510
But at least based
on his data, if we're

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.710
trying to decide whether
there's an association

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.050
between violent games
and getting into a fight

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.290
amongst Lucio's friends, it
doesn't seem like there is.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.310
It seems like relatively,
whether or not

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.490
they play violent video
games or not, 1/5 of them

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.200
have been in a fight
in the last month.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.220
So it really doesn't
seem any difference.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.990
If this number was, I
don't know, 4/5, or 5/5,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.030
or all of them, then I'd say,
hey, even with Lucio's fairly

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.940
small sample, I
would say, hey, maybe

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.099
there is some type of
a strong association

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.140
between playing violent
video games and fighting.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.933
But here you really
don't see any difference.
