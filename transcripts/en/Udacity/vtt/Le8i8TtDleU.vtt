Alright so, let's learn another tag. This one is the image tag. It looks like

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:13.934
this, IMG, and this is for including images. It has the following structure. The

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:20.210
opening IMG tag. It has an attribute called source, SRC equals, and this equals

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.160
the URL. This is the URL of the image to download. Remember, we talked about

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.170
how the web service can serve all sorts of different

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.910
types of content? If you're going to serve an image, this

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.100
is how you would do it. You would include it

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.630
in an image tag in HTML, and you reference the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.220
URL. And then there's another attribute called alt. Which stands

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.620
for alternate, and this is text that gets displayed when

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.250
the image doesn't load. Its required in the sense that

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.170
HTML parses will complain at you if it's not there?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.800
Nothing will break, but it's really nice to include it. So

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.880
broken requests like if, if, if our browser requested a URL that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.260
doesn't exist, this is the text that gets displayed, and it's also

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.924
for blind people. You know, it doesn't take much to add an

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:06.546
alt text that'll make somebody's life or somebody's day at least

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:09.980
mildly easier. And one other thing I'd like to point out here,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.345
is every tag that we've talked about so far has had a

00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:16.540
closing tag. Images don't. This is the entire tag. There's no contents

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.170
to an image. See? It just ends right here.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.790
This is called a void tag, and a void tag

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.280
is a tag that has no content, and because it

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.840
has no content, it doesn't need a closing tag. Let's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200
try this thing out in the browser and see how

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.798
it looks in real life. Okay, so here we are

00:01:32.798 --> 00:01:35.680
in our little HTML previewer. Let's, let's add an image.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.070
Okay so, we've got our, our image tag, src equals

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.330
udacity.com and hipmunk.png. This is our URL of an image that I've prepared

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.080
for us. We've got some alt text there. Let's go ahead and click Update. And

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.780
ta dah, there's our image. Now, a couple other things we can do. I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.999
can put some text here. There's our text. Images just appear in line with text.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.090
Yeah, so a small image just appears right in the middle of other text.
