00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.720
The universe is a really big place, and the
chances, the conditions where life may exist,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.710
happen in much greater abundance than we originally
thought.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.290
For centuries we have looked up to the stars
and wondered if we are alone in the universe.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.449
But recently, our search for extraterrestrial
life has been less about making contact with

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.569
an alien race and more about the search for
some kind of galactic lifeboat.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.560
To look for life, scientists used to focus
on planets in the ‘Goldilocks zone’.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.829
A potentially habitable area that’s neither
too near or too far from our sun - in other

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.640
words it’s neither too hot or too cold.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.809
But when Cassini started to send back data
from the systems of Saturn, scientists began

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.350
to shift their focus.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.230
From planets to moons.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.270
Saturn has 62 confirmed moons with more being
discovered all the time.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.870
And two of those moons, Titan and Enceladus,
could be habitable.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.361
Thanks to Cassini’s galactic hitch hitcher
- a clam shaped probe called Huygens - we

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.630
were able to pierce Titan’s hazy atmosphere
and land on its surface

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.180
It's really surprised us.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.890
We see dunes.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.690
We see these river gullies and channels that
have been carved by liquid, but there that

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.820
liquid is not water.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.660
It's methane and ethane.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.840
Liquid hydrocarbons that have been forming
just like on Earth how we have clouds and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.370
rain events, the same thing happens on Titan,
but it's with an entirely different set of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.370
molecules.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.740
It's a fascinating alien world and we're just
beginning to scratch the surface in terms

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.360
of how complex it is and exactly what is present
there on the surface.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.410
But with lakes of liquid methane and a surface
temperature of minus 290 degrees fahrenheit

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.340
- how could Titan possibly be habitable?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.000
Well, to humans, Titan is one of the least
hostile places in the outer solar system.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.960
It has a dense, planet-like atmosphere.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.310
Meaning, even though it’s colder and gets
less light than Earth, it has a dense biochemical

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.790
make-up that could sustain life.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.680
Titan’s atmosphere is also quite stable.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.170
Except for thunderstorms at the poles there
are no cataclysmic events to worry about like

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.820
cyclones, moonquakes or even cosmic rays.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.170
If you lived on Titan, you could stand on
its surface with just an oxygen mask, and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.390
of course, some very very warm clothing.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.960
But maybe the motivation to colonize Titan
isn’t necessarily about building Earth 2.0;

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.720
it might make more sense to think about it
as a way-station, a halfway point to the next

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.720
Earth 2.0.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.180
Titan has more hydrocarbon reservoirs, like
a larger reservoir than all of them on Earth

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.180
combined.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.180
You need extra gas?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.590
Just go to Titan, scoop up some methane, and
carry on to find a place where you can survive.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.110
It's opening our eyes to the breadth and the
possibilities that exist just in our solar

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.850
system alone.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.980
There is another moon in the Saturn system
that scientists are excited about - Enceladus.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.270
It’s smaller than Titan - about 310 miles
in diameter.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.580
And underneath its icy crust is an ocean of
water.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.950
We had no idea that there were liquid water
oceans underneath the icy crusts of some of

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.950
these moons.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.170
This is exciting for us because any place
on Earth where we find liquid water, we find

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.190
life - every time.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.750
Enceladus, not only is it a key astrobiology
target because of this liquid water, but it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.290
is unique in that that liquid water ocean
is accessible.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.540
We don’t know the exact energy source that
keeps its subsurface ocean liquid.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.590
Cassini was able to sample the plumes erupting
from its surface.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.850
It discovered a hydrothermal chemical makeup
similar to what occurs in the depths of Earth’s

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.850
oceans.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.260
NASA’s next missions to icy moons like Saturn’s
Enceladus and Jupiter’s moon Europa, will

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.250
hopefully be equipped with instruments for
oceanic studies.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.420
Instruments that are directly targeted to
look for organic molecules and the key biosignatures

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.230
of life as we know it, or even life as we
don't know it.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.310
We'll be looking for patterns in organic molecules
that are unique only when life is present.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.650
The discoveries that Cassini, and spacecraft
like Cassini, have made will absolutely help

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.379
us try to eventually become not a one planet
civilization.

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:29.389
We can't stay here forever.

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.430
