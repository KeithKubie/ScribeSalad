00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
&gt;&gt; So today for Authors at Google SF, we'd
like to welcome Bob Gilbreath.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:14.129
He is the Chief Marketing Strategist at Bridge
Worldwide, a WPP agency, and he's here to

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.670
speak about his new book "The Next Evolution
of Marketing: Connect with Your Customers

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.500
by Marketing with Meaning".

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.589
Just a little brief summary on it, he mentions
how the old interruptive model of marketing

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.019
no longer works.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.170
Customers are tuning out.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.019
They are no longer listening to these in your
face messages.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.300
Instead, they're demanding meaning from brands
they buy from and the marketing that reaches

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
them.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.940
In "The Next Evolution of Marketing", Bob
will unveil a new, revolutionary new approach

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.840
to business that fills the gaping voids left
in bottom lines when people start tuning out.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.120
He'll describe the marketing revolution now
underway and the powerful forces driving it.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840
So with that, please welcome Bob Gilbreath
[applause]

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.001
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thanks for coming.

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.079
Those behind the bar, feel free to get within
view [laughs] .

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.390
I can serve your needs much better if I can
see ya but [laughs] thanks for having me.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.230
This is really a great service you guys have,
both for authors like myself to come and visit,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.020
but I think it's really neat that you can,
you can be here and learn from others that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.020
are coming in.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.890
I've been watching several of the Authors
at Google presentations actually over the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.070
years and very, very impressed and would love
to do something similar back at our office

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.070
in Cincinnati.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.670
Just a couple of things I want to talk about.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.380
I think, I'm here for two things both: I've
got a book concept I think you might find

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.369
interesting but I'm also Head of Strategy
at one of the top 30 digital agencies here

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.369
in North America.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.240
Again, part of WPP.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.950
My background before joining Bridge, I was
Grant Manager at Proctor and Gamble and did

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.329
that for about six years.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.299
Almost went to Yahoo instead of going to Proctor
in the late 90's and it was probably a pretty

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.290
good move at the time but always kind of had
digital in my blood and, and working as some,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.899
both the kind of traditional brand management
stuff, I was also the digital geek in the

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.380
halls and always got a lot of those projects
so going to Bridge was kind of chance to kind

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.720
of do that full time and get my peers and
friends on the other side of the, the client

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.490
agency line to, to join me in the, the digital
revolution.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.430
Quick points on Bridge: we're headquartered
in Cincinnati.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.500
We've got about 270 people there now.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.890
Slides a little bit dated.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.970
We've also got a small office in New York
and opening an office soon in LA.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.770
The thing we're probably most proud of is
being named one of the best Top 25 small businesses

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.010
to work for by the same people who do the
Fortune Magazine Most Admir--Best Companies

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.840
to Work for list and that's something that
really for us makes sure that we draw great

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.750
talent, keep them, and, and have them to continue
to develop.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.270
We're part of WPP so I guess we're "frenemies"
with Google, whatever that means but we definitely

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.210
had some good, good relationships there.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.920
We work with a lot of kind of major Fortune
100 clients, that's really our, our business

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920
focus.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.000
Heavy in the CPG with Proctor and Gamble,
retail with Kroeger, Luxottica, and also some

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.540
financial services; I know some of you here
represent that.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.810
We work with Fifth Third Bank.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.510
We also do some work for US Bank but they
don't like to know we're working on those

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.980
so...

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.700
We do a ton of brand work.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.080
This is really kind of the heart of what we
are as an agency is being the digital agency

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.690
of record for several major brands ranging
from Luvs to Red Bull to Ingram Micro.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.090
Again, heavy into CPG, healthcare, financial
services as well.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.260
And the thing that I do in my job most of
the day is help my team and our clients with

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.180
the, the key questions that they're all asking
in the hallways right now which is where is

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.400
marketing going?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.860
What do I do in digital of the fifty or sixty
different things that are possible, and even

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.540
down to the things like what's my social media,
social media strategy?

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.290
What is a little frustrating when you get
all those questions is that a lot of times

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.390
it's diving right down into the tactics, right?

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.670
So what exactly should I do?

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.060
And I think that what I want to share and
really the purpose of this book is to try

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.450
to get the entire industry really to, to raise
up a level and look at what is really the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.370
right way to engage in marketing period.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.130
If we were to look and start over of what
is marketing about, what is the right way

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.820
to approach that and that will help us get
to the right tactics, the right, the right

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.720
things that we actually do to bring those
strategies to life.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.560
And about three years ago, I started thinking
about this, this concept and really kind of

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.150
started off with a very basic statement which
I think most people would agree with.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.411
And that's that people don't like advertising,
right?

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.350
Okay, there's a few smiles and waves, and
nods there.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.692
It's sad but true and again, I've worked in
marketing for a long time and an advertising

00:04:45.692 --> 00:04:46.692
agency for a while.

00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:50.850
It's sad to admit this but this is really
the first step of any, any change, right?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.940
It's admitting your mistakes and what's wrong
with what you're doing today.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.400
And if you look at advertising today, in many
cases it's irrelevant at best and can be offensive

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.800
at worst and if you take things like the erectile
dysfunction category, that we've all seen

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.810
the advertising for these and what's amazing
is that it's only about one percent of men

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.090
over age 40 suffer from this condition.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.871
The other 99 percent of us -- I'm not bragging
by the way.

00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.020
I'm sorry [laughs].

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.610
That's a little bit weird.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.050
Anyhoo, I'm not 40 yet actually [laughs].

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.520
But it's irrelevant for most of the people
who are watching this and, and as a father

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.900
of two daughters, one 9 and one 7, it's really
also not fun when you're watching the Sunday

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.690
football game and, and, with the family and
see advertising for this and have your daughter

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.770
ask, "Daddy, what's ED?"

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.961
True story.

00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:48.870
I have another friend who has a son who said,
"I think I may have ED, Mom".

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.580
So sometimes advertising, even when it's irrevelant,
irrelevant, can go too far.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.470
And then we, as an industry overall, have
overwhelmed people with junk.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.500
So we put ads on gas pumps, ads on turnstiles
at the Cincinnati Bengals Stadium, and even

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.700
in the Netherlands, ads on sheep in a field.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.980
There's a sheep advertising network out there
that maybe Google can buy up and have some

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.260
revelant, relevant ads for us there.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.500
But it's really getting a little bit out of
control and the model of this constantly finding

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.200
new ways to interrupt people is starting to
break down.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.270
In many ways, digital has been that catalyst.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.520
And if you look at it at its heart, it's that
its giving people new habits of how they consume

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.310
media and the freedom that they have to control
their experience.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.620
One thing that's really interesting is that
people are watching, listening to, and, and

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.970
reading less ad supported media overall.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.380
There was a study a couple of years ago that
said ad supported media consumption is actually

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.510
down in the past five years and that's continuing
today even as people seem to be consuming

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.730
more media than ever.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.990
What's happening there is that people are
able to watch a DVD, maybe a whole season

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.380
of television on a DVD, instead of watching
it on traditional twenty minutes out of every

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.930
hour commercial supported television.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.690
People loading enough songs and creating playlists
on their IPod's that you really don't have

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.480
a need for terrestrial or ad supported radio.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.480
You've got your best hits right on hand, or
even things like video games where the sales

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.410
of Madden's annual franchise games keep going
up among young men and viewership of actual

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.240
live football is going down.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.260
While there is some advertising in Madden,
it's more to just make the game look legitimate

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.950
versus actually adding to the experience.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.490
And then of course we know the story of people
have freedom to skip or avoid advertising

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.490
in many ways.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:41.090
Tivo, who I'm meeting with later today actually,
tools like BugMeNot allow you to get content

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:48.000
without registering, and AdBlock which about
six million people have now installed on Firefox,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.550
that if you haven't tried it, it takes five
minutes to install and takes away all banner

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.590
ads that you see on websites.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.480
And so once you start seeing that happen,
it's a pretty slippery slope to see that the

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.720
model is starting to fail and more banners
is not the answer.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.040
We make a lot of banners for a lot of clients.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.040
We make money.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.540
My salary is paid by banners but I can tell
you right now that's not the future of where

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.800
marketing is going to go in digital.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.820
We see things like MySpace, Facebook.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.350
CPM's are horrible, responses are anemic.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.990
The government is starting to track, crack
down on the targeting tools that we want to

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.150
use.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.160
That again, there's no one out there protesting
to say let's allow advertisers to keep using

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.330
our personal data to serve better ads.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.269
That's not going to happen because of the
industry relationship we have.

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:35.820
And then finally, when we do eye tracking
studies, we see that more and more people

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.380
learn where banners are and learn not to look
at them.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.830
And so that's just another reality that we
have to face and figure out how to, how to

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.630
learn and migrate from there.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.029
It's not just making the banner bigger, "So
here are a couple of the new sizes, the push

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:52.290
down, the XXL box."

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.610
You know again, even organizations like Tech
Cruncher are making fun of this who make money

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.520
off banner ads but the reality is what do
you do when people start ignoring these ads

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520
too.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.030
One of the things that is interesting is AOL's
new strategy.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.940
One of the first things they did was cut out
a lot of the ad inventory to make their service

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.570
seem better.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.871
Again, they're listening to their consumers
and that's the first step.

00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:20.390
But that's not good news for, for advertisers
we work with.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.090
So you take that model and you say, "Wow,
we just can't keep interrupting people. What

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.910
do we do instead?"

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.390
And I think if you start to look around, you
see that a new model is starting to form and

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.571
again, digital is actually the catalyst in
many ways.

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:36.350
Some of the best new marketing out there is
happening because of new digital tools that

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.100
we have.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.880
Nike Plus for example.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
Who's on Nike Plus?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880
Come on.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
All right .

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.960
We got one, two way in the back there.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.200
You want to say how many miles you guys have
or is that too personal?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.290
[laughs]

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.420
I got on this about a year and half ago really
to frankly learn what the marketing hype was

00:09:53.420 --> 00:10:00.490
about and found it to be an incredible service
where it's helping me track my runs, improve

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.680
my distance, improve my times, do challenges
with friends.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.940
It's really somewhere between a product and
service and marketing.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.950
It's, it's hard to tell but regardless, it's
working very well for Nike.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.160
They say 30 percent of the users of Nike Plus
return more than once per week and in the

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.330
first year that they launched this, they said
that it was responsible for an eight percent

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.830
increase in profits.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:28.149
And so now Nike as an entire company has really
moving its marketing model toward creating

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:29.149
digital services.

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:36.160
In basketball, they've got training videos
online by actual NBA trainers and Europe,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.390
they have a special shoe that you buy and
when you buy it, you get access to a IPhone

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.690
app that you can bring out to the practice
field and get real tips and training regimens

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.820
from, from the pros.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.460
Southwest Airlines is another great digital
example of adding value through marketing.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.470
Their tool called Ding actually lets people
find - there's a lot of people who will use

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.140
Southwest to fly between key cities.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.360
Say they've got family in Houston and they
live in San Antonio.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.670
If that price -- fare price gets down to a
certain level they'll go any weekend and so

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.430
this Ding tool allows people to, to call out
the flights that they're interested in, what

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.839
fares are the magic price points for them.

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:17.190
And then when those fares hit, 'ding'.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.300
You hear it in your inbox – sorry -- on
your desktop and you can buy a fare right

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.410
there off the spot and some of the results
on this one, 10 million site visits through

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:32.310
Ding just in the third quarter of last year
and it's about four years in now.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.589
The, the data that they are sharing at least
so far as the second year end they got 150

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:39.600
million in revenue from this tool -- so incredible.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.360
Incredible service there and it's marketing
that people enjoy.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360
Kraft Foods is another one.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.070
Kraft has been a leader in really using digital
to provide services for people.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.540
You've probably seen kraftfoods.com.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.709
They've got a great website with recipes of
every type.

00:11:54.709 --> 00:12:00.310
They've added cooking videos and they've now
 -- they've gotten into IPhone apps with a

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.340
tool called IFood.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.300
Incredible success for them so far.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.980
They actually got featured in ITunes and they're
selling it for 99 cents.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.370
They felt like it was so valuable that they
needed to price it at a certain point to communicate

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.690
the value to buyers of it.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.410
And they said that they hit their three year
download goal in just a matter of weeks.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.810
I think in "Advertising Age" last week, they
announced that they are doing a 2.0 with more

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:32.459
services, more revenue opportunities which
means it's definitely working for them.

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:35.580
And you guys are doing this as well, something
definitely interesting.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.970
If you look at the value of Google, maybe
the first company that's created a, a big

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:46.270
sizable business off of creating marketing
that people want to see with Google

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.649
AdWords.

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:52.720
Again, Bob Garfield said it best that consumers
may not care much for commercials but they

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.940
do want to learn a lot about the information
that brands have and they're actively seeking

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:02.070
that and you are helping them find that, and
that really kind of gets to what this concept

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.070
is all about.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.890
We call it Marketing with Meaning and really
we think there's two elements of what is meaningful

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.850
marketing and what is really gonna succeed
today and increasingly going forward.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.421
The first is it's marketing that people choose
to engage with, and if you think about that

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:20.990
carefully, I mean for old time marketers like
myself, we're used to buying eyeballs, right?

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.980
Impressions by the thousand.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.580
This is shifting that and saying what it's
really about is how many people choose to

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.810
engage with the marketing that you've created.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.510
It's a much smaller number but it's actually
a much higher chance of getting sales at a

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.170
high rate from people once they're actually
saying I want to be a part of the marketing

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.110
that you're creating.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.529
And then the second piece is it's creating
marketing that itself improves people's lives.

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:49.730
Again, it's really hard for traditional advertisers
to kind of think this way especially marketing

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.940
that, that may not have the force, you may
not force to buy the product or service itself.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.100
I know when I worked at Proctor and Gamble,
I worked on new formulas with Tide, new products

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.149
like Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:05.480
I loved getting up in the morning and knowing
that I was creating products that people loved

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.940
and they told me at focus groups; they wrote
emails.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.399
It was, it was great but then I would go work
on a commercial where I'd try to squeeze in,

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:18.240
on Tide we called it the "Into the Light"
shot where Mom going by her television set

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.110
with the commercial playing would get some
unconscious symbolism of whiteness linked

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.440
to the brand and we spent hours and hours
trying to perfect those interruptions so we

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.709
could somehow get there.

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:33.730
This is about actually creating the marketing
that improves people's lives so frankly a

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.800
lot of the work we do as marketers and advertisers
is more valuable to us as part of the equation

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800
that comes through here.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.200
One of things that we've done and a couple
of things in the book as well; I think tools

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.800
we use in our company, one of the things is
really where do you start?

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.010
What do you do that's meaningful for your
brand and, and your consumers and one very

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.920
simple way of looking at it kind of – is
come -- comes from "Maslow's Hierarchy of

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.510
Needs" and you probably remember this from
Sociology 101.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.961
It's about 50 years old, this model, but it's
still the best way to kind of understand what

00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:09.420
are people's need and then when -- what do
they satisfy next once they've, they've met

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.420
those needs.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.420
It starts off with things like food and shelter
and water.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.120
Then you go to levels like friendship and
family.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.050
And then finally at the top is self actualization
around how do I improve myself, my family,

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.980
and the world around me.
We've created something similar we call the

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.970
"Hierarchy of Meaningful Marketing" which
is one way to help brands really come up with

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.300
those ideas.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.480
The very basic level is solution and so this
is things like give me services, information,

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.230
and incentives that are helpful.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:43.279
This is that bar; to be meaningful you've
at least got to add value in that way.

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:46.971
The lowly coupon is a great example of meaningful
marketing.

00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:52.829
This is, for decades, people have gone to
their Sunday papers to look for advertising

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:54.101
in the form of the Sunday coupon.

00:15:54.101 --> 00:16:00.350
They learn about what's new; they get discounts
on purchases they're thinking about buying.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.300
And the problem though is that this is a medium
that's gone pretty old and hasn't been updated

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.320
in a while.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.779
A project we got to work on with two of our
clients, Proctor and Gamble and Kroger, was

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:17.160
P&amp;G E-Saver and this is a -- really the first
for, for both -- an online coupon linked to

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.470
that Sunday paper.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.390
What you could do is register on the site,
register your Kroger shopper card and then

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.040
every week you can see which coupons are coming
out.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.870
You don't have to buy the newspaper. You check
off the ones that you're interested in and

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.490
then when you buy the products at the store,
you get the credit automatically put on the

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.829
end of your grocery bill so this is a great
win-win.

00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:42.611
Newspaper circulations have declined so it
helps the marketers, helps the consumers because

00:16:42.611 --> 00:16:43.611
it's more convenient.

00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:49.209
Women and moms are starting to plan their
shopping trips online, first and foremost.

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:50.380
The results have been really great.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:55.140
They had a hundred thousand people register
for this in the first month, well north of

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.760
that today and we're seeing things like higher
shopper card registration, personalization

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.160
that we've tested has become very successful,
people opening the emails more, redeeming

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.480
the coupons more really at a rate that's unseen
in, in traditional Sunday coupons so great,

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.480
great stuff there.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.799
Anyone use the Domino's Pizza Tracker lately?

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:20.940
Tons of people are using it.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.149
This is really interesting and it was kind
of a surprise story but it shows a lot of

00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:28.429
different opportunities for brands to just
provide information about the products that

00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:31.590
they're selling, or in this case delivering.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:37.409
About a year ago, Dominos actually had a problem
which is people will call in frequently after

00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:42.480
they've ordered their pizza but before the
thirty minutes is up to see where it is, and

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.559
really some of that is that we've become use
to this "Where's my order? Where's my, where's

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:47.559
my delivery?"

00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:52.820
We get our UPS packages; we track the steps
along the way and Dominos was having their

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.379
phone lines tied up with people checking on
the progress of their pizza.

00:17:56.379 --> 00:18:02.919
So they launched this Pizza Tracker online
that has a – it's quasi real, quasi simulated

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:08.379
stages of where the pizza is depending on
when you ordered it and now people are going

00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:09.379
there.

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:12.950
When it was first launched around the Super
Bowl last year, a lot of people in the industry

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.609
laughed at and said, "Who wants to check their
pizza?"

00:18:15.609 --> 00:18:21.840
Well, in the first two months, a million people
were silly enough to do that and that was

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.859
only in half the stores that was rolled out
at that time.

00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:28.340
At this point, it's been a huge success for
Dominos.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:33.929
On-liners are now 28 percent of their sales,
75 percent of those people are using the Pizza

00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:40.389
Tracker, and they've now put the Pizza Tracker
in an IPhone app, on Facebook, and more tools

00:18:40.389 --> 00:18:44.970
coming along the way so that silliness is
doing very well for them.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.640
And it's inspired a lot of other companies
to get into things like there's an egg company

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.350
where you can track which farm your egg came
from based on a code that's printed on the

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.600
egg.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.549
Dole bananas have a SKU where you can track
which farm around the world the bananas came

00:18:59.549 --> 00:19:00.549
from.

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:05.869
People love the information about the products
that they're, they're buying and I spotted

00:19:05.869 --> 00:19:06.869
this this morning.

00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:11.429
Actually a friend of mine called knowing I
was coming here but some of the things that

00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:15.059
you're doing at Google I think have a lot
of opportunity to provide that information

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:16.139
that people are looking for.

00:19:16.139 --> 00:19:21.330
I think this was announced yesterday at the
big meeting you guys had down at the headquarters,

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:27.090
Search by Site with Google Goggles, where
you could say hold up your IPhone over a wine

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.759
label and then automatically get some information
about that product right there.

00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:32.570
So tons of opportunity.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.619
People do want this information and then,
in this case, they want it at the wine store.

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:41.210
They're not going to go home and boot up their
laptop to get the information they need so

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.629
a great use of mobile to provide info.

00:19:44.629 --> 00:19:48.409
The second level we call connection and so
this is really about that, that next step.

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:53.590
How do you create experiences that people
can share with others?

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:58.940
One of the challenges we had at our agency
a little over a year ago was with launching

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.950
a new product from Healthy Choice, which is
owned by Con Agra Foods.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.450
Healthy Choice has been known for years as
really the product for if you've got health

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.830
issues and you need things that are a little
bit better for you, a little bit lower sodium

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.830
or less fat.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:16.309
It's been a great market over the years but
it's been limited and kind of too much niche

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:21.109
 – really wanted as -- the brand really
wanted to get to a younger audience.

00:20:21.109 --> 00:20:26.059
The first step they took was to make better
products that are, are better taste, more

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:29.409
convenient, which they've done some great
work on there.

00:20:29.409 --> 00:20:34.559
But they needed to explain these products
were available to a group of thirties and

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:37.530
forty somethings that have really not spent
much time thinking about Healthy Choice in

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.590
the past couple years.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.519
We did some research and we really found out
that sixty percent of our target audience

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:47.100
is in offices and they're eating lunch at
their desks.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.690
We thought that there really was an opportunity
there.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.049
We dug a little further in that and we found
at that time when they're having lunch at

00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:56.090
their desk is me time, right?

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.139
They're not doing work emails then or responding.

00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:03.100
They're checking out their personal email
accounts maybe; they're checking what's new

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.679
with their Facebook updates, or looking at
things like viral videos.

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:12.019
And one of the guys on our team said that
lunch time is the new prime time.

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:17.470
And so we created this pretty cool entertaining
experience around Healthy Choice and I'll

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.600
show this quick video to describe it.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.109
[video plays in background]

00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:29.489
[music on video]

00:21:29.489 --> 00:21:33.015
&gt;&gt; Video Narrator: "Working Lunch" is the
first ever live improve web series directed

00:21:33.015 --> 00:21:34.015
by the audience.

00:21:34.015 --> 00:21:42.659
Fresh Mixers gave office workers a convenient
to mix fresh ingredients into a tasty meal.

00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:46.830
"Working Lunch" gave them a fun way to create
fresh, live improve comedy from the comfort

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.649
of their cubes.

00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:50.799
The audience was in control from the start,
influencing the action in real time every

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:51.799
step of the way.

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:56.409
It was the digital equivalent of shouting
out a suggestion in a comedy club.

00:21:56.409 --> 00:21:59.980
And it led to some crazy stuff.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:21.909
In all, 16 original episodes were streamed
across 3 time zones every day during the lunch

00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:22.909
hour.

00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:23.909
[music on video]

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:27.239
"Working Lunch" and Fresh Mixers were a hit,
serving nearly 3 million live video streams.

00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:31.690
"Working Lunch" – user powered comedy served
fresh at your desk.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.820
Now that's fresh.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.949
[music on video]

00:22:35.949 --> 00:22:41.890
&gt;&gt; Bob Gilbreath: So, pretty fun stuff and
it drove the results for the business as well.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:48.279
We've had -- now had over 5 million views
of the videos that we served up there and

00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:52.350
had a very successful launch of their Cafe
Steamers products there.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.799
What's also really great about this story
is it was the first kind of big digital led

00:22:56.799 --> 00:23:01.059
idea that the company, Con Agra, had done
and now that we saw some success there and

00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:06.389
made it happen, it's gotten the whole company
really pumped up of doing more and kind of

00:23:06.389 --> 00:23:10.489
take it to next level on, on future initiatives.

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:14.480
Any time you personalize a product, this is
meaningful marketing that I think really does

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.409
a good job on hitting on that idea of connections.

00:23:17.409 --> 00:23:19.669
My M&amp;M's probably the best at this.

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:21.479
They've been doing it for five or six years
now.

00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:25.539
It started off you could just type a simple
message, a few words and pick out the color

00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:30.389
M&amp;M's that you wanted, and they've now continued
to evolve that to where you can have sport

00:23:30.389 --> 00:23:32.830
teams on there; you can have pictures uploaded.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:39.049
It's really, really great and any time you're
having consumers make the brand their own,

00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:43.950
that's a much, much deeper connection that
lasts a lot longer than just that "Into the

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:49.690
White" shot of whiteness equity point that
you may get with a traditional commercial.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:55.129
M&amp;M's, again, you think about -- used to be
fifty cents at the checkout counter was what

00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:56.779
they look at for a sale.

00:23:56.779 --> 00:24:01.179
With this product, it's a 7 ounce pack for
12.99, minimum of three packs plus shipping

00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:07.289
and handling so it goes from being a fifty
cent item into a fifty dollar brand experience.

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:10.480
Better experience for the consumer, much more
profitable for M&amp;M's.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.600
And they said that this line has really revitalized
the entire brand and they are now taking it

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:20.070
to their other products like Dove candy for
example.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:27.940
I wanted to just throw an example of a non-digital
social media story in here too.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.799
One of my favorite examples of really kind
of long term meaningful marketing is what

00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:35.609
the Mount Gay Rum brand has done with its
red hats.

00:24:35.609 --> 00:24:41.080
I'm not sure if there's any sailors out there
but this is a premium rum brand that's actually

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:47.840
been around for three hundred years from Barbados
and several years ago they started sponsoring

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:54.220
regattas and if you actually participate,
if you're sailing in this regatta, you get

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.770
a commemorative hat from Mount Gay Rum with
the name of the regatta across the top sewn

00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.779
in.

00:24:59.779 --> 00:25:05.940
And these hats have become incredible collector's
items for people, like that proof that you've

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.940
been in the race.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.879
And what it's used as is that people will
be walking around in an airport or on a beach

00:25:10.879 --> 00:25:15.399
with one of these hats on and other sailors
will come up to them out of the blue and strike

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:20.582
up a conversation about the race itself, what
boat do you sail, and that type of thing.

00:25:20.582 --> 00:25:26.059
And so these rum hat wearers go out in public
wearing the hat, knowing that it'll help them

00:25:26.059 --> 00:25:27.749
connect with other people.

00:25:27.749 --> 00:25:32.769
And so great example of a kind of social media
without digital that shows that people can

00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:38.580
connect over brands with the simple investment
of a red hat.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.039
Again, I want to throw a good Google example
in there.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:46.450
What you all are doing with celebrating events,
holidays, special moments like Sesame Street's

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.039
40th Anniversary; this is meaningful marketing
of Google.

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:55.120
This is part of the reason that your company
continues to be the number one most valuable

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.389
brand in the world without doing a 100 million
dollar glitzy advertising campaign like some

00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:04.019
of your competitors, Yahoo and AOL, are doing
right now.

00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:07.580
Makes -- making the everyday fun, making it
meaningful, that's really what it's all about

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:13.460
and sometimes it's just these little things
that, that can have a huge impact.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.879
Speaking of little things, I want to share
this.

00:26:15.879 --> 00:26:20.769
Anyone clicked on this banner ad in the past
couple of months?

00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:23.899
Would you click it? We actually had a challenge
on…

00:26:23.899 --> 00:26:27.790
The Pringles brand is one of our clients;
they had gone through a process where they

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.580
really wanted to restructure the brand and
really kind of take a new look of what was

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.679
their brand purpose; why does the brand exist.

00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:38.909
This is something that, that their former
Chief Marketing Officer, Jim Stengel, really

00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:44.229
led for the company and they've continued
to, to push that from there.

00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:48.659
Pringles came up with a new brand purpose
which is words to the effect of Pringles exist

00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:51.979
to create moments of spontaneous fun.

00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:56.259
And one of the first pieces of work that,
that we got under that new brand purpose was

00:26:56.259 --> 00:26:57.739
the lowly banner ad, right?

00:26:57.739 --> 00:27:02.679
I just ended up talking a lot of bad things
about banner ads but our team took that on

00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:06.809
and said, "Okay, how can we – very simple,
brief – how can we create spontaneous fun

00:27:06.809 --> 00:27:08.330
through a normal banner ad?"

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.970
And they came up with this concept which is
really daring.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:19.080
It's weird, it's odd, and frankly daring people
to click and when you do start clicking, like

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.080
I will right now.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:33.450
[pause]

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.320
So each one of these is one of 97 total clicks
here.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.320
[pause]

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.999
But check it out, check it out.

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:47.159
Google 'Pringles Banner' and you'll go right
to our staging server.

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:52.559
We knew this was successful when actually
we had it on staging and it somehow leaked

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:57.279
to the outside public and within about three
days, we had three hundred thousand

00:27:57.279 --> 00:28:03.169
people go through this banner ad on our website
and twenty percent of them clicked all the

00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:08.039
way to the end which is 97 frames if you're,
you're wondering.

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:12.719
And what really made us feel good was seeing
this listed, listed on on Buzz Feed.

00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:16.119
Even the critics at FARK raved about this.

00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:19.479
We knew that we had something that, that was
very powerful when people are saying 'best

00:28:19.479 --> 00:28:23.470
banner ad ever', 'thanks for making my day',
and then importantly, 'I'm going to go rush

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.840
out and buy some Pringles this weekend because
you made me have such a great time'.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.279
For us in the agency business, we also love
it because you can still win can advertising

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:33.309
awards for it.

00:28:33.309 --> 00:28:39.330
We got a Gold Lion in June and this was the
first Gold Lion in the cyber category, or

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.530
digital category, that Proctor and Gamble
had ever won so even the lowly banner ad;

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.720
you can do some fun stuff with.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.549
In the final level, we call it achievement
so this is again mirroring Maslow: help me

00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:54.109
improve myself, my family, and the world around
me.

00:28:54.109 --> 00:28:59.389
A program we created that we've been running
for five years, Diabetes Control for Life.

00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:02.730
We saw a real opportunity for people who were
newly diagnosed with diabetes.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.649
They go in, the doctor tells them they've
got a disease that they'll probably have for

00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:09.649
their life, that they've got to change their
eating habits, and they've got to exercise

00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:16.570
more and twenty minutes later, they're ushered
out and are on their own and we found a real

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.580
opportunity to provide them kind of the coaching
and guidance and tools that they needed to

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:27.509
make health habit change and with this program,
the centerpiece is a 24 week meal and fitness

00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:33.539
planner that actually has clinical data that
shows that people's A1C levels, which is a

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:37.919
key determent of the diseases progression,
go down and their weight is going down and

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:39.820
they're saying they're feeling better.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.489
And so we've got great results for improving
their lives but then we also have some great

00:29:43.489 --> 00:29:49.000
data that shows participants in the program
are buying three times more Abbott products

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.599
here in the diabetes category so that's again
a tremendous win- win for them.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:59.129
Something I also want to point out that just
popped up for me this week that I blogged

00:29:59.129 --> 00:30:05.630
about, Facebook is really helping people create
causes and I got an email.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:11.710
My birthday is coming up in another week or
so and got this message from Facebook saying

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.649
we know your birthday is coming up and they
also know that everyone on my Facebook list

00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:17.929
is going to be seeing that.

00:30:17.929 --> 00:30:20.479
This year why don't you help support a charity?

00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:23.909
So with this pretty simple tool, in about
five minutes, you say why you're going to

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:27.859
donate and you can pick the charity that you're
interested in donating to.

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:28.900
It's really early; check it out.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.299
I think it's pretty interesting but it's,
it's neat how they kind of take that personal

00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:36.299
thing that we all experience every year and
turn it from being something that's dreaded

00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:40.659
even and turning it into something positive
that you can share with your, your friends'

00:30:40.659 --> 00:30:41.659
network.

00:30:41.659 --> 00:30:42.729
So really cool stuff there.

00:30:42.729 --> 00:30:47.940
I want to interrupt with just some other things
that we've been thinking about lately, about

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.899
this concept and, and the clients that we're
speaking with.

00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:55.009
One is that I think that we're always asked
the question and we were always out there

00:30:55.009 --> 00:30:59.210
saying, "What's new? What's my Twitter strategy?
What do I do in social media? Is this the

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.210
year of mobile?"

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:04.500
There's also a lot of those questions about
the tactics that are, are up and coming and

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.460
one of things I think that's really easy is
to, to look through new media through this

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:16.210
lens of meaningful marketing and in many ways,
I think that we're leapfrogging the interruptive

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.830
stage and going right to the meaning stage
in our industry and , that's really -- if

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:24.619
you look at that idea of leap frog technology,
it's, it's mainly used when you talk about

00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:29.200
in China -- they're not putting in telephone
poles like we had in our country.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.559
They're going straight to the best technology;
they're going straight to cell towers.

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:37.940
In certain other countries, they're not putting
in coal plants; they're going straight to

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.989
solar cells.

00:31:39.989 --> 00:31:44.859
So if you think about that in a new media,
I think we're already seeing mobile, for example,

00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:49.450
leap frog the interruptive stage, the tiny
little banner stage, and going right to things

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.009
like apps.

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:55.929
And I know if we look -- as I look across
some of our clients and others out there,

00:31:55.929 --> 00:31:59.269
it's tough to get this data but I'd be willing
to bet that brands are already spending more

00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:04.809
money on added value apps than they are on
regular mobile media.

00:32:04.809 --> 00:32:07.710
I think that's something that brands are really
starting to get excited about.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.200
Charmin is one of our clients; they have a
great app called "Sit or Squat" that helps

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.820
you find bathrooms, public restrooms, when
you're in need.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:19.909
I mean, believe me, it's the most innovative
stuff since Mr. Whipple came on the scene.

00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:24.659
But this little app is something that's getting
a Charmin brand, again, total paper brand,

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:28.330
in the marketing pages and having people excited
about it.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:33.870
And having a great experience with this app,
you may become a Charmin fan for life versus

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.509
kind of losing favor every couple of years
and needing a commercial, friendly commercial

00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:39.049
reminder.

00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:45.500
Gaming is another area where as soon as - especially
through things like XBox Live, people have

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.609
been looking for how do we put another banner,
how do we put some kind of ad message into

00:32:49.609 --> 00:32:51.229
games?

00:32:51.229 --> 00:32:56.099
Here you can see one example I pulled from
my Guitar Hero playing; you can barely see

00:32:56.099 --> 00:33:03.139
it on the fake stage of Guitar Hero but that's
an ad for Microsoft Sync, in car audio product.

00:33:03.139 --> 00:33:08.130
Here you can see an ad for Diesel on a, on
a racing game. I think already that's, that's

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:12.109
not getting the mass support that a lot of
people and entrepreneurs would hope it would

00:33:12.109 --> 00:33:17.690
but what is seeing a lot of success is when
you add value to the gamers' experience.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:23.309
Best Buy, for example, partnered with Rock
Band to -- on the re-release of the album

00:33:23.309 --> 00:33:28.419
"Ten"; they provided three free songs for
Pearl Jam songs you could play on your Rock

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:29.559
Band game.

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:34.379
So that was a great promotion that was actually
adding value.

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:40.350
Universal Studios launching the movie "Tropic
Thunder" partnered with Tom Clancy's Red Cell

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:45.080
Vegas game, First Person Shooter, to create
a whole new level that you could play in kind

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.029
of a scavenger hunt for the game.

00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:51.460
So again, they're adding more content to the
game experience and that helped them get a

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:57.039
lot of buzz for their opening weekend which
was critical.

00:33:57.039 --> 00:34:02.179
One last thing I want to hit on is again,
our clients, a, a lot of mass marketers that

00:34:02.179 --> 00:34:07.419
for years have been about hitting tens of
millions of consumers' eyeballs a year and

00:34:07.419 --> 00:34:10.790
hoping a small percentage of them buys the
products.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:15.170
When we talk about digital, when we talk about
what to do in the world where that kind of

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.930
traditional interruptive model is falling
apart, what we constantly hear back -- and

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.500
I'm sure a lot of you have heard it as well
 -- is what about scale?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.970
How do I get scale?

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:28.020
How do I get those tens of millions of people
to pay attention to my message?

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.510
And I think the watch out here is that A)
scale is already going away.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.159
It's very, very hard even with an interruption
to hit that many people.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:41.140
They're not -- folks are tuning out of traditional
advertising or splintering it along five hundred

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:47.461
channels but I think there's a really different
opportunity to have a more focused kind of

00:34:47.461 --> 00:34:52.310
relationship marketing experience with a much
smaller group of people and again being something

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:56.030
that's meaningful marketing; you can keep
them for life and get them to buy a lot more

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.310
of your products than just finding a very
weak interruption.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.770
And one piece of evidence that I see on that
is that if you look at Nike Plus kind of,

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.500
something I mentioned earlier, it's a global
tool.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.310
It's been around for four years now; it's
a big focus of Nike's marketing efforts.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:16.240
It only has about 1.5 million people using
it, who have ever used it, around the world

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:22.050
and if you dig even deeper, it's only about
250,000 people who have run or walked at least

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.080
one hundred miles.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.740
That's not a lot -- I mean that's kind of
the basics and so you look at this huge tool

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:34.860
that's getting a lot of buzz is really only
focusing on a couple hundred thousand people.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:39.370
That's hard for a traditional market to understand
but Nike is seeing the results and that's

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.270
why they're shifting this model. They're seeing
that, "Wow, we can get those 250,000 people

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:48.800
and more and get them to spend a couple hundred
dollars with us every year versus getting

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.790
some tiny fraction to remember to buy our
shoes once every five years''.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:56.470
So that's really kind of shifting the model
right there as well.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.710
I do have one extra last thing I wanted, I
wanted to bring up because it was actually

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:07.200
a conversation we had at our WPP offices with
some folks from Google a couple of weeks ago

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.480
and this question of "Are GRP's really the
answer? Is that gross rating point the number

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.770
of eyeballs?"

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.800
There's a lot of people in the digital marketing
industry that say, "You know what? We're not

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.210
getting the growth we need. Consumers are
still not spending enough on digital so let's

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:24.290
just put everything we do into the impression,
cost per thousand model."

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:28.580
Jeff Ramsey, one of the, the, the top data
guys in the industry for a while, recently

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.850
said this and quoted someone who said, "You'll
never see P&amp;G and Unilever and those guys

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.120
spending online unless we give them reach
frequency and GRP's. Their entire business

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.230
model is based on that."

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.090
And we actually had a debate.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:47.070
Dennis Woodside was with us a couple of weeks
ago talking about a new tool where it was

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:52.900
kind of like a click to play a video from
a brand and the discussion we had is that

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.480
what do you charge for that, right?

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.280
So in the CPM type model, it's twenty dollars
for every thousand people.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:06.590
So that's maybe only a penny or less per view
on a traditional ad on television in primetime.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.900
But what do you charge, what are marketers
willing to pay for someone who says, "I want

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.390
to see your ad. I want to click on it."

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.260
So that's one of the things we've got to struggle
with as an industry and I think it's much

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.740
better for us to start spending our time figuring
out what's the value of that engaged choice

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.160
for consumer than figuring out how do we take
that great experience there and dumb it down

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:30.820
and price it down to the level of lowest common
denominator with the GRP.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.270
So some stuff we got to figure out.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.730
The final thoughts I just want to say, I mean
we'll get some books out to you guys and definitely

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.750
follow up with me if you, you don't have enough
and, and I'm happy to send some out.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:46.200
You guys are great thought leaders and the
kind of people that we want spreading this,

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.370
this word.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.700
But the last thing I'd say is that when you
go back to the meeting here today, when you're

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.560
talking with brands, I think one really useful
tool to think about is to just ask yourself

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.030
the questions, "Will people choose to engage
with my marketing? Is my marketing itself

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:05.110
adding value to peoples' lives? And then frankly,
is this the kind of work that's meaningful

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.110
to me?"

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.100
And I think when we hit all three of those,
we're going to have a lot of great sales for

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.822
our clients and we're going to have a much
more enjoyable every day experience when we

00:38:13.822 --> 00:38:15.980
get up in the morning too.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.130
So the book is out.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.480
I've got a website, marketingwithmeaning.com,
where I've got three blog posts a week.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:28.110
For financial services folks, I've got a lot
of banking examples and stories in there.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:32.360
Also got a Twitter feed that I update pretty
frequently too and with the book.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.060
There's an IPhone app that goes along with
that where I've kind of got links to all the

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.870
examples used in the book which are about
five hundred to go see them online too.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.610
So we got like ten minutes left.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:51.390
Would love to take any questions. The tougher,
the better. Yeah?

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:59.660
&gt;&gt; So I guess I'm curious what's new?

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:06.940
With all due respect, I understand what you're
saying about this really new evolution, marketing

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.940
with meaning makes sense.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.940
I'm just trying to capture like what's the
summary of what you are trying to say?

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.940
[inaudible]

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.940
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Right. Well, I think - so
the question for those, if you can't hear

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.260
it in different cities, is what's new about
this and I think there has been some talk

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:19.200
in the past of other concepts from… another
group calls Brand Utility.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.990
There's another person out there that, that
says marketing a service.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.570
Whatever buzz word we want to use is fine.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.530
I think what I've really tried to do in the
book is give – it's a guide for the traditional

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:36.130
marketers that see a lot of cool new stuff
and tactics and know they need to get on digital

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.360
but they're not sure how.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.480
And what they need is a real, a different
way of looking of what is the function of

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.310
marketing to then be able to understand what's
the right way to work in digital, what's the

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:51.510
right way to deliver on television, what's
the right way to do events or promotions.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:56.230
And so the book itself, about the first half,
I kind of talk about just the overall concept

00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:00.600
and then the second half I've got really a
step by step methodology for how do you set

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:05.090
great business objectives, how do you get
good insights, how do you create a strategy

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.630
around meaningful marketing, how do you measure,
how do you follow up, tips and experiences

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:12.600
I've had both on the client side of Proctor
as well as the agency side

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.960
working with a lot of big companies on the
mistakes to look out for.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.540
So this is really getting at, and we were
just talking earlier, the ideas are out there,

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.670
the future is here -- it's unevenly distributed
and it's only distributed where organizations

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:32.200
have said how do I shift my entire way of
looking at marketing so I think that's really

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.970
what's new there, not the tactics but the
overall approach.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:35.970
Yeah?

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:36.970
&gt;&gt; You've offered examples of like the apps,
the M&amp;M's, the personalization website.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:45.550
What would your advice be for the resourceful
trained SMV's that are almost working?

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:52.700
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; For example, what are some
of the other companies? Small businesses?

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.700
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.560
&gt;&gt;What people can do if they don't have money
for a program?

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Sure. Right.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.751
Basically, what I think is really interesting
is especially with some of the social media

00:41:03.751 --> 00:41:08.760
tools, it's allowing people to do, small business
to do things that they were never able to

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:14.050
do before and what's great about a small business
is often they have more time than they do

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:19.410
have money and they often know their customers
very well.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:23.670
So using some social media tools, again not
just for its own sake or we need to get on

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:28.250
the bandwagon, but looking strategically as
what's a, what's a business objective you

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:32.160
have, what's an insight about your customer
base, and then what are some things maybe

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.530
we can do to hit on those to add value and
get higher sales.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:42.900
One very basic one that I love is there's
a little deli by our office that has a Facebook

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.910
account that they basically focus on updating
their special every day at about 11 o'clock

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:51.750
so the business objective there is get more
people to come in more often.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:55.650
The insight is about 11 o'clock you start
thinking about where you are going to go and

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.890
if you got that, for me it's the Buffalo Chicken
Sandwich.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:02.190
If that's available, I'm at that deli every
time and by using Facebook, you're also able

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.780
to coordinate and message friends in the office
and say, "Hey, let's go out together. They're

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.160
having the special."

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.650
So their word of mouth -- they've told me
that they see sales increase since they started

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:12.880
doing that program.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.820
You know, something that's very basic and
simple.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.880
I think other ways, what you can do is again
focus on what that problem is.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.990
Get some experimental budget money, help companies
set up a test and get some real data in.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.990
&gt;&gt; Bob, I'd love to hear your thoughts on
where you think our products fit in with some

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.990
of your strategies because I see something
like AdWords speaking to

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.990
engagement in some senses and particularly
for a lot of our director's thoughts advertise

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.990
their focus on engagement but yet we've acquired
double

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.990
click and the big bat on display at the end
of advertising which may be opposition to

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.990
some of your thoughts.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.990
How do you see our products fitting in?

00:42:29.990 --> 00:43:05.020
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I think that
the better way to think about it -- what I

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.730
would encourage for all these products and
a lot of the traditional media is not going

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.070
to go away either so print is gonna continue,
radio is gonna continue, television is gonna

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:17.400
to continue and I think that the opportunities
are how do you twist it into really what the

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.470
strategy of how you use it in the creative
as well.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:25.660
So while I said a lot of bad things about
banner ads, we love doing banners that actually

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:32.100
allow people to get deeper information, video,
into the banner itself so things like when

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:36.770
we say -- offer a sample through a banner
ad, we get incredible engagement rates.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.350
Ten percent plus people choosing to hover
over that and spend thirty seconds, forty

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:45.290
seconds into that ad; so that's really where
I would see it.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:51.090
And frankly the reality is that a lot of traditional
brand folks will say "I don't click on banners"

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:55.420
and so one of the answers to that is, "Well,
this is not really a banner. This is an experience;

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.710
this is a kind of a portal to where they can
get information that they desire without having

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:01.550
to leave the website that they're on today."

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:07.610
So anytime that we've seen that more rich
media that has added value, not just clever

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.960
annoyance or takeovers, that's where we see
really great results, and I think AdWords

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:19.910
 – to me that is a core, arguably the first
real marketing company that is hitting on

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.540
marketing with meaning, where I'm searching
and I'm going to find things.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:27.220
A lot of times what the advertiser is paying
for is useful and it's a win-win- win for

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:33.900
all three.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:51.003
&gt;&gt; What do you see as the ideal balance between
a meaningful ad and a humorous ad?

00:44:51.003 --> 00:44:52.003
I think we are so used to seeing beer commercials
and also viral videos where they are focused

00:44:52.003 --> 00:44:53.003
on humor but the meaning could be lost but
then again, you don't have an aging advertising

00:44:53.003 --> 00:44:54.003
exec that's not going to get any sort of [inaudible]
so the truth is out there.

00:44:54.003 --> 00:44:55.003
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean that's a really
tricky one.

00:44:55.003 --> 00:44:56.003
Like one of the, one of the temptations would
be to say, "Hey, all you need to do in your

00:44:56.003 --> 00:45:01.510
television commercial is make it cute or funny
and done deal. We got meaningful marketing

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:02.510
now."

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:06.280
There's certainly occasions where we all have
our favorite commercials that, that make us

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.490
laugh and we want to see again.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.320
Maybe we want to go on YouTube and send it
to friends afterwards.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.750
I think this is really though thinking of,
of first and foremost, about things like how

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:20.010
do we get something that's worthy of people
choosing to see it on YouTube and oh by the

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:25.120
way, we'll, we'll play it on a -- during the
Super Bowl or over the weekend games as well.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.140
I think it's a little bit of a different way
of looking at it versus "hey we got thirty

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.411
seconds to fill. What do we do?"

00:45:30.411 --> 00:45:35.500
We've got this time and so I think that if
you start looking at it in that way, it will

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:41.411
encourage creatives at agencies and other
places to start thinking more and

00:45:41.411 --> 00:45:44.420
again giving a richer palace.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:49.040
One of the problems with the traditional 30
second ad is it's only 30 seconds or maybe

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:54.270
a minute so creatively, that's a tough box
to break out of.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:59.870
So that's something there that I think is
an opportunity for thinking first how can

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:04.510
we create something that's fun and interesting
and then second about traditional television.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:05.760
Does that answer your question?

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Okay.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.260
Someone was kind of ducking around there.
Yeah?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:20.750
&gt;&gt; I'm curious to hear what your thoughts
are on some mistakes that you've seen against

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.750
the traditional advertisers trying to dip
their toes into digital?

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:26.440
Bob Gilbreath &gt;&gt; Tons of mistakes out there
and sadly in traditional organizations when

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:33.530
the mistakes happen often, that can be the
end of someone's career or the idea of experimenting.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:37.360
I do try to talk about some examples that
I've seen, both in the industry and personal

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.161
experience in the book.

00:46:39.161 --> 00:46:45.010
One of the -- I think the most interesting
ones is what Dr. Pepper did with their new

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:49.220
 – I'm forgetting the name -- Guns and Roses
album.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.220
Did anyone see that?

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:55.500
Where they said if the album finally comes
out after ten years of hype by the end of

00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:01.170
2008, they'll give everybody in the country
a free Dr. Pepper and Axl Rose actually got

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:07.250
the album off in November and to fulfill that
obligation, they put a website up for just

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:13.050
24 hours for people to fill out the request
form and it crashed.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:21.680
It was impossible to log on, a lot of negative
buzz on Twitter, other places online and they

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.890
came back and said, "Okay, we'll keep it open
for another half a day."

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.180
Again, you couldn't get through.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:32.290
I tried about 25 times myself and people came
away with a pretty poor experience which -- where

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.530
it should have been the height of Dr. Pepper,
right?

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:39.860
So they focused on a piece of pop culture
 -- people aren't really thinking about Dr.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.860
Pepper.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.470
They had a grand slam -- even Axl Rose was
excited about it and said, "Yep, we're happy",

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.820
even though he didn't get paid.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:51.980
And for them to drop the ball on the execution,
that was really a negative there so that's

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:57.310
one of the things that a good agency will
help make sure that you've got extra server

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:02.370
capacity, put in a cloud or whatever but really
knowing that you got to fulfill your obligation.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:08.001
I think another example that hits every year
and it's going on right now is the "Elf Yourself"

00:48:08.001 --> 00:48:13.820
program from who knows where?
What brand does "Elf Yourself"?

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.950
Raise your hand if you think it's Staples.

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:19.470
Raise your hand if you think it's Office Max.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.210
Raise your hand if you think it's Office Depot.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:25.100
Okay, so there's no consensus, right?

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.580
It's Office Max, I think.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:36.310
They've done it for four years and a huge
amount of people going through the program

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:41.200
but they've done nothing to actually to link
the brand to the program or to try and get

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.650
traffic into the stores at this important
time of year.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:50.470
Now they've said, "Well, it just helps our
equity and we don't care about getting sales",

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:54.420
as crazy as that sounds but I think there
could have been a lot of opportunities for

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.010
again, thinking how could we be more meaningful
and then how do we handle the business objective

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.840
of getting people into the store.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:05.470
They could have done something like once you
do your Jib Jab, you can hit a button and

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:11.880
go get a printout of your picture at the local
Office Max store, right?

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.690
So maybe something like that would get the
tens of millions of people who are playing

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:20.390
with this to go into the store and pick up
their free picture and then buy some, some

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.250
other gear that they need too.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:25.180
So something simple like that I think could
have done a lot better.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:28.690
So making sure you keep your eyes on what's
the business objective -- how are

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.100
we getting in your lives is still important.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:35.760
Anybody else?

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.600
[Pause]

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600
Great.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600
[Pause]

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.300
Thanks very much.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.300
Appreciate it.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:43.970
[applause]
