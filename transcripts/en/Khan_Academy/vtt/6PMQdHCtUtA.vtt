00:00:00.655 --> 00:00:03.634
- [Voiceover] Rishi spend
3/4 of an hour for two days

00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:05.553
working on his science project.

00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:08.353
Kyle spent 1/4 of an hour for six days

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:10.510
working on his science project.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.385
Who spent more time on
his science project?

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:17.434
So we wanna know who spent more time,

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.178
and to do that we need to first know

00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:20.549
the amount of time Rishi and Kyle

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:22.948
each spent on their science projects.

00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:27.746
So let's start with Rishi, and
see what we know about Rishi.

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:31.306
Rishi spent 3/4 of an hour

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.556
for two days, so two times,

00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:37.580
he spent 3/4 of an hour.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.091
Or another way we could say this,

00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:41.739
is he spent 3/4 of an hour once,

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.213
plus on a second day he
spent another 3/4 of an hour.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:49.152
So 3/4 plus another 3/4

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:53.319
will give us a total of
6/4, or six quarter hours,

00:00:54.772 --> 00:00:58.457
that Rishi spent on his science project.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.814
Now let's look at Kyle.

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:04.923
Kyle spent a 1/4 of an
hour, so here's Kyle.

00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:07.185
Kyle spent 1/4 of an hour,

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:08.913
but he did this for six days,

00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:13.173
so six times, he spent 1/4 of an hour.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:17.595
Or we could say that Kyle
spent 1/4 of an hour one day,

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:20.602
plus 1/4 of an hour a second day,

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.409
1/4 of an hour a third day,

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.492
a fourth day,

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:30.232
a fifth day, and then a sixth
day he spent 1/4 of an hour.

00:01:30.232 --> 00:01:32.095
So six times,

00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:35.468
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:36.793
he spent a quarter,

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:39.437
or 1/4 of an hour working on his project.

00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:42.209
So if we have six 1/4s,

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.459
then we have a total of 6/4.

00:01:47.648 --> 00:01:52.254
So Kyle spent 6/4, or six quarter hours.

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:53.866
And now back to our question,

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.054
now that we know how
much each of them spent,

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:59.943
who spent more time working
on his science project?

00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:04.059
Rishi with 6/4 hours,
or Kyle with 6/4 hours?

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:05.291
And the answer here, of course,

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.198
is that these are equal,
these are the same.

00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:13.002
Rishi and Kyle spent
the same amount of time,

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:15.002
so we could say the same

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:20.175
amount of time working on each
other their science projects.
