00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.799
Exactly when King Henry VIII first began contemplating
having his marriage to Catherine of Aragon

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.930
annulled isn’t clear, though court gossip
from the time suggests that the thought possibly

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.060
entered the King’s mind as early as 1520.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.900
More concrete sources suggest that the king
began to seriously consider giving his first

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.050
wife the old heave ho in 1524, upon learning
from court physicians that Catherine could

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.559
no longer bear children.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.920
You see, as with so many monarchs, King Henry
was obsessed to an almost comical degree with

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.610
having a son, something he was apparently
unable to do with Catherine who stubbornly

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.580
gave birth to a girl in 1515 after suffering
several miscarriages.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.620
As Kings, and indeed many men of standing
in the era, were wont to do, beyond hitting

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.580
the hay with his wife, Henry on the side took
a mistress, one of Catherine’s ladies-in-waiting,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.540
Mary Boleyn, in the 1520s.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.890
While this affair is rumored to have resulted
in at least two children being sired by the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.960
King, Henry himself wouldn’t acknowledge
either of Mary’s children as his own.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.700
When two is deemed better, surely three is
best and in 1527, King Henry began trying

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.340
to woo Mary’s younger sister, Anne.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.180
Anne reportedly rebuffed Henry’s advances,
taking advice from another future queen called

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.430
Beyonce and refusing to give him what he wanted
unless he put a ring on it.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.660
And so it was that Henry tasked his finest
biblical scholars with finding a loophole

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.410
in the Bible that would let him divorce Catherine
so as to be able to have his way with Anne.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.060
Eventually such a loophole was found in the
form of Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 16, which

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.420
reads in part: “If a man shall take his
brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.600
uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they
shall be childless.”

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.030
If you’re wondering how this applied to
Henry, we should probably mention that Catherine

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.300
was his dead brother, Arthur’s, former wife
who ultimately became Henry’s wife in part

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.260
because of a dispute over returning the rather
large dowry her parents had sent when she

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.560
married Arthur…

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.870
Henry took this to mean that his marriage
was cursed, pointing to his offensive lack

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.489
of male heirs as proof.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.250
The pope remained unconvinced and refused
to grant Henry the divorce.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.209
Annoyed, Henry had the archbishop of Canterbury
declare his marriage to Catherine null and

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.400
void on May 23, 1533 anyway, though before
this in secret he married Anne Boleyn in January

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.600
of 1533.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.900
This, unsurprisingly, caused a schism between
the King and the Pope and set in motion events

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.540
that would eventually see Britain break free
from Catholic rule– all because King Henry

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.020
had the hots for his wife’s friend.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.620
In the end, this did not work out for poor
Anne, however.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.970
While she dutifully became pregnant seemingly
immediately upon their secret marriage (or

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.880
perhaps got pregnant before, which is why
the date of the supposed secret marriage took

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.200
place long before his divorce), she had the
audacity to give birth to a girl and then

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.240
had a series of miscarriages.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.920
In the meantime, Anne had made a lot of enemies
at court, and they started to plot against

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
her.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.430
She was arrested in 1536 and brought up on
charges of, ironically, adultery (nobody seemed

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.569
to mind the King doing the same, of course-
it’s good to be the King) and incest (one

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.630
can only imagine if there was even a smidgen
of truth to that, the King, who had previously

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.630
had her sister as a mistress, was no doubt
happily involved…).

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.349
Along with this, she was also accused of plotting
to murder the King for good measure.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.660
Which, to be fair, if that one’s true, we’re
not really sure we’d blame her for it.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.239
Her true crime, of course, was not giving
birth to a son.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.750
In the end, she was found guilty and sentenced
to beheading.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.349
Interestingly, shortly before the sentence
was carried out on May 19, 1536, her marriage

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.940
to King Henry was annulled as he claimed that
he had never been legally married to her.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.349
After all, how could you marry someone when
you were already married to someone else?

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.060
Anne’s head was removed during a private
execution with one quick and clean stroke

00:03:50.060 --> 00:04:03.629
of a sword and the King moved on to the next
woman 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:19.590
in line.
