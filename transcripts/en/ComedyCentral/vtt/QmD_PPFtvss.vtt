- I get introduced
to Lionel Richie

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.041
and I could tell that Lionel
Richie doesn't know me,

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.010
has never heard of me, but
because I'm the only other

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:13.579
black male at this event,

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.581
he acts like he knows me.

He is the legendary

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.127
- So when I first started doing
hip-hop music,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.262
even though I'm known for music
that has a message

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:06.966
and music that is not empty
and music that is not vacuous,

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.869
I grew up wanting to be
a rap star.

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.438
I didn't grow up wanting to be
a conscious rapper.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.107
I grew up, I wanted to be
LL Cool J.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.741
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.610
I wanted to be famous for a
being a sexy motherfucker.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.412
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.247
But by the time my career
took off,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.916
I was on a label called
Raucous Entertainment.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:26.752
And myself and Mos Def, we had
a group called Black Star.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:31.791
Right?
[cheers and applause]

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.326
[laughs]

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.428
See, I was cheap for applause,
because I don't got no jokes.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.729
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.097
I said "Mos Def"
so y'all could applaud

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.000
and Black Star and y'all
familiar with that shit.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.403
So by the time we blew up,
the whole Raucous movement,

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:45.972
the whole underground movement,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.808
it was looked at as the
vanguard for conscious rap.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.743
Like, they looked at us
as bringing back

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.812
the sounds of Boogie Down
Production and Public Enemy

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.814
and Rakim and Big Daddy Kane
and everything.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:58.818
So my homeboys, like, I was,
like, 18, 19 years old.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:00.419
My homeboys started going to
strip clubs

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:03.089
and having fun and doing
all the debauchery and stuff,

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.291
but they didn't even
invite me to the strip club,

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:07.126
'cause they heard my records,
and they thought,

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.628
"Kweli wouldn't want to come to
the strip club with us."

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.296
[laughter]

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.265
And one of my best friends
in the world, like, he worked--

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:16.035
he was a bartender at the strip
club when we was, like, 19.

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.771
I didn't find this out
till we were, like, 32.

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.173
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause they never told me.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.707
I was like, "Yo, y'all niggas
hanging out

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.376
at the strip club
y'all didn't tell me?"

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.011
And he was like, "Yeah, you
kick all that conscious rap.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.380
You don't want to hang out the
strip club."

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.149
So by the time I got on
in the music business

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:32.285
and I started making money in
the music business,

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.955
I really, really, really wanted
to go to a strip club.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:37.623
Not just a strip club,
but all the parties.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.025
All this partying down--like--

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.160
Anybody who knows me from
when I first started

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:43.663
my career, you heard my records
and it was conscious rap.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.464
And I was in the streets.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.867
Like, I don't just talk online;
I don't just talk on records.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.803
I go to the rallies. I go to
the protests and all that.

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:52.572
But I also go to
the nightclubs.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.007
You know what I'm saying?
I also turn up.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.178
So the first time I ever went
to a strip club,

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:00.646
in my life,

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.481
I went with Jermaine Dupri...

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:03.749
[laughter]

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.052
And Janet Jackson.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.421
[laughter]

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.890
Because I was working on a song
with Jermaine Dupri.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:12.525
He had a artist that had
sampled one of my records;

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.393
he wanted me to be on the remix
and everything.

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:15.661
Shout-out to Jermaine Dupri.

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:17.029
But here's my advice.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:19.198
If you've never been
to a strip club,

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:20.766
in your life,

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.335
do not go with Jermaine Dupri.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.703
[laughter]

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.905
Do not go with Janet Jackson.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.540
And make sure you don't go
in Atlanta.

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:29.041
[laughter]

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.577
Because if you go to a strip
club with Jermaine Dupri

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.379
and Janet Jackson in Atlanta,

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:37.049
nothing will top that
motherfuckin' experience.

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:39.218
So after my first strip club
experience,

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:42.288
I tried to top that strip club
experience.

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:44.457
And because I was now making
rap money,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.891
I was starting my career,

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:48.027
I tried to go to all the fly
strip clubs.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.732
And the fly strip clubs in this
country are in Atlanta

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.134
and in Miami and Portland.

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:57.870
Surprisingly, Portland, Oregon,
got some--

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.873
Portland, Oregon, is that shit.

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.241
You know what I'm saying?

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.610
But so I was working on my
album,

00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:06.712
and I booked a ticket--

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:08.447
this story has a lot of valleys
and peaks,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.882
so just stay with me.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:12.918
I booked a ticket to Miami.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.887
Because I'm like, "I'm going
to Miami to turn up."

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.722
So I get to Miami,

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:19.058
And I knew some girls who were
some party girls

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.826
and they do all the parties.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.795
And this girl called me; she
said, Come to this party.

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:24.130
Are you in Miami?

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.798
'Cause I told her I was going
to Miami.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.133
She said, Yeah, she said come
to this party.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.434
Yeah, I said, "Where's it at?"

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:30.236
She said, It's in the Bahamas.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.772
So I was like-- after some
convincing, I went.

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:36.909
And these girls, um,
let's just call 'em, um...

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:38.778
Britney and Amber.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.179
They were white girls.

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:43.182
I know those sound like white
girl names.

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.284
But I'm trying to throw the
scent off.

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:46.619
You know what I'm saying?

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:49.088
So Britney and Amber, they
invited me to this party,

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:50.356
but they said, "Listen, if you
come,

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.758
you just gotta follow
the rules."

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:53.959
So I was like, "What is this,
some, like,

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:56.028
'Eyes Wide Shut'
type shit here?"

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:57.930
[laughter]
Okay.

00:04:57.963 --> 00:05:00.700
So I fly to Bahamas
and I get off,

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:01.834
and they tell me
that I need to come

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:04.136
to the Peter [bleep] residence.

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.974
Now, Peter [bleep] is, like,
a textile

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:10.810
super rich billionaire.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.212
You understand what I'm saying?
This is a billionaire dude.

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:16.816
And so at first when I first
get to the island,

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.351
nobody wants to take me there.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:20.886
They say no one's allowed on
the [bleep] property.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.521
I finally convince a driver to
take me there.

00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:23.789
He drops me off in front,

00:05:23.822 --> 00:05:25.558
and I get picked up by one of

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.159
Peter [bleep]'s
representatives.

00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:28.994
He comes in a golf cart to
the front of the gates.

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:30.896
The gates was all opulent
and decadent

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:32.665
like, "Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous."

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:36.969
And I felt like I was in an Ian
Fleming/James Bond situation.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:38.504
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:41.073
And the guy picks me up--
and the guy who picks me up

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:42.708
is asking me about hip-hop,

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.310
and I'm like, "Yeah, I rap.

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.045
He's like, "Yeah, I only listen
to Frank Sinatra."

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.546
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:49.515
And so immediately I'm starting
to feel like,

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:53.085
maybe I'm not
in the right place, you know?

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:55.254
And there's, like, spider
monkeys.

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:58.190
I'm saying spider monkeys
because that sounds official.

00:05:58.223 --> 00:06:01.260
I don't know what kind of
monkeys they was.

00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:03.362
But there was monkeys, you know
what I'm saying?

00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:06.365
There was peacocks and all
types of wildlife.

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:08.501
It was like a two-day,
three-day long thing.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:10.436
I'm staying in this treehouse,

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:13.072
and it's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:14.740
I had never seen nothing
like this.

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:18.711
And I ordered some food, and
the guy that brings my food

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.513
is a Norwegian guy
who says to me,

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:23.883
You know what, Kweli, I saw you
perform with Black Star

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.051
in Norway back in the day.

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:29.422
And the show that he mentioned
was the first time

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.523
I had ever been to Norway.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.757
It was me, Hi-Tek, Mos Def,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.759
in some bar in Norway.

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:35.127
It was a small bar--

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.896
it was smaller than this bar
we in now.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.398
And there was, like, four
people in there.

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.734
I remember, it was like,
four people in this bar,

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:44.570
and this kid in the Bahamas
is like, I saw you perform

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:45.971
at that bar in Norway.

00:06:46.004 --> 00:06:47.573
And I'm like, wow, okay.

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:49.074
What are you doing here?

00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:51.377
He's "I been working here for
Peter [bleep].

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.912
And, you know, I was like,
"Okay, wow.

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.547
It made me feel good,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.415
because this is, again, at
the beginning of my career.

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:58.884
So then the girls come and I'm
hanging out with the girls.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.085
And Britney and Amber and all
they friends

00:07:00.118 --> 00:07:01.454
and a bunch of other girls.

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.756
They finally explain to me
what's happening,

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.224
and they say, We work for
Peter [bleep],

00:07:05.257 --> 00:07:07.326
and because we know
all the party people,

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.496
our job is to invite people
here for parties that he has.

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.098
And this is his birthday party
and it's gonna be a huge party,

00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:14.567
and you're gonna be here for
the next few days;

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.969
it's gonna be fun.
And I say, Okay, great.

00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:18.504
They say, One rule,

00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:22.508
you cannot speak to
Peter [bleep], all right?

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.578
'Cause they got me fucked up.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.279
They think I'm one of them,
you know what I'm saying?

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:28.781
When in my mind, I'm like, "I'm
Talib Kweli,"

00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:30.449
You know what I'm saying?

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:32.985
I'ma speak to whoever the fuck
I feel like speaking to

00:07:33.018 --> 00:07:34.453
when I feel like speaking.

00:07:34.486 --> 00:07:36.789
So me and the girls
have a big argument,

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.958
because they feel like I'm
about to

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.460
mess up they whole situation.

00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:45.264
Because I'm just being arrogant
about who I am.

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:48.467
And so we're about to have
a dinner,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.272
and we find out that he's gonna
have a special guest performer

00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:55.641
for his birthday party and
the special guest performer

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:58.811
is Lionel Richie.
All right?

00:07:58.844 --> 00:08:01.514
Right? "Dancing on the Ceiling"
Lionel Richie, like...

00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:04.717
So...

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.354
We get to the dinner, and we're
all mingling about,

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.489
and I had a seat down at
the table with the girls.

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:12.858
The table was long. I'm all the
way down here with the girls

00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.527
I came with,
and then Peter [bleep],

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.829
and his guests are all the way
at the front of the table.

00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:18.797
And I'm just, I'm playing my
role, I'm playing the position.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.368
But Lionel Richie actually
shows up, all right?

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:27.506
He shows up, and I get
introduced to Lionel Richie

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:30.509
and I could tell that Lionel
Richie doesn't know me,

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:33.212
has never heard of me, but
because I'm the only other

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:36.015
black male at this event,

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:38.584
he acts like he knows me.

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:41.220
He gives me the black male
brother salute.

00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:42.755
You know what I'm saying?

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.990
I get the whole love like I
know Lionel Richie.

00:08:45.023 --> 00:08:46.592
So now I'm hanging out with
Lionel Richie,

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:49.562
and we know similar people in
the music business.

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:50.729
I start talking to him.

00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.665
And he says, Come sit with me.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.199
So now I'm sitting at the head
of the table

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:55.501
with Lionel Richie,
and I'm looking

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:56.835
at them girls like,
"See, I told you.

00:08:56.868 --> 00:08:59.171
I'ma speak when I-- I'm me.

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:00.439
I'm not just here with y'all.

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:03.442
I'm here on my own
reconnaissance.

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:06.545
I might be your guest, but I'm
also me.

00:09:06.578 --> 00:09:08.447
You know what I'm saying?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:15.020
So we have this beautiful,
opulent, wonderful dinner.

00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:17.856
And, you know, I'm always the
hookup.

00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:19.291
I'm always the plug.

00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:21.393
I don't know if y'all know, but
I smoke pot.

00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:24.931
And I won't say that I smoked
weed with Lionel Richie.

00:09:29.234 --> 00:09:33.472
But after the dinner, we were
all hanging out.

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:35.374
And you know, I'm hanging out
with Lionel Richie.

00:09:35.407 --> 00:09:38.077
I put my pops on the phone
with Lionel Richie

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.079
because I grew up listening to
the Commodores.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.413
You understand what I'm saying?

00:09:41.446 --> 00:09:44.249
Like, Lionel Richie is,
for my family,

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:46.385
was a huge, huge part
of my upbringing.

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:48.287
So Lionel Richie's telling me
Commodores stories;

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.822
he's telling me Michael Jackson
stories.

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.657
I put my father on the phone
with Lionel Richie.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.493
And I'm feeling good,
and because Lionel Richie,

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:57.396
meeting him, reminded me
of my childhood,

00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:58.998
I went back to my room
in the treehouse

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:00.633
and I'm with all these girls,

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.168
and it's like, me--
and remember, it was just like,

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:04.403
the dude whose party it was,

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:06.005
Lionel Richie, his wife,
and me.

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.673
I'm the only dude there.

00:10:07.706 --> 00:10:09.241
And it's me and all these
girls, and I'm like,

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:12.444
okay, it is time
for rapper adult fun.

00:10:12.477 --> 00:10:13.979
God damn it.

00:10:14.012 --> 00:10:15.814
I'ma have a great time tonight.

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:18.117
But we get into this
conversation about family

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.119
and I'm explaining to them
how much it means

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.754
for me to meet Lionel Richie,

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24.089
and I talk about my father
and how I called my father

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:26.458
and I was so proud that I could
put my father on the phone

00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:28.293
with one of his heroes,
Lionel Richie,

00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:30.295
and what my kids mean to me.

00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:31.664
And one of the girls--

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:34.800
I don't remember if it was
Britney or Amber.

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:38.103
One of the girls, all of
a sudden at that moment,

00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:39.772
remembered that she had a kid.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:43.009
[laughter]

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:47.279
And she's like, You know what?

00:10:47.312 --> 00:10:50.315
I haven't seen my kid in so
long.

00:10:50.348 --> 00:10:52.785
And I'm out here partying

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:55.287
and I'm out here--my kid.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.489
And she started crying
and getting really upset

00:10:57.522 --> 00:10:59.992
about the fact that she
personally didn't feel like

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:02.494
she was doing enough
for her child.

00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:05.531
And now, like, the whole
romantic sexual vibe

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.633
was just...

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:10.169
No more adult fun,
all right?

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:12.471
So we end up getting in this
whole conversation

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:15.140
about the importance of family,

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:18.377
and then I went to sleep,
all right?

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:21.680
So I wake up the next morning,

00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:23.148
and I'm still supposed to be
there another day,

00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:24.717
but when I wake up the next
morning,

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.852
I wake up to a commotion
and I hear yelling and arguing,

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:29.855
and I go downstairs and the kid
from Norway, the Norwegian kid,

00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:32.391
was arguing with his boss.

00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:34.993
And the argument was about
the fact he had told him

00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:36.261
that he wanted that day off

00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:38.197
because it was
his wife's birthday.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.866
But they told him that he had
to work that day.

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:42.868
And he's like, You know what,
you treat me like shit,

00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:45.204
you don't take care of me, you
don't care about my family,

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:48.240
you know what, fuck y'all.
I'm out.

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:51.243
And the kid quits
right in front of me.

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.713
And in that moment, I think
about everything I saw

00:11:54.746 --> 00:11:58.751
the night before and all
the decadence and all the--

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:01.186
everything that I thought that
I wanted to be part of,

00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:04.456
but when I saw that
the only person there

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.959
that knew who I was
as an artist,

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:09.294
the only person there
who was invested in me

00:12:09.327 --> 00:12:11.430
as a person and
as an artist

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:13.732
he couldn't even stand to be
there no more.

00:12:13.765 --> 00:12:15.768
He was leaving,
and when he was leaving,

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:17.736
something snapped in my
and I'm like, You know what,

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:22.141
as fun as this looks,
this is clearly not my scene.

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:24.910
And you know what, maybe
I need to leave too.

00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:27.146
And I got in the car with that
Norwegian kid,

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:30.215
and I went to
the airport and I left.

00:12:30.248 --> 00:12:34.052
Now, I might have missed out
on a lot of fun.

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:35.420
You know what I'm saying?

00:12:35.453 --> 00:12:40.058
But the lesson that I took
from that is,

00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:42.661
your day-ones is your A-ones,

00:12:42.694 --> 00:12:45.130
and you should rock with
the people who rock with you.

00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:46.832
And if you find yourself
in a situation

00:12:46.865 --> 00:12:48.801
where you're rocking with
people who don't really

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:52.137
rock with you, find that one
person that rock with you

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.072
and maybe leave with them.

00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:55.073
Peace, y'all.

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:58.911 line:0%
