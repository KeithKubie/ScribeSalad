00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.540
Stronger than steel... able to stop a speeding
bullet...

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.649
It’s a bird, it’s a plane!

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:07.970
Its … Spiderman?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.820
Hello Everybody, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.810
Those of us that are not entomologists probably
don’t have any love lost for spiders unless

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.320
their superpowers are helping us fight or
escape from bad guys.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
Now, thanks to actual (not comicbook) science,
spider silk could help us do just that.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.770
The silken material spiders use to build their
creepy webs is a complex form of protein fiber

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.050
that does more than just catch flies.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.470
Using specialized glands spiders produce their
silk from a protein rich liquid that is dried

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.030
into solid filaments by an external portion
of these glands called spinnerets.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.170
This process is dynamic and spiders can produce
different “types” of silk depending on

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.489
whether they are weaving a web, creating an
egg sac, or planning a ballooning trip to

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.790
another location.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.470
Whatever the purpose, the supermaterial spiders
produce is strong, flexible, and lightweight.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.680
It can also stretch to many times its original
length, contracts when it is exposed to water,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.470
has a greater tensile strength than steel,
and produces a mesh strong enough to stop

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.470
a bullet.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.810
All this makes spider silk an attractive material
for use in things meant to reduce the consequences

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
of physical impact like body armor, vehicle
airbags, and football helmets.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.770
But spider silk has some super biological
applications too.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.770
Its acidic nature gives it antimicrobial properties
and it’s also nonantigenic, meaning it does

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.270
not trigger an immune response in the human
body.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.320
This makes it an ideal candidate for use in
medical engineering.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.409
In fact, prototypes of spider silk enhanced
synthetic tendons, cartilage and ligaments,

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.840
as well as surgical sutures and sealants already
exist!

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.400
So why can’t we go out and buy a bolt of
the stuff?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.909
Well, until recently it was really hard to
make a lot of it.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.509
Research into commercial production of spider
silk has been ongoing for a few decades, but

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.360
while the silk worms that produce fibers for
commercial silk can be easily raised for harvest,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.430
spiders are not so cooperative.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.939
Imagine trying to raise thousands of territorial
and predatory arachnids.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.430
Even if you could keep them from fighting
and eating each other you’d still have to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.169
anesthetize them and hand milk them for their
silk …. no thank you.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.719
Scientists have tried all kinds of crazy things
in an effort to produce spider silk on a commercial

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.340
scale, but my favorite one involves goats.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.900
I mean, obviously...

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.129
Professor Randy Lewis at the University of
Utah, has bred genetically modified goats

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.299
to contain genes from orb-web weaving spiders.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.590
These goats produce spider silk proteins in
their milk that can be harvested like traditional

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.590
whey.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.879
Other organisms that have been modified in
the hopes of producing enough protein for

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.769
commercial viability are silkworms, bacteria,
and yeast.

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.810
Now, each of these approaches has its problems,
but they are not insurmountable, so we may

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.639
see spider silk enhanced products in the market
sooner than we think.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.930
In keeping with the theme of spider appreciation,
check out this video from Julia, about some

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.920
of the strangest spiders in existence
