00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To finish this discussion on existence and uniqueness of solutions of differential equations,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
here is a final item from the mathematical cabinet of curiosities another unless, if you will,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the derivative of x with respect to time should be the cube root of x, and if we're going to try out

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
three different initial conditions--0, 0.01, and a really, really tiny number 10^-300.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Implement the forward Euler's method for this differential equation

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and then have a look at what happens with these three different initial values.
