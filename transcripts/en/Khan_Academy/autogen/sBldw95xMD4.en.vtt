00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 Start 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.940
 The points we have learned so far are 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.940
 Scalar function 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.020
 That is, for a given xy value 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.130
 Calculate the value of this function 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.640
 Got a scalar 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.710
 Just a number 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620
 Instead of vector 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.940
 Today my goal is to make everyone 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.860
 Have some understanding of vector functions 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.220
 Then we can understand what is called a linear function 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.910
 Let me write down several vector functions first. 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.052
 In fact, let's start with the curve 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.440
 Let's put this function aside 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.820
 Don't worry about it for the time being 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.525
 Suppose now that there is a curve c 

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:50.720
 Can be parameterized 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.590
 Specify x=x(t), y=y(t) 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.440
 The range of t is [a,b] 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.990
 If I draw it down 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.320
 Probably this way 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.270
 It’s very abstract now. 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.740
 This is not a very specific example 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.910
 This is the x-axis 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.360
 This is the y axis 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.150
 This is the curve. Let this be when t is equal to a 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 The curve can look like this 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.640
 I don't know what this means. 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920
 Let us say that it is here. 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.510
 This is the value when t is equal to b. 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.430
 The abscissa value of this point is x(b) 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.560
 This will be x-coordination 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.270
 Calculate the function value of point b 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.610
 When t is equal to a 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.370
 In the coordinate system 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.140
 The abscissa is x(a) 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.840
 The ordinate is y(a) 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.050
 We have studied before 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 This is the general form of describing a parametric curve 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.650
 a function that represents a curve with two parametric equations 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.350
 Now all I have to do is 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.340
 Describe this curve with a vector function 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.970
 Describe with a vector function, if you don't remember, 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 Let's review it first. 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.180
 Suppose there is a vector function r 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.150
 I marked the vector arrow on r 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.670
 In many textbooks, vectors are represented in bold. 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.940
 The scalar will not be bolded 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.120
 But it is not easy to draw here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.550
 So I use arrows to distinguish 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.220
 Suppose r is a function of t 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.045
 Let r be the position vector 

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:46.800
 blank 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.930
 I especially pointed this out because it is usually said 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.170
 When people say vector, this one and this one 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.320
 Considered equal 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.990
 As long as they have the same direction and size, 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.550
 The start and end of the vector, ie the position of the vector, do not need to be considered 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.490
 Just the same direction 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.710
 Equal size 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.520
 However, if this is a position vector, 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.155
 Then the beginning of all vectors must be the origin. 

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:12.440
 If it is pointed out that this is a position vector, 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.000
 Means that the position of the vector is uniquely determined 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.710
 In this question, this is a two-dimensional space. 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.550
 But the same applies in 3D space. 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.260
 It can even be 4 degrees, 5 degrees, any dimension space 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.010
 So when it is pointed out that it is a position vector, 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.520
 Actually said 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.580
 A specific point in space. 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.560
 If the curve is 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.050
 Position vector function 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.110
 r is the position vector function for t 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.750
 Let me change back to pink 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.020
 This is still green. 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.750
 Is equal to x(t) multiplied by the unit vector in the x direction 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.400
 Unit vector has this little caret at the top - one small hat 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.750
 Just like the little arrow that represents the vector 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.600
 This means it is a unit vector 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.870
 Plus y(t) multiplied by j 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.970
 If this curve is three-dimensional 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.735
 I also add z(t) multiplied by k 

00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:07.270
 But we are now counting two dimensions 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.450
 For this question 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.690
 For any t value, of course, we still have 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.610
 t is greater than or equal to the limit of a less than or equal to b 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.810
 This is exactly the same 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.105
 Let me draw another one 

00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:24.070
 Coordinate System 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.400
 Origin, coordinate axis 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.410
 This is the y-axis, the x-axis 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.765
 This is our first step when you calculate the r value of point a. 

00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:36.180
 Let me write it down 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.140
 The r value of point a, maybe I should write here 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.860
 Our position vector is at t 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.390
 The value of r(a) is equal to x(a) multiplied by 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.040
 Unit vector along the x direction (horizontal direction) 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.460
 Add y(a) multiplied by the unit vector in the vertical direction 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.865
 Direction, or direction of y 

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.500
 What does it look like? 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.830
 x(a) is represented on the number axis 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.220
 Then x(a) is multiplied by the unit vector 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.860
 The unit vector is probably so long 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.180
 Length is 1, 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.070
 In this direction 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.520
 Treat y(a) in the same way 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.240
 In this direction 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.830
 But the base of this vector, this, 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.910
 If you add the size of these two vectors 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.460
 Will get r(a) 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.070
 like this 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.270
 like this 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.770
 This is a position vector 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.330
 This explains why we start from the origin, 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.840
 Place it in the standard position 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.450
 This is r(a) 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.980
 So now how does it change if it grows a bit? 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.590
 That is, r (a) plus. 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.680
 Anything, plus Δ, 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.305
 Or r(a)+h 

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:56.355
 I use another color to represent 

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:59.850
 r(a)+h 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.070
 Plus a small h 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.060
 In fact, it is (x(a)+h) multiplied by 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.710
 Unit vector i 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.820
 Plus y multiplied by (a+h) multiplied by the unit vector 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.230
 What is the result? 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.730
 Let's draw a little more along the curve 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.370
 Going down some 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.100
 Equivalent to getting the abscissa x+h 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.980
 The ordinate is y+h 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.590
 Probably this is 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.640
 This will be a new vector 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.300
 Position vector 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.070
 Not a unit vector 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.940
 Length is not equal to 1 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.470
 like this 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.590
 Use the same color as this 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.970
 like this 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.930
 This is r(a)+h 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.270
 If you continue to increase the value of t 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.950
 Until you get b. these two position vectors 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.860
 We continue to mark the points on the curve 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.160
 I paint this curve in another color. 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.230
 This curve is like this 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.150
 It should be the same as the one I painted before. 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.080
 Let's say r(b), 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.180
 like this 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.680
 Like this line 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.120
 I try to draw it straight 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.310
 This is 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.740
 I hope you realize this, these position vectors, 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.910
 In fact, it is the point in the original curve. 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.880
 Connect the origin to parameterize it 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.070
 As we did before 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.880
 I want to review this simple 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.730
 Because we have to learn next 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.860
 Take the derivative of the vector function 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.210
 I will continue to talk about it in the next section. 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.266
 End
