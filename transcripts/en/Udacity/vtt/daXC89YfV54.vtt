00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, normally I would solve this algebraically and I think that's the best way to do it

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I encourage you to do it in the forums.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But since we already calculated Vmax numerically using the numbers

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I had made up last time, k = 500, m = 1, and Xmax = 0.2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's go ahead and get ourselves an answer. So how do we do this?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, I know that the system has a total amount of energy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When it is at the extreme points, the energy is all potential.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In the equilibrium, it's all kinetic and this middle point here is both kinetic and potential.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I can phrase this mathematically as the total energy is going to be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the kinetic plus the potential.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well the total energy is just whatever energy I had when I pulled it all the way back to Xmax.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The kinetic energy? Well, I'm not sure what that is. But I know that this is the equation that describes it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And actually, I know all of these numbers except for v.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
To solve these for v is just a matter of doing a little bit of massaging, which I will leave to you.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
When I carry out all these algebra and arithmetic, I find that when I'm at this point

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
when the mass is moving through this position here, the velocity is 0.87.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's maximum velocity. 87% and it's moving pretty fast.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
My plot will go up to here, up here, and probably somewhere around here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now, I could do very similar algebra to find that there's also a negative solution

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and this solution corresponds to the exact same thing but when the mass is moving this way.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I could also find that there are solutions over here and if I solve for the position

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
when the velocity was 1/2 of its maximum I would get 0.87 Xmax.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I could put points here and here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Can you see what shape is starting to emerge on the points we're plotting?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's a circle or at least it's supposed to be. Sorry some of my points are a little bit off.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is something in Physics that we call a phase diagram.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And it's a very powerful tool once you understand how to use it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The way to interpret this diagram is as follows.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We start with a mass put all the way back to Xmax. We let it go.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Well in this case, it starts with negative velocity. It moves that way.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That would correspond to going into the negative realms of velocity down here.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Eventually, it maxes out in speed as it passes through equilibrium

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but keeps moving to the left as it can be seen by the negative velocity.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Eventually, it reaches this extreme over here and finally it turns around.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Positive velocity moving to the right passes through the equilibrium at maximum speed

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and keeps moving through the right and returns to where it started.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The Wikipedia page in simple harmonic motion has a really great illustration.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now, a couple of things that I notice that are different about this illustration is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
position is vertical, velocity is horizontal, the spring itself is moving up and down

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but you get the same idea.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Here, the vertical position is tracking the object's position

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and as the object moves downwards we see that the ball is on the left side of this line

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
corresponding to a negative velocity as it moves upwards.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This ball on the right side is corresponding to a positive velocity.

00:02:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Okay, so why did I spend all this time to show you this?
