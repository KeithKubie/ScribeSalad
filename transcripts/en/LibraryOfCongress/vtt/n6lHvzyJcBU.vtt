00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Jack Gantos: Now I really
enjoyed researching this,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.140
researching this author
and these books.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.540
I just thought it was
so interesting,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.770
as someone who I was
never much of a writer

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.600
but I probably should
have tried harder.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.190
So now all of you kids who dream
of seeing your name on a book,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.800
need to pay attention
for this author.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.780
So this Newbery Award-winning
author, Jack Gantos,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.310
inspires young writers to
utilize their writing radar,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.810
which is a tool described in detail
of this book of the same name,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.080
Writer Radar, using your journal
to snoop out and craft great ideas.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.470
Jack is from Mount Pleasant,
Pennsylvania and has written books

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.150
for readers of all ages and has
continued to write children's books

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.360
and has begun to teach courses
in children's book writing

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.810
and children's literature.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.530 position:56%
See? Having so many talents can take
you wonderful places not unlike this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.210
even today.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.420
I'd say he is a jack-of-all-trades,
but that's a terrible joke.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.900
But don't forget to stop by the
book signing area between 4:30

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.560
and 5:30 today to meet Jack and
have him sign a book for you.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.510
And without further ado we
welcome to the stage Jack Gantos.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:35.780
[ Applause ]

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.130
&gt;&gt; Okay. Was that the introduction?

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.930
That must have been
the introduction.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.710
[ Applause ]

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.750
&gt;&gt; Okay. This is one of those
talks that's going to be

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.810
like launched out of a shotgun.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.910
This is 25 minutes and we've
got a lot to cover when it comes

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.490
to children's literature; not
only the books themselves,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.280
but the writing of the books.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.310
So we've got literature and then
really what the purpose is today,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.210
is to talk about how you can
write your own good books.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.540
So you're going to walk out of here
with some tips, some good stuff

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.830
and I'd better get to it,
otherwise you're going to walk

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.840
out with half a mind of good stuff
and I want you to have a full mind.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.860
Okay. Nobody can ever talk about
writing good books without talking

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.120
about reading good books, because
all writing starts with reading.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.320
That is the first principle
of writing a good book,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.360
being a good reader, right?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.390
So for me, when I was
a kid-- I was a kid.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.690
Let's see.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.990
Move that forward.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.290
Does it go that way?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.340
The PowerPoint.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.970
Hold on. Ah there we are.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.400
Okay. There's the book.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.600
Now boom. That's me.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.900
First grade.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960
I went down to Mrs.
Niederheiser's class.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.600
We didn't have kindergarten.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.670
I was in the back yard
digging a hole.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.780
Somebody came by slapped
me on the head and said,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.080
hey, you should go to school.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.380
I was like, okay.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.320
So I walked down the hill
in western Pennsylvania,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.980
probably carried a lump of
coal in my pocket and went down

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.410
and Mrs. Niederheiser
taught me how to read.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.630
We played a lot of London
Bridges, that's what I recall.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.710
But I did like books and I started
reading a lot of picture books.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.310
And you all have read
a lot of picture books.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.720 position:56%
You remember Brown Bear, Brown Bear.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.020
What do you see?

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.320
I see a red bug looking at me.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.620 position:56%
You remember the Hungry Caterpillar.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.920
You remember George
and Martha Butcher.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.110
You remember Loud Crocodile.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.900
You remember all those
fabulous books.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.790
Well they get into you.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.560
So books got into me
and later on, boom.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.090
What was I writing?

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.390
Picture books.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.800
Why? Because I read
them and I loved them.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.870
So the connection between what you
read and what you write is a lock.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.170
Remember, choosing
the books you love

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.640
to read is also choosing the
future of what you want to write.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.840
And then I got older.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.680
Amazing I grew.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.920
And I started writing these books.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.920
Family books of short stories,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.690
because I became a
diary writer as a kid.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.610
And I used to go to the dining
room table with my diary,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.960
keep it on my lap and when my
dad would tell a funny story,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.260
I'd write it down.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.860
When my sister would tell a
tragic story of her well--

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.980
10th grade life, I
would write it down.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.590
And so I always liked
family stories.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.270
And therefore-- oops we went back.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.170
Now we're going forward one more.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.470
There we are.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.620
Joey Pigza.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.710
Whoa, where'd that go?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.420
Hold on. There's Joey.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.750
So the Joey Pigza stories.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.140
So when I was a kid, I was
a bit of an active kid.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.770
I was like one of those
[inaudible]--

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.750
I wasn't off the charts
active, but I was pretty active.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.360
And so later on, naturally
I wrote about who I was.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.490
And then I got a little bit older.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.020
That's my bicycle.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.730
I used to ride around my
neighborhood with my diary

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.600 position:56%
in that basket and spy on everybody.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.600
I'll get to that.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.080
And then I wrote about my hometown,
the town where somebody hit me

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.930
on the head and said go to school.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.910
That's it Norvelt, Pennsylvania.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.490
And then because I loved
that town I wrote about it.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.340
And then I got older.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.720
Oh no. And I started
reading middle school books.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.600
Therefore I started writing them.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.210
And this book; this is about how my
relatives taxidermed their mother.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.510
But you know--

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.300
[ Applause ]

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.780
You think a deer head on
the wall, only family.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.480
And then I got older.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.760
I became like a senior
in high school.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.760
And then I started
writing books where I got

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.070
into a little bit of trouble.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.510
And then I predicted my
own trouble right there.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.810
Oh my goodness.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.720
But let's go back here.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.170
Can you imagine that?

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:03.560
So all these stages of my life, and
all the books I read at each stage,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.190
caused me to write about
every stage of my life.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.960
Again, the reading
leads to the writing.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.670
Choose your books wisely.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.790
Okay. So Writing Radar.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.040
So this is a book that
I wrote that's going

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.680
to give you some really good tips.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.640
It's centers in on journal writing,
because that's where it all starts.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.970
So using your journal.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.420
Uh, that's my journal.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.180
Now, you know all those journals
you have lying around the house?

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.950
You know how like every Christmas
or birthday somebody comes up

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.120
and goes, here's a journal."

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.090
And you write one word in it
and it goes on the shelf next

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.460
to a whole shelf of journals
that you have one word in it.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.320
So, I would sometimes-- my
mother would say to me, hey.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.860
Oh, this is how it would work.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.230
I'd go to my mom, "I'm so bored,"
and she'd whip around and say,

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.930
"Why don't you get your
journal and write something."

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.240
And I'm like uh.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.550
Wrong thing to say to mom.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.620
So I would open the journal and
you know those blank white sheets

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.150 position:56%
of paper in a journal, I would stare
at them, they would stare at me.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.450
I would stare at them.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.750
They would stare at me.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.050
I don't know if this has
ever happened to you,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.780
but my mind would go blank and
I'd feel like a complete loser.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.350 position:56%
So that's how I felt with a journal.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.250
And then I read this book.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.570
Have you read Harriet the Spy yet?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.150
This is one of the
world's great books.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.290
[ Applause ]

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.900
You only need two books
to read; Harriet the Spy

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.220 position:56%
and Moby Dick and you'll be all set.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.870
Now well George and Martha too.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.170
I love those.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.690
And don't forget Ms.
Nelson is missing.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.520
That's another good one.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.820
Oh I'm glad you do.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.980
That's made you a better person.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.370
Now Harriet the Spy.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.760
So I was a library helper
when I was at school.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.690
And I would go into the library

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.480
and this is how I would always
have a great day at school.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.200
I'd walk into the library
and I'd say

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.280
to the librarian I'd
go, you know what?

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.380
I'm a great reader and the
librarian would go, I love you.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.680
You come with me.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.720 position:56%
I will protect you from all of the
sociopathic children at this school.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.850
And so I used to put the
books back on the shelf,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.390
and help move things around.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.360
I was always just a really
good friend to the librarian.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:46.740
In the meantime, I had
this one little feeling

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.000
that I wasn't doing what I
needed to do with my journal.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.810
Because I kept thinking
I should be writing.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.300
I love books, I want to
see my name on a book,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.320
but I wasn't doing anything
until I read Harriet.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.900
And you know what Harriet did?

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.320
She walked around her
neighborhood spying

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.170
on everybody and writing it down.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.560
I thought, I'll do the same
thing if it worked for Harriet.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.890
So I went to the G section.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.470
My name is Gantos.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.400
I went to the G section of the
library and I stuck my hand

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.150
into a slot where exactly
where a book--

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.890
if I had written a book where it
would go and I stuck my hand there

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:37.110
and I promised myself-- I promised
myself I would write a book

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.910
and it would go right
between Galdone and George.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.890
Boom, right there.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.820
And then that so freaked me
out I ran out of the library.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.710
But I didn't forget.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.570
So here's what I did.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.420
I took my journal;
this is my journal.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.560
My fifth grade journal.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.220
And I put it-- you know that
bike with the bicycle basket?

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.300
I put it in that basket and I rode

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.300
around my neighborhood
spying on everybody.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.140
So this is my first spy map.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.370
This map got me started.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.310 position:56%
So this is Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.490
See on that bottom?

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.900
See that picture with the dog?

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.210
That's my house; the Gantos family.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.940
My mother called us the
high-supervision family

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.960
in the neighborhood.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.170
If you played at my house you
had rules and regulations.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.650
Nobody came to my house.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.730
If you came to my house my
mother'd make you clean.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.260
So we all played over at
the Pagoda family house.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.030
My mother called them the
low-supervision family

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.910
in the neighborhood and she
forbid me to play there,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.880
but I was there every day.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.400 position:56%
Because when you played with the
Pagodas, well you came back bruised.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.390
It was good play.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.890
I'll get to them.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.970
They were a little
nutty, a little dangerous,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.130
but they were great to write about.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.780
And then back to my house.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.410
See that dog in the backyard.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.920
That's my dog Bobo.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.450
He was asleep in the
backyard an alligator came

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.600
out of the canal and
took that dog away.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.850
Was such a sad moment.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.230
And there I was standing

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.040
in the backyard yelling
at Bobo, come on Bobo.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.340
You can get away.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.600
Bobo buddy did not get away and
I wrote about that and I wrote

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.560
and I cried in that book.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.340
I loved that dog.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.870
And I wrote about the love of
an animal that you always have

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.260
and how it's such a pure love.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.360
And see that little
circle in the square?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.120
That's called Jack's stain.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.710
That's where I ate three
plates of spaghetti,

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.010
walked into the living room,

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.630
said to my mother I think
I'm going to be sick.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.170
She said get to the bathroom.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.650 position:56%
I didn't. I just looked at my mother

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.360
and went bleh, threw
up right at her.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.660
I missed her.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.070
I hit the wall and we never could
get the stain off of the wall.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.130
[ Laughter ]

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:05.320
And Florida's very humid and
on a humid stain, the smell,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.640
that little vomity
smell would just be

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.450
like a shadow moving
around the house.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.410
You'd wake up in the
morning sniff the air.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.710
You'd go [sniffing].

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.260
Oh the stain's visiting
me today you know.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.510
[ Laughter ]

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.820
Next door Mr. Vilucci built a boat,
launched it, sank in 15 minutes.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.380
Not good at that job.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.920
That's that dog over
there that bit me,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.980
[inaudible] airplane
crash in our neighborhood.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.760
Oh the Frosts and Hunts.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.540
Grumpy old people in
the neighborhood.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.750
Florida you have millions of them.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.050
And you know what they were?

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.350
Retired school teachers.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.080
[ laughter ]

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.480
That come down from Minnesota.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.550
Talks for 50 years,
sick and tired of kids.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.650
And you as a kid, of course
you knew that instantly

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.080
because you could nose it out.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.680
And then you'd go dancing
across your yard.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.740
And they would then put up
that sign that says no standing

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.300 position:56%
on the yard, no walking on the yard.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.200
Then you'd dance across it and
then you'd go send out the dog

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.480
because they always had like a
Chihuahua that would come out.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.010
Like untie your shoe.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.650
You'd be like oh I'm so scared.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.590
And then the M&amp;Ms I love them.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.550
The Metric family.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.530
Now they were something to
write about they had seven kids.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.290
And they gave each one
of them an M first name.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.380
Michael Metric, Megan Metric,
Marshall Metric, Michelle Metric

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.250
and then we'd just caught on.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.890
We started calling them the
M&amp;Ms; plain and peanut 2,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.190
melt in your mouth,
not in your hand.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.410
And then we lined them up
one day and went green M&amp;Ms,

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.740
yellow M&amp;M, brown M&amp;M, orange M&amp;M.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.040
then we just knocked on the door.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.510
Hello Mrs. M&amp;M, can
orange come out and play?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.330
[ Laughter ]

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.150
And then that's me, my
brother Pete, my sister Betsy.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:54.990
This was the first bit of
evidence that I had in my journal

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.800
that I actually had
good story material.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.090
So let's just pause for a moment.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.760
Remember Harriet the spy?

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.020
Going around spying on things.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.870
Draw on the map, getting
it down and then

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.740
when you see it, you
believe it, right?

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.210
When you look at a blank sheet
of paper, it gives you nothing.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.360
You look at a map,
it gives you ideas.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.520
So then I went to my
house and I drew my house.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.050 position:56%
So this is where I want you to start

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.350
because you don't know
your neighbors

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.830
and they might just be psychotic.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.080
So I want you to just start
with your house and even

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.130
if they're sociopathic,
they love you.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:38.720
So nonetheless, that's
the dining room table.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.320 position:56%
That's where I threw up on the wall.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.090
That's Zippy the Roach.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.610
My sister was taking a nap
one day we'd had an argument

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.490 position:56%
and she always slept with her mouth
wide open because she has allergies.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.290 position:56%
And I had a little roach collection.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.830
You know those cockroaches in
Florida, those really big ones.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.530
I had this huge Lego
collection and I used

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.970
to make this giant walled city,
medieval city called Roachville.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.540
And then I'd go outside
and I'd capture all

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.710
of these Florida roaches,
take my sister's nail polish

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.580
and write names on
the backs of them.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.630
And then you'd take a
roach with a name on it,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.640
put it on a Hotwheels car,
scotch tape it on there

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.930
and then you could drive them
all to Roachville, right.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.440
You'd have roaches at a dinner
party, roaches running around,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.900
roaches go this way, that way.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.040
At any rate when I
saw her open mouth

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.710
after our argument I gave my jar
of roaches a shake and I pulled one

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.550
out that said Zippy on it.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.350
I said Zippy not good for you.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.650
What's he know, he's a roach.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.370
[ Laughter ]

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:42.010
I snuck over, leaned,
aimed and let him go.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.310
[ Laughter ]

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.710
Straight down.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.870
Hit her on the lip bounced
up, right in the mouth.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.980
By then I turned around and I run
back down the hallway and I dive

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.150
into my bedroom and then
I just listen deliciously.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.540
And I hear ugh, ugh, ugh.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.550
Phew. And then I hear
a shoe go whax,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.030
splat and I'm like oh,
not good for Zippy.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.050
[ Laughter ]

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.860
And then I hear down the
hallway, thump, thump, thump,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.020
thump and it's my sister.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.150
And she comes into my room and
she looks at me and she goes,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.240
there's only one person
sick enough in this house

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.920
to do what just happened to me.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.520
And I'm like that's
right, that would be me.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.210
She goes now you have to
suffer a wicked punishment

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.910
or I'm going to tell mom.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.560
I'm like, well, what's
the punishment?

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.780
She said, take off all
your clothes and run naked

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.490
around the outside of the house.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.790
I said, I can't do that.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.380
She said, I'll tell
mom she'll kill you.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.140
I go, okay I'll take the clothes
off -- because my mom would have.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.650 position:56%
And so I took off all my clothes,
ran out the back sliding glass door.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.550
I ran screaming all the
way around the house.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.220
I get back to the back door.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.010
Click. She's locked the back door.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.310
[ Laughter ]

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.610
I run to the window.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.900
She's locked every window.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.350
I dash to the front door.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.230
She beat me to the front door.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.720
And now a very naked,
desperate boy jumping up

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.130
and down on the front porch.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.320
I have no idea what to do next.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.540
I look over at the
Pagoda's house next door.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.570
I see some laundry
hanging on the line.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.850
Things I've never seen
before in my life.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.120
I go I don't know what that
is, but I have to wear it.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.670
And so I run nakedly
across the Pagoda's yard

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.480
when Mrs. Pagoda catches
me [inaudible]

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.120
and yells out what are you?

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.420
Some kind of a nut.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.720
I'm like, ah.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.260
I turn around, come back,
still have no idea what to do.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.800
So I dive behind those bushes
in the front of the house

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.790
and I stay hunkered down,
sitting there whimpering nakedly

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.960
until that evening my father
pulls the car in the driveway

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.580
and his naked son jumps out
of a bush in front of the car.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.890
I thought my father was
going to run me over.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.130
I was crying.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.660
I said, she's so mean.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.960
She's so wicked.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.260 position:56%
She said, who are you talking about?

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.130
I said my sister, Betsy.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.090
He goes, well what did you do?

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.910
I said, well I dropped
a roach in her mouth.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.210
He goes, well.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.510
[Inaudible].

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.090
Maybe you deserved this.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.930
He said now go in the house, you're
embarrassing me naked out here.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.510
I said, oh I've already been
naked out here for hours.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.670
[ Laughter ]

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.910
Anyway. See that little story.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.990
That little story just
pops right off of the map.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.280
I can go around that map,
everything you see drawn on there,

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.370
I've written a story about, and
it all starts with your life.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.430
So the very first thing you
need to do as a writer--

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.080
the very first thing you need

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.180
to do is put yourself
first in your writing life.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.330
Right from the first-person
point of view.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.560
I said, I did, I am, I will.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.690
You see how powerful that
I is, that first person.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.020
I'm in charge.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.800
That's what you want.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.910
Now I want you to brainstorm
in your journal.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.140
I want you to make a list to
go with your map, action words.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.380
Brothers, sisters,
parents, pets, dumb stuff.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.630 position:56%
Don't leave dumb stuff off your list
because that's 50% of literature.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.150
Secrets, disasters, schools,
lying, finding stuff,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.400
public humiliation,
that's' like 49%.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.090
And then the rest is
just 1,5 like school.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.440
That's 1%.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.080
And then friends maybe.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.550
Over there on the other side, see
where it says emotional words?

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.650
We all have a great, strong
vocabulary for action.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.030
We have a weaker vocabulary
for emotion,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:36.010
so we have to make sure we get some
good, solid, emotional lead words.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.740
Confused, proud, curious, bored,
loved, jealous, panicked, trusting,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.470
awkward, brave, amused, powerless.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.000
Isn't that great, huh?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.430
Don't you just feel that
way as a kid some days?

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.090
Powerless.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.390
And then accomplished.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.690
That's always good.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.390
And then that goes in your journal.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.410
With that map.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:03.020
And then you take that very
same map and I want you to go

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.750
with every action drawing you have

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.170
and then add an emotion,
a strong emotion.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.130
So like where I dropped that
roach in my sister's mouth.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.940
Right it's Zippy the Roach.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.470
Pain. I suffered pain;
physical and emotional.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:26.200
So not only do you have the action,
now you also have the emotion.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.110
And when you're thinking
of literature,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.030
you say, what is literature?

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:34.650 position:56%
Literature, the answer to that is
all the action in the physical world

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.050
and all the emotion on the inside.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.490
So you're always working both
sides of the human condition;

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.490
the physical world,
the interior world.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.330
The dropping the roach,
the suffering of the pain.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:55.000
So then from there, you
need to organize your story.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.830
So I want you to just draw
a little chart like this.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.170
It's already in the book.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.910
So you can get it that way.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.590
Character, setting, problem, that
goes right to eh beginning, right?

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.220
Characters, me and my sister.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.260
Setting, the living room.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.910
Problem, ah we've been bickering.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.160
Situation, I drop a roach.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.640
Action, right.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.650
Action. Then I have the
runaround the house,

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.250
I'm trying to get some clothes.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.530
Crisis, the door is locked.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.150
Resolution, solve the problem.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.450
I can't solve that problem.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.820
I have to hide in the
bushes all date.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.160
And then the double-ending.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.460
Remember this.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.850
Remember the physical
world, the emotional world?

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.000
Why would you have a double-ending?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.300
Because you need an
ending for the physical

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.180
and an ending for the emotional.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.580
Physical world, finally got some
clothes back on; emotional world,

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.880
had to come to the conclusion

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.080
that my sister was smarter
and tougher than me.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.180
Now, character, setting,
problem; right to the beginning.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.690
Action, crisis to the middle;

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.710
resolution physical
and emotional ending.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.770
So now. You have a journal.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.070
You've got a map.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.130
On the map , you've got
physical; you've got emotional

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.920
and you also have a structure.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.000
You know what you need next?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.850
Discipline.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.560
So here's what I'd do.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.750
Everyday I'd wake up in
Boston, where I live.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.440
My rule in life is live
next door to the library,

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.930
because I write all my
books in the library.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.980
So I get up, I feed
the cats and then

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.160
after I feed the cats,
I go to the library.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.930
I do two hours of first
draft writing,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.550
two hours of second draft
writing, two hours of reading,

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.560
four hours of rewriting and
I go home, which is close

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.520
because I live next
door to the library.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.460
And here's what I'm
asking you to do.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.800
Ten minutes a day.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.370
That's all I want.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.670
Ten minutes a day.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.970
You're young writers.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.430
You're just starting out.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.260 position:56%
You're just getting your journal set

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.300
up like a real professional
writer's journal.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.050
So start with ten minutes.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.840
You draw that map, you
focus in on something.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.260
You just write furiously
for ten minutes.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.870
You don't know where it's
going, don't worry about it.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.170
Just get it in there.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.470
Next day, ten minutes.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.770
Next day ten minutes.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.350
It builds, builds, builds.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:09.370
Two weeks, now you've captured that
really good first draft of a story.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.240
Then you bring the structure to it.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:17.190
You polish it up and then you
have something called literature.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.410
And it's all about you.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.980
How am I doing?

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.740
Am I done?

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.040
I'm just about done.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.340
Okay. Boom.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.970
So drafts.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.960
Now I do 100 drafts.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.330 position:56%
I'm not asking you to do 100 drafts.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.830
I just want a couple.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.110
Point-of-view, remember
what the point of view is?

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.410
First person right.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.040
I am, I said.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.340
Structure.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.640
Apply all elements of writing.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.940
Beginning, middle, end.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.030
We just did that with
that cockroach story.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.330
Physical draft.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.940
Then I want you to read
your story and make sure all

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.450
of the physical details
are in there.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.020
Then go back and read it and make
sure all the emotional details are

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.320
in there.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.620
Then theme.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.920
Hey, what's that story about?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.220
My sister's smarter than me.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.520
Make sure you get that in there.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.210
Dialogue. Make sure
your characters speak.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.840
When your characters
speak they pop alive.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.940
They become three dimensional
and you're a genius.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.890
And then descriptions
and right words.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.120
You want to make sure
you love the language.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.160
Make it poetic, make it beautiful,

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.880
make it represent the
best of what you can do.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.300
Then you review what it is.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.370
Then you rake out all those extra
verys, ands, ifs buts and that word

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.080
like which nobody likes anyway,

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.010
but you have to keep
50% of them for similes.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.700
But nonetheless you clean
it all up and that's

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.270
when it starts looking good.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.670
And then you bam, you put your name
on it and that's a piece of work;

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.520
that you're proud of, you
worked hard on, hard for

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.090
and I will be reading
your good book.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.020
Because I have talked straight
through for 25 minutes,

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.520
we do not have time for questions

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.790
but I thank all of
you for being here.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.270
This is a great festival.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.610
I love it.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.510
Thank you DC.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.270
[ Applause ]

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.570
Good luck with your writing.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.220
