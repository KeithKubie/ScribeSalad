[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:07.070
JASON PHILLIPS: We're going
to talk about the book.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.361
It's called "All in Nutrition--

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:12.489
Powerful Protocols That Will
Deliver What No Diet Ever Has."

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.030
And that's really
like the foundation

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.219
of virtually everything we do.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.960
We talk about protocols.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.685
We never classify
what we do as a diet.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:22.560
And so I'll give you
guys a quick background.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.851
Some of you guys have been
here to see me speak before.

00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:26.140
Some of you haven't it.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.310
But for me, my entry into
the health and fitness space

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.280
is a lot different
than most people.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.170
At the age of 18, I
had an eating disorder.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.890
I was anorexic.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.400
I was 118 pounds.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.024
Kind of been an
athlete all my life.

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:40.940
Use that word loosely.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.370
I was playing golf all the time.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.590
But I had brought myself all
the way down to 118 pounds.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.734
Obviously, overcame that.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:49.400
Decided right then
and there I was going

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.990
to switch my major in school.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.280
Transferred to Florida State.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.320
Majored in exercise science
with a concentration

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.460
in fitness and nutrition.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.960
And decided from
that very minute I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.250
was going to pay it forward.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.750
There was nothing else in my
life that I was going to do.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.730
I was just talking to Heather.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.430
I honestly believe
there's nothing else

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.670
I'm even that good at.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.040
But I have an obsession
with food, clearly.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.660
And I happen to be
pretty good at it.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.457
And that's kind of what
brings us here today.

00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:14.040
So normally what I like to do
is a question and answer format.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.373
We want to keep it a little
bit different than what I've

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:18.150
done here the last two years.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.080
So I kind of want to
bring to your awareness

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.970
your relationship to dieting.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.990
So the one question I always
get when people stop me

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.870
on the streets or
anywhere I am is,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.150
what's the best diet
that's out there?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.590
So let's kind of stop you guys.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.020
Let's talk about that let's
understand what that statement

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.490
even means, why it's--

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.170
can I cuss or not?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.220
Why it's complete B--

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.876
I can-- why it's
complete bullshit.

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:44.375
So much more
comfortable, I promise.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.346
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:50.000
If I have to hold my tongue,
it's like awkward for me.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.430
So let's kind of get
around that statement,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.670
understand why the word "diet"
in and of itself is bullshit,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.780
and really how we
need to move forward.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.380
As I'm talking, I
would love for you

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.380
guys to think of some questions
that you may or may not have.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.090
Like I talked
about, we like to do

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.479
a lot of Q&amp;A. I like to
think that you guys came here

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.520
to learn at least one thing.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.410
You probably have a
question in your head

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.160
that you're hoping
I'm going to answer.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.620
So instead of
leaving it to chance,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.860
I'm going to call on you
guys to come to the mic,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.860
ask that question, and I will
make sure that I answer it.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.569
So let's talk about diet and
what that best diet might be.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.110
I think the word
diet in most people,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.770
they think it kind of
revolves around fat loss.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.270
That's what most people think
of when they're going to diet.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.300
They want to lose weight,
or they want to lose fat.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.940
And typically, when
somebody's asking me

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.370
that, I come to it
with the expectation

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.180
there's probably several
diets they've already tried.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.930
Seeing some of you
like shaking your head.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.535
Yes, I've tried several
different diets out there.

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:49.910
So where you're at today is
you're confused, you're lost.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.650
Is it you that's the
problem, or is it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.860
the diet that's the problem?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.460
And that's really what
we have to figure out.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.730
I have the belief that
no diet is a bad diet.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.180
I also have the belief that
no diet is a good diet.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.220
Where you're at today
is that you just

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.210
haven't found the methodology
or the amount of protocols

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.730
or the number of things
in your life that align

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.759
that will move you forward.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.300
So when we look at
the dietary space,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.540
it's a lot of
calorie restriction.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.510
There's the keto diet
that is low carbohydrate.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.310
Well, when you eliminate
carbs, you eliminate calories.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.170
Obviously, you should
lose some weight.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.490
We look at a low-fat diet.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.770
When you eliminate fats,
you eliminate a certain set

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.790
of calories.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.009
You should lose some weight.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.550
When we look at
intermittent fasting,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.462
if you stop eating for
eight to 10 hours per day,

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:36.170
you're obviously
consuming less calories.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.234
In theory, you
should lose weight.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:40.400
The problem is a lot of you
guys are thinking, well,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.480
I tried keto.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.767
I've tried low fat.

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:44.100
I've tried intermittent fasting.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.620
And it didn't work for me.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.495
And that's where we have
to figure out, well,

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:48.953
why doesn't that
diet work for you?

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:49.970
Are you broken?

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.209
Of course you're not broken.

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.000
The reasons those don't
work for you is you

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.791
guys have to figure
out what we talk about.

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:57.500
What are your
non-negotiables in life?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.940
It's the first question
that we ask our clients.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.050
And so if your intermittent
fasting window is,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.355
let's say you're eating
from noon and until 8:00 PM.

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:09.230
But your significant
other wakes up on Sunday

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.050
morning at 9:30 in the morning
and says, hey, let's go

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.979
have brunch.

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.020
Is your diet now completely
thrown out the window

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.720
because you just screwed
your fasting window?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.131
The psychology of
dieting says, yes, it is.

00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:22.380
You're just going to go ahead
go on a bender that day.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.440
Because if you eat
100 extra calories,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.970
let's eat 100,000
extra calories.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.752
It's the same.

00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:29.960
So really, guys, what I'm
going to challenge everyone

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.810
to understand is,
what are the protocols

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.460
that align with your lifestyle?

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.710
And that's really what the
ethos of our book is about,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.600
is figuring out, who are you?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.620
Where do you come from?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.240
What is your
relationship with food?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.300
What social regulations
within the construct

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.072
of your dietary setting
do you actually need?

00:04:47.072 --> 00:04:49.280
And so in the book, we have
eight different protocols

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.266
we talk about.

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:51.890
The first one is we
actually understand

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.050
what food quality is.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.630
And so within food quality, I
think everyone's like, well,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.075
a diet has to be chicken.

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.630
It has to be salmon.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.480
It's got to be broccoli,
asparagus, whatever the quote,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.692
unquote, "clean food" are.

00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:05.150
Does anybody in
here actually think

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.441
that there's good and bad food?

00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:08.060
Show of hands.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.590
Yes, there's good food.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.570
And yes, there's bad food.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.250
OK, I would actually
argue you're all wrong.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.660
And I would argue there's
no such thing as a bad food.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.610
Understand that every food
just contains calories.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.970
It contains macronutrients,
and it contains micronutrients.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.970
Now, some foods, like sugars,
have very few micronutrients

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.649
in them.

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:28.190
Some foods, like
salmon and broccoli,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.970
happen to have a subset of
calories, macronutrients,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.250
and a ton of micronutrients.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.460
Well, we've started kind of
correlating the words good

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.520
and micronutrient-rich to
mean the same thing, which I

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.410
think is really not the truth.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.010
So if somebody told me
today that I could never

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.670
have another slice
of pizza on my diet,

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.200
what is the first
thing I'm probably

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.420
going to crave instantly?

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.890
It's going to be pizza, right?

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.870
Especially here in Chicago.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.640
So knowing that I really
like pizza, a diet for me

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.690
has to have some sort of
ability to deviate or ability

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.080
to include pizza
within my dietary set.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.090
Let's talk about the
obvious offender everyone's

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.640
worried-- wondering
about-- alcohol.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.340
If I told all of you
guys that to see success

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.879
you could have zero alcoholic
beverages the entire time

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.170
you're dieting, how many
people think they could do it?

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.753
Show of hands.

00:06:21.753 --> 00:06:23.430
Be realistic.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.020
I've got one, two people with
their hands up in the room.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.520
That's awesome.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.100
Now, let's all of a
sudden snap our fingers,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.280
magically say that I could give
you the willpower of these two

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.430
phenomenal human beings.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.030
And you could do
it for 16 weeks,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.840
and you achieve your goals.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.686
Do you think that
those goals are

00:06:41.686 --> 00:06:43.310
going to be something
that you actually

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.670
keep for 16 more weeks?

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.200
Chances are, no.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.470
So then the real question
is, did the diet even work?

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.470
Guys, what we're building
is not really a diet.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.790
It's a lifestyle.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.376
It's a subset of rules that
you have to fit into your life.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.750
So let's talk
about food sources.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.010
It really comes down to
understanding macronutrients.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.250
So we've got-- really simple.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.940
We've got proteins.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.220
We've got carbs.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.120
And we've got fats.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.954
No, alcohol is not
the fourth macro,

00:07:11.954 --> 00:07:13.120
as much as we want it to be.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.040
Really, it's a breakdown
of having the right amount

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.050
of proteins, carbs, and
fats that will move you

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.950
the direction that you want.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.650
So a lot of people are going to
say, well, what about calories?

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.220
Well, if your macros add up to
the right amount of calories,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.250
yes, they'll move you
in the right direction.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.720
However, let's arbitrarily
say it takes 2,400 calories

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.130
to get you to lose weight.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.700
You consume all 2,400
calories from carbs and fats.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.980
You think that's going
to look really good?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.550
Nobody has ever come to me
in my 15 years of doing this

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.310
and said, I want to lose
weight but get fatter.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.100
So really, when you start
talking about weight loss,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.080
you're actually
talking about fat loss.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.974
I don't know very many people
that want purely weight loss.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.390
It's just something
to understand.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.905
Does this make
sense to everybody?

00:07:56.905 --> 00:07:59.734
Does anybody have any
questions on that?

00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:01.650
The next big thing is
the non-negotiable piece

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.690
that we talked about.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.240
What lifestyle things do you
have to have in your diet?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.330
So let's arbitrarily say I can
get you into the food quantity

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:09.870
piece.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.078
You start to understand that.

00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:13.390
You're willing to track it.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.320
Let's say you've got to
have alcohol in your life.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.600
And you're one of
those people that has,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.230
let's call it, one drink per
night, seven nights per week.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.522
Doesn't seem like much.

00:08:23.522 --> 00:08:25.980
But when we actually start to
look at the effect of alcohol

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.070
on the body, I would argue
pushing all seven drinks to one

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.309
night during the week would
give you better results.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.039
It's understanding
the effect of alcohol

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.200
on the metabolism, what we call
the priority of metabolism,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.770
which we might talk
about later, but really

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.829
the hormonal implications
you're going to have.

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:44.120
So it's understanding where
all of these things fit in.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.130
What sacrifices will you make?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.970
Will you move alcohol
to seven nights?

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.380
Will you move it to two nights?

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.937
Will you move it
to three nights?

00:08:50.937 --> 00:08:53.270
Let's arbitrarily say you'll
only move it to two nights.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.320
Great.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.107
It's now my job as a
coach and as an educator

00:08:57.107 --> 00:08:58.940
to tell you that with
the fact that you have

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.770
to drink two nights,
you might have wanted

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.420
to achieve your
results in 10 weeks;

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.370
it's going to take you 20 weeks.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.000
That's totally OK.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.562
Be 100% patient with yourself.

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:09.020
Because now, you're
actually living

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.060
something you can sustain.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.190
Please, please do
not try to adhere

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.910
to a diet that is going
to move you forward faster

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.670
just because of the timeline.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.720
Because the faster
you move forward

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.550
and the faster you're
just omitting things

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.670
that you actually
want in your life,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.830
the faster you will go backwards
to where you originally were.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.990
And you'll go beyond
that set point.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.280
You will absolutely go there.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.390
Speaking of set point, let's all
understand the set point theory

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.360
as to why weight loss happens.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.310
So we look at--

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.230
Lyle McDonald gives us
a really good example

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.480
when he talks about set point.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.900
We look at where our bodies are.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.225
If we were to just kind
of look at a thermostat

00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:48.550
and we set the room--

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.020
I don't know--
call it 70 degrees.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.180
And it's 76 degrees outside.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.680
What does the thermostat do?

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.560
It cools down.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.310
It's going to kick on
the AC, because it's

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.840
going to bring the natural
temperature of the room down.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.340
Your body's the exact same.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:10.050
Let's say your set point is
burning 2,500 calories per day.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.660
And all of a sudden,
you're consuming 1,500

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.570
because that's a common
dietary prescription.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.040
Let's eat 1,500
calories per day.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.130
What do you think your body is
actually doing in this area?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.170
It's downregulating
its metabolic response.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.030
Why?

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.540
Because it need survival.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.840
So as you're consuming
less and less calories,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.550
you're actually
teaching your body

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.106
to be a fat-storing machine,
not a fat-burning machine.

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:40.980
So a lot of people go
into a dietary setting.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.020
And they're like, well,
I've tried this diet.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.160
I've tried that diet.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.260
Well, really, all
you've done is you've

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.900
reinforced with
every subsequent diet

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.820
that your body
should not burn fat.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.690
So that 500 calorie
isogenic cleanse

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.050
followed by the keto diet that
gave you 800 calories followed

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.620
by the fasting diet where you
only consumed 1,200 calories--

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.930
all you've done is
build a set point here.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.850
So now, when you have a normal
prescription of 2,500 calories,

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.060
you've actually taught
your body that's a surplus.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.250
And you're now going to gain fat
on a normal amount of calories.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.110
That is actually--
that statement

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.770
is where probably 70% of
people are living today,

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.690
relative to diet culture.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.420
We've lived in a world
where for the last 10 years,

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.510
it's been a heavy
quality emphasis.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.670
So everything that has
come at us has been paleo.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.750
It's been keto.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.430
It's been, well,
god, you eat carbs.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.380
Or god forbid you
actually have a little bit

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.460
of sugar in your diet.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.510
Or god forbid it's not paleo.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.470
You're going to die.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.550
Well, you're not going to die.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.490
You're also not going
to magically get fat

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.940
because the food was not
was keto-- was not paleo.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.370
When you look at the paleo
diet in and of itself,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.630
one of the biggest
offenders that it have

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.320
is no quantity control.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.180
So we can agree--

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.370
500 calories, probably
going to take you

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.860
into this metabolic adaptation
I just talked about.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.524
5,000 calories, it's
going to make you fat.

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:07.690
Whether that's salmon and
broccoli or whether that's

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.200
pizza, 5,000 calories is 5,000
calories across the board.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.390
And it's going to
leave you overweight.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.150
So in a paleo confines,
you absolutely

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.509
have to have the right
quantity control.

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:21.550
So are you guys starting
to see where all of this

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.720
comes together?

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.180
So 90% of people that are
probably sitting in this room,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.790
they've been here, in
this low calorie state,

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.100
for far too long.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.840
Oh, let's also consider you're
consuming 1,500 calories.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.173
Then, you're going to do the
cardio, because we all know

00:12:34.173 --> 00:12:35.890
cardio is how you lose fat.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.310
That's another five to 800
calorie deficit per day.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.760
So now, we're actually
probably out here creating

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.100
more metabolic adaptations.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.180
We're doing that.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.770
We're trying diets
that don't really

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.910
align with our lifestyle.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.370
And we're thinking
that we're going

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.770
to actually achieve weight
loss and sustain weight loss.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.530
And it's not really
going to happen.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.904
So guys, in the
book, we actually

00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:00.665
present you with
eight different steps

00:13:00.665 --> 00:13:01.790
that you should go through.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.260
At the conclusion
of eight steps,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.140
you should have actually
built not only the diet from

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.260
a numerical perspective-- so
from calories and macros--

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.760
but also the lifestyle that
the diet needs to fit into.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.930
And once you've identified all
of those things for yourself,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.350
success is inevitable.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.260
It really becomes very simple.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.630
Compliance becomes very simple.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.310
And success is actually
where we get to.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.110
So that's kind of where I come
at a dietary setting from.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.760
My question is
for you guys, what

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.342
do you want to know about
the dieting process?

00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:36.050
So I can make sure
you all understand it,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.070
and you guys go
out and apply it.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.860
And this is where the
Q&amp;A part comes in.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.150
This is where it
gets super awkward.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.233
Because I actually need
somebody to break the ice,

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:44.990
raise their hand, talk into the
mic, like do that whole thing.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.220
So somebody's got to do that.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.861
Go ahead, man.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.860
AUDIENCE: So what role
does intermittent fasting

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.860
play in your philosophy
or the things

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.600
you're talking about here?

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.100
JASON PHILLIPS: The
question I would

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.720
ask you is, before
you started fasting

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.120
or when you shifted to
intermittent fasting,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.260
what changes did you make?

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.280
Was it purely just controlling
the time that you ate?

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.780
Was there any other
identifications?

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.590
Did you know how many
calories you were consuming?

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.840
Do you now know how many
calories you're consuming?

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.310
Was your activity
level the same?

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.180
Was it different?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.170
Let's talk about those things.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.120
AUDIENCE: OK, so activity
level didn't change.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.370
JASON PHILLIPS: OK,
activity's level the same.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.250
So output is the same.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:18.833
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:20.830
Calorie level didn't
really change.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.660
I've always been
cognitive of that.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.230
JASON PHILLIPS: So it's
something you're tracking,

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.480
something we're aware of.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.189
AUDIENCE: Macros.

00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:26.855
JASON PHILLIPS: Macros
you are aware of?

00:14:26.855 --> 00:14:28.430
So we kept the macros the same.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.320
We're just in a smaller window.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:29.410
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:29.440
I'm sorry.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.110
Calorie level I kept the same.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.110
What changed was macros.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.010
So I--

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.510
JASON PHILLIPS:
What macros changed?

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.465
AUDIENCE: Dropped
carbs, increased fat.

00:14:37.465 --> 00:14:40.100
So feeling like much more
satisfied after I'm eating.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.450
I'm not really hungry.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.566
But just trying to
bracket it between--

00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:45.190
JASON PHILLIPS: So
let me ask you this.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.710
Do you think it was the fasting
window that changed things?

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.376
Or do you think it
was your overall food

00:14:49.376 --> 00:14:52.260
consumption in 24 hours?

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.039
AUDIENCE: I feel like
it's the fasting.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:57.080
JASON PHILLIPS: So I would
tell you you're wrong.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.212
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:58.212 --> 00:14:59.920
JASON PHILLIPS: So
when we look at that--

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.790
and that's OK.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.020
That's totally acceptable.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.130
We have what's called total
daily energy expenditure.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.070
And this is a function of
basically your basal metabolic

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:14.140
rate, your exercise activity,
your non-exercise activity,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.310
and the thermic effect of food.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.980
Those are the four
factors that equal--

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.280
that equate to your total
daily energy expenditure.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.180
This-- not at all
controlled by when you eat.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.920
This-- not controlled
by when you eat.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.010
This-- not controlled
by when you eat.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.800
That-- not controlled
by when you eat.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.210
So all of the
calories you're out

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.320
putting in a 24-hour window- not
controlled by what's taken in.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.820
So if what you're
taking in is being

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.403
eaten in a shorter
window, it's really

00:15:44.403 --> 00:15:45.770
just relative to the deficit.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.170
What I would argue
for you is you

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.120
found a lower
carbohydrate approach.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.510
You probably had some underlying
insulin-sensitivity issues,

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.800
or your activity output did not
warrant as many carbohydrates

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.470
as you were consuming.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.367
That's really what your
success came down to.

00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:02.700
So Charles Poliquin has a quote.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.530
You've got to earn your carbs.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.140
I don't think we have to
go that far with things.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.050
But it's a pretty good analogy.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.047
The person that sits
on the couch all day

00:16:12.047 --> 00:16:13.380
probably doesn't eat many carbs.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:13.880
Why?

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.540
We don't need carbs to live.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.604
Carbs are what we call a
non-essential nutrient.

00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:19.770
We don't need carbohydrate
to survive in this world.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.728
We can produce ketones.

00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:23.274
We can live off those ketones,
hence the ketogenic world

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:23.940
we're living in.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.134
Because you were consuming--

00:16:28.134 --> 00:16:29.300
I don't know how many carbs.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.712
I don't how many grams.

00:16:30.712 --> 00:16:32.670
But because you were
consuming that many grams,

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.660
you brought that down.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.730
You had a little more of your
essential nutrients, the fats.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.080
And all of a sudden,
you're seeing weight loss.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.160
You're seeing results.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.535
I'm just going to
assume you were

00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:40.980
having too many carbohydrates.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.060
Make sense?

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.870
AUDIENCE: I think it-- the
whole insulin response in that--

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.500
JASON PHILLIPS: The
response is huge.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.550
Absolutely.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:52.140
Also, to be completely fair,
how many hours a day do you eat?

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.400
What's your fasting window?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.710
Is it like--

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.360
AUDIENCE: Four to eight.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.350
JASON PHILLIPS: 18:6?

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like
a 24 or to a 16:8.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.360
JASON PHILLIPS: So 16:8.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.750
So that's 16 hours fasted,
eight hours eating.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.540
The actual intermittent
fasting, like the protocol

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.730
in and of itself, was
never actually meant

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.869
to be a daily thing.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:11.780
It was actually meant
to be intermittently,

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.440
you fast, meaning a 24
to 48 to 72-hour fast

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.730
every now and then.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.040
I just did a 24-hour
fast on Sunday.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.089
I felt great.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.524
My GI feels way better.

00:17:22.524 --> 00:17:23.940
And there's a lot
of research that

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.040
says your gut health
is going to get better.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.449
Insulin sensitivity can improve.

00:17:28.449 --> 00:17:30.990
So prolonged fasting for you,
if there is insulin sensitivity

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.790
pieces, that might improve.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.250
Cortisol regulation
can happen if done

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.960
in a stress-controlled
environment.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.010
That's huge.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.952
Let's not mix and say,
oh, well, I'm fasting,

00:17:39.952 --> 00:17:41.535
and I'm doing
high-intensity CrossFit.

00:17:41.535 --> 00:17:43.200
And I'm gonna
control my cortisol.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.010
Like no, that shit's
not going to happen.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.370
You're going to
make shit way worse.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.440
But assuming you
control your stressors

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.940
and you're having
periodic fasts,

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.030
you can absolutely improve
your cortisol curve,

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.360
which, as we know, will help
you long-term from a hormone

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.620
perspective and, ultimately,
a fat loss perspective.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.954
So I would say it comes
down to insulin sensitivity.

00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:05.320
Dude, if it's working--

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.140
this is the beauty of diet.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.410
Let's just arbitrarily say that
Gwen had cake every single day.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.930
And we saw that
she was losing fat.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.510
And her blood health markers
were saying the exact same.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.160
That flies in the
face of science.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.846
It flies in the
face of physiology.

00:18:18.846 --> 00:18:20.970
If it's working, I'm not
going to tell her to stop.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.860
Assuming I'm looking
at her health markers

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.380
and everything is, like,
she's super healthy, great.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.269
You're the anomaly.

00:18:27.269 --> 00:18:29.560
Sometimes science doesn't
explain every single thing we

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.650
do, even though we want it to.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.935
Also, do you feel good
on intermittent fasting?

00:18:34.935 --> 00:18:35.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.480
JASON PHILLIPS: Is it
something you could stay

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.710
sustain for the next 10,
15, 20 years of your life?

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:39.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I can do it.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:39.770
JASON PHILLIPS: OK.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.853
Is it going to interfere
with any lifestyle things

00:18:41.853 --> 00:18:43.180
that you've got going on?

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.860
Then, dude, you've
found your diet.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.420
You've found your
dietary protocol.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.590
Let's not use the word diet.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.850
But you've found your
dietary protocol.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.070
You found your way of eating
for the rest of your life.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.861
Keep doing it, man.

00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:52.570
That's awesome.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.860
Congrats.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.400
Good for you.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.050
Yes, sir.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.820
AUDIENCE: Can you just
touch a little more

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.580
on the alcohol
with the metabolism

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.080
and how that impacts it?

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.760
Because if it really is
that big of a difference,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.910
instead of going home
and having a glass or two

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.600
of wine every night,
but I can still

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.354
have the same amount
in three nights?

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:16.020
JASON PHILLIPS: So
I'm going to give you

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.097
a lot of empirical data on this.

00:19:20.097 --> 00:19:21.555
Because I have 15
years' experience

00:19:21.555 --> 00:19:26.000
and literally have 10,000 people
I've put through programs.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.470
And so I'm going to get
some science zealots that

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.970
are going to be
like, ah, well, that

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.280
doesn't add up 100%
from the human body.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.322
I can tell you numerically
in fat loss weight,

00:19:35.322 --> 00:19:36.780
this is how it ends
up working out.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.540
When you consume an
alcoholic beverage--

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.623
let's just say this is the
seven days of the week.

00:19:44.623 --> 00:19:47.265
Let's say you consume
alcohol here on Sunday.

00:19:47.265 --> 00:19:49.140
This is what we're going
to see on the scale.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.223
You're likely going to see
the body weight go down

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:52.620
the next day on Monday.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.710
Why is that?

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.879
You're dehydrated.

00:19:55.879 --> 00:19:57.420
What's going to
happen here is you're

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.550
going to see the scale
go up on Tuesday,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.770
above what it was here.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.690
It's going to go
above that baseline.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.010
On Wednesday, we're going
to see it go up again.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.090
So let's just say you
have another drink here.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.930
Well, you're already dehydrated.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.570
So it's definitely
going up here.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.430
It's definitely going up here.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.615
And it's going up here.

00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:20.490
Let's say you have
another one here.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.900
Guess what's probably happening.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.710
Well, we just tacked
onto that again.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.890
And that's what you
start to see happen.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.020
When we look at alcohol
metabolism in the body,

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.360
alcohol is a foreign
substance to the body.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.860
We know that proteins,
carbohydrates

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.720
have four calories per gram.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.730
Fats have nine
calories per gram.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.670
Alcohol has seven
calories per gram.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.080
So your body really
doesn't understand seven.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.530
It understands four and nine.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.760
So as soon as a seven comes
in, your body freaks out.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.135
It's like, what
the fuck is this?

00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:47.490
Get it out of me.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.110
Everything else shuts down.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.090
Your liver immediately
starts prioritizing

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.910
the metabolism of that alcohol
to get it out of your body.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.060
Well, what does that
do to the efficiency

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.590
of everything else in the body?

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.510
It slows it down.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.970
Not saying that it's directly
going to be stored as fat,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.642
but it's definitely not being
used as efficiently for fuel.

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:08.850
So let's take a look at that.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.580
There's definitely some of that
contributing to weight gain.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.890
There's also hormonal
suppression from alcohol.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.710
We know, via studies, that
it brings testosterone levels

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.690
down, males and females.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.400
Well, when testosterone
levels are low,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.280
that begins to
affect the metabolism

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.480
and metabolic health.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.720
So lower hormone output
equals lower metabolic health

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.560
long-term.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.660
Lower metabolic
health equals more fat

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.850
burn-- or more fat gain.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.434
So really, you're just
working in an environment

00:21:35.434 --> 00:21:37.350
where there's just nothing
positive happening.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.540
Now, I'll say this.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.931
There's this one caveat.

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:41.430
I've worked with
probably two people

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.000
in 15 years that have insane
rates of alcohol metabolism--

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.350
nothing happens.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.020
Like the dude could literally
drink a liter of vodka,

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.052
and you wouldn't even
know it the next day.

00:21:51.052 --> 00:21:53.010
AUDIENCE: So if you were
able to go cold turkey

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.080
tomorrow in regards to
alcohol consumption,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.466
how long would it take the
body to adjust for that,

00:21:58.466 --> 00:22:00.090
like so you're starting
off pretty much

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:04.280
fresh without it compounding on
top of each other day over day?

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.530
JASON PHILLIPS: I'm trying
to understand the question.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.570
So if we went cold turkey
alcohol consumption tomorrow,

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.300
I guess it would depend on
how much alcohol you currently

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.880
consume.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.580
So for instance,
my wife's pregnant.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.850
I haven't consumed alcohol
in quite some time.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.770
So stating that I'm giving
up alcohol tomorrow probably

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.290
wouldn't change my life.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.900
If I'm somebody that drinks
pretty frequently, probably

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.840
as fast as 24 hours you
would start to see things.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.770
I guarantee you-- you
give me somebody--

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.010
can we use you as an example?

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.270
So Katie likes her
alcohol beverages.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.179
We work together.

00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:40.220
It's just factual, right?

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.700
Listen, this is the
best part of it.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.450
We acknowledge it.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.710
It's part of per protocol.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.000
It's totally acceptable.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.234
And this is also part of
defining your non-negotiables.

00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:48.900
She'll tell you.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.860
In the beginning,
we worked together.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.610
I'm like, Jesus Christ.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:51.730
Why the fuck can't
you figure this out?

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.230
Like stop drinking
on Friday nights.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.939
Stop going crazy.

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:55.355
And then, I'm like,
you know what?

00:22:55.355 --> 00:22:56.010
Don't stop.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.074
Keep doing it.

00:22:57.074 --> 00:22:58.740
Let's just make sure
the other five days

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.910
are a little more controlled.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.451
We actually now build protocols
that allow her to see success

00:23:02.451 --> 00:23:04.680
based on that.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.900
However, if it's
in your diet day

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.150
in, day out, week in, week
out, and you eliminated it

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.970
for seven days, when you've
eliminated it for seven days,

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.080
the results are two, three,
four x better in just

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.640
as little as one week.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.540
Now, I would argue that first
seven days will be way better,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.090
and then, the effect
will slowly diminish.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.640
So you're going to see like
you go from here to here, back

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.820
down, just because,
obviously, the hormonal shift.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.790
Hormones come back up.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.040
You're in a really good place.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.470
But ultimately, everything
levels back out.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.640
That make sense?

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.240
AUDIENCE: Within the context
of a set point theory,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.480
how long does metabolic
adaptation take?

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.905
And what are some
symptoms, I guess?

00:23:44.905 --> 00:23:45.780
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.280
No.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.940
That's really good.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.610
So within the
context of set point

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.269
theory and creating metabolic
adaptations, how long

00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.810
does it take?

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.619
So everyone's going
to be individual.

00:23:56.619 --> 00:23:58.660
I think it would come down
to a couple of things.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:04.070
One, what is the degree
of your calorie deficit?

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.070
Two, what is your gender?

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.870
And three, what does your
hormone profile look like?

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.060
So we'll discuss those.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.290
So one, we talked
about calorie level.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.190
Two, gender.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.470
And three, hormone profile.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:28.810
So number one-- obviously, if
you're in 750-calorie deficit--

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.440
actually, they just did a study
on this not terribly long ago.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.490
There's one that I
like to reference

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.030
a lot called the MATADOR study.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.880
They put them in a
31% calorie deficit.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.790
They studied them over
the course of 16 weeks.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.470
At the end, the metabolic
markers were relatively low.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.289
There was a pretty
significant change.

00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:46.330
That being said, a
significant amount of fat loss

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:46.900
was achieved.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.160
It was pretty much a success.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.710
They were in a reasonably
significant calorie deficit,

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.210
31%.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.840
Let's just arbitrarily
say you're used

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.080
to taking in 2,000 calories.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.996
That would obviously put
you just under 1,400.

00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:01.120
That's a big deficit.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.847
That being said, what if we
put you on 1,000 calories?

00:25:03.847 --> 00:25:05.680
I would say the rate
of metabolic adaptation

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.900
is going to happen faster.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.910
Let's say we put you
on 1,700 calories.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.490
The rate of metabolic adaptation
is going to happen slower.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.660
That make sense?

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.222
Relatively simple then, right?

00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:16.430
Gender, why does that matter?

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.710
Well, men are far more
resilient, metabolically

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.260
speaking, than women are.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.670
It's just factual.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.950
Our hormone profile,
our HPA axis,

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.395
just functions a
little bit better.

00:25:26.395 --> 00:25:28.270
And that transitions
right into number three,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.230
which is hormones.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.940
We have a better
sex hormone profile.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.860
The more testosterone
you have, the less

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.240
suppressed your HPA
will be and the faster

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.950
you will recover from that.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.680
But let's also look into
non-sex-related hormones.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.640
Let's look at like cortisol
and then cortisol to DHEA

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.450
ratios, which would
be kind of a--

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.450
described in the-- I guess it
would be controversially called

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.020
adrenal fatigue.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.020
A lot of you guys have
heard of adrenal fatigue.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.870
It's in the media a lot now.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.150
We refer to adrenal
fatigue more properly

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.200
as HPA axis dysfunction.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.450
That's truly what's happening.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.997
Your HPA axis in your brain
is actually suppressed.

00:26:06.997 --> 00:26:08.080
It's not working properly.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.050
It's not able to properly
regulate cortisol in your body.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.280
If your HP axis is trashed and
you go into a very low calorie

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.130
deficit, your rate of metabolic
adaptation will happen faster.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.620
You will also be
far less resilient.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.470
Does that makes sense?

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.300
So really, you kind of have
to look at, well, where am I?

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.370
Is this the first
time I've ever dieted?

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.740
Am I putting myself in
a really big deficit?

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.740
And am I doing mildly
intense exercise?

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.770
It'll happen at a
reasonably fast rate,

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.550
but it's not going to
be super permanent.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.280
Because it's your first time.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.860
If you've tried every
diet under the sun

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.210
and you're doing CrossFit
on top of 500 calories,

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.890
it's going to happen very quick.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.710
And it's going to
destroy your HPA axis,

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.230
making it not only
going to happen faster,

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.940
but it's going to make it
much harder to recover from.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.220
Does that make sense?

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.400
So in terms of
signs and symptoms,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.110
there's two things
that we can look at.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.760
There's two things that
we look at, as coaches,

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.759
with all of our clients.

00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:06.860
We look at physical data.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.510
And we look at
physiological data.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.000
The physiological data
we call biofeedback.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.980
So I'm pretty sure any
really solid nutrition

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.340
coach could work purely off
biofeedback and create change.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.100
To me, that's a marker
of a very good coach.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.410
But it's learning to
understand the person

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.850
relative to their well-being.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.410
What is their hunger response?

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.210
What is their ability
to sleep like?

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.530
What is their sex drive like?

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:31.430
What is their mood?

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.540
What's their energy?

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.420
What's their ability to
focus and concentrate?

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.250
What is their body
temperature like?

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.000
OK, so let's just
say, all of a sudden,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.020
even on 1,000 calories,
which is starvation level,

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.190
you lose your appetite.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.620
Well, that's a sign you're
becoming metabolically adapted.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.180
Let's say all of a
sudden out of nowhere--

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.138
you're a great sleeper.

00:27:48.138 --> 00:27:50.690
You no longer have the
ability to fall asleep.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.720
And you're waking up at 2:00 in
the morning thinking about god

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.160
knows what.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.500
That's a sign you're becoming
metabolically adapted.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.810
Let's say you no longer
have a sex drive.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.100
That's definitely a sign you're
becoming metabolically adapted.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.980
Let's say you're just in a shit
mood or you're just very moody.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.120
You're very up and down.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.370
That's a sign
you've gone too far.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.230
Let's say you just
can't focus on anything.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.521
You sit down in front your
computer, or you go to work.

00:28:14.521 --> 00:28:15.980
You can't do any proper work.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.540
That's a sign.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.424
So basically a lot
of movement away

00:28:19.424 --> 00:28:21.590
from what we would call
normal or what we would call

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.880
set point.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.550
There's movements away from
point in our biofeedback,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.350
in our physiological
data as well,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.900
and those are very
indicative of us dipping

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.670
into metabolic adaptations.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.199
Make sense?

00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:35.990
AUDIENCE: Back to the
intermittent fasting.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.823
JASON PHILLIPS: Yup.

00:28:36.823 --> 00:28:39.140
AUDIENCE: Is it different
for males and females?

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.080
I guess I want to know as
far as female hormone levels.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.140
Can that really mess it up if
you're doing it incorrectly?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.510
JASON PHILLIPS: I don't think
it's different male to female.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.940
I think it's-- a lot of females
will come to intermittent

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.490
fasting--

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.150
and this is a statement
relative to society today.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.571
This is not a blanket
statement myopically looking

00:28:58.571 --> 00:28:59.570
at intermittent fasting.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.260
But having the knowledge
of the clientele

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.940
that's out in the world today
and where diet culture sits,

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.106
a lot of females are coming
to intermittent fasting,

00:29:07.106 --> 00:29:10.460
again, having tried five
other diets, 10 other diets.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.587
And so they've tried
only eating 500 calories.

00:29:12.587 --> 00:29:13.670
They've tried the cleanse.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.600
They've tried paleo.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.650
They've tried keto.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.829
And they heard fasting
is the magical solution.

00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:19.870
Well, where are they really
coming to fasting at?

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.920
They're coming to fasting
with probably some HPA

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.180
axis dysfunction.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.430
Now, they're not only
limiting the window of time

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.440
that they're eating but they're
keeping their calories super

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.040
controlled.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.050
So tit's not going to
help them in any way.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.200
If anything, it's only going to
further exacerbate the issues.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.750
Now, let's talk about what
happens in those people

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.315
from a hormonal standpoint.

00:29:37.315 --> 00:29:38.690
When you wake up,
you're supposed

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.730
to have very elevated
cortisol levels.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.570
So fasting, in theory, should
keep cortisol very high.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.170
Insulin is the shutoff valve.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.210
Those people are waking
up with no cortisol,

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.340
because their HPA is not
allowing it to produce.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.298
And they're operating
all day with no cortisol,

00:29:51.298 --> 00:29:53.149
so they're not even
feeling very good.

00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:55.190
I would not argue that's
a male and female thing.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.720
I just think
females are far more

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.182
susceptible to getting into
HPA axis dysfunction faster.

00:30:00.182 --> 00:30:01.640
And because of the
culture we live,

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.597
in they've been pushed
there a lot easier.

00:30:04.597 --> 00:30:06.680
But I don't think hormonally
there's a difference.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.460
JASON PHILLIPS: Make sense?

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.717
Yes, sir.

00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:11.300
AUDIENCE: I'm confused
about this idea

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.200
of metabolic adaptation in
that you kind of describe it

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.030
as like consuming less calories
is how you lose weight.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.410
JASON PHILLIPS: Yup.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.780
AUDIENCE: But then, it
screws you up because then

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.720
you get adapted to it.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.220
So--

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.678
JASON PHILLIPS:
Isn't that a bitch?

00:30:26.678 --> 00:30:27.637
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:27.637 --> 00:30:29.720
AUDIENCE: So what do you
do, then, read your book?

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.950
JASON PHILLIPS: I mean,
you must throw your arms up

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:31.900
and say, fuck it, right?

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.400
No.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:34.940
No, you're 100% right.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.860
And that's the whole paradigm--

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.920
the whole paradox of
dieting in and of itself.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.950
So undeniably so, as
body fat levels go down

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.860
because of the calorie deficit,
as you're getting leaner

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.615
and leaner, your body is
100% drawing adaptations

00:30:48.615 --> 00:30:50.960
at you to return to set point.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.030
So if you're taking
somebody that's naturally,

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.410
let's call it, a
male of 15% body fat,

00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:00.080
but because he wants to
operate with visible abdominals

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.030
all year round--

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.490
because let's be honest, we talk
about dieting related to abs.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.950
Fat loss is always abs.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.050
Nobody cares about the
muscles in their legs.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.282
They care about abs,
maybe arms for guys,

00:31:12.282 --> 00:31:13.490
because we're vain like that.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.100
But let's say you
want to get to 9%.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.410
Factually speaking,
this sacrifice right

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.180
here will create a host
of metabolic adaptations.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.910
There is very literature--

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.130
very little literature
to support that you

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.280
can establish a new set point.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.460
So if this is your
point, you're living

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.026
within this set of compensatory
mechanisms in your body.

00:31:36.026 --> 00:31:37.650
Now, you can get down
here, and you can

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.450
try to trick the metabolism.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.760
And you can say, OK,
well for every six days

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.120
that I'm living in the thing--

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.850
in the deficit to
get here, one day I'm

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.910
to give you what you want, which
is maintenance level calories.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.410
Or you could come
down here and say,

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.150
I'm going to live
two weeks here.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.970
And I'm going to give you two
weeks at maintenance calories.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.150
If I said to you, I had
somebody that just dieted down

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.030
over time for 16 weeks,
or I had somebody

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:05.770
that went two weeks, two weeks,
two weeks, two weeks, which

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.050
one do you think is going
to end up looking better

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.704
with 16 weeks of dieting?

00:32:10.704 --> 00:32:12.620
AUDIENCE: I mean, I would
think the first one.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.730
JASON PHILLIPS: You would the
first one, because they're

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.760
in a calorie deficit longer.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.370
This one-- and there's a
study; it's the MATADOR study I

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.170
referenced recently--

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.630
actually showed not
only more fat loss

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.994
but better metabolic health
at the end of that period.

00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:27.910
Now, mind you, this one
was double the length,

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.530
because it took
eight cycles of it

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.690
to achieve 16 weeks
of a calorie deficit.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.400
And perhaps, that's the reason.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.640
However, what scientists tried
to show with other earlier

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.800
studies and when diet
breaks were discovered--

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.620
or higher calorie days or
refeeds or whatever we've heard

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.525
out there--

00:32:42.525 --> 00:32:44.650
scientists tried to show,
well, how much fat do you

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.262
gain when you go off your diet?

00:32:46.262 --> 00:32:48.220
So they intentionally
took a number of subjects

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.930
that were on a calorie deficit.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.960
And they said, hey, we want
you to eat at maintenance level

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.120
for between one and six days.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.467
I think it was
something like that.

00:32:57.467 --> 00:32:59.800
They were trying to show that
you would rebound and gain

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.383
a significant amount
of weight because

00:33:01.383 --> 00:33:03.160
of these metabolic adaptations.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.493
Well, really all they showed
was that nothing really bad

00:33:05.493 --> 00:33:06.280
that happened.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.610
So really, part of a
structured dietary phase

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.350
should be returning
to maintenance

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.357
with some sort of frequency.

00:33:13.357 --> 00:33:15.440
This also comes down to--
we've touched on it last

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.930
I was here-- periodization.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.630
When I work with athletes, I
work on four different things.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:33.030
I work on pre-season, season,
post-season, and off-season.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.232
With athletes, that's
really easy to see.

00:33:35.232 --> 00:33:37.440
When I work with an athlete,
when they're right here,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.330
which a lot of CrossFitters
are right now--

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.746
I don't know if any of you
CrossFit, but you're in-season,

00:33:41.746 --> 00:33:43.180
because the open is happening--

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.630
your visible abdominals
don't mean shit.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.172
They've never put anybody on a
podium for how their abs look.

00:33:48.172 --> 00:33:49.671
We're in the Olympic
time right now.

00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:52.110
Nobody got a gold medal because
of how good their abs are.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:53.262
They got the best time.

00:33:53.262 --> 00:33:54.720
That's why they
get the gold medal.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.740
Those athletes--
they're in season--

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.540
should not give a
shit how they look.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.540
They need to go through
a very brief phase here,

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.657
because intense exercise is
very hormonally-demanding.

00:34:03.657 --> 00:34:05.490
So they actually need
a nutritional protocol

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.877
that addresses their hormones.

00:34:06.877 --> 00:34:08.460
Now, when you're in
off-season, that's

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.630
when you can worry
about your abs, when

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.050
you can go into a deficit.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:16.810
However, relative to the year,
this is only 25% to maybe 40%

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.380
if you have a
prolonged off-season.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.755
So you're only living in a
calorie deficit for this long.

00:34:20.755 --> 00:34:23.830
Now if every year, we can
achieve a little more fat loss,

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.650
now you're getting
here and maintaining

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.540
better metabolic health.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.350
So basically what
I'm trying to say

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.489
in a lot of fucking
words is, yes, you

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:34.560
need to go into a
calorie deficit,

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.199
but you need to control how
long you're in that deficit.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.050
And you have to have periods
of returning to maintenance.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.559
It must happen.

00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:43.350
So that could be periodic
refeeds, like one

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.150
or two high carbohydrate
days per week.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.190
That could be maintenance
week calories.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.260
That could be cheat days.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.264
There's a host of
way to get there.

00:34:51.264 --> 00:34:52.889
And then, I would
say, well, which fits

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.530
into your lifestyle the best?

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.534
And for people that think cheat
days sound super appealing,

00:34:58.534 --> 00:35:00.450
I can tell you when I
did my fitness modeling,

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.869
I did a diet where for
six days out of the week,

00:35:02.869 --> 00:35:03.910
I was in extreme defecit.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.580
I was on 1,800 calories.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.810
Sunday, I literally got
to eat whatever I want.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.010
And when I say
whatever I want, I

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.510
mean I got a frappuccino on my
way to Dunkin' Donuts on my way

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.340
to IHOP.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.620
That was how I started
my Sunday mornings.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.720
That sounds super
sexy and really fun.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.860
I'll tell you this.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.110
A lot of dieting is
psychological in nature.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.127
It created food
obsessions for me.

00:35:24.127 --> 00:35:26.460
The other six days of the
week, all I thought about was,

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.793
what am I going to do on Sunday?

00:35:27.793 --> 00:35:29.580
My training went to shit.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.580
My relationship went to shit,
because my only relationship

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.670
was with the pizza I was eating
on Sunday and that frappuccino,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.620
donuts, and IHOP.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.890
So we also have to observe
the mental attachments that we

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.390
build to our dietary protocols.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.039
That's super important as well.

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:45.330
Does that answer your question?

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:45.660
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.320
JASON PHILLIPS: Does
that clear it up?

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:46.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.059
Thanks.

00:35:47.059 --> 00:35:49.010
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes ma'am.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.860
AUDIENCE: So there is
a lot of discussions

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.560
out there how you should
make calorie count.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.750
JASON PHILLIPS: Really?

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.140
Who's having those talks?

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.515
AUDIENCE: I feel like there's
a lot of nutritionists that

00:35:59.515 --> 00:36:00.920
are against calorie counting.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.080
JASON PHILLIPS: Is
his name Gary Taubes?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.140
AUDIENCE: Well, like especially
with my MyFitnessPal,

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.300
there's all these
apps that are just

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.280
making you eat 1,200 calories
a day if you give your goal.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.590
So how do you balance knowing
when you're in a deficit?

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:18.570
Or I guess do you--

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:19.880
JASON PHILLIPS: Well,
that's the best question.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.963
I'll stop you right there.

00:36:20.963 --> 00:36:23.949
How do you balance knowing
when you're at a deficit?

00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:25.490
Do you know when
you're at a deficit?

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.740
If I told you today you
had to go out and consume

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.380
food and guarantee you're in
a deficit, could you do it?

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.339
AUDIENCE: Yes, I think.

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:33.921
JASON PHILLIPS: Do
you think you would

00:36:33.921 --> 00:36:36.000
be in too big of a
deficit and start leading

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.710
towards metabolic adaptation?

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.890
AUDIENCE: I have no idea.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:39.690
JASON PHILLIPS: So
I'm going to argue

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.670
that if I sent you out
into the real world

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.580
and I said you have to
100% eat in the deficit,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.040
you're probably going to eat
in a deficit that is greater

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.060
than 750 or 800 calories
under where you should be.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.340
That's what we refer to
as an absolute deficit.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.800
This man asked about the
rate of metabolic adaptation.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.600
You're going to
adapt super quickly.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.430
You're going to stop seeing
results super quickly.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:01.909
So this is where
tracking comes in.

00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:03.450
Do I think you have
to track forever?

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.370
100% no.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.200
Do I think every
single person that

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.690
undertakes a dietary protocol
at some point in their life

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.510
should track to create
a level of understanding

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.980
as to what they consume?

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.270
Yes.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:17.100
I think that you,
if you're working

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.340
with a really good coach,
should be brought into it gently

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.350
and should be taken
out of it gently.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.050
But it's an education
tool, and it's a resource.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.960
It should not be the cornerstone
that we're building dependence

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.280
on as a dietary culture.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.520
So when I'm educating
other nutrition coaches,

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.844
I'm teaching them how to
prescribe based on quantity.

00:37:34.844 --> 00:37:37.260
I'm also teaching them how to
transition their clients out

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.130
of that.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.480
Because listen, I don't want
to track my macros forever.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.130
My wife doesn't do that.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.410
My kids sure as hell
aren't doing that.

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.360
I can tell you as an
anorexic teenager,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.960
I would never allow my kids
to understand food quantity,

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.120
other than, hey, don't eat
the whole fucking pizza.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.027
That's what daddy does.

00:37:56.027 --> 00:37:57.360
But does that make sense to you?

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:57.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.970
JASON PHILLIPS: So
do I think that you

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.220
shouldn't count your calories?

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.310
Well, who are you?

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.440
Where are you in
your dietary phase?

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.000
What have you tried before?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.294
Can I show you that you're
only consuming 200 calories?

00:38:08.294 --> 00:38:09.710
Because eating 10
heads of lettuce

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:13.100
really isn't very many calories,
even though it's paleo, bro.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.280
Can I show you that the
whole jar of almond butter

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.860
has like 4,000 fucking
calories and that even

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.210
though it's paleo, that's
why you're getting fat?

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.660
AUDIENCE: A lot of TDE
calculations hinge on a lot--

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.720
on hard-to-measure--

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.157
hard-to-eyeball variables.

00:38:32.157 --> 00:38:32.990
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.104
AUDIENCE: How do
you establish a TDE?

00:38:36.104 --> 00:38:38.270
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.060
Total energy expenditure
definitely-- so it relies--

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.520
first of all, I gave
you the four factors--

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.520
basal metabolic rate,
exercise activity,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.380
non-exercise activity, and
thermic effect of food.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.900
There is nothing that
you're going to intake food

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.580
and instantly know
the thermic effect.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.050
There's nothing that's
you're absolutely

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.008
going to know the number
of calories you output

00:38:56.008 --> 00:38:58.700
in a day either directly through
exercise or from taking 10,000

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.510
steps.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:03.770
And we can only reasonably
estimate what your BMR is.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.780
A better way to figure
out how your current diet

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.370
is affecting you, assuming no
metabolic adaptations exist--

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.040
and that's a really
big statement.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.460
I think in the diet culture
today, a lot of books,

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.350
a lot of websites,
a lot of pop culture

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:21.980
is throwing out these dietary
facts with no caveats.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.320
Remember, every time that we
talk with the word "diet,"

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.278
we should always be
starting it with the words,

00:39:26.278 --> 00:39:28.114
"assuming all things normal."

00:39:28.114 --> 00:39:29.780
So assuming you're a
normal human being,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.840
assuming you haven't tried 10
million crazy fucking diets,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.880
and assuming your hormones
aren't suppressed,

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.230
we could probably
put you in a setting

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.730
where over the
course of seven days,

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.990
we could track your calories.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.480
We could look at how
your body reacted

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.920
to that seven-day average.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.960
And we could come
close to estimating

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.247
what that daily energy
expenditure would look like.

00:39:47.247 --> 00:39:48.830
That, truthfully,
is a much better way

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.980
of doing it than trying
to use some formula.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.070
Formulas are a great
place to start.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.681
But let's take somebody--

00:39:55.681 --> 00:39:56.180
let's see.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.004
Well, you eat a ton of food.

00:39:58.004 --> 00:40:00.170
Like this guy right here,
if we ran his daily energy

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:05.040
expenditure, it'd probably come
out to 2,600 2,800 calories?

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.050
2,800.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:09.470
He probably could consume 4,000
calories and not gain a pound.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:11.780
Well, according to total
daily energy expenditure,

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.340
he should gain
two pounds a week.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.040
So the formulas don't add up.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.690
So if we actually
look at real life,

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.444
I want to look at his food logs.

00:40:20.444 --> 00:40:22.110
Over the course of
seven days, if you're

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.330
averaging 4,000 calories,
you're not gaining a pound,

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.371
my new assumption is his
daily energy expenditure

00:40:26.371 --> 00:40:27.414
is 4,000 calories.

00:40:27.414 --> 00:40:28.830
If I'm building
him a deficit, I'm

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.060
building it off
of 4,000 calories.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.060
I'm not building it off
of some bullshit formula

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.590
that scientists
over the last god

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.450
knows however many years
have been building.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:41.280
Mad respect to them, because
what they do is super hard.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.740
It has laid the foundation of
science that we look at today.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.800
But science and
formulas are not always

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.600
going to add up in
real life application.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.190
And this is where,
honestly, it's

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.460
the crux of everything that I
teach and the crux of the book.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.250
When you get into it, real life
application says, well, yeah,

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.220
you should be able to
eat a ketogeneic diet

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.220
and lose tons of weight.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.080
If I went on keto, I
wouldn't lose a pound.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.790
My body needs
carbohydrates to thrive.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.080
Real life practical
application tells me that.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.632
Make sense?

00:41:09.632 --> 00:41:11.540
Yes, ma'am.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.790
AUDIENCE: How do
you know what your--

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.227
whatever-- what your
normal maintenance calories

00:41:17.227 --> 00:41:17.810
are every day.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.340
JASON PHILLIPS: Well, kind of
like what we just talked about.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.048
How do you know daily
energy expenditure?

00:41:21.048 --> 00:41:25.281
So the fastest way to do it
is to establish your BMR.

00:41:25.281 --> 00:41:27.530
You can do it Harris-Benedict
equation, Katch-McArdle.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.300
There's several different
formulas out there.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.716
Establish your basal metabolic
rate, and then, multiply it

00:41:31.716 --> 00:41:33.540
times an intensity factor.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.450
I believe the intensity scale--

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:39.260
correct me if I'm
wrong-- goes 1.2 to 1.9--

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.515
1.2 basically being somebody
that's super sedentary,

00:41:41.515 --> 00:41:43.280
and 1.9 being an
athlete training

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.071
multiple times per day.

00:41:45.071 --> 00:41:46.820
That's where you're
going to get your best

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.520
estimate from for a
daily energy expenditure.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.150
I still believe for people
out there that are educators

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.620
or that want to become
educators, that is the best

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.800
place to start if you don't have
access to seven days of a food

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.490
log.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.210
Let's be honest.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:01.620
If everybody in here hired a
nutrition coach, and they said,

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.570
hey, the first
thing you need to do

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:04.400
is log your food the next
seven days before I can even

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.290
prescribe you, you're
going be like, fuck,

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.342
can't we start yesterday?

00:42:08.342 --> 00:42:09.800
The reality is
you're going to want

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.640
to submit two days of food
logs, maybe one if you could,

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.780
or none.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.820
And you're going to
get started tomorrow.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.820
So as coaches, those of us
that coach in this space

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.420
will typically work on three.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.490
We'll run this formula.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.570
We'll see how it adds up.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.972
And we'll make our best
estimated guess from there.

00:42:25.972 --> 00:42:27.430
The reality about
coaching is this.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.555
And I'll out myself, and
I'll out every other coach

00:42:29.555 --> 00:42:30.620
out there.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.610
When we give you a prescription,
any dietary prescription,

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.850
it's our best educated
guess given the information

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:38.320
available to us.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.231
Any coach or any
nutrition resource

00:42:40.231 --> 00:42:41.980
or any authority in
the health and fitness

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.730
space that tells you they
100% have the solution for you

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.830
on day one is
completely full of shit,

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.560
and you should run the
other way very quickly.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.417
It is 1,000,000%
impossible to do, even

00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:55.500
as a practitioner in the
health and fitness space.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:42:59.237
Other questions?

00:42:59.237 --> 00:43:01.861
AUDIENCE: More general question
than the weight loss question--

00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:04.120
what are your thoughts on
daily water consumption?

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.786
JASON PHILLIPS: Daily
water consumption.

00:43:05.786 --> 00:43:08.474
Super simple formula-- this is
one where I'll use a formula,

00:43:08.474 --> 00:43:10.390
and it's reasonably
accurate across the board.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:12.306
I like to give people--
take their body weight

00:43:12.306 --> 00:43:14.150
in pounds, divide it by two.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.960
That will give you the number
of ounces you need to consume.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.910
I like to add 15 to
err on the higher side.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.500
So a 200-pound male
divided by two--

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.460
100 ounces.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.900
Add 15-- 115 ounces.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.434
That's just shy of a gallon.

00:43:24.434 --> 00:43:26.350
I would say that's pretty
reasonably accurate.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.320
Typically, that 15 accounts
for an exercise variable

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.010
that's in there.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.950
People will sweat.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.450
That's replacing
the amount of water

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.774
they're losing during exercise.

00:43:33.774 --> 00:43:35.440
If they're super
sedentary, I would just

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.271
body weight divided by two.

00:43:38.271 --> 00:43:39.270
Now, are you concerned--

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.570
I mean, there's lots of
effects of dehydration.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:45.340
We can see hormonal
downregulation.

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.110
We can see
performance detriment.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:49.120
We can see inability to focus.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.409
There's lots of negatives
about being dehydrated.

00:43:51.409 --> 00:43:53.200
Being dehydrated can
make you feel bloated.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.658
It can make it hard to eat all
of your calories in the day.

00:43:55.658 --> 00:43:57.700
It can make you feel
like shit from consuming

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.901
your foods, foods that
normally wouldn't affect you.

00:44:00.901 --> 00:44:03.400
So there's a lot of reasons not
to go into that dehydration.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.110
I always tell people it's
the very simplest thing

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.776
you can control.

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:08.440
Just pick up the bottle
of water and drink it.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:08.940
Make sense?

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:09.565
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:09.565 --> 00:44:10.887
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:44:10.887 --> 00:44:12.720
AUDIENCE: So you've
talked just a little bit

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.970
about protocols and about
the psychological effect

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:15.945
of dieting.

00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:21.500
Given that, how frequently
should people step on a scale?

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.460
JASON PHILLIPS: That's
a really good question.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.250
I think it comes
down to your ability

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.400
to understand the
scale as a data point.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.560
Again, what does
weight loss mean?

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:34.485
We know, relative to
osmotic fluctuations,

00:44:34.485 --> 00:44:36.860
water fluctuations in the
body, the scale, theoretically,

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.490
should shift
virtually every day.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.490
We're not going to be
able to ensure that you're

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.732
the same level of
hydration per day, really

00:44:42.732 --> 00:44:44.690
that you had the same
exact number of calories,

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.852
same macros.

00:44:45.852 --> 00:44:47.060
In a perfect world, we could.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.770
But even the number
of steps you take

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:50.936
per day and the amount of
sodium you intake per day,

00:44:50.936 --> 00:44:53.280
potassium, that's all
going to affect it.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.200
I think if you're looking at
the scale as the only determiner

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.710
of your success, you're
definitely doing it wrong.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.110
That being said, I
think that if you

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:07.100
can look at it as one data
point amongst several others

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.780
that we're looking
at for progress,

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.440
then I'm totally OK with
you doing it every day.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.750
So me as a coach, if I see
somebody get on the scale

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.900
and they freak out because it
went up 0.3 pounds one day even

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.000
though it had been trending
down for five days,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.400
I'm probably pulling their
ability to get on the scale

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.350
very frequently.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.810
That being said, I've been
in this space 15 years.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:27.920
I understand fluctuation.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.295
I get on the scale
every morning,

00:45:29.295 --> 00:45:30.467
and it doesn't bother me.

00:45:30.467 --> 00:45:33.050
So I think it really comes down
to understanding your maturity

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:36.230
with the process, your
psychological relationship

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.727
to the process, and
really how that's

00:45:38.727 --> 00:45:40.310
going to affect
things moving forward.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.170
Because honestly,
the scale can be

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.157
a driver of dietary compliance.

00:45:44.157 --> 00:45:45.740
If you like the way
it's going, you're

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.150
going to stay on your diet.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:48.950
If all of a sudden
you don't like it,

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.170
most people-- and this is
a very big generality--

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.503
but the truth is most people,
what are they going to do?

00:45:53.503 --> 00:45:55.130
They're gonna start
eating less food.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.380
Well, I can tell you 90%
of people that come to me,

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.940
I need them to eat more food.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.830
So they're actually going
to make the problem worse.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.070
So again, it's understanding
the relationship

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.190
that you have with it and
where that fits into your life.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:09.800
AUDIENCE: Could you touch on
some of those other measures

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.590
of success?

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:10.880
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.500
So we touched earlier
on biofeedback.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.080
So I'm always looking to
maintain a hunger response

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.475
throughout the process.

00:46:16.475 --> 00:46:19.100
I'm always looking to make sure
all biofeedback markers that we

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.810
gave earlier are positive.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:25.970
I also need you to get super
clear on what your goals are.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.700
One big thing I see-- and this
is really common in the space--

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.300
is people come to me and say,
well, I want to lose weight.

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.180
OK, great.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.254
Let me also tell you what
you're saying when you

00:46:34.254 --> 00:46:35.420
say you want to lose weight.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.770
Even though you didn't
directly saying it,

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.390
you're also saying these things.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.850
I'm OK with having
mildly less energy.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.760
I'm OK with having
reduced output in the gym.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:49.910
And I'm OK with occasional, if
not extreme or periodic, higher

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.969
levels of hunger.

00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:53.510
You're definitely
saying those things

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.410
when you say you
want to lose weight,

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.451
because those are functions
of a calorie deficit.

00:46:56.451 --> 00:46:58.280
Are we cool with that?

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.560
So the very first thing when
we have our conversation

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.435
and you tell me that,
I'm going to inform you

00:47:02.435 --> 00:47:03.632
of those three things.

00:47:03.632 --> 00:47:05.840
Now, if we've agreed on
that, we move forward, great.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.840
Then, I'm going to allow
those things to happen.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.070
The problem is you go
in the gym one day.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.909
And your back squat
went down by 15 pounds.

00:47:11.909 --> 00:47:13.700
And you come to me,
and you're like, Jason,

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.692
what the fuck happened?

00:47:14.692 --> 00:47:16.150
Well, I told you
on day one, you're

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.290
going to get a little weaker.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:18.831
It's just part of
being in a deficit.

00:47:18.831 --> 00:47:20.920
You don't have the fuel
or the subsequent recovery

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.545
to keep up with your
training modality.

00:47:22.545 --> 00:47:23.860
That's totally OK.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.630
So it's really
understanding the process.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:28.150
If we're strictly looking
at weight loss and that's

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.229
all that matters, great.

00:47:29.229 --> 00:47:31.270
We're going to do what it
takes to achieve weight

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.250
loss while keeping you healthy.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.057
Makes sense?

00:47:34.057 --> 00:47:34.640
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.300
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes, sir.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.140
AUDIENCE: If you're
more interested in,

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.020
say, strength to weight ratio--

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.770
JASON PHILLIPS: So
relative body strength?

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.456
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:43.456 --> 00:47:46.530
Is it best to try to control
your nutrition, then,

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.320
through macros or calorie count?

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.174
How would-- so you're not
increasing your performance--

00:47:52.174 --> 00:47:53.590
JASON PHILLIPS:
Definitely macros.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:55.290
AUDIENCE: --but
not gaining weight.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:56.170
JASON PHILLIPS: Like
I mentioned earlier,

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.350
when you put somebody
in a calorie deficit,

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:00.150
all you're creating
is weight loss.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.130
Really what you're
after in relative body

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.960
strength is fat loss.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.850
Because again, nobody
wants to get fatter

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:06.990
as they're losing weight.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.790
And that certainly can happen.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:10.170
There's McDonald's studies.

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.760
There's Twinkie
studies, things where

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.980
people ate in a deficit
only eating those foods.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.650
So we want to obviously
maintain as much lean tissue.

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.160
Remember, you're looking
for relative body strength.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.350
That requires you holding
onto your lean tissue,

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:23.850
because that's
what's actually going

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:26.340
to fire, create this
power output you need,

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.322
at a slightly lower body weight.

00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:30.030
Now, I would argue
this-- a lot of people

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:31.410
that are looking for
relative body strength,

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.660
they just don't fuel enough.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.200
So they're actually
not eating enough food

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.750
at their current body weight to
fuel the level of performance

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:37.440
they want.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.480
So I don't necessarily
want to pigeonhole you

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.190
into the thinking
that it's definitely

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:42.990
going to be a calorie deficit
that's going to get you

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.950
where you want to be.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.420
But to answer your
direct question

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.840
is 100% macros, not calories.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.900
AUDIENCE: Is there
a way, a route to--

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.950
if you have a adaptation
that you can fix that?

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.530
Like what's the route if you
have one and you're not sure?

00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:59.363
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:48:59.363 --> 00:49:02.490
So how does metabolic
adaptation become fixed?

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.106
That's a really good question.

00:49:05.106 --> 00:49:06.230
So you're a trainer, right?

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.720
The fundamental change the
human body from training

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.550
happens very simply.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.540
People come to you.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.240
As their trainer, you
impose a stress on them.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.370
You're hoping that they
have enough nutrition

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:21.200
and enough stress
management in their life

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.360
to facilitate adaptation.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.720
We lift a weight.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.669
The adaptation we create
is we get stronger.

00:49:27.669 --> 00:49:28.460
We lift the weight.

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.810
We break down the muscle.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:33.071
The adaptation we look
is to regrow that muscle.

00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:34.820
For people that are
metabolically adapted,

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.230
the stressors are way too high.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.590
So there's not enough calories.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:41.600
They're getting
too much training.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.700
Or let's look at
Western culture--

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.370
too much nervous system
stimulation from stimulants;

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:49.190
not enough sleep, so no
hormone replenishment;

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.410
too much stress at
their work, whatever

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:52.610
is going on in their house.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.850
Western culture is a
stressful fucking place.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:57.650
Then, we're tacking
on calorie deficits,

00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:59.750
and we're tacking on
training on top of that.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:01.460
The way out of
metabolic adaptation

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.690
is reduce the stressors.

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:03.860
That's the bare bones of it.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:04.956
Reduce the stressors.

00:50:04.956 --> 00:50:06.080
How do we reduce stressors?

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.940
We feed you more.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.820
The food with the greatest
impact on metabolic response

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.054
is going to be carbohydrates.

00:50:12.054 --> 00:50:13.970
So the hormones that
have likely downregulated

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:16.095
are going to be metabolic
hormones, leptin ghrelin,

00:50:16.095 --> 00:50:19.212
peptide YY, T4 T3 conversion.

00:50:19.212 --> 00:50:21.170
That's going to come
mostly from carbohydrates.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:22.070
We're going to try
to get you more

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.510
carbohydrates in your diet.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.670
We're also going to pull
back on your training.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.851
Yes, I just said even
though you want to lose fat

00:50:27.851 --> 00:50:29.600
and you're not eating
enough fucking food,

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.414
I need you to train less.

00:50:31.414 --> 00:50:33.830
That is hard for 90% of the
people to hear, right Heather?

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.400
HEATHER: Right.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.025
JASON PHILLIPS: It
is the hardest thing

00:50:36.025 --> 00:50:37.674
in the world to hear.

00:50:37.674 --> 00:50:38.840
But they need to train less.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.750
They have to stress less.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:42.400
I need them to sleep more.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.690
I need them to consume
adequate amounts of water,

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:46.421
because most of them don't.

00:50:46.421 --> 00:50:48.420
Then, we started going
into deeper rabbit holes.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.850
What's your food quality like?

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:51.297
What is your gut health like?

00:50:51.297 --> 00:50:53.630
Potentially, how is that
affecting your hormone profile?

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:54.950
Because again, if they're
metabolically adapt,

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.325
and they have been
for some time,

00:50:56.325 --> 00:50:58.070
there there's some
HPA axis depression.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.320
So we're also trying to
rebuild that hormone panel.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.615
But understand it's a long game.

00:51:03.615 --> 00:51:05.240
If you're metabolically
adapted and you

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.090
go into like a
reverse diet protocol,

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.610
we actually have an ebook
coming out on reverse dieting.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.950
We openly addressed there's
three ways that you're going

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.750
to respond to reverse diet.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.090
There are some hyper-responders.

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.420
They're lucky motherfuckers.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.357
You feed them more.

00:51:18.357 --> 00:51:19.940
You allow them to
keep their training.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.110
They lose weight.

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:22.982
We look like geniuses.

00:51:22.982 --> 00:51:25.190
I'm like, hey, I fed this
person 3,000 calories more.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.898
She got shredded.

00:51:25.898 --> 00:51:27.640
I'm so smart.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.330
There's people that don't
really respond that way,

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.950
but their bio
biofeedback gets better.

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.750
Perhaps body composition
gets a little better,

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.130
but there's no
real scale change.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:36.570
They just feel better,
and they get to eat more.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:37.500
That's great.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.550
Because at the end
of the reverse diet,

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:39.780
they go into active fat loss.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.680
They lose weight.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.670
Beautiful.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.630
And then, there's
people that gain weight.

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.910
And they can gain a
significant amount of weight.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.760
I worked with a
woman for 20 months.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.450
One year and eight months she
had to reverse diet with me.

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.460
She gained something
like 18 pounds.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.210
This woman was paying me
$500 a month to lose fat,

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:00.760
and I told her you need
to gain 18 pounds before I

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.970
can get you to lose fat.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:04.185
Fun job, huh?

00:52:04.185 --> 00:52:05.070
I've got a great job.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:07.970
But it's the only way to fix it.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:09.719
Like what am I going
to do, feed her less?

00:52:09.719 --> 00:52:11.479
She's already eating
like 700 calories.

00:52:11.479 --> 00:52:13.020
You want me to give
her 300 calories?

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.903
She was doing five
workouts a day.

00:52:14.903 --> 00:52:17.060
You want me to have her do 10?

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.680
Like it's just
not going to work.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.020
So it's always pulling
back on the stressors,

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.270
getting more food in,
getting more recovery.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:24.990
Food is just a
vehicle of recovery.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:26.040
It's not the food itself.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.096
It's the vehicle and
modality of recovery.

00:52:28.096 --> 00:52:29.720
And it's pulling back
on the stressors.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.609
Does that make sense?

00:52:30.609 --> 00:52:31.233
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:31.233 --> 00:52:33.550
JASON PHILLIPS: Awesome.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.771
Yes, ma'am.

00:52:34.771 --> 00:52:36.270
AUDIENCE: Going
back to the strength

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.920
question from earlier--

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.080
if strength is the
goal, how do you

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.260
know if you need to gain
more weight to get stronger

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.750
if you've kind of
plateaued in terms of PRs

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:46.710
and things like that?

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:48.210
JASON PHILLIPS: So
science would say

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:51.477
that more weight is always
going to give you more leverage.

00:52:51.477 --> 00:52:54.060
Scientific principles just say
more force is going to create--

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.130
or more mass is
going to more force.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:58.980
That's just relative
to strength principles.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.860
That being said, a lot
of strength athletes

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.540
have some vanity goals.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.540
They don't want to be a fat
slob just to push more weight.

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.060
Or they have weight classes
that they have to compete in,

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.700
so they have to be cognizant
of what their body weight gets

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.877
too.

00:53:12.877 --> 00:53:14.460
I think it's just a
determinant there.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.380
I mean, the truth is, you
can always eat more calories.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.660
And it should, in theory,
provide more output.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.810
And more body weight should, in
theory, provide more strength.

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:23.220
Again, that's scientific theory.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.340
I would argue in empirical
data that you're actually

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.150
looking to keep biofeedback
markers alive on the top end,

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:32.130
in a calorie surplus, just like
you are in a calorie deficit.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:34.260
I think that your body
functions most efficiently

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.680
in a relative calorie surplus,
so really just 500 to 750

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.520
calories above maintenance.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.520
I think that's where your body
functions the most efficiently.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.134
So it's just playing
the long game,

00:53:44.134 --> 00:53:46.050
understanding that
strength adaptation doesn't

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.260
happen overnight.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.150
I think a lot of people think,
oh, well if I 5,000 calories,

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:53.820
my back squat will go from 500
to 600 pounds in five weeks.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.860
It's just being realistic
about the goals.

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.390
I think most people
for-- if you can

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:01.166
add 40, 50 pounds on a squat
in a year, that's really good.

00:54:01.166 --> 00:54:03.540
But most people seem to think
that we're all super human,

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.780
and we can add 200 pounds
to our back squat in a year.

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.700
Let's see.

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.310
What else do we got?

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:12.680
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about the role of vitamins

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.510
and supplements in any of this?

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.220
There's so much competing
and sometimes conflicting

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:17.720
literature.

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:17.900
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.400
Do you have any
specific supplements

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.050
you want to ask me about, or?

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:23.810
AUDIENCE: Well, like
the B vitamins, D, C,

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.060
like the basic groups,
and then adapt divisions.

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.460
JASON PHILLIPS: And their
role in which specific goal?

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.680
AUDIENCE: Overall health,
some of the recovery

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.680
that you were talking
about, reducing stressors.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.263
JASON PHILLIPS: So
I think that having

00:54:34.263 --> 00:54:36.680
a good spectrum of vitamins
and minerals in your diet

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.210
is never a bad idea.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.860
When we look at any subset
of goals, be it performance,

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.780
be it aesthetics, and
obviously, be it health,

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.820
you're going to want to
have a broad spectrum

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.081
of micronutrient intake.

00:54:48.081 --> 00:54:50.330
That's going to give you the
best chance of longevity.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:51.996
When your body is
functioning optimally,

00:54:51.996 --> 00:54:53.540
it can lose fat faster.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.061
It can perform better.

00:54:55.061 --> 00:54:57.560
So I think that you're going
to a micronutrient-dense foods.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.870
That being said, from a
supplement standpoint,

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:02.060
I am a big fan of Vitamin
D-- supplemental Vitamin

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.310
D, around 5,000 units a
day for most individuals.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:08.096
The reason that I'm
so big on that is if--

00:55:08.096 --> 00:55:09.470
especially being
here in Chicago.

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.345
It's snowing outside.

00:55:10.345 --> 00:55:11.960
There's not a lot of sunshine.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.877
You're going to have
a 25(OH)(D) test done.

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:14.710
That's a blood test.

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:16.626
It'll tell you what your
Vitamin D levels are.

00:55:16.626 --> 00:55:19.580
Most people will be clinically
deficient or subclinical.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:23.450
So I think the reference range
is something like 25 to 90,

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:26.750
and most people will
come in at like a 35.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.530
We want you sitting
like 75 to 80.

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:30.860
So we'll supplement with
5,000 units of Vitamin D.

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.080
Now remember, Vitamin
D is fat-soluble.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.540
So you're not just going to
pee it out like a B vitamin.

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.990
I could load you with
B vitamins all day.

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:38.000
You'll pee out what
you don't need,

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.200
because it's water-soluble.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.750
Fat-soluble vitamins, there
is an upper level limit.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.810
There is a toxicity risk
with taking too much of them.

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:47.270
5,000 seems to be pretty safe.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:48.860
Vitamin C is one you mentioned.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.050
That can actually
help with HPA axis.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:53.090
So 1,000 milligrams of
Vitamin c taken at night

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:55.173
can actually help with
adrenal fatigue or HPA axis

00:55:55.173 --> 00:55:56.510
dysfunction.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:57.890
You know B vitamin complex--

00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:01.010
activated B vitamin
complex is definitely

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.615
helpful there as well.

00:56:03.615 --> 00:56:05.240
I think a lot of
people want to default

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.880
to these things as the fixes
instead of really addressing

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.380
the real underlying
problem, which

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.960
is the abundance of stressors
and the lack of recovery.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.080
People want to think they can
live in a 800-calorie diet.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.330
But because they take their
B-complex, all of a sudden

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:18.950
the world is a better place.

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:21.800
No, that just means you're
going to be out more B vitamins,

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.508
because you're not
taking in enough carbs

00:56:23.508 --> 00:56:25.340
to actually hold
that water anyway.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.340
Does that makes sense?

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.590
Does that answer the question?

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.530
I thought you were going to
ask me about fat burners.

00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:30.197
I'm like, yeah, let's
just get them all.

00:56:30.197 --> 00:56:31.654
Because that's what
everybody wants

00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:33.006
to talk about in supplements.

00:56:33.006 --> 00:56:34.479
AUDIENCE: Someone else can.

00:56:34.479 --> 00:56:35.270
JASON PHILLIPS: No.

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:37.110
That's not go down
that rabbit hole.

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:39.600
I'm mean enough.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.101
Yes, sir.

00:56:40.101 --> 00:56:41.850
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
gut health before,

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:42.900
which makes me think--

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:43.990
you know, all the
rage these days

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.406
is every meal should have
yogurt and kefir and [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:46.406 --> 00:56:48.850
bacteria supplements,
and all that stuff.

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:50.670
What stuff in that
space do you think is BS

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:52.320
and what is backed
by science and--

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.240
JASON PHILLIPS: So I'm
becoming more and more

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.020
against kombucha every day.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.710
Yeah, I know.

00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:59.251
Mind-blowing.

00:56:59.251 --> 00:57:01.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:05.040
So a lot of the live cultures,
especially in kombucha,

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.220
especially the commercial shit
that's very sugary that you're

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.560
finding at Whole Foods
that tastes so good,

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.672
is actually going to fee--

00:57:11.672 --> 00:57:14.130
like most of the time, it's
actually going to be a problem.

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.060
Because half the times when
you have gut health issues,

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:16.976
it's actually a yeast.

00:57:16.976 --> 00:57:18.160
It's not just the bacteria.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.326
Well, the cultures found
in the kombucha is actually

00:57:20.326 --> 00:57:21.340
going to feed the yeast.

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.197
So you're actually
making it worse.

00:57:23.197 --> 00:57:25.030
So 90% of people who
have gut health issues,

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:27.535
they do one kombucha,
things get better.

00:57:27.535 --> 00:57:29.410
And all of a sudden,
they start living on it.

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:31.680
If they develop a
yeast, it gets worse.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:35.040
Probiotics in general
are-- should be

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.920
more about acute consumption.

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.020
I don't believe they
have to be taken daily

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.460
for extended periods of time.

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:44.170
They are more about symptom
relief in the short term

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.357
than they should be about
long-term prevention.

00:57:46.357 --> 00:57:48.690
And this is where I think
that the nutritional world has

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:49.680
it wrong right now.

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:52.470
Mark my words-- in the next
year, two years, three years,

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:53.850
every supplement
under the sun is

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.170
going to claim to have
a probiotic in it.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.200
That being said, when
we recommend probiotics,

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.720
we recommend it
with 5 billion CFU.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.620
What you're going to see in the
supplements is maybe 1 billion.

00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:06.300
So that means they spent an
extra $0.07 per bottle adding

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.400
1 billion bullshit in there.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.130
That's what it's
going to look like.

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:15.960
In terms of yogurt and
kefir, I'm a fan of kefir.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:19.410
I'm not overly a huge fan of a
lot of the yogurt products that

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.430
are out there.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.430
Organic, full-fat yogurt
is a different story,

00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:24.186
but most people don't
want to go that way.

00:58:24.186 --> 00:58:25.560
Most of all want
like the Dannon,

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.400
like fucking sugar on the
bottom, because it tastes good.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.870
But I am a big fan of kefir.

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.680
I actually use it with a
lot of my high-end athletes,

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.450
especially my fighters.

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.046
So as their calories
got really low,

00:58:35.046 --> 00:58:36.670
it's a great source
of micros for them.

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:38.211
It's also keeping
their guts healthy.

00:58:38.211 --> 00:58:39.877
Any athletes I have
in a very heavy

00:58:39.877 --> 00:58:42.210
lactate-based environment,
I'm using a lot of gut health

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:43.840
protocols with them.

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.090
I think the reason that we're
seeing gut health become

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.298
such a big thing right now
is there's lot of research

00:58:48.298 --> 00:58:49.490
in the gut microbiome.

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:54.180
Naveen Jain is leading a lot of
that-- super intelligent dude.

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.760
But I also think we're seeing
the results of Western culture

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.330
the last 15, 20 years.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:58:59.490
We've lived on fast foods.

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:00.870
We've lived on low fats.

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.261
We've lived on processed foods.

00:59:02.261 --> 00:59:03.760
And remember, this
whole "if it fits

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:06.325
your macros" thing got super
sexy like eight, 10 years ago.

00:59:06.325 --> 00:59:08.700
And so people are saying they
can lose fat eating nothing

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.180
but Pop-Tarts which is true.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.859
I'm not going to dispute it.

00:59:11.859 --> 00:59:13.900
That being said, it's not
optimal for gut health.

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.080
So you're seeing people
achieve the results they want.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.090
Yet, they're claiming
their guts feel like shit,

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.548
and that's why it's actually
coming to the forefront today.

00:59:20.548 --> 00:59:23.190
I don't think that we've learned
anything overly new outside

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:24.360
of the microbiome stuff.

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.949
I just think we're
having to treat it

00:59:25.949 --> 00:59:27.990
relative to the environment
we've been living in.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:29.781
AUDIENCE: We have people
that want to bulk,

00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:31.230
and then, they want to cut.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:36.130
Do you believe it's
possible to cut fat and bulk

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:38.770
by doing excess protein?

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.080
JASON PHILLIPS: Whoa.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.150
Let me stop you, pump the
brakes before you even

00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.825
say excess protein.

00:59:42.825 --> 00:59:45.408
Do I think it's possible to cut
fat and bulk at the same time?

00:59:45.408 --> 00:59:47.590
The answer is no.

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:50.100
Unless your training
age is very low--

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.170
if your training age is
very low, if you just

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:54.500
began training, remember
what happens your first

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.750
six, eight months of training?

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:57.374
It's your brain that's
really adapting.

00:59:57.374 --> 00:59:58.485
It's not the muscles.

00:59:58.485 --> 01:00:00.360
You're creating neurological
adaptations more

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.830
than you are
physical adaptations.

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:04.740
Because of that, there's
a hypertrophy response,

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.327
regardless of caloric intake.

01:00:06.327 --> 01:00:08.160
So you could take
somebody that's brand new,

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.460
put them on a low-calorie diet,
have them shed the fat relative

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.660
to the low-calorie diet.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.250
Because of the
neurological response

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.874
stimulating hypertrophy,
they will also

01:00:15.874 --> 01:00:17.800
gain weight concurrently.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.790
But that happens in the absence
of tons of protein as well.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:24.240
The reason you have to
have adequate protein

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.430
in a calorie deficit
is because ultimately,

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.620
to create low
levels of fat loss,

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.850
you have to bring down
carbohydrates and fats.

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:33.502
Carbohydrates and fats are
protein-sparing nutrients.

01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:35.460
So when your protein-sparing
nutrients are low,

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.334
you actually have to
have more direct sources

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:38.490
of dietary protein.

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:40.950
So that being said, when
you're in a gaining phase,

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:42.630
if somebody is trying
to gain weight,

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:45.090
carbohydrates and fats are
obviously exponentially higher.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.800
You don't need as much protein.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.990
Because when carbs
and fats are high,

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:50.240
you're sparing the protein.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.860
So your rates of muscle protein
synthesis are much higher.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.870
That being said, I will say
some research is coming out

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:56.370
that there's evidence
higher protein

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:59.640
diets, even in a
surplus, are helping

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.990
stimulate an anabolic response.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.650
They are help stimulating muscle
protein synthesis even further.

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:07.050
That being said, I haven't
seen enough of those studies

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:09.790
to allow me to say,
yes, high protein and--

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:11.261
irregardless of
the time of year.

01:01:11.261 --> 01:01:12.510
Does that answer the question?

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:13.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:14.100
JASON PHILLIPS: OK.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:14.934
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:14.934 --> 01:01:16.100
AUDIENCE: Can you you ever--

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.124
JASON PHILLIPS: Can you
ever overdo protein?

01:01:18.124 --> 01:01:19.832
Yeah, if you're eating
too many calories.

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:26.630
Some people have a very
hard time digesting

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.030
very high levels of protein.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.700
So it's either-- it
becomes a gut health issue.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.740
So I guess the answer
is can you overdo

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:36.160
it relative to body weight
or body comp or GI health?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.747
Which piece are
we talking about?

01:01:37.747 --> 01:01:38.830
If it's body weight, yeah.

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:40.480
If you're eating too many
calories, even from protein

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.940
alone-- like the carnivore
diet, that's a new one.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.760
I would challenge people to go
and eat 4,000 calories a day

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.090
purely from meat.

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:51.620
That just wouldn't taste good.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.120
I like meat just
like everyone else.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.850
But fuck, even 4,000 calories a
day from filet mignon by itself

01:01:56.850 --> 01:01:59.890
is not going to be very tasty.

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.350
So I don't really comprehend it.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:06.500
Even the studies on carnivore
diet are, in my opinion,

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.000
very skewed.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.290
Because it's so new.

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:09.790
Understand this
about research-- you

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.456
could probably set
up a scientific study

01:02:11.456 --> 01:02:13.482
to prove anything you want.

01:02:13.482 --> 01:02:15.190
If you controlled the
variables properly,

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:17.340
you can pretty much
prove anything you want.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:21.370
So I would argue, yes,
there is negatives of it.

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.850
Very few people
are at risk for it.

01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:26.320
AUDIENCE: How do you feel about
vegetarian and vegan diets?

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.285
JASON PHILLIPS: [SIGHS]
Are we still recording?

01:02:29.285 --> 01:02:31.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:35.060
I'm not a fan.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.640
So I think a lot of people
are going, right now, vegan

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.050
as a method of weight loss.

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:43.200
Again, cut out all the sources
of protein in your diet,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.945
and it probably adds
up to 800 calories.

01:02:44.945 --> 01:02:48.440
If you're eating 150 grams of
protein a day as a female--

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.936
600 calories, 200 grams a
meal, it's 800 calories.

01:02:50.936 --> 01:02:53.310
Cut out 800 calories of your
diet, what the fuck happens?

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:54.330
You lose weight.

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:57.070
It's just not that hard-- same
as fasting and same as keto,

01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:01.707
same as everything we talked
on earlier in the lecture.

01:03:01.707 --> 01:03:03.290
I think it's great
to encourage people

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:04.550
to get more micronutrients.

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:05.990
But that being
said, you are going

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:09.590
to lack an abundance of
micronutrients and amino acids

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:10.470
that are critical.

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:14.000
So there's a set of amino acids
called essential amino acids.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.470
We cannot produce those.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.420
You have to get
them from your diet.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.460
Vegan and vegetarian
diets are very

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.344
low in essential amino acids.

01:03:21.344 --> 01:03:22.760
Yes, you can
supplement with them.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.770
Do I feel like your diet
should lack anything

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:25.936
you have to supplement with?

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:27.500
No, I don't.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.980
I believe it's a
personal choice.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.410
I work with some vegan clients.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:33.050
One of my WWE
wrestlers is vegan.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:33.770
It's her choice.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:36.697
I try every week to
get her to eat meat.

01:03:36.697 --> 01:03:38.030
But we haven't gotten there yet.

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:39.280
Yesterday, she almost gave in.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.890
So the animal meats relative
to the other sources of protein

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:46.010
are still going to give
you higher concentrations

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:49.500
and appropriate concentrations
of essential amino acids.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.160
So you're getting a lot
of incomplete proteins.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.440
And so not to say that
the incomplete proteins

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.480
with consumption of other
foods don't ultimately

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.470
make complete proteins.

01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:58.344
I'm not arguing that.

01:03:58.344 --> 01:03:58.850
I get that.

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:01.308
All the science zealots will
be like, oh, blah, blah, blah.

01:04:01.308 --> 01:04:01.894
But I get it.

01:04:01.894 --> 01:04:03.560
That being said,
you're just not getting

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.590
a high enough concentration
of essential amino acids.

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:07.610
You're also not getting
a wide variety enough.

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:10.700
There's also so many
other trace nutrients

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.350
they are missing out on.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.650
That being said, it's a great
way to reduce inflammation.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:19.830
Because most of the fats in
animal products are omega-6.

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:22.014
Omega-6 are pro-inflammatory.

01:04:22.014 --> 01:04:23.430
The reason people
take fish oil is

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:25.500
to get higher
concentrations of omega-3.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.130
We currently live
in Western culture,

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:30.660
which we live in about a 1 to
20 omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.370
That's very pro-inflammatory.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.700
If we can reduce that closer
to 1 to 10, that's optimal.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.100
If we can get one to two,
that would be amazing.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.340
I don't think anybody can.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.480
But if we can get 1 to 10,
that's very anti-inflammatory,

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.980
which is why you
see a lot of people

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.600
go plant-based to
reduce inflammation.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.762
That absolutely has merit
and has a lot of success.

01:04:48.762 --> 01:04:50.470
Well, I hope that
answers your questions.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.370
I hope I gave you guys a
lot of different routes

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:56.460
to start thinking about
your dietary protocols from.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.460
Hopefully, you walk away
from your understanding

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.731
there's no one diet that
you should be undertaking.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:04.230
You should really be looking
at yourselves, your lifestyles,

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.969
your likes, your desires,
your food preferences.

01:05:07.969 --> 01:05:09.510
All of those things
should definitely

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:10.830
impact the way that you eat.

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:13.740
If it's not something you can
sustain for months and years

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.560
at a time, don't even
try it for a week.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.659
It's just not worth it.

01:05:16.659 --> 01:05:19.200
It's just going to send you down
a really gnarly rabbit hole.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.707
Even if it creates success,
that's probably worse for you,

01:05:21.707 --> 01:05:23.790
because you are going to
undertake it eight weeks.

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:25.440
And then, it's gonna send you
really in a bad direction.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.905
So understand yourself.

01:05:26.905 --> 01:05:28.280
Understand your
relation to diet.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.182
Guys, I'm super thankful,
Katie, to you, to everybody here

01:05:31.182 --> 01:05:32.640
at Google for
bringing me back out.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.098
This the third year I've been
fortunate enough to come out.

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:37.230
I always get super emotional
at the end of talks.

01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.510
You know, guys, I was
an 18-year-old anorexic.

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:43.830
It's super humbling to stand on
a stage at a place like Google

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:45.960
to speak to educate you
on something that I'm

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.020
so passionate about on something
that's truly changed my life.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.582
I take it massively seriously.

01:05:50.582 --> 01:05:52.290
I flew up today, and
my wife is pregnant.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.340
She's going to give
birth any day now.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.780
So super excited about that.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.790
But I'm always
humbled to be here.

01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:01.080
So I just want to thank you guys
very sincerely for coming out.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.160
Really appreciate it.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.510
[APPLAUSE]
