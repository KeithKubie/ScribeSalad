00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.599
Hey guys

00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.189
We're back today with another experiment that I'm personally excited about and been looking forward to for a couple of months

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.010
I went picked up a couple of bags of marbles from the Dollar store

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.880
And I'm bringing it back my mini Arc Furnace

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.979
because I'd like to bring the two together and see if we can get those marbles to melt

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.990
So you probably remember from a previous project,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.809
We took a piece of refractory brick and cut it to form a mini Arc furnace. This thing's capable of withstanding temperatures over

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.389
3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and possibly even more. Now something that I haven't really played with yet

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.090
But I've seen popping up a lot in the comment is to make glass

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.959
But before I actually make glass I wanted to try melting it first just to make sure we had

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.980
capability. So the purpose of this experiment today is to take some of these glass marbles,

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.769
strike up a ripping hot electric arc powered by my homemade Arc welder, and bring the two together to see if we can actually get

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770
electricity to melt glass.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.520
Now some of you faithful long-term viewers will remember that the electrodes I use on its Arc furnace are

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.378
carbon rods that I pull out of Lantern batteries. And unfortunately I used my other ones up and threw them away,

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.288
so we're going to need to start this project by harvesting a new batch.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.779
And there we have it guys. With that very simple lantern battery hack, we now have ourselves four black carbon electrodes

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.809
that should work perfectly for this mini Arc furnace.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.300
Now we can pretty much put these up and use them as is. But the problem

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.240
is they've got this goopy stuff on the ends from where they're capped off at the top.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.910
But I find the quickest and easiest way to clean this goop up

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.960
is simply to strike an arc and let it burn for about five seconds.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.410
Just be careful not to breathe in the fumes because the smoke is toxic.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.559
Alright guys, so our carbon electrodes are now prepped and ready. Everything is good to go so at this point

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.219
let's just take one of our white marbles place it down inside the furnace and strike an arc

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.589
just to see if we can actually get it to melt. And I think the chances of that happening are quite high. And I did

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.149
make a lid for my arc furnace so it can go on top and help contain the heat. However this first experiment

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.500
I'd actually like you to see the Arc.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.469
So I'm going to leave the lid off, strike our Arc, and then turn it so that it

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.649
splashes downward over top of the marble. Let's watch what happens

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.090
oh

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.140
Wow ok, I'm going to stop it right there because that's only been ten seconds and I can already see that the glass is melting.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.140
I'm gonna pull it out for you to can see.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.400
Oh my goodness! That's ten seconds in the Arc furnace, guys! That is crazy!

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.290
This is kind of cool and very encouraging. Our marble is only in the arc furnace for 10 seconds

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.380
It melted in half and then when I went to grab it with my needlenose pliers it actually conformed to the shape of the pressure

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.249
So it's already moldable at ten seconds. Lets see what it will do in a minute

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.249
[buzzing sound of arc]

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:12.759
Okay, so I actually only went to 25 seconds and look at that. It is completely molten. That is crazy! And stick a screwdriver in there

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.959
Wow, that is Molten glass!

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.519
Liquefied glass in 25 seconds. Look at that! And it's still hot enough I can sculpt it around

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.519
Lets see if I can pull a little bit of that out

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.370
Ah, that's super cool

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.819
Well mini Arc furnace versus marbles apparently no problem at all. So for this next experiment

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.569
Let's grab five more marbles and see if we can melt them all together at the same time

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.980
Check that out! That has gone completely molten

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.110
Hahaha, those marbles are nothing, but a molten sea of glass right now, look at this

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.960
ohh gosh, that is cool

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.349
That is like Lava look at that look at that

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.480
It's like liquid glass putty. Except It's actually glass what?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.140
It's starting to harden up here at the top. Look I can pull it. He form strands and fibers. Oh my

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.950
ah

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.879
Look at that. I made a nice long fiber there by pulling it

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.310
Well guys it seems to work pretty well

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.679
We just took down five marbles in less than a minute

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.790
And when I stuck my screwdriver in there and start pulling it out. You could see it was actually very

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.890
Liquidy like I could pull it up

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.699
I could stir it around. They kinda had the same viscosity as liquid chocolate or liquid silicone before I kieres up I also tried dipping

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.219
The tip of my screwdriver and pulling it up as high as I could get it they made this nice long strand of glass fiber

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.470
No where I'm going with this?  That's right, this right here is a homemade piece of fiberglass now

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.980
It's only one piece you can see how flexible it is if you flick it with your finger

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.160
You can see it bounces up and down

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.630
It''s got a surprising amount of flexibility to it unlike a sheet of glass which would just crack if you try and bend it, so fiberglass seems to

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.020
have different properties than a sheet of glass, interesting! But one final experiment lets take a whole handful of these colored decorative marbles

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.429
and try melting them down. These are yellow, green, teal, little bit of purple in as well

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.290
It'll be interesting to see the result after they've been melted and mixed.. man that thing is full

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.580
And you know what I might do to conserve a little bit of energy is put the lid on this time and we can get

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.580
them to melt even faster

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400
okay, i'm gonna pull them out

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.908
Wow, that's cool. When I take the lid off here so you see inside

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.439
oh that's beautiful

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:17.000
Looking at the lid here. You can see how toastie hot that got. I'd like to heat that from the top now to get it a little warmer

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.620
Oo I'm actually underneath the Molten glass. Can you see that?

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.490
oh wow that's cool

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.250
Cool, all right. Let's stop there and take a look

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.650
That's cooling down fast but there are 
pockets in there that are super hot. Look in there! Wow looking down inside, it was almost white hot there

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800
Wow it  just keep going and going

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.840
What! This stuff is amazing! Cools down very quickly, but it pulls like putty

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.280
Be good if i could break that tip off

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:12.008
Wow, that's crazy. It looks like some kind of a Lava pit Monster from the nether realm

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:18.369
And look how all the colors are blended together here to form this charcoal gray. It almost looks like a paint

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:25.000
Oh it's kinda smokey in here. Does glass burn? We did it guys we melted that whole handful of marbles within about a minute

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:26.259
Maybe a minute and a half

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.999
But it didn't take much at all. You can see when I tried pulling it out with the head of the screw driver, it made these

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.459
nice long glass strands which are very very brittle. But what I found was amazing about

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.909
This is it pulled almost like putty. If you were to stick a screwdriver in

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.329
Something like silly putty stretch it, it has about the same consistency

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:47.769
The difference is that after this sets, it's as hard as glass

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.960
Which is exactly what it is. It's also very sharp and very pointy. Now just for fun

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.909
I'm going to break down these shards, melt the glass one more time, and then take a glob of that molten material and just drip it

00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:01.389
Into a glass of water just to see if we can get anything cool to happen

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:10.939
It shattered didn't it?  A million pieces

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:21.359
Got it on the side of the glass. Oops I missed! I was trying to melt down some of this glass and drip it into the

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.050
Water but I actually missed and it dripped down the side of the glass instead

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.389
Which is hilarious because now it's actually fused with the glass and become part of it

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.509
That's crazy. It's also warmed up the water quite a bit as well. Oh

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.720
No, it just chips right off

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.430
I just knocked it off

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.999
But it looks like it was welded to the glass because the left a little pockmark there when it fell off

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.670
Alright guys bonus experiment since this arc furnace seems to be taking down glass without any problem at all

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:52.769
I thought it would be fun to try striking an arc and just running one electrode on the inside of the glass and the other on

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:58.949
The outside just to see how quickly it would melt the edge. So let's fire it up for one more experiment to see what happens

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.100
Arc furnace versus drinking glass, here we go

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.520
Wow

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.299
Look at that! That is crazy!

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.900
That was amazing. What I tried doing was holding one electrode

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.900
just on the edge of the glass itself and

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.550
Using the heat and the flame to kind of direct it down side, and what it did is it made almost like an improvised

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.120
plasma cutter for glass. You can see it took that thing no problem

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.289
Now as the thing is cooling it is cracking and spattering and spewing glass all over

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.729
We do have this really cool looking molten drop down the side here though. That was so much fun

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.090
I'm going to try it one more time on the opposite end then we can call it a day

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.279
So quick summary of what we did here today

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:28.719
We started off with the purpose of seeing if we could use high amperage electricity to melt glass

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:35.109
We took one single marble and exposed it to an electric Arc in the mini Arc furnace and found that not only did at melt

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:40.360
Glass but it melted it within seconds. So we threw in five more marbles and melted them in less than a minute

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:45.698
We threw a whole handful of colored marbles in there and melted them down to a bubbly liquid Lava type soup

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.729
We also found that if we suck the tip of the screwdriver in there and slowly pulled it out the glass acts like putty and

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.230
If we stretched out high enough and fast enough it would thin out into little strands of Fiberglass

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:59.529
We tried dripping a glob of Molten glass into a cup full of water

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:01.279
But it missed and landed on the side

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:05.799
Where it solidified and fused into the side wall. And when we removed it, it left a little crater behind

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.540
For our last experiment

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.259
We drew out one more juicy arc and tested it in the side of a common drinking glass

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.560
Where we found the electrodes almost form an improvised glass cutting

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:20.349
Plasma torch where the glass flows away like butters. These are very cool experiment and very satisfying to see the results

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.350
We now have the power to melt glass

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:25.959
Thanks for joining me for this video guys. I'll be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.440
Because now we have the power to melt glass
