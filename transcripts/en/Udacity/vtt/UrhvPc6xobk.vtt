00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; So Isabelle, what input sources did you come up with?

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.882
&gt;&gt; Well the first one would be the light sensor.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:06.040
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.750
&gt;&gt; The accelerometer, the gyroscope the compass, and the fingerprint reader.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.360
&gt;&gt; That's a great list. Some Android devices

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.370
have more sensors, some have fewer sensors. But

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.760
the important thing to note is that, these

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.950
sensors are not available, typically, on web and desktop.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.490
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.830
&gt;&gt; Which is what makes Android such an amazing platform

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.590
to create really amazing experiences on. And in the rest

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.810
of the lesson, we're going to tell you how

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.560
to use these sensors and create really awesome maps.
