The only one that passes is peach. If I pick up where I left off, and click

00:00:03.438 --> 00:00:08.130
enter, I get that the syllables in all of these words is 1. But peach is the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.056
only one for which that's actually correct. Hello and yellow should both have

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:14.427
two syllables.
