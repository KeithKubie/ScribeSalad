00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.100
So today, we've talked about formal
logic in order to set up a kind of

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.890
formal language for
us to reason with going forward.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.850
We started off by talking about formal
notation, including conjunctions and

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.540
disjunctions, so that we can
write sentences in formal logic.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.580
We use that to then talk
about truth tables, and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.430
exam some of the properties that we need
going forward, like De Morgan's law.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.240
Using that,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.530
we investigated some of the inferences
that we can draw using formal logic.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.310
And finally, we looked at proof by
reputation which kind of capitalizes on

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.490
everything we've talked about so far.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.990
Next time, we'll be discussing planning,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.900
which leverages the formal logic
that we've developed in this lesson.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.170
It allows agents to reason more
formally about initial and goal states.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.970
Interestingly, planning actually has its
history in the kinds of proofs we've

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.010
developed here.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.890
Originally, agents would prove that
a particular plan would work, so

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.420
that's why we talk about formal
logic before we talk about planning.
