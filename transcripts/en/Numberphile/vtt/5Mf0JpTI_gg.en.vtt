00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Sometimes you see, once you've spotted this you'll see it everywhere.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.100
In graphic design you'll sometimes see a design

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.040
with like, three or more gears that are supposed to be meshing together

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.660
sometimes what you see

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.060
I-I guess I'll draw just sorta wheels like this

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.180
but they are supposed to have teeth like this

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.080
and then there will be another one here

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.360
and another one here

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.540
and this is supposed to be like

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.200
y'know three things that are working together

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.240
the students and the teachers 
and the parents all come together

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.700
to make this school work fantastically, or whatever it is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.480
and you look at this thing

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.300
and if you think about what happens with gears

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.080
alright so-so if this one is going this way

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.020
then because these two the teeth are meshing this way

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.140
this one has to go this way

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.980
so that they, you know, because they have to turn against each other

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.100
and then whats this one supposed to do?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.260
this one is saying that it's supposed to go around  that way

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.900
and this one is supposed to [be] saying it's supposed to be going around this way

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.400
so nothing works, and so your school district grinds to a halt, or whatever it is.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.200
If you happen to have a British two pound coin and you look on the back of it, you'll see there is this design

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.040
with gears, and various other things about technology and the industrial revolution

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.580
So, if you look closely, there's like 19 --well if you count them--

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000
I guess you can't look and immediately count 19

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.940
But if you count them, right, there's 19 of these gears and 19 is odd

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.260
So like it goes this way, it goes this way, it goes this way

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.800
Odd means that it wont work. So, you know, your symbol of technological process, or whatever; it doesn't move.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.660
So the question is, well, how do you get three gears that do move?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140
Is there a way to change the shape?

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.440
Like, you can't do in the plane, but if you go out of the plane, then what can you do?

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.380
So here's a few mechanisms that shows ways you can make this to go

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.340
So, these are, like worm gears. 
You get this, sort of, screw helix thing

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.460
And then the way that they work... Well you can see that it works and they are all, sort of, symmetrical around...

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.060
Let's see, maybe if you look directly down here, you can see that there is a symmetry between them.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.220
RIght, so these three, sort of, worm gears... Because the way that they interact,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.520
they don't have a direction in the same way as planar gears do (gears just on the plane)

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.720
and so you can get them to all work like this

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.940
although you do require this frame.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.920
So this is another solution to the problem. It wasn't really a problem that needed solving, but there you go!

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.920
So this is, again, it's three gears that turn together, and they are, sort of, meshing with each other.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.240
They have this other weird feature that they're all linking with each other. So they're sort of linked gears.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.540
They stay in place. You can't actually turn one of them without turning all of them at once.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.560
It doesn't move.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.220
It's me and Saul Schleimer, it a guy who I work with these things.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.340
So we made this thing and immediately people say

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.300
"Okay. Sure. You can make it go. But can you, like, drive it with a motor?"

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.620
And then, what we ended up figuring out is, like... So here's another, sort of, helical worm screw thing

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.620
and then. Whoops. So you can see that it's sort of climbing down and as it's going, it is making them go.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.200
So, to answer the question about how do you make it drive itself...

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.760
So here's this, sort of, base that you can put it on.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.980
And the gears just sort of slide in there. And then, if you pull this through, then it makes it go.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.280
Or if you just turn it.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.360
This helix thing turning is, sort of, the same thing as moving it, as translating it

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000
So, if you turn it, it makes the gears go.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.660
Or if you push it through, it also makes the gears go.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.600
*grinding sound*

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.120
This is, sort of a... ...another variant on that same idea.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.000
These gears aren't rotating gears, they are, sort of, sliding gears.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.520
All of these have, like a, an axis of symmetry. So, there you go.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.420
So... *scoff*

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.960
So these... I mean you can see these teeth that make it do that.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.780
Let's see if I can do this weird thing. Let's see. So...

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.740
So the illusion, if I move it just right, is that the one I'm not holding doesn't move.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.060
I don't know if you're getting that. So the one that I'm not touching is supposed to sort of hover in the mid air

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.540
And while the other ones move. It's, sort of, a weird effect because...

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.460
...cause it doesn't look like I'm directly controlling it.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.020
I don't know how good I'm doing that.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.780
You can fix this in post, right? You can just stabilize on it?

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.520
Then you'll be fine! Right?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.220
Brady: *giggles*

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.040
...of the gaps between the primes as well. You see that some are short...

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.860
*ticking*

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.080
Oh, that was nice! That was satisfying! A nice long gap. It's really nice!

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.440
I mean, it's a bit of silly fun. There is no practical use to anything, but I love it!

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.660
*ticking*
