When we look at an apple like this we
don't necessarily think of beauty, we

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.880
think of what's happening to the apple,
but I'm a mycologist by training so what

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.339
I look at this, when I look at this I
think, gee, look at all that spore

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.880
production there, look at all that's
going on with that apple.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.180
Rotten apples seems like an odd thing to
come out and look at, but these are a set

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.920
of models that were part of a series
that the Blaschkas did. They illustrate

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.680
the diseases of plants, they are blown
glass, and they're painted and they're

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.540
colored, they're fantastic
representations of what the real things

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.500
look like.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.020
For me it's looking at these and
realizing that if I zoom in I bring out

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.480
my microscope and I look at these, there's
fantastic structures to be seen; we have

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.590
one model that is particularly
instructive in that way it's called

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.900
Aspergillus; it's a glass model of a
fungus and if you kind of let yourself

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.680
think about this it's almost like
walking through a forest, it's so

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.540
beautiful the way in which it's arranged
and it shows these developmental stages

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.620
of how the spores are formed.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.660
These models are part of a kind of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.100
experimental series with Rudolf
Blaschka where he was using different

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.560
techniques and different classes; in some
cases the the glass had a kind of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.759
effervescence on the surface of the
apple and so each of these was cleaned

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.270
to remove that powdery coating and then
they were painted and touched up so that

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.800
they are really kind of the apple of our
eye, we can look at them and appreciate

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.910
them as objects that are both the model
and they remind us of apple pie, of candy

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.280
apples, and all those wonderful things.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.320
We think of the museum as being a
primary way in which Harvard research

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.350
and activities can be presented to the
public and in an exhibit like this, which

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.770
we think is topical and important for
people to realize about food security

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.770
and food sources, it's another way to
reach out and reach the public and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.290
because of its beauty, because of the
rarity of these models, and because of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.690
the stories that we can tell around the
apples and their diseases, we think that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.980
the public will leave with a broader
appreciation of both museums and biology

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.360
of plants.
