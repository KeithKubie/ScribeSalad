1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,390
Sometimes bad things,

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:08,391
horrible things happen to good people and

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,890
I don't, I don't know why,

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,703
but

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,490
life isn't fair that that's,

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,550
that's the reality and disease like
cancer and ms and horrible diseases and

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
accidents and these things.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,320
A good person in the wrong place

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,850
in the wrong time can
end up just a victim of,

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,660
of, of feet and,

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,390
and of reality.

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,530
And it can be horrible
and heart wrenching,

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,013
but

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,150
when those bad things happen,

15
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,143
okay

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,180
to people around you,
what are you going to do?

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,670
How are you going to lead?

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,770
Are you going to get angry or
do you going to get frustrated?

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,570
Are you going to lash out at people who,

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,400
who are you going to lash out at anyways?

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,760
Are you going to start going
down the spiral of negativity?

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Are you going to let this horrible
situation dictate the way you feel and the

23
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:50,470
way you handle it?

24
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,150
Are you gonna fall over and
fall down and fall apart

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,960
or or are you going to lead?

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,400
Are you going to face
this issue with courage,

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,710
with resolution?

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,470
I say lead, lead,

29
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,830
step up to the challenge.

30
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,100
Be the one that other people look to

31
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,220
absorb that impact.
Absorb that negativity.

32
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,990
Draw fire, draw fire. That's,

33
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,000
that's when a member of a platoon for
for tactical reasons steps into the open

34
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,680
to draw enemy fire.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,830
Maybe to give another part of
his team the chance to move or,

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,850
or distract the enemy. But
that's what I say, draw fire,

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,550
bring that pain to me. I can handle it

38
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,640
when, when, maybe others cannot.

39
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,190
And when, when bad things are happening,

40
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,600
I am going to try and
be the one good thing.

41
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,670
The thing standing tall
that can be relied upon

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,200
because I know that that
attitude will spread.

43
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,420
It will bolster those around me and,

44
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,730
and we will fight.

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,420
And in fighting we will win.

46
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,590
And if not the battle, and if not the war,

47
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,670
we will win because our spirit,

48
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,320
it will never surrender

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,333
in that

50
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,410
that is the ultimate victory to hold your
head high and even even in the face of

51
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,110
inescapable defeat

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,190
to stand and to fight,

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,870
that is to win.
