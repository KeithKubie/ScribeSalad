00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.670
I just made a decorative floating shelf for
my bedroom, and a matching shelf for my wife.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.319
But these ones aren’t just for looks.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.849
Slide a couple knick knacks into just the
right positions, and you’ll discover there’s

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.589
quite a bit more to them, than meets the eye.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.080
Concealment shelves, aren’t a new idea, But rather than spending hundreds of dollars
to get one myself,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.800
I wanted to see if I could create a “Stealthy” design of my own. And here’s what I came up with.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.360
These “Stealth Shelves” are high quality
pieces of furniture that’ll compliment your

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.810
home decor, but will also hide a spare set
of keys, passports, or any spare cash, you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.550
might not want the general household knowing
about.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.440
If your kids need a break from phones and
video games, a secret shelf like this is a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.660
great way to make those devices, virtually
disappear in just an instant.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.820
The secret to the “Stealth Shelf” design,
is a pattern of powerful magnetic locks hidden on the inside.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.900
Set a few choice decorations in exactly the
right places, and the secret compartment clicks

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.220
open, giving instant access to sweets, treats,
or even defensive firearms the moment you need them.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.600
You can find magnetic locks these at any local
hardware store, sold as child safety locks for kid-proofing your cupboards.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.780
And I’ll put a link to where you can get
them in the description.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.360
Now the shelf is still a shelf, and works
great for showcasing pictures, or displaying random trinkets.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.660
And can handle a good amount of weight because
it screws directly into the studs in your wall.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.300
You can customize the shelf with any feature
you want, or stay on the simple side and build

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.079
a basic version for as little as $35.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.519
Keep an eye out for my next video because
I’m going to show you step-by-step, how to make your own.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.600
I designed mine so when the secret compartment
drops open, a little motion activated LED

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.590
turns on, lighting up the interior, like a
display case.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.080
But this detachable light also doubles as
an instant flashlight, in case the power goes out,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
and can help locate dangerous intruders
in the dark.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.819
The back of the light is magnetized as well,
so it clicks right back into position when

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.319
you’re done, and automatically shuts off
15 seconds later.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.939
Now despite how easy it is for you to open,
it’s very unlikely that thieves or kids

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.899
will find their way in, and here’s why.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.979
By studying the shelf from the outside, there’re
really no obvious feature that’ll give it

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.990
away as a secret safe in the first place.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.509
And since we made it ourselves, we’re the
only ones that know the secret magnetic combination.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.689
Not to mention if you use multiple locks in
multiple locations, it’ll make cracking

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.180
the code exponentially trickier.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.060
Well now you know how beautiful and functional
decorations like these, can also serve as

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.429
stealthy storage containers.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.489
To keep important items out of sight and out
of mind, but still give quick and easy asses

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.160
to them, the moment they’re needed.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.940
So go ahead and try making a “Stealth Shelf”
for yourself, and revel in the satisfaction

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.480
you’ll get from the secret power and security,
you’ve got hidden inside.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.920
Well that’s it for now.  If you liked this project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
