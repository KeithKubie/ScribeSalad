CHUMLEE: So what do we have here
today?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.500
I have a talking
Herman Munster doll.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.960
OK.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.040
I restore vintage talking
dolls from the '60s.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.210
All right.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.290
Do you mind if I
take a look at it?

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.380
No, go right ahead.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.040
Do you know when
this came out?

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.040
1964

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.000
1964, OK.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.170
I know he spent several hours
every day doing the makeup,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.670
and they actually made this flat
part of his head new every day.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.750
But I never realized he only
have three fingers and a thumb.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.920
Yeah.
[laughing]

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.830
I came down to the pawn
shop today to try to sell

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.250
my talking Herman Munster doll.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.210
Originally, I bought
him online for $300.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.250
I'm hoping to get $600 for
him, but the least I will take

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.880
is $500.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.330
Yeah, this is pretty cool.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.920
It looks like it's
in good condition.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.420
"The Munsters" was a huge
hit when it came out.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.210
I recall Herman Munster's
the head of the household.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.210
He was part of a
family of monsters,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.920
and they were just trying
to live their daily life

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.420
as normal people.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.920
But you can imagine at 7
feet tall, size 26 shoe--

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.460
probably pretty hard
to live a normal life.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.420
Can I pull the string?

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.750
TERRI: Sure.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.290
How many things does he say?
TERRI: 11.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.290
HERMAN MUNSTER DOLL: You
are the ghoul of my dreams.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.880
You are the
ghoul of my dreams.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.120
HERMAN MUNSTER DOLL: I love
your hands-- so cold and clammy.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.790
Well, that's pretty cool.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.620
Did you have to do anything
besides clean it up?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.960
Did you repaint it?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.620
I didn't repaint him at all.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.540
But when you clean him, the
black will wash off on here,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.290
so you have to pretty
much take him all apart.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.750
CHUMLEE: It looks like
you did a pretty good

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.290
job at reselling him there.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.080
Yeah, he still has the
tush tag on his back, which

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.880
tells you the year he was made.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.210
So what would you
like to do with it?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880
I would like to sell him.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.960
OK, and how much are
you looking to get?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.920
I'm looking to
get $600 for him.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.460
OK.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.580
$600 for a talking doll
doesn't sound unreasonable,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.920
but I don't know if that leaves
me any room to make a profit.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.000
Well, this is usually the part
where I offer you 50 bucks.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's not going to work.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.080
[laughing]

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080
Tell me what you want for it.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.120
I would like $600 for him.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.580
OK, there's going to be
no way I can get you $600.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.170
Although it's
obviously worth $600,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.830
I gotta have room to
make something there.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.750
Would you take $450?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.500
I'll take $500 for him.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.420
I would normally pass on that.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.460
But I think it appeals to
a lot of different markets,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.500
so I really don't see it
sitting around for too long.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.420
It's a deal.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.290
- All right.
- $500.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.380
Great.
Cool.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.170
Thank you.
- All right.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.830
Bring him with us.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.040
All right.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.620
We ended up settling
on $500, which--

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.540
it didn't really
surprise me because when

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.380
he first seen this toy,
he really liked it a lot.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.380
So I kind of had a feeling
we were going to make a deal.
