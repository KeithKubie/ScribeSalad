we can play videos we're here today to
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.389
we can play videos we're here today to
talk about rendering performance and we

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
talk about rendering performance and we
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.619
talk about rendering performance and we
want to start off with a few basics that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
want to start off with a few basics that
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.639
want to start off with a few basics that
we're not going to cover in much detail

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
we're not going to cover in much detail
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.860
we're not going to cover in much detail
because there is a ton of great content

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
because there is a ton of great content
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260

available on the web about this stuff
already we've talked about it before

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
already we've talked about it before
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.490
already we've talked about it before
other folks on our developer relations

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
other folks on our developer relations
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.050
other folks on our developer relations
team have talked about it before but we

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
team have talked about it before but we
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.219
team have talked about it before but we
wanna make sure we're on the same page

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
wanna make sure we're on the same page
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200
wanna make sure we're on the same page
so the pages that we want you to be on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
so the pages that we want you to be on
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.190
so the pages that we want you to be on
are the following right you got the the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
are the following right you got the the
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810
are the following right you got the the
screens here lots of them they're all

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
screens here lots of them they're all
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910
screens here lots of them they're all
running at about 60 Hertz but maybe not

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
running at about 60 Hertz but maybe not
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070
running at about 60 Hertz but maybe not
16 milliseconds is a number that you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
16 milliseconds is a number that you
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.090
16 milliseconds is a number that you
want to keep in your mind

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
want to keep in your mind
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100
want to keep in your mind
we heard Ilya talking about numbers much

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
we heard Ilya talking about numbers much
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.140
we heard Ilya talking about numbers much
bigger than 16 milliseconds so this is a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
bigger than 16 milliseconds so this is a
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330
bigger than 16 milliseconds so this is a
much smaller time frame but it's super

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
much smaller time frame but it's super
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.770
much smaller time frame but it's super
super important that if you want to be

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
super important that if you want to be
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.060
super important that if you want to be
smooth you've got to hit that budget

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
smooth you've got to hit that budget
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.859
smooth you've got to hit that budget
that's right and there's a lot of stuff

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
that's right and there's a lot of stuff
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.969
that's right and there's a lot of stuff
that needs to go into that 16

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
that needs to go into that 16
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.200
that needs to go into that 16
milliseconds the rendering system is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
milliseconds the rendering system is
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.969
milliseconds the rendering system is
really complicated we're gonna walk

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
really complicated we're gonna walk
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590
really complicated we're gonna walk
through kind of the various stages in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
through kind of the various stages in
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.080
through kind of the various stages in
the rendering pipeline in this talk but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
the rendering pipeline in this talk but
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.420
the rendering pipeline in this talk but
it's challenging to fit everything into

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
it's challenging to fit everything into
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.480
it's challenging to fit everything into
16 milliseconds and this means that you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
16 milliseconds and this means that you
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.590
16 milliseconds and this means that you
should be working with the browser

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
should be working with the browser
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.179
should be working with the browser
whenever possible

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
whenever possible
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.350
whenever possible
this means using things like

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
this means using things like
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.149
this means using things like
requestanimationframe rather than a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
requestanimationframe rather than a
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.730
requestanimationframe rather than a
timer to to run animations this means

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
timer to to run animations this means
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889
timer to to run animations this means
using things like CSS animations when

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
using things like CSS animations when
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.240
using things like CSS animations when
possible rather than doing everything

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
possible rather than doing everything
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.440
possible rather than doing everything
yourself and JavaScript and yeah just

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
yourself and JavaScript and yeah just
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150
yourself and JavaScript and yeah just

you know we all know and we've known for

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349
you know we all know and we've known for
 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.009
you know we all know and we've known for
many years that if you have good load

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019
many years that if you have good load
 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.839
many years that if you have good load
times for your pages your user

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849
times for your pages your user
 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.970
times for your pages your user
engagement will be much better than if

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980
engagement will be much better than if
 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.800
engagement will be much better than if
you have bad load times there's another

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
you have bad load times there's another
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.270
you have bad load times there's another
part of this business that we don't talk

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
part of this business that we don't talk
 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.009
part of this business that we don't talk
about but that's obvious to mobile

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019
about but that's obvious to mobile
 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.110
about but that's obvious to mobile
developers which is your responsiveness

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
developers which is your responsiveness
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.869
developers which is your responsiveness
right we've got two videos here going

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879
right we've got two videos here going
 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.640
right we've got two videos here going
that are you know a good responsive page

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650
that are you know a good responsive page
 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.830
that are you know a good responsive page
that is smooth and one that's janky

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840
that is smooth and one that's janky
 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.880
that is smooth and one that's janky
right

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890
right
 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.380
right
you've got to think of this as a first

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390
you've got to think of this as a first
 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.509
you've got to think of this as a first
order part of your business as creating

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519
order part of your business as creating
 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.039
order part of your business as creating
a web app I think most of you know this

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049
a web app I think most of you know this
 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.539
a web app I think most of you know this
but it's really worth hammering that

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549
but it's really worth hammering that
 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.009
but it's really worth hammering that
home up to the bosses that this is

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019
home up to the bosses that this is
 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.599
home up to the bosses that this is
something you don't fix at the end you

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609
something you don't fix at the end you
 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.309
something you don't fix at the end you
think about throughout the lifecycle of

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319
think about throughout the lifecycle of
 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.479
think about throughout the lifecycle of
whatever it is that you're building

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489
whatever it is that you're building
 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.339
whatever it is that you're building
that's right and and especially we're

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349
that's right and and especially we're
 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.119
that's right and and especially we're
going to talking a lot today about sort

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129
going to talking a lot today about sort
 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.160
going to talking a lot today about sort
of things that impact mobile devices

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170
of things that impact mobile devices
 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.619
of things that impact mobile devices
more than they impact say like this

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629
more than they impact say like this
 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.039
more than they impact say like this
laptop and this kind of difference this

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049
laptop and this kind of difference this
 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.649
laptop and this kind of difference this
difference in responsiveness but the

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659
difference in responsiveness but the
 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.080
difference in responsiveness but the
difference comes out much more on said

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090
difference comes out much more on said
 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.430
difference comes out much more on said
mobile devices right this is one of the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440
mobile devices right this is one of the
 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.319
mobile devices right this is one of the
key distinctions between native

application development platforms on
 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.490
application development platforms on
Android or iOS and and the mobile web is

that thing's feel webby

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329
that thing's feel webby
 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.539
that thing's feel webby
when they like when they're slow when

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549
when they like when they're slow when
 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.400
when they like when they're slow when
they're jittery and your users are going

they're jittery and your users are going
 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.539
they're jittery and your users are going
to notice the difference even if they're

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549
to notice the difference even if they're
 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.339
to notice the difference even if they're
not conscious of it it doesn't feel as

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349
not conscious of it it doesn't feel as
 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.800
not conscious of it it doesn't feel as
nice it's one of the the tells so to

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810
nice it's one of the the tells so to
 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.680
nice it's one of the the tells so to
speak of of a web app and that's that's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690
speak of of a web app and that's that's
 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.900
speak of of a web app and that's that's
unfortunate that's what we want to avoid

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910
unfortunate that's what we want to avoid
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.069
unfortunate that's what we want to avoid
so we've been nice in that let's talk

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079
so we've been nice in that let's talk
 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.229
so we've been nice in that let's talk
tech that's right and so we're gonna go

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239
tech that's right and so we're gonna go
 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.659
tech that's right and so we're gonna go
through if any of you have seen us to

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669
through if any of you have seen us to
 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.220
through if any of you have seen us to
talk before we're gonna go through sort

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230
talk before we're gonna go through sort
 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.979
talk before we're gonna go through sort
of some content that should be fairly

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989
of some content that should be fairly
 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.659
of some content that should be fairly
familiar about how the painting system

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669
familiar about how the painting system
 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.490
familiar about how the painting system
works how the compositing system works

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500
works how the compositing system works
 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.780
works how the compositing system works
and then we're going to talk about some

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790
and then we're going to talk about some
 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.500
and then we're going to talk about some
stuff that we haven't talked about

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510
stuff that we haven't talked about
 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.140
stuff that we haven't talked about
before so with that in mind we're gonna

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150
before so with that in mind we're gonna
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.740
before so with that in mind we're gonna
go kind of fast but but bear with us if

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
go kind of fast but but bear with us if
 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.580
go kind of fast but but bear with us if
you think about how pixels get on the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590
you think about how pixels get on the
 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.949
you think about how pixels get on the
screen of say mobile phone there's a

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959
screen of say mobile phone there's a
 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.420
screen of say mobile phone there's a
whole slew of stuff that needs to happen

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
whole slew of stuff that needs to happen
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.520
whole slew of stuff that needs to happen
from the perspective the JavaScript it's

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530
from the perspective the JavaScript it's
 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.800
from the perspective the JavaScript it's
all of this stuff yeah so this this sort

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810
all of this stuff yeah so this this sort
 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.479
all of this stuff yeah so this this sort
of thing makes the actual chrome

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489

engineers try to kill themselves because
 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.420
engineers try to kill themselves because
it's all a lie but from the point of

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430
it's all a lie but from the point of
 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.069
it's all a lie but from the point of
view of a web developer there are these

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079
view of a web developer there are these
 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.750
view of a web developer there are these
various pipeline stages that your

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760
various pipeline stages that your
 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.640
various pipeline stages that your
content goes through you start off with

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650
content goes through you start off with
 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.529
content goes through you start off with
your J s and your DOM it has to be

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539
your J s and your DOM it has to be
 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.629
your J s and your DOM it has to be
styled that has sort of two big steps

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639
styled that has sort of two big steps
 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.719

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729
layout and recalc style the first parts
 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.010
layout and recalc style the first parts
where you're taking all your CSS

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020
where you're taking all your CSS
 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.510
where you're taking all your CSS
selectors and figuring out which apply

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520
selectors and figuring out which apply
 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.220
selectors and figuring out which apply
to what second part is figure

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230
to what second part is figure
 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.430
to what second part is figure
where things are positionally eventually

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
where things are positionally eventually
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.720
where things are positionally eventually
you've got all that stuff done you're

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730
you've got all that stuff done you're
 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.920
you've got all that stuff done you're
still not done you've got to basically

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930
still not done you've got to basically
 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.170
still not done you've got to basically
take all of that computed stuff and turn

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180
take all of that computed stuff and turn
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.630
take all of that computed stuff and turn
it into actual pixels RGB values in

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640
it into actual pixels RGB values in
 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.570
it into actual pixels RGB values in
memory somewhere or on a GPU and we do

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580
memory somewhere or on a GPU and we do
 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.640
memory somewhere or on a GPU and we do
that in two parts right now first we

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650
that in two parts right now first we
 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.380
that in two parts right now first we
paint which is where we take all the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390
paint which is where we take all the
 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.270
paint which is where we take all the
lines and we rasterize them and the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280
lines and we rasterize them and the
 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.040
lines and we rasterize them and the
second part is we take all those

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050
second part is we take all those
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.960
second part is we take all those
textures that we made and we smash them

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970
textures that we made and we smash them
 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.520
textures that we made and we smash them
together on the screen using the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
together on the screen using the
 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.290
together on the screen using the
compositor and that's the stage where

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300
compositor and that's the stage where
 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.910
compositor and that's the stage where
you hear the layers come about that's

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920
you hear the layers come about that's
 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.800
you hear the layers come about that's
right and so you can actually see this

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810
right and so you can actually see this
 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.200
right and so you can actually see this
pipeline in action in dev tools we

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210
pipeline in action in dev tools we
 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.220
pipeline in action in dev tools we
really really like the dev tools

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230
really really like the dev tools
 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.590
really really like the dev tools
Timeline view because it not only shows

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600
Timeline view because it not only shows
 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.230
Timeline view because it not only shows
you each of these pipeline stages kind

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240
you each of these pipeline stages kind
 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.970
you each of these pipeline stages kind
of happening but it also shows you how

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980
of happening but it also shows you how
 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.430
of happening but it also shows you how
long each stage took which means that

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440
long each stage took which means that
 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.960
long each stage took which means that
you have some sense of where the time

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970
you have some sense of where the time
 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.510
you have some sense of where the time
may be eaten up if you you have some

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520
may be eaten up if you you have some
 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.200
may be eaten up if you you have some
janky

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210
janky
 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.560
janky
interaction on your page and usually the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570
interaction on your page and usually the
 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.270
interaction on your page and usually the
first thing I do when I'm trying to

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280
first thing I do when I'm trying to
 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.910
first thing I do when I'm trying to
debug some slow site for whatever reason

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920
debug some slow site for whatever reason
 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.520
debug some slow site for whatever reason
is I open it up I take a timeline

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530
is I open it up I take a timeline
 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.990
is I open it up I take a timeline
recording of whatever it was that was

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000
recording of whatever it was that was
 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.450
recording of whatever it was that was
slow and I start to get some sense of

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460
slow and I start to get some sense of
 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.210
slow and I start to get some sense of
the breakdown of where that time is

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220
the breakdown of where that time is
 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.250
the breakdown of where that time is
going and what it is that's causing a

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260
going and what it is that's causing a
 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.780
going and what it is that's causing a
lot of time to be eaten this is your

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790
lot of time to be eaten this is your
 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.730
lot of time to be eaten this is your
first line of defense really when it

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740
first line of defense really when it
 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.770
first line of defense really when it
comes to jank busting that's right and

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780
comes to jank busting that's right and
 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.140
comes to jank busting that's right and
if you think about what properties you

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150
if you think about what properties you
 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.230
if you think about what properties you
can animate in CSS you know CSS will let

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240
can animate in CSS you know CSS will let
 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.730
can animate in CSS you know CSS will let
you animate whatever you want right but

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740
you animate whatever you want right but
 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.370
you animate whatever you want right but
it's it's important to realize that not

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380
it's it's important to realize that not
 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.320
it's it's important to realize that not
all of these things are created equal if

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330
all of these things are created equal if
 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.290
all of these things are created equal if
you change something like the opacity

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300
you change something like the opacity
 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.100
you change something like the opacity
value on on some element then all we

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110
value on on some element then all we
 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.870
value on on some element then all we
need to do behind the scenes is

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880
need to do behind the scenes is
 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.390
need to do behind the scenes is
recompose it turns out compositing is

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400
recompose it turns out compositing is
 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.030
recompose it turns out compositing is
fairly cheap we can do it on the GPU and

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040
fairly cheap we can do it on the GPU and
 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.700
fairly cheap we can do it on the GPU and
and we can composite every frame no

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710
and we can composite every frame no
 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.110
and we can composite every frame no
problem in fact chrome needs to

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120
problem in fact chrome needs to
 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.880
problem in fact chrome needs to
composite every frame just to make a new

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890
composite every frame just to make a new
 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.590
composite every frame just to make a new
screen image but then you compare that

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600
screen image but then you compare that
 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.800
screen image but then you compare that
to something like width or top and all

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810
to something like width or top and all
 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.720
to something like width or top and all
of a sudden you you you modify the width

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730
of a sudden you you you modify the width
 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.660
of a sudden you you you modify the width
property and maybe some text reflows we

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670
property and maybe some text reflows we
 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.270
property and maybe some text reflows we
need to do a lot of relay out and

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280
need to do a lot of relay out and
 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.130
need to do a lot of relay out and
everything that got real laid out and

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140
everything that got real laid out and
 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.260
everything that got real laid out and
maybe more stuff around it needs to be

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270
maybe more stuff around it needs to be
 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.640
maybe more stuff around it needs to be
repainted and then everything that got

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650
repainted and then everything that got
 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.830
repainted and then everything that got
repainted needs to be recomposed and all

the sudden this whole pipeline is kind

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940
the sudden this whole pipeline is kind
 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.120
the sudden this whole pipeline is kind
of in action which is very difficult to

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130
of in action which is very difficult to
 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.590

danger territory that's the more left

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400
danger territory that's the more left
 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.280
danger territory that's the more left
you go in this pipeline the more you're

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290
you go in this pipeline the more you're
 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.120
you go in this pipeline the more you're
risking jank

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130
risking jank
 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.050
risking jank
yeah but that's it

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060
yeah but that's it
 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.060
yeah but that's it
it's not just the more left there's it's

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070
it's not just the more left there's it's
 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.909
it's not just the more left there's it's
kind of a big cliff right about on air

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919
kind of a big cliff right about on air
 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.260

right about there

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270
right about there
 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.940
right about there
one of these things is not like the

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950
one of these things is not like the
 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.960
one of these things is not like the
others painting is really slow it's like

some numbers right so so this is data

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530
some numbers right so so this is data
 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.240

we have like a rasterization time metric

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919
we have like a rasterization time metric

we have like a rasterization time metric
and if you look at a nexus 10 and you

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290
and if you look at a nexus 10 and you

I mean 10 is is not yeah okay sure fine

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210
I mean 10 is is not yeah okay sure fine

like about this but because then you go

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960
like about this but because then you go
 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.150

pooh-poohing any of these sites I'm just
 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.150
pooh-poohing any of these sites I'm just
saying like there's there's an

how long things take to paint and if you

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600
how long things take to paint and if you
 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.779
how long things take to paint and if you
think about this in terms of frames

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:45.789
think about this in terms of frames
 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:48.990
think about this in terms of frames
which is kind of a good logical unit to

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000
which is kind of a good logical unit to
 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.360
which is kind of a good logical unit to
consider then all the sudden you can see

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.370
consider then all the sudden you can see
 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.480
consider then all the sudden you can see
that 214 milliseconds that's that's 13

frames at 16 milliseconds of frame that
 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.500
frames at 16 milliseconds of frame that
means that you end up in this position

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.510
means that you end up in this position
 

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.760
means that you end up in this position
where if you really want to be

00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.770
where if you really want to be
 

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.779
where if you really want to be
repainting all that content every frame

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:02.789
repainting all that content every frame
 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:05.400
repainting all that content every frame
there's just no way right it's per frame

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.410
there's just no way right it's per frame
 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.230
there's just no way right it's per frame
this means that your frames per second

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240
this means that your frames per second
 

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.120
this means that your frames per second
it goes goes way way way down you're

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.130
it goes goes way way way down you're
 

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.310
it goes goes way way way down you're
nowhere near 60 or is that smooth right

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.320
nowhere near 60 or is that smooth right

I kind of alluded on the last slide you

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.410
I kind of alluded on the last slide you
 

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.110
I kind of alluded on the last slide you
end up in this position where you need

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120
end up in this position where you need
 

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.190
end up in this position where you need
to paint things on a per frame basis so

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:25.200
to paint things on a per frame basis so
 

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.500
to paint things on a per frame basis so
we call this a paint storm if you go

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:28.510
we call this a paint storm if you go
 

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.790
we call this a paint storm if you go
into dev tools and you turn on show

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800
into dev tools and you turn on show
 

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.800
into dev tools and you turn on show
paint rectangles you'll get a red flash

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:31.810
paint rectangles you'll get a red flash
 

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.570
paint rectangles you'll get a red flash
on the part of the screen that Ray

paints every time a tree paints this is

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159
paints every time a tree paints this is
 

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.560
paints every time a tree paints this is
cool because it means that you can see

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:37.570
cool because it means that you can see
 

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.120
cool because it means that you can see
that during this interaction this is

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.130
that during this interaction this is

Nats fat-finger kind of moving up and

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:41.800
Nats fat-finger kind of moving up and
 

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.120
Nats fat-finger kind of moving up and
down on an online demo you made you can

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.130
down on an online demo you made you can
 

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.490
down on an online demo you made you can
see that there are key points in that

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:47.500
see that there are key points in that
 

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.900
see that there are key points in that
interaction where all the sudden they're

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:48.910
interaction where all the sudden they're
 

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.760
interaction where all the sudden they're
these red flashes that show up and and

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:50.770
these red flashes that show up and and
 

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.680
these red flashes that show up and and
cover the screen and this is really bad

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:52.690
cover the screen and this is really bad
 

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.540
cover the screen and this is really bad
right because that means

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:53.550
right because that means
 

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.710
right because that means
every time one of those red flashes

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720
every time one of those red flashes
 

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.040
every time one of those red flashes
shows up then we're paying a lot of this

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.050
shows up then we're paying a lot of this
 

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.389
shows up then we're paying a lot of this
significant paint cost right and if you

00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399
significant paint cost right and if you
 

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:01.519
significant paint cost right and if you
were to show a sort of like a timeline

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:01.529
were to show a sort of like a timeline
 

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:03.470
were to show a sort of like a timeline
view of this in developer tools you'd be

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480
view of this in developer tools you'd be
 

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.880
view of this in developer tools you'd be
able to see exactly how long each of

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:04.890
able to see exactly how long each of
 

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.190
able to see exactly how long each of
those paints were taking yeah so you

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200
those paints were taking yeah so you
 

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.019
those paints were taking yeah so you
know and we see a lot of sites that

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:09.029
know and we see a lot of sites that
 

00:09:09.029 --> 00:09:10.670
know and we see a lot of sites that
basically get pretty far along in their

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680
basically get pretty far along in their
 

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.500
basically get pretty far along in their
lifetime before they even look at paint

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:12.510
lifetime before they even look at paint
 

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.329
lifetime before they even look at paint
rects you know and at that point you've

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339
rects you know and at that point you've
 

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:16.160
rects you know and at that point you've
added so much complexity to your Dom

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.170
added so much complexity to your Dom
 

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.410
added so much complexity to your Dom
you've got 73 different things all going

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420

we've alluded to it we've talked a lot

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:36.570
we've alluded to it we've talked a lot
 

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.930
we've alluded to it we've talked a lot
about it on jank-free you can look at

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940
about it on jank-free you can look at
 

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.220
about it on jank-free you can look at
that demo and think about it in your

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.230
that demo and think about it in your
 

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.930
that demo and think about it in your
head and go well you know these pieces

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940
head and go well you know these pieces
 

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.360
head and go well you know these pieces
and they're just moving around so what

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:44.370
and they're just moving around so what
 

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.100
and they're just moving around so what
we can do to make this smoother is keep

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.110
we can do to make this smoother is keep
 

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.350
we can do to make this smoother is keep
each one of those in a layer and sort of

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360
each one of those in a layer and sort of
 

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.720
each one of those in a layer and sort of
add them all together and if you sort of

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:50.730
add them all together and if you sort of
 

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.280
add them all together and if you sort of
think about then the movement from frame

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.290
think about then the movement from frame
 

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.319
think about then the movement from frame
to frame to frame is us just moving

00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:54.329
to frame to frame is us just moving
 

00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:56.509
to frame to frame is us just moving
these layers around on the screen no

00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519
these layers around on the screen no
 

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:58.819
these layers around on the screen no
repainting is necessary so that means we

00:09:58.819 --> 00:09:58.829
repainting is necessary so that means we
 

00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:00.530
repainting is necessary so that means we
don't have to get those left parts of

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540
don't have to get those left parts of
 

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.090
don't have to get those left parts of
the pipeline running that are slow the

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100
the pipeline running that are slow the
 

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.240
the pipeline running that are slow the
purples and the Pitt the greens and and

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.250
purples and the Pitt the greens and and
 

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.430
purples and the Pitt the greens and and
so in theory this this is smoother right

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440
so in theory this this is smoother right
 

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.769
so in theory this this is smoother right
and so this is just the the same thing

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:09.779
and so this is just the the same thing
 

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:15.050
and so this is just the the same thing
but redone to be no repaints or very few

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060
but redone to be no repaints or very few
 

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.780
but redone to be no repaints or very few
and so it's a lot smoother yeah and

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:17.790
and so it's a lot smoother yeah and
 

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.250
and so it's a lot smoother yeah and
actually you can see it's probably

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260
actually you can see it's probably
 

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.569
actually you can see it's probably
pretty small on the screen but you can

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:20.579
pretty small on the screen but you can
 

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:22.639
pretty small on the screen but you can
see that there are some red flashes

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:22.649
see that there are some red flashes
 

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:24.560
see that there are some red flashes
still happening along the far right side

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:24.570
still happening along the far right side
 

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.660
still happening along the far right side
of the mobile device screen that's just

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:26.670
of the mobile device screen that's just
 

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.280
of the mobile device screen that's just
us repainting the scrollbar which we do

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.290
us repainting the scrollbar which we do
 

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.630
us repainting the scrollbar which we do
at bars we have an optimizer they're

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640
at bars we have an optimizer they're
 

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.010
at bars we have an optimizer they're
small but you can see that other than

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.020
small but you can see that other than
 

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.900
small but you can see that other than
that there there are no no red flashes

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:32.910
that there there are no no red flashes
 

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.120
that there there are no no red flashes
right this is this is good the point

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.130
right this is this is good the point
 

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.350
right this is this is good the point
here is that you you want to try to

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360
here is that you you want to try to
 

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.389
here is that you you want to try to
decompose the the the structure of your

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399
decompose the the the structure of your
 

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:41.780
decompose the the the structure of your
page into kind of logical units that map

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:41.790
page into kind of logical units that map
 

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.730
page into kind of logical units that map
well to layers and these logical units

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740
well to layers and these logical units
 

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.500

should be things that move together that
fade together or that maybe stretch

stretched and and basically this maps to

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:00.750
stretched and and basically this maps to
 

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.680

the set of things this maps to the set
 

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.010
the set of things this maps to the set

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:06.020
of things that GPUs are good at right
 

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.250

GPIOs are okay at the kind of

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:09.260
GPIOs are okay at the kind of

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.430
rasterization that not was talking about
 

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.400
rasterization that not was talking about
earlier but they're really good at these

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:12.410
earlier but they're really good at these
 

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.430
earlier but they're really good at these
bulk pixel operations yeah so think in

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440
bulk pixel operations yeah so think in
 

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.410
bulk pixel operations yeah so think in
terms of layers it's really really sort

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:17.420
terms of layers it's really really sort
 

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.780
terms of layers it's really really sort

of that key building block right now for
 

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.790
of that key building block right now for
getting speed on mobile but that having

getting speed on mobile but that having
been said great right what sucks about

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.140
been said great right what sucks about
 

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.100
been said great right what sucks about

this watching things about this we
we try to make layers automatically but

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:29.029
we try to make layers automatically but
 

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:30.880
we try to make layers automatically but
we can't always do it right like one of

we can't always do it right like one of
 

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.110
we can't always do it right like one of

persuade to exist yeah and so you have
 

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.050
