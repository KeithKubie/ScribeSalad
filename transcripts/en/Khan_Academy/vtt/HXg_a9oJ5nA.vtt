00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.210
The following graph represents
the first five terms

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.499
of two given patterns.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:06.540
In the answer box, there
are different statements

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.498
about the two patterns.

00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:09.320
Choose all correct statements.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.700
So here, for each point,
this point right over here,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.750
this represents its
horizontal coordinate

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.086
is the first term of
pattern A, which is 4.

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:17.960
And its vertical coordinate
is the first term

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.149
in pattern B, which is 1.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:21.440
And then we could do that
for the other points as well.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.990
So actually, let's figure
out what the values are.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.160
So we have pattern A and
then we have pattern B.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.680
So the first term
for pattern A is 4.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.590
And when pattern A is 4, the
first term for pattern B is 1.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.330
The second term
for pattern A is 7.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.680
And when pattern A is
7, pattern B is also 7.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.080
Third term, pattern A is
10, and pattern B is 13.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.590
And then the fourth
term, pattern A is 13,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.130
and pattern B is 19.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.910
And then finally, fifth
term, pattern A is 16,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.534
and pattern B is 25.

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:15.950
Now, before even
looking at these,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.700
let's see what we can think
about these patterns here.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.070
So it looks like
pattern A starts at 4,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.320
and it increases
by 3 every time.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.490
To go from one term to the
next, you just have to add 3.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.160
Now, what about for pattern B?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.170
Well pattern B starts at
1, and every term here it

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.550
looks like you're adding 6.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.050
So when pattern A
increases by 3 and we're

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.155
moving in the horizontal
direction based on the fact

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:45.270
that pattern A is represented
on the horizontal axis,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.490
we're going to move up
6 in the vertical axis,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.460
and we see that here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.230
Pattern A increases by 3
from one term to the next.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.220
And when that increased
by 3, pattern B

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.820
increased by 6 from
one term to the next.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.680
And we see that it
keeps doing that.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.160
Now, let's think about
what we have over here

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.100
to see which of these statements
actually apply to this.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.900
For every term in pattern
A, multiply the term by 2

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.640
and then subtract 7 to get the
corresponding term from pattern

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.690
B. So let's see
if that holds up.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.780
So according to this,
if this was true,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.910
I should be able to take
this, multiply it by 2

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.990
and subtract 7 and get that.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.580
So let's see.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.380
Is 1 equal to 2 times 8 minus 7?

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.490
Sorry, 2 times 4 minus 7.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.090
So 2 times this number,
2 times 4 minus 7.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.610
Well, 8 minus 7 is equal to 1.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.660
Is this right over here equal
to 2 times this 7 minus 7?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.510
Well, yeah, it's equal to 7.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.594
Is 13 equal to 2
times 10 minus 7?

00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:02.130
Well, yeah, 20 minus 7 is 13.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.870
Is 19 equal to 2
times 13 minus 7?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.210
26 minus 7 is 19.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.400
Is 25 equal to 2
times 16 minus 7?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.060
Well, 32 minus 7 is 25.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.360
So this first
statement checks out.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.880
For the corresponding term,
the value of pattern B

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.475
is two times the value
of pattern A minus 7.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.850
Now let's look at
the second one.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.370
The terms of
pattern B are always

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.470
greater than or equal to
their corresponding terms

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.630
from pattern A. Well,
no, that's not right.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.130
It's true for a
couple of scenarios.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.380
Here for the third,
fourth, and fifth term,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.670
or actually for the second,
third, fourth, and fifth terms,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.977
pattern B is equal to or
greater than pattern A.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.560
But for the first
term, it's not true.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.520
Pattern A is greater,
so this is not right.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.190
To get from each
point to the next,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.080
you need to move 3 units to
the right and 6 units up.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.830
Well, that's exactly
what we talked about.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.550
From one term to
the next, pattern A,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.710
along our horizontal
axis, we increased by 3,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.620
while pattern B, which is
plotted on our vertical axis,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.620
by 6.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.580
So you move 3 to
the right and 6 up.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.630
So that is right.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.874
The second terms of
both patterns are 7.

00:04:16.874 --> 00:04:18.540
Well, yeah, we see
that right over here.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.950
The second terms are 7.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.770
We have 7 here, and
we have 7 there.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.090
And so that is right as well.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.730
So the only one that doesn't
apply is this second one.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.970
This is not right.
