I'm here with Brielin Brown, who works on quantum computing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So Brielin, what does quantum physics have to do with computing?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Quantum physics actually has a lot to do with computing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you think about the algorithms that you've been learning about in your course

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
for searching the Web and doing things like this, everything that you program

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is built on a fundamental model of computing that manipulates a registry of 0s and 1s.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Everything is transformed into machine instructions to manipulate these bits.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But in quantum computing, you actually get to replace these bits

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with something called qubits, which give you a lot more power.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What can you do with a qubit that you can't do with a regular bit?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
With regular bits they're either 0 or 1 and there's no middle ground,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but with a quantum bit you can actually exist in a superposition of 0 and 1.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So right now I have this coffee cup

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which the viewer doesn't know whether or not it has any coffee in it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So right now it exists in a superposition of being filled and unfilled until I measure,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
a.k.a. take a sip.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And so you can see that there is coffee in this cup.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The cool thing about quantum information is that it takes a lot more classical information

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to describe the same system.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But at the end of a quantum algorithm, to get the access for this information

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you have to take a measurement which actually destroys the system.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So if you're really clever with how you devise your algorithm,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you can sort of access this exponential amount of information

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in a way that allows you to solve a problem faster

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
by making a correct measurement at the end.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And so this allows you to do things like factor integers faster

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or simulate quantum systems, which gives you a lot of progress in physics

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that we haven't been able to see recently.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Wow. All this talk about physics is making me thirsty.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I think it's time to go get a coffee. &gt;&gt;[laughs] Absolutely.
