Speaker 1:          00:00          I got home from the comedy store, I'd like to, and then I watched some goofy, I've been on this Ufo documentary kick

Speaker 2:          00:07          watching you a foe. Documentaries. Yeah. I told you it was David. That was, I'd seen it. I started talking about it though. We were talking about that. What were you, did you have something specific that you saw recently? The documentary,

Speaker 1:          00:16          one of them is air area 51 Bob Lasar and alien area 51 and flying saucers. It's uh, some, a documentary on this guy who claimed that he worked on these alien ships in area 51 in the 1980s and chills as time's gone on more, more of the things that he said have proven to actually be true, including an element that he talked about. Element one 15, I think it was called like an organism from outer space. No, no, no. An element like a man created element, you know, at this carbon, right? Yeah. Well there's an element that they created that he talked about way before it was ever publicized and he talked about this thing and then it turned out to be true. He talked about these, um, there's these, um, uh, hand monitors that you would put your hand on this thing and these lines, these metal lines would detect the distances in the bones of your fingers, the exact distances and everyone is different.

Speaker 1:          01:14          It's like a signature thing and that they could find out if it was you or not you, it was trying to go through. So the way they would scan people, that bio scan would literally measure the bones and their fingers and people said that was horseshit. It's all about this. In the 1980s, people said it was horseshit, but then later on turned out, no, they did have that. And Los Alamos, they did have that in, in area 51. And that this technology was very, very uh, in advance, very not just at very advanced but very not, it was not well known at all. Like very few people did. And this guy who was creative with this documentary, it was very difficult for them to get photos of this hand scanner. But this hand scanner did exist and existed exactly as this guy described it

Speaker 2:          01:56          in the 80s. I mean that's super progressive for that time. It also a Plinko

Speaker 1:          01:59          that did approve is top secret clearance to get to this place. They know that he actually worked there. There's people that um, worked in the same Los Alamos lab with him. They tried to say he never worked there, but his name's on the manifest. It's very strange. It's like they've tried to erase parts of this guy's passed because he um, he filmed a bunch of their crafts as they were flying around. Like he knew what days. This is the thing, that thing right there, you put your hand on that and it actually measures the distance of your, the size and length of your bone.

Speaker 2:          02:30          That looks like something that's inside of an escape room in La. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:38          I went into this documentary, skeptical. I wasn't sure. Yeah, but I am. I'm so done with all those things. But listen to this guy talk for awhile. After awhile I was like, what if he's telling the truth? Like what if he is actually telling the truth? Because if he's actually telling the truth, there is some part of the government that had access at least in the 19 to alien technology.

Speaker 2:          03:01          I mean it probably is. It probably is some truth to that. Crazier things have happened. And also like just your mentality of believing him. It's probably the same thing that made Dr Malakai Lovejoy Robinson the third become successful. A con artist. Yeah. I mean either this dude, there's validity of what he's saying in this documentary, which I can't wait to watch or he's just really great at painting a picture. Some people are so good at convincing you that's true of truths. True. There's, you know, people with like borderline personality disorder in every sort of spectrum in between there they become really good manipulators.

Speaker 1:          03:34          That is true. However, usually they do that in more than one avenue. Absolutely. And this guy's not doing that. Yeah. So if it's just a documentary then also hasn't varied a story like you mean he might've like changed the way he says things in terms of like the words he chooses. But the actual story is exactly the same as he was telling a long time ago.

Speaker 2:          03:54          Is this a self produced documentary or is there a production company in the oil production company? That's where was like, hmm, okay, there's probably some validity to this.

Speaker 1:          04:00          This guy's been around for a long time. I remember reading about him and watch videos about him, you know, 20 years ago.

Speaker 2:          04:05          I mean, don't you think you're somebody who you said you, you know, and I notice about you, you love space. You're, you're obsessed with that. The idea of what we are in, in the solar system and beyond, like how impossible is it to think that there could be a creature that could breach our atmosphere with some advanced technology and be able to just sort of chill, you know, scoot around, scoot scoots macoutes check us out and fucking piece out, back up to wherever they're from. That's how they would do it. But yeah, I know what you're saying. Exactly. They scoot, scoot, scoot codes. Yeah. They just kind of cruise around. You know, they're looking at us.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Well, he had an initial reconnaissance. He said if you brought a um, uh, uh, an atomic engine to these people that live in the Victorian era and said, hey, this is a, this is a nuclear power plant, like here, here, check this out. They would fuck with it. They'd wind up getting sick from radiation. They'd wind up dying. No one would understand what it was or how it worked. They would never figure it out. Right. He goes, why would we assume that this is only from that one time with this one device? Why would we assume that there'd be some other technology that maybe we'll create some day in the future? I'm paraphrasing and very poorly, or someone else from another planet would create that we wouldn't understand at all. And he said that's what we were dealing with when we're trying to back engineer the propulsion systems that these things use the, they use some gravity based propulsion system and it was just something that would manipulate gravity in front of, it's very, look, I don't, I'm too stupid to know the science of it. I don't know if he's town, like if you're a scientist, you're supposed to know these things. Yeah. I have to get my to Joseph Rogan degree so I can call myself doctor. You should. I just want to get an honorary one. Like Cosby had.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Oh, it's gone now. He doesn't have it. He doesn't have it anymore. They

Speaker 1:          05:59          take back, take him back. He can't keep those. He can keep that. Actually, I think he wrote an essay and that's why they gave him his doctorate. I'm just neither here nor rose. Probably got more than one doctorate. I'm sure he did and he didn't. He didn't deserve that. But I think, I mean there's gotta be stuff out there. Oh, a hundred percent a hundred percent I like to say there's not, it's like, ah, stop. No, no, I don't think it is, but it is entirely possible. Um, I use that phrase too often and it's entirely possible. You've got to get a mash up of all of those. It's sort of you're hilarious. 150,000 of them. To be honest. It's possible that we're the, we're the most advanced. That's possible too because something has to be the most advanced. Absolutely. And something has to be the least. We could also be on that part of the spectrum or maybe where the last two we evolve.

Speaker 1:          06:52          It's a hundred percent a hundred percent possible. If there's, if there's an infinite number of life forms out there, like if there's an infinite number of planets and there's an infinite number of earth, like planets that could, you know, have beings like us on it. Who's to say that we're not the most advanced? Maybe they're all like people from the 1820s they haven't caught up to the ceiling shit. They're still doing, you know, I don't think they chiseled chisels, but I'm talking like old old shit. They don't even have pens and papers yet. Like the orangutan that was fishing with a spirit. There's just a bunch of advanced orangutans that are like, you know, putting hieroglyphics in caves. It's possible. It is very possible. It's totally possible. But because we're just, we're just basing it off of our own experience and perception of what we have been exposed to. We have no idea. You know, the other, um, really interesting scenario is that there are time travelers. Oh, that's really, that's exciting to think about ar is some being from the far distant future that understands that it could come back and observe us and see like where things went wrong, where things went right, but do so in a way that's as minimally intrusive as possible and occasionally interfere. That's things.
