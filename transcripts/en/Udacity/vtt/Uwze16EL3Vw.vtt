00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.070
If you follow the stock market, you may
have noticed that when news comes out

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.520
about a particular company its stock
price can change considerably.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.740
Why is that?

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.630
Well, the stock price is of course
the main mechanism by which

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.500
investors can essentially let
their view of the stock be known.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
In other words, If they think
that the company is buying less,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990
they're going to sell and
the prices are going to go down.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.030
If investors think the value
of the company should go up,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.530
they're going to buy the stock and
the prices are going to go up.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.440
Now, why is it that this information or
news affects the stock price.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.890
It's based on these things that we've
covered up to now in the lesson.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.250
In other words intrinsic value,
book value, and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.320
well of course, market capitalization.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.120
But let's take a look at how it affects,
say, intrinsic value.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.970
Consider a company run by this CEO and
assume for the moment,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.720
that his business, his company,
is to grow and sell coconuts.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630
What if the following news comes out?

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.326
The CEO is ill.

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:18.090
Maybe he has cancer, maybe he has
something else that prevents him

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.780
from collecting those coconuts as
effectively as he might otherwise do.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.370
Well, certainly that should affect
the stock price downward because

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.210
the probability that we are going to get
dividends in the future is decreasing.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.000
Either that or the amount of
the dividends is going to decrease.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.429
So, if you think back to the intrinsic
valuation that we talked about.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.640
The potential for

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.310
reduced future dividends reduces
the value of the company significantly.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.510
Now consider another scenario
where's there's an island

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.120
with our original company and
another company.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.909
And news comes out about the soil
on the island being contaminated.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.350
That news is going to affect not
only our original company, but

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.110
also all the other
companies on the island.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.130
So you can think of this sort
of news as being sector news.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.450
In other words it relates to the sector
of growing coconuts on this island and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.240
it affects all the companies
in this sector.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.010
let's consider one last
scenario were we have many

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.830
islands with many
companies on those islands.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.250
And news that might effect all
of them like sea level rising,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.720
that is going to negatively
impact all of these companies.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.080
So we have examples here of
companies specific news that affects

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.731
the price of an individual company.

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.050
Sector-specific news that effects, say,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.880
the companies on a particular island or
in a particular industrial segment.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.620
And market-wide news that affects
all the companies in the market.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.980
So that's how news can effect
the prices of the stock.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.080
Primarily because they reduce
the expectation of future dividends.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.210
We've seen how that can affect
the intrinsic value and

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.580
accordingly, why people would
want to pay less for that stock.
