00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.273
Carol Dweck, who is now at Stanford,

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:09.802
conducted a research experiment

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:13.139
where she compared 7th graders
in two different groups.

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.634
One group, she taught study skills to,

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:16.554
and the other group,

00:00:16.578 --> 00:00:18.221
they taught a mini-neuroscience class

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:19.691
about how their brain worked.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:20.976
They followed those two groups

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
throughout their middle school math grades

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:24.274
and noticed that the group

00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:26.726
who had the mini-neuroscience course

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.379
was much more successful
in their math grades

00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:33.042
than the group that had
the conventional study skills,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.024
like being organized

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:36.796
and using note cards.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.048
The reason, they believe,

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:40.617
that the group had
the mini-neuroscience course

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.685
did so much better

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:44.345
is that they were picturing the formations

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:46.907
and the connections
in their brains occurring

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:48.155
while they were learning.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.067
They were also able to have
a certain level of resilience,

00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:54.197
knowing that their brain
was more of a muscle

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.711
and not a stone that couldn't
grow any larger.

00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:59.314
Having this resilience,

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:01.596
having students understand

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.885
that their brains can continue to grow,

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.324
allows them the confidence
to struggle with situations,

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:09.038
to wrestle out that information

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:10.715
to come to deeper understanding.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:13.031
So, how does this look in my classroom?

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.579
How do I attempt to get students

00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:17.084
to struggle with information
and wrestle with it

00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:19.793
so they come up with deeper
levels of understanding?

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:22.842
Primarily, I use unanswered questions.

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.304
For example, I'll give students a jar

00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:27.215
and say it's 500 grams,

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:28.812
and inside that sealed jar

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:33.018
is a moist paper towel
with about six to seven seeds.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:34.685
What do you think will happen

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.109
to the mass of the container

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.081
as those seeds begin to grow?

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:40.832
And the students will then write

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:41.943
on a little half-sheet of paper

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.609
what they think is going
to happen and why.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:45.999
Depending on the class,

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:48.656
I will have the students
sometimes work in partners

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.621
to kind of combine ideas,

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:52.741
see what they think
of each other's reasons,

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:54.165
maybe work in groups of four

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:54.874
and then groups of eight

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:56.458
and come to consensus.

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:58.890
But, sometimes, I'll have
the students pass in

00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:01.588
all that information
without conversing about it,

00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:05.211
and I will then read their explanations

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:09.239
so that they are anonymously
presented ideas

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.256
that no student can rely upon

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.935
the other smart students

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.244
to say, 'Oh, I agree with Sally

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.316
because she's always
got the right answer.'

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.085
That rarely happens in my class.

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.984
At this point, I will probably
stop the conversation

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.741
after I've read these out loud

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:27.402
and leave students wondering.

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.905
Wondering, what is the right answer?

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.578
What evidence is good evidence?

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:33.515
Because I want them,

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.566
when they leave the classroom,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.833
to continue to want to know more,

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.695
to continue to want
to make more connections.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.183
So, in addition to unanswered questions,

00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:45.862
I will often pose problems and projects

00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:47.326
for students to work on.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.447
And, when I have them work on

00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.057
these problems and projects,

00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:53.622
I'll give them about 15
to 20 minutes to brainstorm

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:55.186
how to solve the problem

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.419
or how to go about completing the project.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.443
And this 15 to 20 minutes happens

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:01.302
well before I expect a lot of work

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:03.091
to be done on the project.

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:05.214
I don't want them to try
to produce too much

00:03:05.238 --> 00:03:08.796
because I want them to try
to figure out in their brains,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.153
give themselves a chance

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:12.598
to struggle
with the information overnight,

00:03:12.622 --> 00:03:14.865
while they go
about their daily activities.

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.556
For example, I might give a project

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.198
where you need to explain
or teach a 6th grader

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:24.099
the simple concept of endosymbiosis.

00:03:24.123 --> 00:03:27.097
And the students then have

00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:30.496
a whole bunch of questions generated

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.563
related to this project.

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:33.930
They have things that they need to know

00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:34.616
from me,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.870
from other resources.

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:37.974
But I have not given them

00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:40.309
the questions and the answers to memorize,

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:42.516
their brain is actively seeking out

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.230
the understanding of this concept

00:03:44.254 --> 00:03:46.527
so that they can teach it to others.

00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:47.980
We would like to, as teachers,

00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.624
think that students love
everything that we teach them,

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:53.477
and we think
that they understand everything

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.852
and want to engage with our content

00:03:55.876 --> 00:03:58.229
outside of the school day.

00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:00.138
Students don't do that.

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:02.330
Most students don't do that.

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:04.779
So, through mass one-way text messaging,

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:08.286
I'm able to resend them the question

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.114
or the topic from that day.

00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:11.465
To get them to re-engage

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.052
and touch the content one more time.

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:17.392
And, hopefully, get that seed
planted in their brain

00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:19.763
so that they want to think about it more,

00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:21.658
so that their brains come up with

00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:24.689
those "Ah-ha!" moments at obscure times.

00:04:24.713 --> 00:04:30.078
My goal is for students
to generate the story,

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:31.232
their story,

00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:33.061
of the content that I teach.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:34.043
I would love for them

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.023
to completely understand my story

00:04:36.047 --> 00:04:37.633
and understand it deeply,

00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:40.669
but I know if I just get
them to understand it

00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:42.124
as I understand it,

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:45.009
that will simply ooze out of their brains,

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:48.172
and they will not have
information and the knowledge

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:51.131
that is applicable in other situations.

00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:53.046
They will not have knowledge

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.136
that they can ask more questions about.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.972
They are simply
understanding to please me,

00:04:58.996 --> 00:05:01.215
and then it's gone.

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:03.395
"It's not that I'm so smart,

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.787
it's just that I stay
with problems longer."

00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:10.303
We, as teachers, need
to encourage and facilitate

00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:13.806
students staying with problems longer.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.345
Thanks.
