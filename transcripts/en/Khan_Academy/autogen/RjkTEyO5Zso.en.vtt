in this video I want to show some

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010
in this video I want to show some
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.840
in this video I want to show some
examples of graphing quadratic functions

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850
examples of graphing quadratic functions
 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.550
examples of graphing quadratic functions
but before I do that I want to make one

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
but before I do that I want to make one
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.950
but before I do that I want to make one
fairly minor correction to the end of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
fairly minor correction to the end of
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.240
fairly minor correction to the end of
the last video where we did some

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
the last video where we did some
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520
the last video where we did some
factoring with grouping when I showed

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
factoring with grouping when I showed
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.160
factoring with grouping when I showed
you the proof of why that works I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
you the proof of why that works I
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.810
you the proof of why that works I
multiplied F X plus G times HX plus J

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
multiplied F X plus G times HX plus J
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.060
multiplied F X plus G times HX plus J
and when I multiply them when I did the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
and when I multiply them when I did the
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.720
and when I multiply them when I did the
first term I said FX times HX when I did

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
first term I said FX times HX when I did
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.060
first term I said FX times HX when I did
it in the last year I just wrote F H X

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
it in the last year I just wrote F H X
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.860
it in the last year I just wrote F H X
and we know that that's not true we have

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
and we know that that's not true we have
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.350
and we know that that's not true we have
F times H times X times X it's fh x

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360
F times H times X times X it's fh x
 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.410
F times H times X times X it's fh x
squared that times that is fh x squared

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
squared that times that is fh x squared
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.910
squared that times that is fh x squared
and then the rest of it I had gotten

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
and then the rest of it I had gotten
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.430
and then the rest of it I had gotten
right it's FX times J so plus we get F J

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
right it's FX times J so plus we get F J
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.720
right it's FX times J so plus we get F J
X and then we had G times HX so we could

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
X and then we had G times HX so we could
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.479
X and then we had G times HX so we could
write that as plus G H X and then

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
write that as plus G H X and then
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.439
write that as plus G H X and then
finally G times J which gives us G J so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
finally G times J which gives us G J so
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.819
finally G times J which gives us G J so
I apologize for that error I had

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
I apologize for that error I had
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.009
I apologize for that error I had
forgotten to write the exponent there

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
forgotten to write the exponent there
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.450
forgotten to write the exponent there
and I think I had forgotten to write it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
and I think I had forgotten to write it
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.950
and I think I had forgotten to write it
in the step after that but it didn't

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
in the step after that but it didn't
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050
in the step after that but it didn't
change the argument for the proof I at

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
change the argument for the proof I at
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.670
change the argument for the proof I at
least didn't mess up there so I just

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
least didn't mess up there so I just
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.140
least didn't mess up there so I just
want to make that quick correction in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
want to make that quick correction in
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240
want to make that quick correction in
case that confused anyone and I also

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
case that confused anyone and I also
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340
case that confused anyone and I also
made a small annotation in that video if

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
made a small annotation in that video if
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380
made a small annotation in that video if
you're watching it on YouTube with that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
you're watching it on YouTube with that
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020
you're watching it on YouTube with that
out of the way let's learn to graph some

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
out of the way let's learn to graph some
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.570
out of the way let's learn to graph some
of these quadratic functions so let's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
of these quadratic functions so let's
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.679
of these quadratic functions so let's
say I have the function y is equal to x

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689
say I have the function y is equal to x
 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.140
say I have the function y is equal to x
squared minus 2x minus 8 and what we're

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
squared minus 2x minus 8 and what we're
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.190
squared minus 2x minus 8 and what we're
going to do is we're going to rewrite

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
going to do is we're going to rewrite
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289
going to do is we're going to rewrite
this quadratic expression on the right

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
this quadratic expression on the right
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.749
this quadratic expression on the right
hand side we're gonna write it in

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759
hand side we're gonna write it in
 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.859
hand side we're gonna write it in
intercept form and that essentially

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
intercept form and that essentially
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719
intercept form and that essentially
means just writing it in its factored

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
means just writing it in its factored
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580
means just writing it in its factored
form then doing that we're able to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
form then doing that we're able to
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.560
form then doing that we're able to
figure out the x-intercepts where we're

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
figure out the x-intercepts where we're
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810
figure out the x-intercepts where we're
intersecting the x axis and then using

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
intersecting the x axis and then using
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.740
intersecting the x axis and then using
that we'll be able to figure out the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
that we'll be able to figure out the
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270
that we'll be able to figure out the
vertex and I'll show you what the vertex

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
vertex and I'll show you what the vertex
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219
vertex and I'll show you what the vertex
is in a second so let's just factor this

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
is in a second so let's just factor this
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.590
is in a second so let's just factor this
this quadratic on the right hand side so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
this quadratic on the right hand side so
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.649
this quadratic on the right hand side so
we get Y is equal to so what are two

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
we get Y is equal to so what are two
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200
we get Y is equal to so what are two
numbers where their product is negative

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
numbers where their product is negative
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.670
numbers where their product is negative
8 so they're gonna have different signs

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
8 so they're gonna have different signs
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.389
8 so they're gonna have different signs
and then their difference is negative 2

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399
and then their difference is negative 2
 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.219
and then their difference is negative 2
well let's see if we have negative 4

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
well let's see if we have negative 4
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.430
well let's see if we have negative 4
negative 4 and plus 2 when you take the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
negative 4 and plus 2 when you take the
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.720
negative 4 and plus 2 when you take the
product you get negative 8 when you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730
product you get negative 8 when you
 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.470
product you get negative 8 when you
add them you get negative two so we

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
add them you get negative two so we
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.920
add them you get negative two so we
could rewrite why is being equal to X

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
could rewrite why is being equal to X
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.500
could rewrite why is being equal to X
minus four times X plus two so this is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
minus four times X plus two so this is
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.149
minus four times X plus two so this is
essentially writing this quadratic

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159
essentially writing this quadratic
 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.970
essentially writing this quadratic
function in intercept form and now let's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
function in intercept form and now let's
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.800
function in intercept form and now let's
figure out where this intersects the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
figure out where this intersects the
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.890
figure out where this intersects the
x-axis so let me label my axes this is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
x-axis so let me label my axes this is
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.860
x-axis so let me label my axes this is
of course the x axis that is the y axis

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870
of course the x axis that is the y axis
 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.050
of course the x axis that is the y axis
so when will something intersect the x

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
so when will something intersect the x
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.630
so when will something intersect the x
axis the x axis is when y is equal to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640
axis the x axis is when y is equal to
 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.210
axis the x axis is when y is equal to
zero right so let's set this equal to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220
zero right so let's set this equal to
 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.520
zero right so let's set this equal to
zero zero is equal to X minus 4 times X

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530
zero zero is equal to X minus 4 times X
 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.030
zero zero is equal to X minus 4 times X
plus 2 we've seen this multiple times

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
plus 2 we've seen this multiple times
 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.580
plus 2 we've seen this multiple times
before this means that either X minus 4

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590
before this means that either X minus 4
 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.130
before this means that either X minus 4
or X plus 2 or both of them have to be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140
or X plus 2 or both of them have to be
 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.490
or X plus 2 or both of them have to be
equal to 0 so X minus 4 is equal to 0 or

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
equal to 0 so X minus 4 is equal to 0 or
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.210
equal to 0 so X minus 4 is equal to 0 or
X plus 2 is equal to 0 so that means X

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220
X plus 2 is equal to 0 so that means X
 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.490
X plus 2 is equal to 0 so that means X
could be equal to 4 we're just adding 4

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500
could be equal to 4 we're just adding 4
 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.059
could be equal to 4 we're just adding 4
to both sides of that equation or

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069
to both sides of that equation or
 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.289
to both sides of that equation or
subtracting 2 from both sides of this

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299
subtracting 2 from both sides of this
 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.589
subtracting 2 from both sides of this
equation X could be equal to negative 2

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599
equation X could be equal to negative 2
 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.650
equation X could be equal to negative 2
so these points where we intersect when

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660
so these points where we intersect when
 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.710
so these points where we intersect when
X is 4 this term is 0 so the whole thing

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
X is 4 this term is 0 so the whole thing
 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.809
X is 4 this term is 0 so the whole thing
is 0 Y is 0 that's how we solved for

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819
is 0 Y is 0 that's how we solved for
 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.960
is 0 Y is 0 that's how we solved for
this so the points 4 comma 0

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
this so the points 4 comma 0
 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.839
this so the points 4 comma 0
and the point negative 2 comma 0 are

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849
and the point negative 2 comma 0 are
 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.059
and the point negative 2 comma 0 are
going to both be on this parabola so

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069
going to both be on this parabola so
 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.330
going to both be on this parabola so
let's graph them so 4 comma 0 let me do

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340
let's graph them so 4 comma 0 let me do
 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.199
let's graph them so 4 comma 0 let me do
this in a darker color 1 2 3 4 that's 4

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209
this in a darker color 1 2 3 4 that's 4
 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.030
this in a darker color 1 2 3 4 that's 4
comma 0 and then the other point is

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040
comma 0 and then the other point is
 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.860
comma 0 and then the other point is
negative 2 comma 0 1 2 negative 2 comma

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870
negative 2 comma 0 1 2 negative 2 comma
 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.110
negative 2 comma 0 1 2 negative 2 comma
0 is right there so that's the two

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
0 is right there so that's the two
 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.890
0 is right there so that's the two
points where we intersect the x axis and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900
points where we intersect the x axis and
 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.180
points where we intersect the x axis and
now we're going to determine something

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190
now we're going to determine something
 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.819
now we're going to determine something
called the vertex of our parabola and

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829
called the vertex of our parabola and
 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.650
called the vertex of our parabola and
the vertex you can kind of view it as

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
the vertex you can kind of view it as
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.780
the vertex you can kind of view it as

preview parabolas are the graphs of

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609
preview parabolas are the graphs of
 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.909
preview parabolas are the graphs of
quadratic functions and so the graph is

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919
quadratic functions and so the graph is
 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.800
quadratic functions and so the graph is
going to look either like an upward U or

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810
going to look either like an upward U or
 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.629
going to look either like an upward U or
a downward u it's gonna be shifted

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639
a downward u it's gonna be shifted
 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.939
a downward u it's gonna be shifted
around on this but the vertex is either

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949
around on this but the vertex is either
 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.610
around on this but the vertex is either
this minimum point or this maximum point

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620
this minimum point or this maximum point
 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.129
this minimum point or this maximum point
and the word parabola just describes

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139
and the word parabola just describes
 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.740
and the word parabola just describes
this function shape it's the shape of

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750
this function shape it's the shape of
 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.290
this function shape it's the shape of
the graph of a quadratic let me write

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300
the graph of a quadratic let me write
 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.659
the graph of a quadratic let me write
that

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669
that
 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.999
that
these are parabolas parabolas so to

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009
these are parabolas parabolas so to
 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.429
these are parabolas parabolas so to
figure out the vertex you actually just

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439
figure out the vertex you actually just
 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.499
figure out the vertex you actually just
take the x-value that's halfway in

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509
take the x-value that's halfway in
 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.869
take the x-value that's halfway in
between the two intercepts no matter

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879
between the two intercepts no matter
 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.939
between the two intercepts no matter
what the intercepts are going to be

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949
what the intercepts are going to be
 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.490
what the intercepts are going to be
equidistant from the vertex are going to

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500
equidistant from the vertex are going to
 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.290
equidistant from the vertex are going to
be equidistant from the vertex so that

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
be equidistant from the vertex so that
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.689
be equidistant from the vertex so that
is the graph those would be our

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699
is the graph those would be our
 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.790
is the graph those would be our
intercepts and then our vertex is going

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800
intercepts and then our vertex is going
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.959
intercepts and then our vertex is going
to be an x-value exactly halfway between

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969
to be an x-value exactly halfway between
 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.510
to be an x-value exactly halfway between
them so to figure out the x-value of our

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520
them so to figure out the x-value of our
 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.540
them so to figure out the x-value of our
vertex we just average these two x

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550
vertex we just average these two x
 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.230
vertex we just average these two x
values of our x-intercepts so let's do

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240
values of our x-intercepts so let's do
 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.909
values of our x-intercepts so let's do
that so we could say the X for the

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919
that so we could say the X for the
 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.279
that so we could say the X for the
vertex we could call it that well let's

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289
vertex we could call it that well let's
 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.749
vertex we could call it that well let's
call that well yes it's called that X

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759
call that well yes it's called that X
 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.640
call that well yes it's called that X
for the vertex so that's why I wrote a V

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650
for the vertex so that's why I wrote a V
 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.100
for the vertex so that's why I wrote a V
there is going to be equal to the

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110
there is going to be equal to the
 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.350
there is going to be equal to the
average of these so four plus negative

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360
average of these so four plus negative
 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.980
average of these so four plus negative
two over two which is equal to this 4

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990
two over two which is equal to this 4
 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.820
two over two which is equal to this 4
minus 2 which is 2 over 2 is equal to 1

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830
minus 2 which is 2 over 2 is equal to 1
 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.700
minus 2 which is 2 over 2 is equal to 1
so X is going to be equal to 1 and what

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710
so X is going to be equal to 1 and what
 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.529
so X is going to be equal to 1 and what
is y when X is equal to 1 so Y the Y for

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539
is y when X is equal to 1 so Y the Y for
 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.450
is y when X is equal to 1 so Y the Y for
the vertex is going to be equal to 1

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460
the vertex is going to be equal to 1
 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.730
the vertex is going to be equal to 1
squared 1 squared I'll just write that

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740
squared 1 squared I'll just write that
 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.100
squared 1 squared I'll just write that
as 1 minus 2 times 1 so minus 2 minus 8

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110
as 1 minus 2 times 1 so minus 2 minus 8
 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.180
as 1 minus 2 times 1 so minus 2 minus 8
so what is this this is 1 minus 10 which

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190
so what is this this is 1 minus 10 which
 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.269
so what is this this is 1 minus 10 which
is equal to negative 9 so the vertex is

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279
is equal to negative 9 so the vertex is
 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.519
is equal to negative 9 so the vertex is
going to be at the point 1 comma

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:47.529
going to be at the point 1 comma
 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.670
going to be at the point 1 comma
negative 9 so we go 1 and then we go

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680
negative 9 so we go 1 and then we go
 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.600
negative 9 so we go 1 and then we go
down 9 so X is 1 and then Y is negative

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610
down 9 so X is 1 and then Y is negative
 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.499
down 9 so X is 1 and then Y is negative
9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so it's right there

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509
9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so it's right there
 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.619
9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so it's right there
and so if we were to graph this parabola

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629
and so if we were to graph this parabola
 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.510
and so if we were to graph this parabola
the line of symmetry is on the x value

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520
the line of symmetry is on the x value
 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.459
the line of symmetry is on the x value
of the vertex so let me do it in the

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469
of the vertex so let me do it in the
 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.790
of the vertex so let me do it in the
darker color than that so the graph

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800
darker color than that so the graph
 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.619
darker color than that so the graph
should be symmetric around X is equal to

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629
should be symmetric around X is equal to
 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:19.540
should be symmetric around X is equal to
1 and the graph will look something like

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550
1 and the graph will look something like
 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.629
1 and the graph will look something like
this I'll try my best to draw it BAM

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639
this I'll try my best to draw it BAM
 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.369
this I'll try my best to draw it BAM
it'll intersect the x-axis there and

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379
it'll intersect the x-axis there and
 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.290
it'll intersect the x-axis there and
it'll be symmetric and look just like

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300
it'll be symmetric and look just like
 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.619
it'll be symmetric and look just like
that on the other side and it'll go BAM

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629
that on the other side and it'll go BAM
 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.600
that on the other side and it'll go BAM
just like that I think you get the

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610
just like that I think you get the
 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.490
just like that I think you get the
general idea and then the other point

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500
general idea and then the other point
 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.110
general idea and then the other point
that you may or may not be interested is

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120
that you may or may not be interested is
 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.689
that you may or may not be interested is
the actual y-intercept if X is equal to

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699
the actual y-intercept if X is equal to
 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:38.450
the actual y-intercept if X is equal to
0 you mean

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460
0 you mean
 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.580
0 you mean
see that y is equal to negative 8 so the

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590
see that y is equal to negative 8 so the
 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.460
see that y is equal to negative 8 so the
point 0 negative 8 should also be on

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470
point 0 negative 8 should also be on
 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.200
point 0 negative 8 should also be on
this graph and let's see if I drew it

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210
this graph and let's see if I drew it
 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.409
this graph and let's see if I drew it
right 0 negative 8 right there should

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419
right 0 negative 8 right there should
 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.870
right 0 negative 8 right there should
also be on that graph let's do another

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880
also be on that graph let's do another
 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.330
also be on that graph let's do another
one of these let's do another one

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340
one of these let's do another one
 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.020
one of these let's do another one
and let me I'm kind of taking up some of

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030
and let me I'm kind of taking up some of
 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.460
and let me I'm kind of taking up some of
the space for the next problem so let me

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470
the space for the next problem so let me
 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.350
the space for the next problem so let me
clear this let's do another one all

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360
clear this let's do another one all
 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.430
clear this let's do another one all
right so let's say we have let's say we

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440
right so let's say we have let's say we
 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:15.980
right so let's say we have let's say we
have y is equal to 2x squared plus 6x

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990
have y is equal to 2x squared plus 6x
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.770
have y is equal to 2x squared plus 6x
plus 6x plus 4 so here the thing that

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780
plus 6x plus 4 so here the thing that
 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.120
plus 6x plus 4 so here the thing that
immediately strut jumps out at me is

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130
immediately strut jumps out at me is
 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.860
immediately strut jumps out at me is
that I can factor a 2 out of everything

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870
that I can factor a 2 out of everything
 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.629
that I can factor a 2 out of everything
so I could rewrite this as Y is equal to

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639
so I could rewrite this as Y is equal to
 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:32.210
so I could rewrite this as Y is equal to
2 times x squared plus 3x plus 2 that

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220
2 times x squared plus 3x plus 2 that
 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.460
2 times x squared plus 3x plus 2 that
saves me the pain of having to do the

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470
saves me the pain of having to do the
 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.379
saves me the pain of having to do the
factoring by grouping that we talked

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389
factoring by grouping that we talked
 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.210
factoring by grouping that we talked
about in the last video and this we can

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220
about in the last video and this we can
 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.740
about in the last video and this we can
factor in a pretty straightforward way

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750
factor in a pretty straightforward way
 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.760
factor in a pretty straightforward way
this is C 2 times 1 is 2 2 plus 1 is 3

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770
this is C 2 times 1 is 2 2 plus 1 is 3
 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:49.550
this is C 2 times 1 is 2 2 plus 1 is 3
so this is X plus 2 times X plus 1 right

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560
so this is X plus 2 times X plus 1 right
 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.020
so this is X plus 2 times X plus 1 right
2 plus 1 is 3 2 times 1 is 2 so that's

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.030
2 plus 1 is 3 2 times 1 is 2 so that's
 

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.390
2 plus 1 is 3 2 times 1 is 2 so that's
what Y is equal to so if we wanted to

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400
what Y is equal to so if we wanted to
 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.439
what Y is equal to so if we wanted to
know the the x-intercepts we figure out

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:00.449
know the the x-intercepts we figure out
 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:02.839
know the the x-intercepts we figure out
where this expression is equal to 0 so

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:02.849
where this expression is equal to 0 so
 

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.680
where this expression is equal to 0 so
we said 0 is equal to 2 times X plus 2

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:05.690
we said 0 is equal to 2 times X plus 2
 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.390
we said 0 is equal to 2 times X plus 2
times X plus 1 remember we want to

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400
times X plus 1 remember we want to
 

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.310
times X plus 1 remember we want to
figure out where we intercept the x-axis

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.320
figure out where we intercept the x-axis
 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.550
figure out where we intercept the x-axis
that's the x-axis there Y is 0 on the

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560
that's the x-axis there Y is 0 on the
 

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.890
that's the x-axis there Y is 0 on the
x-axis so sorry my phone was ringing so

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900
x-axis so sorry my phone was ringing so
 

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.510
x-axis so sorry my phone was ringing so
let's get back to this problem so either

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520
let's get back to this problem so either
 

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.370
let's get back to this problem so either
of these 1/2 can be equal to 0 obviously

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:25.380
of these 1/2 can be equal to 0 obviously
 

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.649
of these 1/2 can be equal to 0 obviously
the two can be equal to 0 so we get the

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:27.659
the two can be equal to 0 so we get the
 

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:30.770
the two can be equal to 0 so we get the
situation where X minus X plus 2 is

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780
situation where X minus X plus 2 is
 

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.209
situation where X minus X plus 2 is
equal to 0 or X plus 1 is equal to 0 I

00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219
equal to 0 or X plus 1 is equal to 0 I
 

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:36.050
equal to 0 or X plus 1 is equal to 0 I
didn't have to write the parentheses

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060
didn't have to write the parentheses
 

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.750
didn't have to write the parentheses
there subtract 2 from both sides of this

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760
there subtract 2 from both sides of this
 

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.880
there subtract 2 from both sides of this
equation we get X is equal to negative 2

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:40.890
equation we get X is equal to negative 2
 

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.040
equation we get X is equal to negative 2
subtract 1 from both sides of this

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.050
subtract 1 from both sides of this
 

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.760
subtract 1 from both sides of this
equation or X could be equal to negative

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:46.770
equation or X could be equal to negative
 

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.840
equation or X could be equal to negative
1 so the points negative 2 comma 0 you

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:50.850
1 so the points negative 2 comma 0 you
 

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.310
1 so the points negative 2 comma 0 you
put negative 2 here this obviously

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320
put negative 2 here this obviously
 

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.120
put negative 2 here this obviously
going to make y is equal to zero and and

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:30.510
that's our 3 that's our 1 2 3 just like
 

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.950
that's our 3 that's our 1 2 3 just like
that negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 so

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:33.960
that negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 so
 

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.500
that negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 so
I'm using two blocks to represent one so

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.510
I'm using two blocks to represent one so
 

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.600
I'm using two blocks to represent one so
the point negative 2 comma zero is on

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:38.610
the point negative 2 comma zero is on
 

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.550
the point negative 2 comma zero is on
our graph or it's our x intercept so

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560
our graph or it's our x intercept so
 

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.890
our graph or it's our x intercept so
negative 2 comma 0 is right there and we

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:42.900
negative 2 comma 0 is right there and we
 

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.170
negative 2 comma 0 is right there and we
have negative 1 comma 0 which is right

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.180
have negative 1 comma 0 which is right
 

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.780
have negative 1 comma 0 which is right
there and then we want to figure out the

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:47.790
there and then we want to figure out the
 

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.420
there and then we want to figure out the
vertex well the vertex is going to be

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:50.430
vertex well the vertex is going to be
 

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.120
vertex well the vertex is going to be
the average of those two so the X for

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.130
the average of those two so the X for
 

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.710
the average of those two so the X for
the vertex is going to be negative 2

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720
the vertex is going to be negative 2
 

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.520
the vertex is going to be negative 2
plus negative 1 over 2 that's negative 3

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:58.530
plus negative 1 over 2 that's negative 3
 

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.200
plus negative 1 over 2 that's negative 3
over 2 which is the same thing as

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.210
over 2 which is the same thing as
 

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.400
over 2 which is the same thing as
negative 1.5 now what is y equal to when

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.410
negative 1.5 now what is y equal to when
 

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.410
negative 1.5 now what is y equal to when
X is negative one point 5 is going to be

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420
X is negative one point 5 is going to be
 

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.240
X is negative one point 5 is going to be
a little bit involved I'll use actual 3

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.250
a little bit involved I'll use actual 3
 

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.560
a little bit involved I'll use actual 3
halves so we get Y is equal to Y is

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:12.570
halves so we get Y is equal to Y is
 

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.450
halves so we get Y is equal to Y is
equal to 2 times negative 3 halves

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:16.460
equal to 2 times negative 3 halves
 

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.460
equal to 2 times negative 3 halves
squared plus 6 times negative 3 halves

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:21.470
squared plus 6 times negative 3 halves
 

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.420
squared plus 6 times negative 3 halves
plus 4 and let us figure this out so

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.430
plus 4 and let us figure this out so
 

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.730
plus 4 and let us figure this out so
this is equal to 2 times 9 over 4 minus

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740
this is equal to 2 times 9 over 4 minus
 

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.080
this is equal to 2 times 9 over 4 minus
you have that negative sign there and

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.090
you have that negative sign there and
 

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.120
you have that negative sign there and
then we could make this 6 divided by 2

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.130
then we could make this 6 divided by 2
 

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.910
then we could make this 6 divided by 2
is just the same thing as 3 over 1 so

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920
is just the same thing as 3 over 1 so
 

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.490
is just the same thing as 3 over 1 so
this is minus 9 3 times 3 plus 4 this 2

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500
this is minus 9 3 times 3 plus 4 this 2
 

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.790
this is minus 9 3 times 3 plus 4 this 2
over 4 is the same thing as 1 over 2 so

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800
over 4 is the same thing as 1 over 2 so
 

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.000
over 4 is the same thing as 1 over 2 so
this becomes 9 halves minus 9 plus 4 so

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.010
this becomes 9 halves minus 9 plus 4 so
 

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.880
this becomes 9 halves minus 9 plus 4 so
let's simplify this minus 9 plus 4 is

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:55.890
let's simplify this minus 9 plus 4 is
 

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.840
let's simplify this minus 9 plus 4 is
the same thing as minus 5 right minus 9

00:10:59.840 --> 00:10:59.850
the same thing as minus 5 right minus 9
 

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.110
the same thing as minus 5 right minus 9
plus 4 minus 5 we can rewrite is equal

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120
plus 4 minus 5 we can rewrite is equal
 

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.040
plus 4 minus 5 we can rewrite is equal
to minus 10 over 2

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.050
to minus 10 over 2
 

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:11.690
to minus 10 over 2
9-10 all of that over 2 is minus 1/2 so

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700
9-10 all of that over 2 is minus 1/2 so
 

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.600
9-10 all of that over 2 is minus 1/2 so

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.190
and then we can graph this parabola it
 

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.140
and then we can graph this parabola it

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.000
form we just factor the right-hand side
we get Y is equal to well the first

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.010
we get Y is equal to well the first
 

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.930
we get Y is equal to well the first
thing I want to do is factor this

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940
thing I want to do is factor this
 

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.480
thing I want to do is factor this
negative 1 out negative 1 times x

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.490
negative 1 out negative 1 times x
 

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.350
negative 1 out negative 1 times x
squared minus 10x plus 21

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360
squared minus 10x plus 21
 

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.750
squared minus 10x plus 21
now what two numbers when I multiply

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760
now what two numbers when I multiply
 

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.760
now what two numbers when I multiply
them they're positive 21 so they have to

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:34.770
them they're positive 21 so they have to
 

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.890
them they're positive 21 so they have to
be the same side and when I add them I

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:36.900
be the same side and when I add them I
 

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.750
be the same side and when I add them I
get negative 10 at least in my brain

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760
get negative 10 at least in my brain
 

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.090
get negative 10 at least in my brain
negative 7 and negative 3 jump out I

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100
negative 7 and negative 3 jump out I
 

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.830
negative 7 and negative 3 jump out I
mean there's not that many factors of 21

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:42.840
mean there's not that many factors of 21
 

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.230
mean there's not that many factors of 21
so 7 and 3 are probably 2 that

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240
so 7 and 3 are probably 2 that
 

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.730
so 7 and 3 are probably 2 that
immediately jump out because they add to

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740
immediately jump out because they add to
 

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.090
immediately jump out because they add to
10 so you have Y is equal to negative 1

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100
10 so you have Y is equal to negative 1
 

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.130
10 so you have Y is equal to negative 1
times X minus 3 times X minus 7 negative

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:55.140
times X minus 3 times X minus 7 negative
 

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.960
times X minus 3 times X minus 7 negative
3 plus negative 7 is negative 10

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:56.970
3 plus negative 7 is negative 10
 

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.960
3 plus negative 7 is negative 10
negative 3 times negative 7 is positive

00:12:59.960 --> 00:12:59.970
negative 3 times negative 7 is positive
 

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.360
negative 3 times negative 7 is positive
21 so if you want to find the

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:02.370
21 so if you want to find the
 

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.550
21 so if you want to find the
x-intercepts the x-intercepts are going

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.980
x-intercepts the x-intercepts are going
to be where so we could set this whole

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:06.990
to be where so we could set this whole
 

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.380
to be where so we could set this whole
equation equal to 0 negative 1 times X

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:09.390

or the X values that make y equal to 0

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:15.630
or the X values that make y equal to 0
 

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.140
or the X values that make y equal to 0
are either the ones that make X minus 3

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:18.150
are either the ones that make X minus 3
 

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.369
are either the ones that make X minus 3

00:13:19.369 --> 00:13:19.379
equal to 0
 

00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:21.769
equal to 0
or the X values that make X minus seven

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779
or the X values that make X minus seven
 

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:24.139
or the X values that make X minus seven
equal to zero add three to both sides of

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:24.149
equal to zero add three to both sides of
 

00:13:24.149 --> 00:13:25.789

this equation you get X is equal to

00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:25.799
this equation you get X is equal to
 

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:28.639
this equation you get X is equal to
three add three to both add 7 to both

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:28.649

seven so we get our two x-intercepts the

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839
seven so we get our two x-intercepts the
 

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:39.619
seven so we get our two x-intercepts the
point 3 0 1 2 3 0 and the point 7 0 1 2

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:39.629
point 3 0 1 2 3 0 and the point 7 0 1 2
 

00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:45.739
point 3 0 1 2 3 0 and the point 7 0 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 0 now we know that our vertex

00:13:45.739 --> 00:13:45.749
3 4 5 6 7 0 now we know that our vertex
 

00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:47.989
3 4 5 6 7 0 now we know that our vertex
is going to be right in between them so

00:13:47.989 --> 00:13:47.999
is going to be right in between them so
 

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:50.389
is going to be right in between them so
the X for the vertex is going to be 3

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399
the X for the vertex is going to be 3
 

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:54.079
the X for the vertex is going to be 3
plus 7 over 2 which is equal to 10 over

00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:54.089
plus 7 over 2 which is equal to 10 over
 

00:13:54.089 --> 00:13:57.469
plus 7 over 2 which is equal to 10 over
2 which is equal to 5 and the Y value

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:57.479
2 which is equal to 5 and the Y value
 

00:13:57.479 --> 00:13:58.789
2 which is equal to 5 and the Y value
let's figure it out

00:13:58.789 --> 00:13:58.799
let's figure it out
 

00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:03.039
let's figure it out
y for our vertex is going to be negative

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:03.049
y for our vertex is going to be negative
 

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:06.759
y for our vertex is going to be negative
negative 5 squared so negative 25 plus

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:06.769
negative 5 squared so negative 25 plus
 

00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:14.299
negative 5 squared so negative 25 plus
10 times 5 plus 50 minus 21 minus 21 so

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:14.309
10 times 5 plus 50 minus 21 minus 21 so
 

00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:17.559
10 times 5 plus 50 minus 21 minus 21 so
what is this this is equal to we have a

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:17.569
what is this this is equal to we have a
 

00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:20.899
what is this this is equal to we have a
negative 25 a negative 21 you add those

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:20.909
negative 25 a negative 21 you add those
 

00:14:20.909 --> 00:14:24.049
negative 25 a negative 21 you add those
together you get a negative 46 add that

00:14:24.049 --> 00:14:24.059
together you get a negative 46 add that
 

00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:28.129
together you get a negative 46 add that
to 50 you get Y is equal to 4 so the

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139
to 50 you get Y is equal to 4 so the
 

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:31.399
to 50 you get Y is equal to 4 so the
vertex is at five comma four five comma

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:31.409
vertex is at five comma four five comma
 

00:14:31.409 --> 00:14:35.059
vertex is at five comma four five comma
four let me graph that the vertex is 5

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:35.069
four let me graph that the vertex is 5
 

00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:40.099
four let me graph that the vertex is 5
comma 4 so 1 2 3 4 5 right in between

00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:40.109
comma 4 so 1 2 3 4 5 right in between
 

00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:44.149
comma 4 so 1 2 3 4 5 right in between
and then up 4 1 2 3 4 so notice

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:44.159
and then up 4 1 2 3 4 so notice
 

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:46.489
and then up 4 1 2 3 4 so notice
something in this graph over here the

00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:46.499
something in this graph over here the
 

00:14:46.499 --> 00:14:47.989
something in this graph over here the
last two graphs actually I think I just

00:14:47.989 --> 00:14:47.999
last two graphs actually I think I just
 

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:51.229
last two graphs actually I think I just
cleared them you saw that the you saw

00:14:51.229 --> 00:14:51.239
cleared them you saw that the you saw
 

00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:54.019
cleared them you saw that the you saw
that the vertex was below the x-axis so

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:54.029
that the vertex was below the x-axis so
 

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:57.319
that the vertex was below the x-axis so
when we plotted the x-intercepts and

00:14:57.319 --> 00:14:57.329
when we plotted the x-intercepts and
 

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:59.419
when we plotted the x-intercepts and
then the vertex the upward forming

00:14:59.419 --> 00:14:59.429
then the vertex the upward forming
 

00:14:59.429 --> 00:15:02.599
then the vertex the upward forming
u-shape was the only option but here the

00:15:02.599 --> 00:15:02.609
u-shape was the only option but here the
 

00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:04.879
u-shape was the only option but here the
only option is a downward u shape in

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:04.889
only option is a downward u shape in
 

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:07.309
only option is a downward u shape in
order to this being a either the minimum

00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:07.319
order to this being a either the minimum
 

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:08.840
order to this being a either the minimum
maximum point and going through both of

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:08.850
maximum point and going through both of
 

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.299
maximum point and going through both of
these points and having a u-shape ru is

00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:11.309
these points and having a u-shape ru is
 

00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:12.409
these points and having a u-shape ru is
going to have to look something like

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:12.419
going to have to look something like
 

00:15:12.419 --> 00:15:16.549
going to have to look something like
this now you let me draw that a little

00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:16.559
this now you let me draw that a little
 

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:20.149
this now you let me draw that a little
bit better the U is the U is going to

00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:20.159
bit better the U is the U is going to
 

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:23.689
bit better the U is the U is going to
have to look something like that that's

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699
have to look something like that that's
 

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:26.659
have to look something like that that's
a better better shot at it now notice

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:26.669
a better better shot at it now notice
 

00:15:26.669 --> 00:15:28.819
a better better shot at it now notice
what was the difference between this

00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:28.829
what was the difference between this
 

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:31.340
what was the difference between this
equation and the previous ones the

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:31.350
equation and the previous ones the
 

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.990
equation and the previous ones the
difference was is that this one

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000
difference was is that this one
 

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.450
difference was is that this one
had a negative in front of the x squared

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:35.460
had a negative in front of the x squared
 

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.370
had a negative in front of the x squared
the coefficient in front of the x

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380
the coefficient in front of the x
 

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.250
the coefficient in front of the x
squared was a negative number and that's

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260
squared was a negative number and that's
 

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.110
squared was a negative number and that's
why we have kind of a downward-opening

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120
why we have kind of a downward-opening
 

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.450
why we have kind of a downward-opening
parabola if this was a positive number

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:44.460
parabola if this was a positive number
 

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.720
parabola if this was a positive number
we would have an upward an

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:46.730
we would have an upward an
 

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.830
we would have an upward an
upward-opening parabola so that's why

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:48.840
upward-opening parabola so that's why
 

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.690
upward-opening parabola so that's why
this one is kind of a downward shape and

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:50.700
this one is kind of a downward shape and
 

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.910
this one is kind of a downward shape and
it's vertex represents a maximum point

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920
it's vertex represents a maximum point
 

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.560
it's vertex represents a maximum point
it's the highest point on the parabola

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:54.570
it's the highest point on the parabola
 

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.080
it's the highest point on the parabola
in the previous videos we had an upward

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.090
in the previous videos we had an upward
 

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.420
in the previous videos we had an upward
opening or in the previous problems we

00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.430
opening or in the previous problems we
 

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.430
opening or in the previous problems we
had an upward opening parabola and our

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440
had an upward opening parabola and our
 

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.970
had an upward opening parabola and our
vertex was the minimum point
