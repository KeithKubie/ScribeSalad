00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.660
For most of history, religion has been a central focus of human concerns.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.340
But now in large parts of the developed world, it's become a side show or even an irrelevance.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.380
Because its been declared untrue by the most powerful force of our age:

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.560
Science

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.460
But debating whether religion is true or not may not in the end be the most important move we can make.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.280
Its also key to understand what needs have traditionally driven people to religion.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.300
So we can go on recognizing and answering these needs,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.160
even outside a supernatural structure.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.700
4000 BC, Arnhem land, Australia

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.580
An aboriginal Australian paints an image of a serpent on a rock.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
The so-called Yingarna Serpent is a key part of aboriginal religion.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.380
This creature and a few other associated
divine serpents are worshiped for having done everything:

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
[They] created the sky, the lagoons the
mountains, they colored the birds, they

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.190
decreed laws relating to marriage, food
distribution and death ceremonies.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.680
The serpents also generate rain and storms when anyone breaks the rules of the tribes.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.700
The belief structure of the early
Australians is almost identical to that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.580
found in primitive religions pretty much
everywhere around our planet.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.920
Religion has its origins in a desire to
explain a very confusing world.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.420
It is a wild projection onto the natural
realm of all kinds of human concerns.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.920
It becomes the focus of rituals to appease
the possibly angry gods.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.440
Offerings are made in return one hopes for favors and kindness.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.000
Always there is the terror of death and the hope that the worst of it
can be handled by an alliance with the gods.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.060
One comes away from the study of
primitive religions full of compassion

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.710
for the terrors and confusion that were
responsible for generating these beliefs.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.909
And for the frightening ignorance in
which our for-bearers were fated to live.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.920
But one also comes away with respect for
our own psychological ingenuity,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.119
For our cleverness in telling ourselves stories to calm ourselves down,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.330
hold the community together and deal
with the unknown.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.490
400 BC, Kushinagar, India

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.130
A kind philosophical Indian prince, Siddhārtha Gautama meets his end,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.420
his other title Buddha means awakened or enlightened one.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.860
He teaches his followers of whom they
will soon be millions, to expect constant suffering in life

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.340
but also to strive to detach themselves from their immediate circumstances

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.600
and the anxious spasms of what Buddhists call the "monkey mind" through reflection and meditation.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.920
In Buddhism we see a characteristic attempt

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.690
of religion to calm the minds of
followers in relation to anxiety, poverty, illness and death.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.940
The task of religion is to keep us hopeful,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.100
to stop our minds caving in to terror

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.620
and to hold our
hands through the worst last days of our lives.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.250
1025 AD, Song Dynasty, China

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.860
A sculptor produces this representation of a beautiful kindly female Buddhist deity
called Guanyin.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.160
Guanyin is the Buddhist counterpart of the Virgin Mary.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.380
And she fulfills a similar role as this lady:

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.220
that of hearing us in our distress,
meeting us with tenderness and

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.290
strengthening us to face the tasks of
life.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.250
The centrality of these maternal figures
in both Buddhism and Christianity

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.490
suggest that mature adult lives

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.290
share moments of terrible and lacerating
self-doubt which breed longings to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.890
recover some of the security and
coziness of childhood.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.600
Being reasonable and adult doesn't always work.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.120
In our worst crisis we regress,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.720
we want to be held and understood and forgiving like we were five years old.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.680
All this religion knows, honors and does
not mock us for.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.040
1133, Winchester, England

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.840
The poorest people in the parish of Winchester in Southern

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.920
England take up residence in hospitals
?? and the almshouse of noble poverty.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.110
This is the oldest charitable
institution in the United Kingdom,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.190
founded by the Bishop of Winchester who
has read the Gospels thoroughly and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.440
taken inspiration from Jesus command to
treat the poorest with special dignity.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.490
They're destined for the poorest, the
almshouses are built on the scale of an

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.430
Oxford or Cambridge College with the
most beautiful noble architecture of the day.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.880
The almshouses are typical example
of a theme found in all world religions:

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.060
that of charity and of the duty of the
rich towards the poor.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.500
That there may be a regressive aspect of this, religions can be praised for moderating egoistic

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.660
impulses and urging the powerful to
think of the defenseless.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.460
It can be tempting to think of the poor
as evil and responsible for their fate

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.140
but religions ask the powerful to
imagine them always as unfortunate and

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.290
worthy of a special place in the divine
scheme.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.610
1543, Nuremberg, Germany

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.419
Nicolaus Copernicus publishes "On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres".

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.160
This post a heliocentric view of the
universe rather than geocentric version

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.480
widely accepted at the time and based on
the book of Joshua.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.240
In 1616 the Catholic Church moves to declare this heliocentric theory nonsense

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.180
and angrily bands Copernicus's
work.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.150
However, Copernicus's revolution will not
be quelled.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.960
Galileo Galilei will defend the system in "The Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems" published in 1632.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.760
Again the papacy is furious.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.060
It curses Copernicus once more and put Galileo under house arrest.

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.779
It's tempting to laugh at the catholic
church

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.000
but the church is trying to hold on to something rather lovely that had
served humankind well:

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.360
the idea of our cosmic significance.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.550
The idea that we matter, that someone out
there cares.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.230
Copernicus and Galileo's theories are like
the very painful end of the childhood of man kind.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.600
Their discoveries that we are
but a tiny forgotten meaningless blue dodge in the randomness of space

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.760
is akin to a child discovering that his or her parents are in truth really unimportant
in the scheme of things.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.660
A new existential terror will echo down the
ages from these scientific discoveries.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.549
We are still dealing with it.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.020
July 1830, London, England

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.589
Charles Lyell publishes the first of
three volumes of his geological masterpiece:

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.260
Principles of Geology.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.080
The book uses new geological methods to show

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:35.629
that the earth is far older than was
ever previously believed.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.560
The Bible had said it was 6000 years old.

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:43.099
Lyle says the fossil record proves it
must be at least 240 million years old,

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.729
based on this observation of marine
fossils.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.620
Modern science now puts it at 4.5 billion years.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.400
In response to Lyle's discoveries the British social critic and essayist John Ruskin

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.080
abandons belief.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.770
He says his faith has been beaten to the
thinness of a gold leaf by such rockbound evidence.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.539
If only the geologists would
leave me alone he writes I could do very

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.120
well but those dreadful hammers

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.660
I hear the clink of them at the end of
every cadence of the bible verses.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.900
Science now makes it almost impossible
for any intelligent person to believe in

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:18.749
the Bible is literally true.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.520
1835 Tübingen, Germany

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.180
27 year old David Friedrich Strauss publishes the first edition of
the first volume of an epochal work:

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:30.489
"The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined".

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.159
Strauss advances the view that it doesn't matter whether or not Christ
really was the son of God or worked

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:41.089
miracles or came back from the dead
after being crucified because what's

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:43.909
important about him is the moral example
he gives:

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.380
his generosity, his immense tenderness to the week,

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:48.849
his commitment to forgiveness:

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:52.749
"You must forgive your brother seven times seventy"  he notes.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.100
His humility: he lived as a carpenter had a simple life lived amongst the poor.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.180
Strauss initiates a new way of looking at religion:

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:04.049
It isn't a true description of how the
world actually is.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.260
It something humans have invented to
comfort themselves in highly valuable

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.270
and important ways that deserve are
selective reverence.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.380
1885, Amsterdam, Netherlands

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.020
A new national museum, the
Rijks Museum officially opens.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.980
The architect Pierre Kuiper has spent his career designing and restoring churches and it shows.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.920
The building is quickly dubbed a
new cathedral devoted to art with it's

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.529
stained glass and ecclesiastical
solemnity.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.840
The museum is one of many to open the
second part of the 19th century.

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:43.029
It's the result of a widespread panic as
to what can replace religion now that belief is in decline.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.340
One leading answer is that Culture can replace Scripture.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.500
The argument is that art can achieve for us many of the things that religion once did:

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.560
It can be a guide,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.500
a source of consolation, a teacher of wisdom and
compassion, a reminder of our better

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:05.289
nature and something that can
imperfectly but still to a real extent reconcile us to our mortality.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.280
2006, Oxford, England

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.879
An English biologist Richard Dawkins publishes "The God Delusion".

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:17.439
Dawkins argues that religion is
intellectually wrong and delusional and

00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:20.589
therefore should be removed entirely
from public culture.

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:24.249
There Dawkins has just about stops from saying
that people should be prevented by law

00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:27.459
from being religious in private but only
just.

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:33.299
Dawkins's mocking view of religion
coincides with deep disquiet about militant Islam in the West.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.260
The murderous
ways of fringe Muslim groups seems to be Dawkins is real target.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.260
Religion just
comes to seem like something a bunch of mad people could ever be interested in.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:49.129
Dawkins insists that reasonable people
can find all the consolation they need in science and medicine.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.400
The doctor can replace the priest, the welfare state can replace charity,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.720
and the laboratory can
replace rituals and ceremonies.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.600
For the rest we have television and the news.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:06.780
The needs that religions answered were real and important and despite
science and TV and theme parks and

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.449
cancer treatment centers we still have
many of these needs.

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:14.019
We still have to die, we still need to be
comforted, we still need to be reminded

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:19.139
in conditions of aggressive capitalism
of our duties to the community and to the poor,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.280
and we still need somewhere to
take are disappointed ambitions, frustrations and sorrows.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.960
Religion may
well have been a deep illusion but it

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.870
was an important illusion that we need
to understand with sincere depth and

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:37.990
compassion in order to know how to
create functioning secular societies in our own time.
