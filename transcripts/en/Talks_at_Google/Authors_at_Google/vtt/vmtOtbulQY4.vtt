JULIE: OK, everybody,
how we doing?

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.080
Having fun?

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.580
All right.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.690
I'm Julie Wiskirchen, and I
work on the Talks at Google team

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.710
here at Google LA.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.640
And today we're
excited to welcome

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.070
one of our very own
Googlers, Rachel Searles, who

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.790
is also an author.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.950
Rachel grew up in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.420
where she spent her childhood
reading everything available,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.310
studying languages, and
dreaming of seeing the world.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.140
She lives with her
husband in Los Angeles

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.850
where she's hard at work on the
next book in "The Lost Planet"

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.400
series.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.320
And today she's going to
talk about her first novel,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.940
a sci-fi adventure story
called "The Lost Planet."

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.440
So let's all give
Rachel a big hand.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.890
RACHEL SEARLES: Hello.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.800
So, yeah.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.590
What she said.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.587
I'm a Googler, but
I also write books.

00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:02.670
So I'm going to tell you
a little bit about myself

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.710
and how I became an author,
starting with where I'm from.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.420
Planet Earth.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:14.075
The United States.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.580
What state is that?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.050
Michigan, yes.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.860
And I'm from the upper peninsula
there, that bit at the top,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.400
right next to Canada.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.870
This is what it looks
like in the summer,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.630
and this is what it
looks like in the winter.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.585
It's very cold there.

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:34.140
It snows a lot.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.258
When I was a kid this is how
I went to school every day.

00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:40.620
By dog sled.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.070
Just kidding, my dog
couldn't really pull me.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.680
But it snowed all the time.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.200
It was cold.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.560
I stayed inside a lot,
and so in my spare time,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.530
I really liked to read.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.030
There are a lot of pictures of
me from my childhood reading.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.440
Who here likes to read?

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.380
Yes, good.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.630
Everybody.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.210
I read.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.970
I had really cool glasses,
because this was the '80s.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.300
And when I couldn't read, I read
some more with my companion.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.260
Does he look pretty happy
to be there with me?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.950
AUDIENCE: No.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.741
RACHEL SEARLES: No.

00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:17.450
Oh, am I in your way?

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.640
Some of my favorite
books when I was a kid.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.960
"A Little Princess."

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.760
Lloyd Alexander's books.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.670
This is "The Castle of Lear."

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.410
And maybe you know this guy.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.510
Roald Dahl.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.040
Yeah.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.200
He's pretty funny.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.140
Those are great books.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.040
Because I liked to read
so much, I thought a lot

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.570
about maybe writing
my own books.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.019
So when I was about
six years old,

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.310
I started writing some stories.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.268
This is my first story.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.660
It's called "Birthdays."

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.690
It was about five pages long.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.190
Yeah.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.790
I was six years old,
so just beginning.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.280
And I knew some day I
would like to be an author.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.100
I knew right away that I
wanted to make stories as fun

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.320
to read as the ones
I loved to read.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.280
But I thought about a
lot of other options.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.194
I thought about what I
wanted to be when I grew up.

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:15.610
How many of you know what you
want to be when you grow up?

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.210
Oh wow, a lot of you.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.712
What you want to be?

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:20.985
AUDIENCE: I want to
be a police officer.

00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:22.360
RACHEL SEARLES:
A police officer.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.347
How about you?

00:03:23.347 --> 00:03:24.680
AUDIENCE: I want to be a doctor.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.520
RACHEL SEARLES: A doctor.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.850
You?

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.490
AUDIENCE: I want to
be a pediatrician.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.440
RACHEL SEARLES: A pediatrician.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.071
Outstanding.

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:32.570
Huh?

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.716
Who was that?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.360
An inventor.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.900
Last one.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.799
What do you want?

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.590
AUDIENCE: I want to be
a computer animator.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.006
RACHEL SEARLES:
Computer animator.

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.030
Well, you're in the
right place for that.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.580
So I thought about
different options.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.410
My first thing that I wanted
to be was an entomologist.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.960
That's somebody who
studies insects.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.980
I thought that would
be a lot of fun

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.540
because I really liked ants.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.407
I thought they were cool.

00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:00.740
I really liked praying mantises.

00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:05.320
We don't have any praying
mantises in Michigan,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.940
where I grew up.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.606
So I just read about
them, but I thought

00:04:07.606 --> 00:04:08.680
they sounded interesting.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.690
But there was a problem with my
plan to become an entomologist,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.395
and that problem was spiders.

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:16.810
That was a deal breaker.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.899
I couldn't do
something where I had

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.959
to handle spiders every day.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.940
So I thought about what
else I'd like to do.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.600
I thought, maybe I'd
like to be a nurse.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.166
Seemed like a
really good career.

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:30.040
There are a lot of jobs
for nurses out there.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.664
Everybody's always
looking for a nurse.

00:04:31.664 --> 00:04:33.340
It'd make my grandma
really happy.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.620
My grandma wanted a
nurse in the family.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.080
Not quite a doctor, but close.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.290
But what does a nurse do?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.710
Cleans up after sick people
every day, and that is messy.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.230
So I thought, well,
maybe that's not for me.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.100
Maybe that's not my personality.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.680
So eventually, I
came on the idea

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.596
that I wanted to be an
international diplomat.

00:04:54.596 --> 00:04:57.260
And I wanted to travel the
world and learn new languages

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.410
and meet interesting people.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.360
And that was about the time
I was graduating high school.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.240
So I made a plan.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.470
I got a bachelor's degree in
political science in German.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.870
I moved to Germany
for three years.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.190
I learned to speak
German fluently.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.900
I thought maybe I'd
like to be a lawyer,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.710
so I worked at a law firm.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.230
Killed that idea
pretty quickly, I

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.500
decided that was not
what I wanted to do.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.240
I lived in Istanbul for
half a year in Turkey.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.990
And I came back and I
went to grad school,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.340
and I studied
journalism eventually.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.500
The international diplomat
lost its glamour after a while,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.090
but I thought, well,
I like to write.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.060
And so journalism school
seemed like a good fit.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.820
But when I graduated journalism
school, I changed my mind.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.745
Again.

00:05:41.745 --> 00:05:47.340
I didn't really like
having to talk to strangers

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.840
and bother them for information
they didn't want to give me,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.150
so instead I got a really
great job working at Google.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.690
And what I do at Google is
I work on the search quality

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.830
team.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.910
And we look for bad
websites and weed them out

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.530
of the search results.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.840
And it was a great
job, it is a great job

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.270
with a great team, a great boss.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.301
I mean, do you think working at
Google is a good place to work?

00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:17.800
Yeah?

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.360
But.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.539
There was one big, hairy but.

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.080
I hadn't forgotten
about my childhood

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.114
dream of becoming an author.

00:06:29.114 --> 00:06:31.530
So after I'd been working at
Google for maybe six or seven

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.560
years, I started to write
again in my free time.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.535
Usually on business
trips in my hotel room,

00:06:36.535 --> 00:06:39.160
write a little story.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.100
I never wrote too much.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.480
I'd get distracted.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.040
There's a lot of things to do
when you have a full time job.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.760
I got married.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.580
I had friends.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.750
There's always movies to
watch, good TV shows to watch.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.990
It's hard to really concentrate
on something like writing.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.250
But eventually in 2006,
I came up with this idea.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.160
I wanted to write a
story about a boy who

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.360
goes on an adventure in space.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.892
So I started writing in 2006.

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:08.850
This is the first page.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.730
I was calling it "The
Babel Project" at the time.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.740
And it was about a boy.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.119
He was on a planet.

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:15.660
He got into a fight
with his parents.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.474
He hung out with his neighbor.

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:18.390
He went to get sister.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.500
It was a very boring story.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.570
And I wrote about 30
pages of it in 2006

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.060
and realized that
I didn't really--

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.690
it wasn't a good story.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.560
So 2008, I came up with the
idea to make it more adventurous

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.772
by starting this story with
the boy not having any memory

00:07:37.772 --> 00:07:38.480
when he wakes up.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.180
Start it as a mystery.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.520
And so I started writing that
around the beginning of 2008.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.750
By the end of 2009, so two years
later, I had about 100 pages.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.380
And 100 pages over
two years, that

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.060
averages out to
about 40 words a day.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.140
That's pretty slow.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.540
If I was going to keep
writing at that pace,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.440
it would've taken me
six years to finish

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.770
the first draft of this book.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.370
And I thought, well,
that's not going to work.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.980
So I made a plan.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.470
You can see my
Google Calendar here.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.460
I decided, it was my
New Years resolution,

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.020
I was going to write
a thousand words a day

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.700
until I finish the book.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.610
I had never actually
finished writing a book.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.782
So you can see all these little
yellow spots on my calendar.

00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:32.240
That's where I logged my word
count every day that I wrote.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.679
I didn't write every single day.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.909
You can see the kind of reddish
pink-- those are my goals.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.191
So every 10 days, I'd put down
40,000 words, 50,000 words.

00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:44.440
Those are my word count goals.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.260
And I didn't always
hit them, but I tried.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.051
I kept up, and I actually
finished the book

00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:49.890
in four months.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.090
So, what was this?

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.220
April of 2010.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.440
I had a finished book.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.320
It was huge.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.140
It was an enormous book.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.330
It had potential, but
it was a first draft.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.060
And the first draft of any
book is not a good book.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.114
It's the potential
for a good book.

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:08.780
So I thought, how do
I make this better?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.863
How do I make this something
that I could actually

00:09:10.863 --> 00:09:11.680
get published?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.580
So I went out and I met
some writer friends.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.650
I joined critique groups.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.810
And I spent a year and a
half rewriting this book

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.624
with critique groups.

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:23.040
And a year and a
half later, I was

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.750
ready to send my book
out in the world.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.280
I thought it was a lot better.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.340
Hi.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.710
So I wrote a query letter.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.440
And this is an idea of what
a query letter looks like.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.962
It's just an email to
an agent, because you

00:09:36.962 --> 00:09:39.170
don't want to send your book
directly to a publisher.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.530
You want to send it to
an agent, an agent who

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.330
will help you find publishers.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.370
So I had this letter saying,
dear agent, this is my book.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.520
A few paragraphs, this
is what it's about.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.050
And I sent out about 60 of
these to different agents.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.290
About 10 at a time,
not all at once.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.800
And over half a year,
I got 50 of these.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.680
Dear Rachel, thank you
kindly for thinking of me

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.430
for "The Fulcrum."

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.159
That was the title at the time.

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:08.950
It seems promising,
but I'm afraid it's not

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.965
an ideal fit for my
list at this time.

00:10:10.965 --> 00:10:13.340
I wish you much luck all the
same with your agent search.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.730
Happy Holidays.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.760
So--

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.640
RACHEL SEARLES: Because
they're telling me

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.960
they don't want to
represent my book.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.540
50 times in a row,
people told me

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.840
they didn't want to
represent my book.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.010
And there were times where
I thought, man, maybe I

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.259
should write a different book.

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:29.790
Maybe this book's no good.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.560
Maybe I should write a
different kind of book.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.250
Maybe I should just
stop writing together.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.660
But every time, something
would push me along,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.840
and I'd send out
another 10 queries.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.320
And eventually, after half
a year, I got one of these

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.730
from an agent who said,
thank you for your patience

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.330
while we've pulled together our
notes on "The Burned Planet."

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.624
I was calling it "The Burned
Planet" at this point.

00:10:52.624 --> 00:10:54.290
While we're writing
them up more firmly,

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.039
I'd love to set a time
to discuss with you

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:56.930
this week as well.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.090
So, I had a phone
call with an agent.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.570
And when I talked to her
she said she loved the book.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.300
She wanted to represent me.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.300
We did some light
revisions together.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.680
She took the book out.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.410
Two weeks later, I think we
sent it to a dozen publishers.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.400
Two weeks later, we had several
offers from major publishers.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.317
We got to take it to
auction, had publishers

00:11:15.317 --> 00:11:16.150
bidding on the book.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.510
It was very exciting.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.240
And we sold it.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.820
We ended up getting a two
book deal with Macmillan.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.099
So this was 2012.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.640
It takes a while after you sell
books for it to be published,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.140
because this book didn't
come out until this January.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.590
So it was very exciting.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.974
And it goes to show-- I
mean, to me that says,

00:11:33.974 --> 00:11:35.515
just because a lot
of people say no--

00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:36.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.434
RACHEL SEARLES:
(WHISPERING) OK, thank you.

00:11:38.434 --> 00:11:40.350
(SPEAKING NORMALLY) Say
no, I don't want this,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.610
it doesn't mean it's bad.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.290
It just means you
have to keep trying.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.640
So people ask me,
why science fiction?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.420
Why did I choose to
write science fiction?

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.160
There are all kinds of
books you can write.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.534
Do you guys like
science fiction?

00:11:53.534 --> 00:11:54.470
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.680
RACHEL SEARLES: Do you like
"Star Wars?" "Star Trek?"

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.710
Did you see "Avatar?"

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.630
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.360
RACHEL SEARLES:
"Doctor Who," yes.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.420
My kind of person.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.280
So there are two main
kinds of fiction.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.700
There's realistic fiction, and
this takes place in our world.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.610
And maybe it's set
in a different time.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.612
Maybe it's historical.

00:12:15.612 --> 00:12:20.070
Maybe it's a funny book,
maybe it's a serious book.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.110
But it conforms to the
rules of our world.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.740
It takes place in the same
kind of place we live in.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.135
Then there's on the other side,
there's speculative fiction.

00:12:29.135 --> 00:12:30.147
AUDIENCE: Harry Potter.

00:12:30.147 --> 00:12:30.980
RACHEL SEARLES: Yes.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.510
Speculative fiction takes
place in a made up world.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.830
There's fantasy.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.350
There's dystopian.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.250
There's horror.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.280
But my favorite is
science fiction.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.160
Who can tell me what
book this is from?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.360
Anybody?

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.750
"A Wrinkle In Time."

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.740
Who did that?

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.970
Very good.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.620
So, this is "A Wrinkle in Time."

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.190
Very good book if you
haven't read it yet.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.850
Why do I like science fiction?

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.360
I like space science
fiction in particular.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.470
Because I think space
is really exciting.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.740
It's vast.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.190
This is a picture
of our solar system.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.456
And the planets are to scale.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.580
That's the size of the sun.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.540
That little dot over
from it, that's Earth.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.970
That's how big the sun
is compared our planet.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.906
But the scale is wrong, because
the distances at this size,

00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:21.030
I would have to spread this
all around the building

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.154
to get the distances right.

00:13:22.154 --> 00:13:24.485
Because the distances
between planets are so huge.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.760
So, the distance between
Earth and the sun

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.740
is about 93 million miles.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.500
And right now the fastest
that we can travel in space

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.790
is 36,000 miles.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.470
That's the New Horizons
that's going out

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.440
towards Pluto right now.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.150
So traveling at that speed,
it would take us 107 days

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.210
to reach the sun at
our very fastest speed.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:59.750
But we don't measure
by-- ooh, what did I do?

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.550
There it goes.

00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:05.610
But we don't measure it
by how fast we can travel.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.640
How fast we travel in space,
we measure this by light year.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.720
What's a light year?

00:14:12.974 --> 00:14:14.950
AUDIENCE: How far light
can travel in a year.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.075
RACHEL SEARLES: How far
light can travel in a year.

00:14:17.075 --> 00:14:18.430
Very good.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.720
So, light travels at the speed
of 186,000 miles a second.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.890
It gets to us from the sun
in about eight minutes.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:33.720
But one light year is equal
to about six trillion miles.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.730
That's really far.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.550
And the next closest
star to our solar system

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:43.570
is Proxima Centauri, and
it is 4.3 light years away.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.700
And in miles, that's
about 25 trillion miles.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.420
So if we were traveling to that
star at our speed of 36,000

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.640
miles, it would take us
82,000 years to get there.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.070
So right now, we're not
traveling to any other planets.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.870
But it's exciting, because
maybe someday we will.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:10.420
With fantasy, fantasy's all
about unicorns and wizards

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.400
and vampires and things
that we know aren't real.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.730
RACHEL SEARLES: Yes.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.560
But the difference
with science fiction

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.690
is that science fiction has
the potential to be real.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.940
Maybe someday we will be able
to travel at the speed of light.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.100
Maybe someday we will
travel to other stars.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.450
And I think that's
very exciting.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.450
Other things I like about
space science fiction.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:42.380
When you look-- so it's 4.3
light years to the next star.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.300
But that works in reverse.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.070
So we don't see light
from that star--

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.010
that light doesn't
reach us for 4.3 years.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.490
And that's the closest star.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.750
There are stars that
are tens of thousands--

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.020
there are stars that are
millions of miles away.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.050
So it takes-- millions of
light years away, not miles.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.610
Sorry.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:05.150
So it takes those stars-- their
light takes tens of thousands,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.300
or millions of
years to reach us.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.670
So when we look up
at the sky, what

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.450
we see is the light from
millions of years ago.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.762
So it's more like we're
looking back in time.

00:16:15.762 --> 00:16:16.845
AUDIENCE: Like Doctor Who.

00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:20.060
RACHEL SEARLES: Like
Doctor Who, exactly.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.180
I like space because
space looks cool.

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:26.160
Look at that.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.565
That's a storm on Jupiter.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.820
That's a moon of Saturn.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.310
That's a sun flare.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.800
I like space because
space is full.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.600
It might have aliens.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.600
Good aliens.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.260
Bad aliens.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.855
RACHEL SEARLES:
But these planets

00:16:50.855 --> 00:16:56.180
are-- other solar systems are
millions light years away.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.977
So we can't say whether or
not they might not exist.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:00.310
Maybe they don't look like this.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.077
Maybe they don't
look anything like us

00:17:02.077 --> 00:17:04.410
or anything we've imagined,
but they might be out there.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.910
I like space because space
stores are full of adventure.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.190
They're always very exciting.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:20.530
Light saber fights, spaceship
chases, battles with aliens.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.800
Very exciting.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.400
But my favorite
thing about space

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.080
can be best described
by this book here.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.320
It's called "From the
Earth to the Moon."

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.486
Have you heard of this book?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.441
It was a book written in 1865,
around the time of the Civil

00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:38.940
War.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.900
It was written a long time ago.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.980
But it's about a
club in Baltimore

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.510
that wants to send three
people to the moon.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.530
At the time they had no
idea how to get to the moon.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.239
They had no idea
what was up there.

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.530
They didn't know if we could
land there and walk around

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.550
in our regular,
everyday clothes.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.150
But in 1969, over
100 years later,

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.800
we did land someone on the moon.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.590
So today's space fiction might
be tomorrow's space reality.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.270
Maybe someday we will travel
to these other solar systems,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.590
and see other planets,
and meet some aliens.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.060
Who knows?

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.240
To me, space fiction,
science fiction

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.500
is about imagining the future.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.440
I stole this picture off the
internet because I love it.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.150
This is "Star Trek," predicting
the future since 1966.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.890
You can see on the left in "Star
Trek," how we imagined-- back

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.620
in 1966, 1987,
1988-- we imagined

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.150
these futuristic devices
that people might use someday

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.760
to communicate, and now
those exact same devices

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.180
exist in our everyday lives.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:49.080
Cell phones, iPads, video
conferences, Google Glass.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.850
So these are the reasons why
I like reading and writing

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.030
science fiction.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.130
Now, I'm going to read
to you guys a little bit

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.300
from the beginning of my book.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.230
Has anybody read this yet?

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.640
Yes?

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.465
Surprised me.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:13.940
OK.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.480
Chapter one.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.240
The boy opened his eyes to a
sky the color of melted butter

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.480
and a sense of
inexplicable terror.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.256
He sucked in a ragged
gasp of air and sat up.

00:19:24.256 --> 00:19:25.630
The pain followed
a second later,

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.920
smacking the back of
his head like a club.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.810
The world swam
around him in a blur.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.330
He grasped for simple facts.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.800
Where he was, how
he'd gotten here.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.030
Why he hurt.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.540
Why he could barely see.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.774
Nothing.

00:19:37.774 --> 00:19:40.190
Shoving aside his confusion,
he pushed himself to one knee

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.410
with a grunt.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.415
The muggy air seemed
to vibrate, but he

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.790
couldn't tell
whether it was real

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.492
or whether he was imagining it.

00:19:46.492 --> 00:19:47.950
He squinted hard
enough to make out

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.930
the gray shape of
a nearby building,

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.380
and something vast
and green behind it.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.380
What was this place?

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.800
A hand landed on his shoulder.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.100
With a cry of
surprise, he turned

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.430
and saw a blurry figure
crouched beside him.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.090
It took a moment to unscramble
what the person was shouting.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.210
"Who are you?

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.280
How to get past the fence?"

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.310
Fence?

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.800
He shook his head.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.640
Something had began
to rise in his chest.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.480
A bubble of vital information.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.720
What was it?

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.100
His mouth worked
silently, trying

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.080
to pin down the words dancing
at the edge of his tongue.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.620
The pain swelled, crowding
everything else out,

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.990
and he felt himself
slipping away.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.510
"Guide the star,"
he shouted just

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.120
before the blackness closed in.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.520
"Hey, hey wake up."

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.990
He opened his eyes.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.820
The blinding sunlight was gone.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.460
He was somewhere dim and quiet,
breathing processed indoor air.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.310
A dark haired boy leaned
over him, studying his face.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.750
"There you are."

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.400
For a moment he struggled
to form a slurred question.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.750
"Where am I?" "I
brought you inside.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.430
You're safe.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.820
You're in my house."

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.250
He stared at the
pale, sharp faced boy.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.250
Was the same person who
had spoken to him outside?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.150
"Uh, who are you?"
"OK, you're welcome.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.960
I'm Parker.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.340
Now who on Taras are you?

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.990
Where did you come from?"

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.980
Letting the questions
fly over his head,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.760
he looked past Parker to
take in his surroundings.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.820
He was lying in a bed inside
a small, empty bedroom.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.960
The only light came
through an open door.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.230
He turned this head to see
what lay beyond the door

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.101
and winced as throbbing
erupted behind his eyes.

00:21:19.101 --> 00:21:20.600
Parker had crossed
his arms as if he

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.790
were waiting for something.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.630
Did he know this Parker?

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.900
He didn't think so.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.520
His eyelids grew heavy
and began to droop.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.260
"No, you don't.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.190
Stay awake."

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.530
Parker reached down and
slapped his cheek lightly,

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.730
but he may as well
have swung a hammer.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.180
Jagged bolts of pain raced
across the boy's skull

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.860
and he cried out.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.120
Parker raised his
hands. "Whoa, sorry.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.670
Good lords, what happened
to you?" "What happened?"

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.660
he repeated, looking
for the answer himself.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.005
The confusion he felt outside
started to rise again.

00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:50.600
"Um, yeah.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.040
How did you get through
the fence?" "Fence?"

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.730
Parker shook his head.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.270
"What is wrong with you, kid?"

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.330
"Kid?"

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.040
He felt like a bleeding
idiot repeating everything,

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.440
but it was if his
brain had shorted out.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.730
Why didn't he know the
answer to these questions?

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.080
Why didn't he know anything?

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.440
"Yeah, what are you, 13?"

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.130
Parker said, with
the authoritative air

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.780
of someone much older.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.510
He couldn't have been
more than 14 himself.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.420
How old am I?

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.160
"I don't know," he admitted.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.830
"Don't know how old you are?

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:26.235
You some kind of run away?"
"I-- I don't know." "What do you

00:22:26.235 --> 00:22:27.110
mean, you don't know?

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.720
Who are you?"

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.850
Who am I?

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.010
He stared into
Parker's gray eyes

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.960
and his confusion began
to twist into fear.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.900
"I don't know," he
repeated a third time,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.500
his voice dropping to a whisper.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.650
Parker's face lit
up with a grin.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.599
"Are you kidding me?

00:22:42.599 --> 00:22:44.640
You must have really gotten
your brain scrambled.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.390
I know what to do.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.636
Hold on a sec."

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:48.510
He left the room and
returned a minute later,

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.050
thrusting a mirror
into the boy's face.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.910
Wincing, the boy hoisted
himself up on one elbow

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.600
and grabbed the mirror with
the other hand steady it.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.550
His stomach plummeted and
his heart began to race.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.280
A sandy haired,
ashen faced stranger

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.410
stared back at him from
the mirror with wild eyes.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.595
A low gasp diverted his
attention for the mirror.

00:23:06.595 --> 00:23:08.680
"Oh, lord," said Parker,
staring past the boy

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.200
at something behind him.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.990
Tingling panic raced over
his skin. "What is it?"

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.782
Parker was already
backing toward the door.

00:23:14.782 --> 00:23:16.781
"I'm going to call the
doctor," he said quickly.

00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:19.150
He turned and ran, his
pounding footsteps echoing down

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.660
the hall.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.200
Frantic, the boy in the bed
wrenched his head around.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.390
Fresh explosions of pain knocked
him back into unconsciousness,

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.640
but not before he glimpsed
the bright red stain

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.210
spreading on his pillowcase.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:38.250
So I will stop there, and
now open it up to questions.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.840
Do you guys have any
questions for me.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.412
You?

00:23:40.412 --> 00:23:42.370
AUDIENCE: Are you going
to autograph the books?

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.453
RACHEL SEARLES: Am I going
to autograph the books?

00:23:44.453 --> 00:23:46.016
Yes, I will.

00:23:46.016 --> 00:23:47.492
You?

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:48.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.479
RACHEL SEARLES: What other
books have I written?

00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:52.720
This was the first book
I ever actually finished,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.730
and I was describing
how long it took me.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.370
It took me, overall, maybe four
years to write the whole thing.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.828
I've written the
second book since,

00:23:59.828 --> 00:24:01.590
because there's a
sequel, but I wrote

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:05.241
that one in about four
months last summer.

00:24:05.241 --> 00:24:05.740
Yes?

00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:13.710
AUDIENCE: What's the next
book going to be named?

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.130
AUDIENCE: What's my next
book going to be named?

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.780
I know the name,
but my publish--

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.454
it's not called The
Lost Planet Two.

00:24:21.454 --> 00:24:23.870
I can't announce the name yet,
because my publisher hasn't

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.609
announced it, but it's
about a moon this time.

00:24:26.609 --> 00:24:27.150
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.330
RACHEL SEARLES: Ah.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.010
Yes?

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.460
AUDIENCE: Why are you
afraid of spiders?

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.251
RACHEL SEARLES: Why am
I afraid of spiders?

00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:35.680
AUDIENCE: Because they can
bite and some are poisonous.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.710
RACHEL SEARLES: They
can bite, they can jump.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.840
I don't know.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.640
I think they're just the
creepiest thing on the planet.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.970
You?

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.470
AUDIENCE: They're
actually-- I would

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.410
like to correct the
person-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.840
They're all--
they're all venomous.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:58.230
Because they need their venom
and webs to trap and immobilize

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.380
their prey.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.540
RACHEL SEARLES: Yes.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.980
That's how they stay alive.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:06.061
They're just creepy
as all get out.

00:25:06.061 --> 00:25:12.150
AUDIENCE: How long did it
get to make the first idea?

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.650
RACHEL SEARLES: How
long did it take

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.740
me to get the first
ideas to write my book?

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.550
Years.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.157
Well, first I had the idea of
just writing a space adventure.

00:25:22.157 --> 00:25:23.990
But the time between
coming up with the idea

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.200
that I wanted to write
a space adventure

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.450
and knowing that I
wanted to write a space

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.741
adventure about a boy who
lost his memory who's getting

00:25:28.741 --> 00:25:33.144
chased across the galaxy
was probably two years.

00:25:33.144 --> 00:25:33.644
Yeah?

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:37.580
AUDIENCE: Are there wars?

00:25:40.074 --> 00:25:41.490
RACHEL SEARLES:
Are there any wars

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.820
in any of the
books that I wrote?

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.740
There is a war that happened in
the past that they talk about,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.700
but there's not a war
going on in the book.

00:25:54.065 --> 00:25:57.460
AUDIENCE: Why did you write
a boy, a girl, [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:02.841 --> 00:26:04.590
RACHEL SEARLES: He's
asking me to describe

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.610
the people on the cover.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.790
There's a lot of
characters in the book,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.050
and all the important
ones are on the cover.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.175
You have to read the book
to find out who they are.

00:26:11.175 --> 00:26:13.415
AUDIENCE: But other
books, like-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.740
RACHEL SEARLES:
Oh, no thank you.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.020
Thank you.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.520
Anyway, yes.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.019
You?

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.140
AUDIENCE: In the
book, does it explain

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.025
what happened in the past?

00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:28.400
RACHEL SEARLES:
In the book, does

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.246
it explain what
happened in the past?

00:26:30.246 --> 00:26:31.620
Do I explain what
happened to him

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.430
by-- by the end of the
book, he figures out

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.961
what happened to him before
the start of the book, yes.

00:26:37.961 --> 00:26:39.252
AUDIENCE: What happened to him?

00:26:39.252 --> 00:26:40.490
What happened to the boy?

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.240
RACHEL SEARLES: You
have to read the book.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.005
AUDIENCE: What?

00:26:43.005 --> 00:26:43.880
RACHEL SEARLES: What?

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.630
Yes, you?

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.085
AUDIENCE: What
kind of book is it?

00:26:46.085 --> 00:26:46.585
Adventure?

00:26:46.585 --> 00:26:47.104
Comedy?

00:26:47.104 --> 00:26:48.770
RACHEL SEARLES: What
kind of book is it?

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.030
I would call it an
action adventure.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.207
It's got some funny parts,
but it's more action.

00:26:55.207 --> 00:26:58.012
AUDIENCE: What about
the kindergarten book?

00:26:58.012 --> 00:27:00.220
RACHEL SEARLES: I didn't
write the kindergarten book.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.280
She's out there.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.390
You?

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.590
AUDIENCE: Have you
wrote any humor books?

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.430
RACHEL SEARLES: Have I
written any humor books?

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.020
No, I haven't written
any funny books.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.603
There's some funny
lines in this book,

00:27:11.603 --> 00:27:13.585
but humor is not
my strong point.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.582
Yes, you?

00:27:19.582 --> 00:27:22.091
AUDIENCE: Do you have
[INAUDIBLE] or any other books?

00:27:22.091 --> 00:27:24.590
RACHEL SEARLES: Am I going to
write any other kind of books?

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.650
Yes, maybe someday.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.626
I'm pitching a fantasy
book right now.

00:27:28.626 --> 00:27:32.787
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
But any other subject?

00:27:32.787 --> 00:27:33.620
RACHEL SEARLES: Yes.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.720
I'm pitching a book about
an orphanage right now.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.220
Yes.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.606
Question?

00:27:41.606 --> 00:27:44.444
AUDIENCE: Did you ever
have any curiosity

00:27:44.444 --> 00:27:46.155
about being an astronaut?

00:27:46.155 --> 00:27:48.030
RACHEL SEARLES: Did I
ever have any curiosity

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.700
about becoming an astronaut?

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.020
No.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.280
Astronauts are crazy.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.890
To let someone launch you
on a rocket to the moon.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.121
Would you do it?

00:27:58.121 --> 00:27:58.620
No?

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.786
AUDIENCE: They're not crazy.

00:27:59.786 --> 00:28:01.580
Aliens are crazy.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.661
RACHEL SEARLES: Maybe.

00:28:02.661 --> 00:28:03.160
Yes, you?

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.320
AUDIENCE: Are you going to do
an autobiography on yourself?

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.819
RACHEL SEARLES: Am I going to
do an autobiography on myself?

00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.240
A little early for that.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.140
You mean write an
autobiography, like a book?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.390
No, not yet.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.990
Maybe when I'm about
60 years older.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.642
Question?

00:28:24.642 --> 00:28:27.072
AUDIENCE: Did you
meet Aaron Hunter?

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.530
Because I know [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:34.284 --> 00:28:35.950
RACHEL SEARLES: Have
I met Aaron Hunter?

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:36.839
I haven't, no.

00:28:36.839 --> 00:28:38.005
Does he live in Los Angeles?

00:28:40.474 --> 00:28:41.515
I'll have to look him up.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.660
Oh, good to know.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.745
Yes, with the glasses?

00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:50.956
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:53.077 --> 00:28:54.660
RACHEL SEARLES: Do
I think there could

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.320
be aliens in other places?

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.650
You know, there are about
100 to 200 billion galaxies

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:01.410
in the universe.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.041
That's a lot of place.

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:03.916
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.490
RACHEL SEARLES: Exactly.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.198
I agree with you.

00:29:11.198 --> 00:29:14.768
The odds are very small
that it's just us out here.

00:29:14.768 --> 00:29:15.268
Yes?

00:29:18.124 --> 00:29:21.650
AUDIENCE: In the cover, which
picture [? shows him? ?]

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.900
RACHEL SEARLES: In the cover,
which picture shows him?

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.050
He's the blond
boy in the middle.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.690
That's Chase.

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:31.113
Question?

00:29:31.113 --> 00:29:35.550
AUDIENCE: Did you
know that there

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:41.647
is planets that have
chances of sustaining life?

00:29:41.647 --> 00:29:43.230
RACHEL SEARLES: Do
I know that there's

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.310
a lot of planets that have
a chance of sustaining life?

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.690
Yes.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.240
I don't know the exact number,
but I follow that in the news.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.040
I think it's really interesting.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.696
I can't wait to see what people
discover in the next 10, 15,

00:29:53.696 --> 00:29:56.350
20 years.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.850
AUDIENCE: Probably
a thousand years.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:58.750
RACHEL SEARLES: Maybe.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.833
Probably a thousand years.

00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:01.370
I won't be around for that.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:02.190
Yes?

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.940
AUDIENCE: Did you know
the fear of spiders

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.890
is called arachnophobia?

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.900
RACHEL SEARLES: Do I
know the fear of spiders

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.900
is called arachnophobia?

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:07.520
Yes.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.340
It's also the name
of a terrible movie.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:10.891
Yes?

00:30:10.891 --> 00:30:12.766
AUDIENCE: Are you gonna
write [? any books ?]

00:30:12.766 --> 00:30:15.412
on Saturn or Pluto?

00:30:15.412 --> 00:30:17.870
RACHEL SEARLES: Am I going to
write any other planet books?

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:21.290
Well, I'm hoping that the series
is about four or five books,

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.234
so I'll probably
pick on some other--

00:30:24.234 --> 00:30:26.424
AUDIENCE: Are you going
put them on YouTube?

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:28.507
RACHEL SEARLES: Am I going
to put them on YouTube?

00:30:28.507 --> 00:30:32.004
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]
Because I always go on YouTube.

00:30:32.004 --> 00:30:34.420
RACHEL SEARLES: No, I don't
have any plans to put anything

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.560
on YouTube right now.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.780
It's terrifying.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.280
Yes?

00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:42.085
AUDIENCE: Is this the Milky Way?

00:30:42.085 --> 00:30:43.960
RACHEL SEARLES: Is this
the Milky Way Galaxy?

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.260
Well, the one on the back
cover, I don't think so.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.720
Somebody told me
which one it is,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.660
and I can't remember right now.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.009
It's a different one.

00:30:52.009 --> 00:30:54.409
AUDIENCE: What is your
favorite part about the book?

00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:56.700
RACHEL SEARLES: What's my
favorite part about the book?

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.630
Well in chapter, I
think it's chapter 22,

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.980
I almost kill one of
my favorite characters.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.632
That was my favorite
part of the book.

00:31:04.632 --> 00:31:05.507
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.500
RACHEL SEARLES: It
was fun to write.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.690
Other questions?

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.750
Anybody?

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.811
You?

00:31:17.811 --> 00:31:19.185
AUDIENCE: When
you're writing, do

00:31:19.185 --> 00:31:24.320
you like to write humorous
[? sketches ?] or like

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.820
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.520
RACHEL SEARLES: Do I have
a favorite kind of section

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.470
to write in my book?

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.040
I like writing the
dialogue sections.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.123
I think those are fun when
people are talking back

00:31:36.123 --> 00:31:38.302
and forth, because
they can be funny.

00:31:38.302 --> 00:31:39.510
AUDIENCE: I mean, [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.891
RACHEL SEARLES:
Yeah, those are fun.

00:31:45.891 --> 00:31:46.390
You?

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.510
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
other ideas for books?

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.430
RACHEL SEARLES: Do I have
any other ideas for books?

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.090
Well, like I said, I'm pitching
about to my publisher right now

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.000
about an orphanage and monsters.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.250
So that's not science fiction.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.460
But right now, if I'm
not writing these,

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.670
I can write about
one book a year.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.880
That's about the maximum,
because otherwise my brain

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.470
will explode.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.060
What's your question?

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.030
AUDIENCE: I'm a lost planet.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.212
RACHEL SEARLES: Are you?

00:32:17.212 --> 00:32:19.670
Silly.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:20.809
Back there, yes?

00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:22.392
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:32:22.392 --> 00:32:23.986
about your process
for writing books?

00:32:23.986 --> 00:32:25.315
How often you write, how long?

00:32:25.315 --> 00:32:26.190
RACHEL SEARLES: Sure.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.020
My process for
writing the books.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.730
On a daily basis, ideally, I
would write every single day.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.960
But that doesn't always happen
because life gets in the way.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.020
I prefer to write
in the morning.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.350
I don't usually
outline before I write.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.800
I tried to on the second book.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.510
I tried to plan
that whole book out,

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.540
and I thought, oh, I'll
just have this road map

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.706
I can follow, and I could
just write the whole thing

00:32:46.706 --> 00:32:48.340
in four weeks.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.080
And that didn't
work, because when

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.890
I was trying to
outline it, I couldn't

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.380
get past-- I don't know what's
going to happen in chapter

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.463
four, because I haven't
written Chapter three yet.

00:32:56.463 --> 00:32:58.550
So I pretty much wing it.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.320
Maybe I have an idea
for the next chapter.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.570
I go chapter by
chapter, but it's slow.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.390
On good days, I still
try to 1,000 words a day.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.080
Yes?

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.960
AUDIENCE: Similar to
those lines, [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.430
do you remember
how many words it

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.370
was by the time you started
it and by the time it actually

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:21.990
shipped?

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.490
RACHEL SEARLES:
Yeah, my word count.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.080
When I finished
that first draft,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.970
I really didn't have an idea
what age group I was writing

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.750
for or, what the average
length of the book should be.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.115
So I just set this
random number in my head

00:33:34.115 --> 00:33:36.790
that I was going to write
a 100,000 word book.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.750
100,000 words is long
for a young adult book.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.850
For a middle grade
book, it's really long.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:47.470
So on my own, I trimmed it
down to about 70,000 words.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.519
About 70,000 when I was
sending it to agents.

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:51.310
And by the time I was
sending it to agents,

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.130
I had revised it
so much by myself,

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.850
that when it sold
to the publisher

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.260
we did one week of
revisions with my editor.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.220
Really light stuff.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:00.940
And sent it out.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.497
I think now it's between 70, 72.

00:34:04.497 --> 00:34:05.330
Something like that.

00:34:08.042 --> 00:34:08.900
No, thank you.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.399
Yes?

00:34:09.399 --> 00:34:11.199
AUDIENCE: How many
book have you made?

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.210
RACHEL SEARLES: How
many books have I made?

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.179
Well, this is the only
one I have out right now.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.220
And there's a second one
coming out next January.

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.493
Yes?

00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:21.368
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:28.500
RACHEL SEARLES: Do I have
lunch with other authors

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.291
and talk about what
we're going to do next,

00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:33.110
and how we're going to
make our readers cry?

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.580
There are a lot
of authors in LA,

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.973
and I do have a lot of
friends who have books out.

00:34:36.973 --> 00:34:38.889
I'm going on a retreat
next weekend, actually,

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:39.639
with some friends.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.010
We're going to-- we don't
talk about how we're

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.159
going to torture our
readers, but we do talk.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.162
We help each other
out of potholes.

00:34:47.162 --> 00:34:48.870
Say if you're writing,
and you get stuck,

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.060
and you don't know
what to do, and then

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.429
you describe the
scene to your friends

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:53.929
and they help you think of ways
to get back out of the hole.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.230
Yes?

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.397
AUDIENCE: Are you thinking
about making a movie yet?

00:35:00.397 --> 00:35:02.813
RACHEL SEARLES: Am I thinking
about making a movie for it?

00:35:02.813 --> 00:35:04.260
That would be awesome.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.300
But we haven't sold
the movie rights.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.590
It's not up to me.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.333
Yes?

00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:11.208
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:18.690
RACHEL SEARLES:
Yeah, maybe it'll

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.815
be a cartoon movie someday.

00:35:19.815 --> 00:35:21.522
It would work well as a cartoon.

00:35:21.522 --> 00:35:22.397
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:31.465 --> 00:35:32.340
RACHEL SEARLES: Yeah.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.300
Some people change
their jobs all the time.

00:35:40.255 --> 00:35:40.755
Yes?

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:45.850
AUDIENCE: Do you know if you're
going to make a movie of this?

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:46.250
RACHEL SEARLES: Do
I know if anyone

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.920
is going to make a movie?

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.250
Somebody just asked that.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.616
So far, nobody's
going to make a movie.

00:35:50.616 --> 00:35:52.590
AUDIENCE: You should get one.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.830
RACHEL SEARLES:
I should get one?

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.160
It would be nice.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.500
It's been submitted
to producers.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.000
Yes?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.197
AUDIENCE: Do you plan
on going on a book tour?

00:36:03.197 --> 00:36:05.280
RACHEL SEARLES: Do I plan
on going on a book tour?

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.220
When my book came out,
it came out January 28,

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.020
and my publisher sent
me on a book tour.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.460
Just for a week to
schools around California.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.102
So now it's kind of--
you get your moment where

00:36:17.102 --> 00:36:18.810
the publisher pushes
you, and then you're

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:19.510
kind of on your own.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.730
And you have to just
keep setting stuff up.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.540
So now I'm doing school visits
just on my own in the LA area.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.635
Anybody else?

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.520
All right, are we all done here?

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:33.325 --> 00:36:33.825
All

00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:35.090
RACHEL SEARLES: Right.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:37.420
OK, last question.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:37.920
What is it?

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.220
AUDIENCE: Did you
get a lot of money?

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.220
RACHEL SEARLES: [LAUGHS]
Did I get lots of money

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.210
for making books?

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.530
Writing books is an act of love.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.260
It's not a way to get rich.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.521
AUDIENCE: I'd like to get rich.

00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:55.520
RACHEL SEARLES: OK, thank
you so much for coming

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.989
in and listening to me talk.

00:36:56.989 --> 00:36:58.030
I hope you like the book.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.080
[APPLAUSE]
