00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.820
Now, if you were to take a look a little
more carefully at these photoreceptors,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.840
and actually look at them for
real, you would see two types.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.810
You would see rods and cones.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.400
Now, we've, we've looked at this picture
before when we're talking about color,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.230
but now we want to
talk about the anatomy.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.200
So, the rods are these little,
skinny structures here, and there

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.840
are something like, it says 120 million
rods, plus or minus, within your retina.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.540
They are very, very light sensitive,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.380
about 1000 times more light sensitive
than the cones, if given time to adapt.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.940
We'll see that in a minute.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.530
And it can sort of help
you discriminate between,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.340
of different illumination levels
at very low overall illumination.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.710
The other structures here are the cones,
and we've actually seen these before.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.745
The cones are the things that
allow you to discriminate color.

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:52.605
We talked about them when
we talked about the short,

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.885
medium and long wavelength cones.

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:58.945
The cones are also the ones
that are packed within your,

00:00:58.945 --> 00:00:59.905
what are called your fovea.

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:02.745
That is that middle area that
has the very high resolution.

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:04.905
We'll talk about the impact
of that in a minute.

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:09.910
And it's the cones that give you
sort of what we tend to think

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.950
of as the high quality vision, and the
rods sort of provide everything else.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.460
Now by the way, even if you didn't
have an electron microscope, and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.560
even if you hadn't sort of
peeled apart peoples' retinas.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.040
It sounds kind of gross.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.800
You would know that there are at
least a two kinds of systems

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.390
going on in the eye.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.980
And one of the ways that this was
discovered is what's referred to as dark

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.820
adaptation experiments, okay.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.200
So in dark adaptation,
here's what we do.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.360
We, we put you in a dark room for
months at a time, no.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.948
You put somebody in a dark room, and
you, let's say after one minute,

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:48.382
you say, how bright a light do I have
to have a light to be before you can

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:49.708
tell that it's on.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.042
Okay, if you do that?

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:53.860
And then later we do it all over again
and we do it for two minutes, and

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.208
then we do it for three minutes.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:02:00.031
Right, so we track to see how
much light you need in order

00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:04.040
to detect that there's
some illumination.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.790
Now we've all had this
experience before right?

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.900
You walk in from a bright day light into
a dark room and it takes a little while.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.830
We say for your eyes to adjust.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.560
Well, that adjustment is not
your pupil opening and closing.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.980
That's a rapid response.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.630
What's happening is, is that the pho-,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.930
is that the photo receptors in your eye
are adjusting to the amount of light.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.550
All right?

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.290
And if I were to track that,
I would see this kind of a curve.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.580
Okay, I would see a curve that
starts going down like this, and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.050
starts to look like it's
going to flatten out.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.940
And then somewhere, this says about
eight minutes, varies on person to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.600
person, somewhere around there, all of
a sudden it starts to drop down again.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.370
Okay.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.430
What's happened is your
rods are now kicking in.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.440
Your rods are now coming into play.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.590
And you can go way much,
much, much lower threshold.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.220
All right.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.010
And so, you know, when,
when you have a single system

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.320
you never get psychfisicers that
have sharp breaks like that, right.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.910
And basically what you're seeing
here is there are two curves.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.840
There's a curve here for cones.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.010
And a curve here for rods.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.220
And this was where they intersect,
all right?

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.780
And that's the sort of well-known
phenomena which implied that there was

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.410
multiple systems within the retina
in terms of light sensitivity.
