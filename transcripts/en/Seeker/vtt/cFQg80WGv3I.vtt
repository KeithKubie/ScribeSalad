00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.741
When the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, or
HZMB, was completed in January of 2018, it

00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:09.190
became the longest sea crossing bridge in
the world.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.700
With a total length of 55 kilometers, the
structure is impressive to behold, but the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.460
engineering behind it is even more incredible.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
The goal of the bridge was to connect the
major population center of Hong Kong on one

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.820
side of the Pearl River Delta to Macau and
Zhuhai on the other.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.440
Normally to go between the cities requires
driving around a large bay, and a more direct

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.320
path could take two hours off the trip.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.520
Making such a long bridge required careful
planning from the HZMB’s designers.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.120
They had to build it to withstand the annual
typhoon season, the occasional earthquake,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.720
and the ever-present sea.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.670
And their goal is to make it last for for
120 years.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.510
They also had to account for its location,
cutting across five shipping navigation channels

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.160
and the flight path of aircraft taking off
and landing at Hong Kong International Airport.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.380
And finally, they had to consider the local
marine life, like the chinese white dolphin,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.530
and the impact the construction and presence
of the bridge would have on the ecology of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.530
the region.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.350
The first most obvious challenge when building
over water is the fact that there’s no land

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.350
to build on.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.220
That’s kind of the whole point of the bridge,
so you need to start with a stable base.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.150
However the first solid ground you run into
under water isn’t usually ideal either.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.340
In this case, there were weak marine deposits
that don’t make for a solid foundation.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.200
To overcome this, builders drove long poles
called piles down through the sediment.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.400
Piles used in the Hong Kong link road portion
of the bridge could be as wide as 2.8 meters,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.150
and in a few cases were over 100 meters long
to reach a stable foundation.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.200
With the piles in place, workers put a cap
over them.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.030
HZMB designers placed many of these caps under
the sea floor in order to minimize their impact

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.340
on the flow of water.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.240
From the pile cap rises a single column called
a pier, and spans with the road surface on

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.550
them stretch from one pier to the next.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.159
To minimize the number of piers and reduce
the ecological impact, long spans of up to

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.979
180 meters were used where applicable.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.119
These long spans are strong enough to support
themselves in between piers, but they’re

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.749
still not long enough to leave a gap for the
large vessels that use those five major shipping

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:12.950
lanes into the bay.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.519
For those portions of the bridge, engineers
had to switch up their design.

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.079
Across three of the lanes, they used a cable-stay
bridge design, where large towers are anchored

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.110
with cables directly to the deck.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.890
The towers absorb the compression forces on
the spans.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.559
For two of those navigation channels through,
cable-stayed bridges were not an option.

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.230
The tall towers would pose a risk to flights
from the nearby airport.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.629
So the designers decided to take part of the
bridge underwater.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.209
6.7 kilometers of the HZMB’s length is a
tunnel, connected to the bridge with an artificial

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.840
island on each end.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.719
This solved the air and sea traffic problems
in one fell swoop, but posed another problem

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.180
for the local marine life.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.889
The usual process of making artificial land
starts with dredging out the muck on the seafloor

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.510
and filling it with sand, then building a
sea wall on top of that and finally filling

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.999
in the area within the sea wall.

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.049
But the process of dredging muddies the water
with disturbed and dumped sediment.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.730
This suspended sediment can consist of organic
material, nutrients, or contaminants that

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.700
affect the ecosystem in positive and negative
ways.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.689
When the dust settles, it can blanket and
smother communities living on the seabed.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.689
Past projects that used dredging have played
a part in the decline of the Chinese White

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.689
Dolphin population in the area.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.069
To try and avoid harming the dolphin population
further the builders used a completely different

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.150
approach.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.790
First they installed a matrix of stone columns
running down to the sturdier sand and clay.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.779
Then they drove hollow steel cylinders into
the seabed.

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:41.209
The steel cylinders were each 30 meters in
diameter, and they were connected to form

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.879
a continuous sea wall.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.450
After they were filled in, the rest of the
island could be built, and the tunnel could

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.920
be laid in 33 prefabricated sections from
one island to the other before being buried.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.849
And that’s the last piece of the puzzle.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.659
Add it all up, the piles of piles, the spans
of spans, the cable-stayed sections, the artificial

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.280
islands, the tunnel, and the link roads, and
you get 55 kilometers of a record breaking

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280
bridge.

one of china’s massive engineering projects.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.249
Fun fact, If you want to find the world’s
longest bridge, full stop, you don’t have

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.280
to go far.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.139
The Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge connects
Shanghai to Nanjing and is nearly 165 kilometers

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.830
long.Thanks for watching, and I’lll see
next time on Seeker!
