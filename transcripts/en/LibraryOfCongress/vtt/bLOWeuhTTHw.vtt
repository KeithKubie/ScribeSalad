00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.330
&gt;&gt; Eugene Flanagan: Hello,
my name is Eugene Flanagan.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.950 position:56%
I'm the director of National
Programs at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.480
And it's my great pleasure
to welcome you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.040
to this morning's master
class, the kickoff event

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.460
of our daylong symposium.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.620
The symposium is sponsored
by the library's Poetry

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.920
and Literature Center, as well as
the Folger Shakespeare Library,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.970
the PEN Faulkner Foundation,
and the [inaudible] Foundation.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.270
I want to thank them, and I want
to thank We Need Diverse Books,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240
the grassroots organization
responsible

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.250
for coordinating today's master
class, and whose goal is,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.640
and I quote, to produce and
promote literature that reflects

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.040
and honors the lives
of all young people,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.540
and in doing so to create a world

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.780
in which all children
can see themselves

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.320
as in the pages of a book.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.910
The symposium, and this morning's
master class in particular,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.880
started with one writer,
Kwame Alexander.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.640
I would like to thank Kwame
for his work with the Poetry

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.460
and Literature Center, and for
applying a full court press

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.380
to create the terrific
programming that we

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.010
and the Folger Shakespeare
Library are presenting today.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.950
And thank you for appreciating
that one.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.890
Kwame is a poet, educator,
and author of 21 books.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.020
He has written books for children
of all ages, including Surfs Up,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.490
a picture book [inaudible]
middle grade novel,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.050
and He Said She Said,
a young adult novel.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.210
His book, The Crossover, received
the 2015 John Newbery Medal

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.270
for the most distinguished
contribution to American literature

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.810
for children, and the Lee Bennett
Hopkins Poetry Award presented

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.340
annually to an American
poet or anthologist

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.870
for the most outstanding new
book of children's poetry.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.340
Kwame also works with students

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.440
in the classroom through
Books in a Day.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.170
His program teaches and
empowers teenagers to write

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.250
and publish their own books.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.620 position:56%
And he is founder of Leap for Ghana,
an international literacy project

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.150
that builds libraries,
trains teachers,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.040
and empowers children
through literature.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.680
He has said, again I quote, writing
is active, writing is action,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.580
writing is activism, writing
is being part of the world,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.510
and that's what I like to do.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
As he gets us started here today,
please join me in welcoming a man

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.510
of words and actions,
Kwame Alexander.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:51.850
[ Applause ]

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.150
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
Wow, I said all that?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.430
Thank you, Eugene.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.760
Thank you to the Library of
Congress, to the Center for Poetry

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.550
and Literature, to the
Center of the Book.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.610
Thank you to Robert
[assumed spelling]

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.070
and Anya [assumed spelling]
for being excited

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.330
and open to this opportunity.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.800
Almost a year, if not more,
maybe eight or nine months ago,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.550
and here's how it happened.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.800
I was on the phone with a friend
of mine named Jacqueline Woodson.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.850
And we text maybe once a week to
find out if we're in the same city,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.940
because that's really the only
time we get to see each other.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.240
Are you Minneapolis?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.990
No, I'm in -- I'm in Milwaukee.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.690
You know, we're close
but we're not there.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.910
And I said, I was talking to
my editor at Houghton Mifflin,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.440
which is the publisher of
The Crossover, and I said,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.770
Margaret [assumed spelling], do
you all have any black editors?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.270
Do you all have any
editors of color?

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.060
You should really think
about hiring somebody.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.210
And this happened because I --

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.400 position:56%
well, it happened because I had been
thinking about it, but I was sort

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.660
of moved to contact her immediately
because I received an e-mail

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.960
from Jason Low [assumed spelling].

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.680
And Jason said, Kwame,
we're doing a survey.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.040
Can we get your publisher involved?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.760
And I was like, oh, I don't know
if they're going to move on that,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.090 position:56%
but maybe there's another way I can
go about this so let me call and see

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.970
if I can, you know, sort of probe
them to hire some black editors.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.630
I had a little bit
of cache at this time

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.750
because I had just read an
article in Publishers Weekly

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.170
that said Houghton Mifflin,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.200
their fourth quarter results were
significantly higher than last year

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.780
because of three things,
some cookbook,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.320
some educational unit they
had purchased from Scholastic,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.840
and the sales of The Crossover.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.230
So I said, let me try to use a
little bit of leverage [laughter].

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.190
And my editor's response
was, Kwame, we've tried.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.230
We've looked for editors of color,

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.590
and there just aren't
a whole lot out there.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.420
Now two things.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.010
One, that's a cop out.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.310
We all know that.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.990
And number two, well if it's a
cop out where are the editors?

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.290
Where are the writers?

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.590
Where are the marketers?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.190
Where are the people
of color who need

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.120
to be children's book publishing?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.530
And so I texted Jackie
[assumed spelling] and said,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.960
Jackie, let's do a master class.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.640
I'm going to propose this
to the Library of Congress

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.960
and let's get editors,
writers, publishers, marketers,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.910
promoters of the future
of color in a room

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.670
and let's just share
what we have to say.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.150
To share what we've been through.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.800
And Robert and Anya were on board.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.530
And I called up friends
of mine in the industry,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.370
Cassandra [assumed spelling]
from Scholastic, Jenny Brown now

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.400
at Random House, [inaudible],
Jason from Lee

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.940
and Low, and everybody said yes.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.430
And so that's how we ended
up here in this room.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.870
It started with an e-mail
from Jason, a text to Jackie,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.660 position:56%
and it really speaks to how things
work in this industry in particular,

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.290
and just in American in general.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.510
You can't know what you don't know.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.030
And the way you find out things
is by people who are interested

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.050
and concerned and care enough to
be able to share things with you,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.630
resources, opportunities, tools,
tips, tricks, and techniques.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.490
And I think that's
why we're here today.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.020
Would you agree?

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.320
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So by a show of hands, people who
want to write or who are writing?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.940
Excellent.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.140
People who want to be involved
are involved in the business

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.300
of literature and publishing?

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.970 position:56%
Lovely, lovely, that's so important.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.730
Librarians, teachers?

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.070
Excellent.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.800
And so we're all here
together under one roof.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.250
I think the end goal -- the
end goal of today is for us

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.620
to certainly be inspired, but
more importantly it's for us

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.150
to leave here with some
practical sort of guidance,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.950
some rules as they were, that
are going to propel us forward.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.380 position:56%
So we've got 55 people in this room,
there's no reason why five five, 10,

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.280 position:56%
or 15 of you all when you leave here
today are actively pursuing your

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.620
dream, your idea of what it means
for you to be a part of the world

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.530
of Children's Book Publishing.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.960
And it is a beautiful world.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.340 position:56%
And here's the cool part about
children's literature and publishing

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.350
when it compares to other
aspects of the publishing world.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.710
There is no competition.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.990
Well, no, let me not
say that [laughter].

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.370
Let me not say it like that.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:52.230
There is no competitive
energy amongst us.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.180
When you're in the room where it
happens we all trying to support

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.890
and encourage each other.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.540
I wish I had gotten into
children's books a long time ago.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.230
There is a spirit of love.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.700
There is cooperation.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.750
Yeah, it's competitive, everybody
wants to sort of do their thing

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.800
and be successful, but we
all support each other,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.860
and you can't ask for
a better industry

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.770
if you're a part of
writing to be in.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.570
I tell poets all the
time in particular,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.720
if you want to make some money
get into children's books.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.030
We spend a lot of time writing --
you know, as poets we spend a lot

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.180
of time writing and submitting and
trying to get out poems published.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.230
And it's wonderful.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.670
And we do it not to make money.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.200
What, Robert Frost
said there's no poetry

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.580
in money and no money in poetry.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.350
We don't do it to make money.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.230
We do it because we love to do it.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.100 position:56%
But at some point you have a family.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.990
I have two kids and I have a wife.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.400
And you have to figure out
how to sort of, you know,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.390
marry the art and the commerce.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.880
And so how do you do that?

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.550
I posit that if you're a poet
you write a wonderful book of 40

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:06.420
or 50 poems and it's -- you know,
you sell three or 4000 copies.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:12.960 position:56%
And it's okay, it's cool and you
get critical acclaim and you love it

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.980
and you share and you do
your readings and so forth

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:24.520 position:56%
versus you write one poem and it's a
picture book and maybe you sell five

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.080
or 10,000 copies of
this picture book.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.730
And it's one poem.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.340
See people, we're going
to get real today.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.810
We're going to talk
[laughter] -- I'm not --

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.760
we're not going to come
up here and talk theory.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.950
We're going to talk dollars
and cents, because this is

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.130
about you are moving
forward in this industry

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.840
and having some modicum
understanding of how it works

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.800
so that you can be successful.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.580
Kwame off his soapbox.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.230
Thank you, Eugene, for
that wonderful introduction

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.530
and for the reminders of the
fact that, yes, this is about art

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.090 position:56%
and commerce, but it's also about
the responsibility that you all have

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.890
to help kids imagine a
better and a brighter world.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.400
Poetry is activism.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.270
Children's literature is activism.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.710
So this is going to be a great day.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.230
Anya hasn't held up her
five minutes, have you?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.090
Okay, three minutes, okay.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.880
So I mention that -- I called
some people to have them --

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.830
to make sure they were
in the room today.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:29.250 position:56%
And first up is -- I suppose how
this is going to work is our experts

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:35.320
in the field, we have editors, we
have publishers, we have writers.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.150
We have just some wonderful
people here today.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.000
They're going to come up
and present and share sort

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.710
of their experience and
some tools with you.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.150
And then we'll do a Q and A.
And I have a few questions

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.030
in case you all get a little
shy, but this is your chance

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.940
so certainly jot down your
questions as you're listening.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:06.430
About 10 years ago I
submitted to a contest

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.190 position:56%
to get my children's book published.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:15.000
And at this point in time this
was the only publisher that seemed

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.170 position:56%
like they were involved and invested

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:22.400
in promoting publishing
diverse books.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.040
How many of you all are
familiar with Lee and Low Books?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.480
Of course.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.780
Of course you are.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.670
Jason Low is the publisher and
the co-owner of Lee and Low Books,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.530 position:56%
the largest multicultural children's
book publisher in the United States,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:44.530
founded in 1991, year I moved
from Virginia Tech to Arlington,

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:50.510
Virginia, which means this
is their 25th anniversary.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.320
[ Applause ]

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.960
It was the name 2014 Indy Publisher
of the Year by Forward Magazine,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.300
the Eric Carle Museum selected
Lee and Low as the recipient

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.820
of the Angel Award for its
dedication to diversity books.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:15.260 position:56%
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
our first presenter, a friend,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.940
a figure in the publishing
industry who has been a part

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.840
of the diverse books movement
before there was a movement,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.610
and we'll get into
that a little later.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.510
Please welcome Jason Low.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:42.050
[ Applause ]

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.000
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Good
morning, how are you?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.300
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.600
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Excellent.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.970
All right, so I don't have to
cover the 25th anniversary thing

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.900
because it's already been covered.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:58.010
But it is -- it is a
major milestone for us.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.890
And I guess in the
next 40, 45 minutes --

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.930
40 minutes maybe, I'm going to sort
of start out and talk about like,

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.960
you know, how it all started,
our progress through the years,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.520
and then where we are now.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.990
I guess the first question
that I'm going to answer is

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.520
that why is it even
necessary for a company

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.970
like Lee and Low Books to exist?

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.290
The world we live in
is very diverse.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.110
And this shot here
is sort of like --

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.270
it always reminds me of
when I lived in Queens

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.320
and I would take the F train
into the city to go to work.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.030
I mean, this is really
my world view.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.370
This is what I always
think the world looks like.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:56.870
The -- and also the fact is
that the U.S. Census Bureau

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:02.310
in 2014 basically cited
that children under the age

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:07.040
of five years old had
become a minority majority.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:14.020
On top of that the other census
also added by 2020 that all kids

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.690
under the age of 18 would
become a minority majority.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.770
So literally, you know,
that's four years from now.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:26.250
I mean, that's not -- that's
practically here, right.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.910
So I think what's interesting
about that in contrast is

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.350
that these numbers are pulled

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.790
from the Cooperative Children's
Book Center in Madison, Wisconsin,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.990
and they keep track of the new
diverse books published each year.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:48.460
And despite the population being
overall 37% people of color,

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.670
we only have over the
span of 22 years 10%

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.340
of new children's books published
each year that have any kind

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.940
of multicultural content.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.670
So have a huge disconnect,
a huge separation, you know,

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:07.610
separation from what the world
looks like and then what the view

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.270
of books looks like in terms

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:14.820
of whose experiences are
captured in the pages of books.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:21.930
Now in the beginning
when we started it was --

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.870
we could basically manage
to do the very basics.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.430 position:56%
And what I mean by that basics is we
could afford to publish a few books.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.690
We could afford to send
them out for review.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.220
You would post the reviews
and awards our website,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.650
which I built actually
in the early days.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.960
Back then there was no web.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.940
It was all -- marketing
was basically reliant

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.640
on the U.S. Postal Service, so you
would purchase thousands of names

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.450
and you would mail a couple
catalogs out to those names.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.210
And then we could also go and --

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.170
go to conferences with
our distributors.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.060
So all in all that --
those are the basics.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.700
It's not a winning formula
for getting your books known.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.240
But luckily in our very first list
we published Baseball Saved Us.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.590
Now the story behind Baseball
Saved Us is that it's, you know,

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.630
a book about the Japanese
internment camp, right.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.810
And so we came out with
three books on our first list

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.360
and the distributor that
was going to, you know,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.680
basically carry our books, liked
the other two books that we did,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.150
but did not like Baseball Saved Us.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.280
They basically said this
book is way too dark.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.480
This is not going to have any kind
of, you know, audience whatsoever.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.370
So they dropped us, you
know, as a distributor.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.110
And so we had to essentially
find another distributor.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:51.270
So after we did that, you know,
got everything squared away,

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.240
got the book out there, we
landed a full page review

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.920
in the New York Times, right.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.150
And so in one fell swoop,
right out of the gate,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:06.290 position:56%
Baseball Saved Us put us on the map.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.550
So essentially baseball
has done a few things.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.510
It established a bar for us
in terms of what was possible

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.120
about which stories
you could tell to kids.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.920
And it's also -- sort of
outlines, you know, good timing.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.540
In the early '90s there was a
big push for multicultural books.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.590
You know, so -- you know, we
were just coming on the scene.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.160
The timing was good.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.400
I think luck had something
to do with it.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.780
But then also pushing the
envelope and really, you know,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.750
sort of testing what
is possible, you know,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.390
in terms of stories for kids.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:49.380
Okay, so this is a, you
know, multi-tool leather man,

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.250
and the reason why I show this
is not because of my interest in,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.890
you know, doing handiwork
around the house,

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.400
but it's sort of to illustrate
a point that when you are

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.090
in a startup there are some
advantages to being in a startup.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.940
And some of those advantages
are that if you come

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.060
up with a strategy there aren't
like layers of management to sort

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.740
of weave through to
employ that strategy.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.670
Or if you want to change that
strategy you just change it.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.220
You don't -- there's not a
lot of discussion involved.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.860 position:56%
But there are distinct
disadvantages to being in a startup.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.770
And some of those disadvantages are

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.610
that you essentially
wear all the hats.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.910
I mean, when I started in Lee
and Low 18 years ago I was --

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.210
I started as the website designer.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.050
I was the network administrator.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.890
If your computer had a
problem I was that guy.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.960
I was the marketing manager.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.380
I did order processing, human
resources, hiring, firing,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.240
you know, managing people.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.250
I worked in the editorial
department.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.590
I was an art director.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:59.900
Did all -- you know, oversaw all
of our promotional materials.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.730
And then on top of that there was
the role of running a business.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.770
So I think, you know, sort
of what that illustrates is

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.350
that actually sounds kind of cool,
like that's like the kind of job

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.490
where it never gets
dull and years can fly

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.130
by because you're always
doing something different.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.850
But what that illustrates is that
a lot of publishers, you know,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:28.000
who maybe have niche missions,
get stuck in the startup mode

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.030
where they essentially wear
all the hats, they can afford

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.930
to publish some books, send them
out for review, that type of thing.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.510
But they never grow
to the next stage.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.090
You know, and I know there are
many small publishers who have been

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.270
around for decades and
they're still at that stage.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.440
So it's very hard to sort
of influence what's going

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.090
on if you're still just
scrambling to do the basics.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.820
Now historically publishing,
it's a cottage --

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.520 position:56%
it was a cottage industry, you know.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.790
It was built on selling books to
sort of mom and pop companies known

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.090
as independent bookstores.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.790
The relationship mostly worked
back then because, you know,

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.170
the booksellers were
very knowledgeable.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.590
They [inaudible] you know, they --
and when they did have some books

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.330
that they didn't sell they
could take that unsold stock

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.520
and they could basically return
it to the publisher for a credit.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.020
And this was an industry standard
or courtesy at the time, all right.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.710
So that model was pretty
much blown to pieces

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.700
when the superstores came
onto the scene, right.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.660
And we tried for many
years to work with B and N

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.720
and [inaudible] and
things like that.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.020 position:56%
But the thing is the reason
working with them didn't work was --

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.530
it was partially because of

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.430
that industry courtesy
of returning books.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.790
And so let me just walk
you through this, right.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.330
So let's say you published a book

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.920
and you print 10,000
copies of that book, right.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.910
So then Barnes and Noble
comes, they see your new books,

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.790
and then they say, oh, you
know, we like this book.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.710
We're going to buy 5000 copies.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.110
And you're like, great,
here you go, you know.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:17.870 position:56%
And so then -- so then they have the
5000, you're left with 5000, right.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:23.150
So then you basically concentrate
on selling down those 5000 copies.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.620
And then, boom, you
know, a few months later,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.960
whatever, you've done it, right.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.560
So you got to back and reprint that
title so you can keep selling it.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.820
So then at the end of the year
Barnes and Noble would come back

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.160
and they would return any unsold
stock that they didn't sell.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.530
Now, the thing is, that's a
problem because they have Barnes

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.840
and Nobles all over
the place, right.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.870
So let's say they bought that 5000
copies, all of a sudden you --

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:54.200
we were seeing like 80%
returns or whatever.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.970
So then you would have all of this
stock come back into the warehouse

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.960
and that would be on
top of the stock

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.530
that you just reprinted, right.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.910
So the way it works in
independent publishing,

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.050
I don't know how it works in the
larger houses, is that you want

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.780
to keep about a year's worth
of inventory on hand, right.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.060
But then with the returns,
all of a sudden,

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.830
you have two to three years'
worth of inventory hanging

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.980 position:56%
out in your warehouse that you have
to pay for to basically house there.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.160
So it basically it causes
an inventory nightmare

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.190
and you got a flood of inventory
sitting in the warehouse.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.960
It just messes with your cash flow

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.650
because all your money
is tied up in inventory.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.520
So really that did not
work for us, you know,

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.700
in terms of working
with superstores.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:46.090
Amazon is -- basically came onto
the scene and basically destroyed,

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.390
you know, the superstores.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:51.900
I mean, Borders is gone, B and
N is on the ropes now, you know,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.180
and it's really -- you
know, and I would --

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.010
I would say though that they're
much better at selling books.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.170
You know, I mean they got all the
algorithms, they got the code.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.790
Basically, you know, when they
get books they sell books,

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.090
they return very little.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.810
So that's good a good thing.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.580
But the bad thing is the big
picture of publishing, right.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:18.060
The thing is Amazon really operates
in a very uneven playing field,

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.550
and I'm going to tell you why.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.790
Because they basically buy
books on consignment, right.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.650
And so that means they don't have
to put any money down, right,

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:31.010
and then they sell their
books, whereas in booksellers

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.770
and superstores they got to buy
any books that they sell, right.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.800 position:56%
So uneven playing field right there.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.090
So it's not as even if you
could say to Amazon, well,

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.440
we can't do this consignment
thing anymore.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.800
You don't bargain with
Amazon [laughter].

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.370
They do what they want to do and
there isn't any discussion, right.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:55.920
So I'm saying that Amazon
basically creates, you know,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.670
an unlevel playing field since
the superstores, you know,

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.120
are on the ropes, as well as
the independent booksellers.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.670
I think it's an unhealthy
environment, you know,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.080
because essentially we're
heading toward a monopoly,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.990
and monopolies aren't good, right.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.990
I mean, at one point
Amazon was in negotiation

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.580
with one of the big houses.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.690
They didn't like the way
the negotiations were going.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.090
They took away all their
buy buttons, right.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.880
I mean, that's not the way you
partner with someone, you know,

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.930
that you're working with long-term.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.000
That's just, you know, being a
bully, being the big buy, you know,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.260
he doesn't have to listen
to you anyone, okay.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.360
So that's -- the thing is,
there is a price to be paid

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.920
for one click purchases and
having drones bringing packages

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.270
to your doorstep.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.040
So what did work for us?

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.320
What worked for us
was the school market

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.350
and the school library market.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.520
And the reason that
this works for us is

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.470
because they don't
return books, okay.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.890
Essentially you can
manage what you're doing.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.540
It's very, very -- you sell
something, it stays sold.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.250
You know, that's the
way you got to go there.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.940
So that works for us, okay.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.270
All right, where are we?

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.200
So, getting back to what
Lee and Low Books is up to.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.650
So back in 2000 we launched
the New Voices Award.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.600
And I would call the New
Voices Award kind of re-upping

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.480
on your mission know for mission.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.360
You know, before -- actually,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.960
did I even say what
our mission was before?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.260
Remind me.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.560
All right, I'm going to say it now.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.120
Anyway, the mission of Lee and
Low Books is to fill the void

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.220
of diverse books that
are not present

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.870
in the publishing industry
right now.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:46.630 position:56%
And to work with and nurture authors
and illustrators of color, okay.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.980
Okay, now back here, right,
with the New Voices Award.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:55.030
Essentially what we were seeing was
that there was an exorbitant amount

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.670
of diverse books being published
by white authors, right.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.580
So we said to ourselves, okay,
we're going to have to re-up

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.980
on the mission, make
a concerted effort

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.110
to reach out to authors color.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:12.250
And so what this award does is
it publishes authors, not --

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.810
who have not been published
before and who are people of color

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.120 position:56%
for picture book manuscripts, right.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.030
So one of those books is Juna's
Jar -- Juna's Jar, excuse me.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.030
And Juna's Jar is a New
Voices Award winner.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.730
It's about friendship.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.960
It's about imagination, but I think
most importantly it's got this

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.510
universal message of, you
know, when your friend moves,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:43.020
your best friend moves away,
you know, I'm feeling that pain,

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.940
dealing with that pain, but
through fantasy, you know,

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.340
in Juna's Jar she gets to finally
say goodbye to her best friend

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.470
in her fantasy life even
though she didn't get to do it

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:55.770
in her real life, you know.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.340
So it's a really sweet book.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.230
It was reviewed by the New
York Times and everything.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.790
It did really well.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.740
The second book here is, it's
Little Melba and Her Big Trombone.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.230
So this book is about Melba Liston,

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.550
and she was a trombonist
and a ranger.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.900
She worked with all the
greats, Dizzy Gillespie,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.220
Count Basie, Louis Armstrong.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.250
And she -- so the book does a good
job of talking about the gender

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.000
and racial issues that she faced

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.450
because really the music business
was an old boys club, you know,

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.490 position:56%
so you had that working against her.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:35.270
You know, but also captures the
love, you know, and the frenetic,

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:40.320
you know, excitement of jazz,
and that's really done through,

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.290
you know, our illustrator,
Frank Morrison,

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.190 position:56%
who did an amazing job on this book.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.990
The third book here
is Olinguito, right.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.900
And it is -- this book it's
got a lot in it, right.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.060
I mean, it's about exploration.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.960
It's about science and environment.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.220
It's an alphabetical book.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.020
It's bilingual so it's good
for dual language studies.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.380
But it's got this great message
about discovery because, you know,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.910 position:56%
basically it was believed in science

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.240 position:56%
that all mammals had been catalogued
already, had been discovered.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.930
There wasn't any new
mammals out there.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.440
But then a years back they
discover the olinguito.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.600
And so I think it's like a great
message to put out to kids that,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.430
you know, that you can still
find new things in the world.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.540
And it even has a Where's Waldo
component to it where kids can look

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.190
for the naturalist who is searching

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:38.520
for the olinguito throughout the
book, so there's that as well.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.820
Okay, imprints.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.780
So the way we've been able to
grow is through a combination

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.950
of homespun imprints as
well as some through --

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.450
we've gotten through acquisitions.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.220
So Bebop Books, they're --

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.400
that's our imprint for kids who
are just learning how to read.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:00.640
Tu Books is -- was the idea
of Editor Stacy Whitman,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.830 position:56%
and I discovered her on Kickstarter.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.370
She was trying to raise money
to basically launch two books.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.720
And so I contacted her
and I said, you know,

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.010
I think that you would be able to
expedite what you're trying to do

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.210
with books if you joined
us, right, and she did.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:20.570 position:56%
And so Tu Books sort of lends itself
to older books for readers, okay.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.380
Children's Book Press is --

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.260 position:56%
they were the first multicultural
book publisher in the United States.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.740
They were the very first.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.900
And so Children's Books
Press and [inaudible] Books,

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.000
they fell on hard times so
we were able to fold them

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.780
into what it is we do
because it was a great fit,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.710
you know, in terms of diversity.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.860 position:56%
Now, managing Children's Books Press

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.920 position:56%
and [inaudible] is a good
opportunity to talk about, you know,

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.470
the diverse books that
in print already.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.630 position:56%
You know, before I mention the
Cooperative Children's Book Center's

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.500
statistics on new diverse books
that are published each year,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.040
but what about the books
that are already in print?

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.220
Now the thing is if
Children's Book Press

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.540
and [inaudible] essentially
ceased to exist,

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.660
that would be a large
amount of diverse books

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.470
that essentially would not be
available for kids to read.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.260
So I think it's important to sort
of keep your eye on the books

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.080
that are out there already.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.700
So when the age of
social media happened,

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:28.690
I would say personal blogs
came onto the scene around '96,

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:34.550
corporate blogs followed in 2000,
Facebook was created in 2004,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:39.320
Twitter came up -- came
up -- was created in 2006.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.770
So we began to get more
active online, right.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:48.860 position:56%
And so we started a blog but it took
many years for us to figure out what

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.690
to talk about online, right.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:54.950
And so then we started this
series called the Diversity Gap

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:58.480
and we began to look at different
things a little more in-depth.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.950
And we started children's books.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.590
Again, Cooperative Children's
Book Center data has been

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.170
out there for years.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.670
And we took it and we put
it in an infographic, right.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:13.010
And so infographics are --
they're essentially these graphics

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.360
that allow you to take
complex data sets

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.380
and then make them completely
understandable at a glance,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.200
you know, because they're
so easy to read.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.640 position:56%
So, you know, the Children's Book --

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.990
Cooperative Children's Book Center
data had been out there for years,

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.380
but then when we put it in the
infographic there were who were,

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.870
you know, very, very
familiar with this information

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.950
but were actually shocked
to see it displayed this way

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.700
and over so many years.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.730
They didn't think that the
situation was this bad.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:49.450
And so then when -- so let's see.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.750
Where am I?

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.050
Okay, okay.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:56.380
So then -- so then -- so
we started that online.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.200
And then around the time
that we launched two books.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.650
Again, we re-upping
on the mission, right.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.650
We started the New Visions Award.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:10.360
And this was -- is an award
for unpublished authors

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.110
of middle grade and
YA novels, right.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.340
So -- and they have to
be people of color again.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:23.870
So Tu Books also brought a sense of
fun, you know, to our line because,

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.990 position:56%
you know, there's always that
complaint that diverse books are dry

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.650
and they're not a lot of fun and
it's like eating your broccoli,

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.660
but it's more -- but Tu Books
was able to sort of bring a sense

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:38.390
of adventure, a sense of, you
know, thrilling action, you know.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.910
And so with this book
here, Killer of Enemies,

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:46.350
it's written by the Native American
storyteller Joseph Bruchac, right.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.660
And so what these books allowed
us to do was come up with

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:54.720 position:56%
like very quick one-liners of
summing up what the books are about.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.480
So for Killer of Enemies we have --

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.710
it's an Apache post-apocalyptic
steam punk thriller [laughter].

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.010
Pretty fun, right?

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:09.510
So then Ink and Ashes, it's
Veronica Mars meets the yakuza,

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:13.300
which is the Japanese mafia, okay.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.110
And then Yummy, Yummy is
our first graphic novel

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:21.160
and it is essentially --
who here likes comic books?

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.270
All right, yeah.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.980
I'm a huge comic book fan.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:31.800
I just really admire how the format
allows you to tell complex stories

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.590
through sequential artwork.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.920
So rather than tell you
anything about Yummy I'm going

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.200
to play this book trailer for you

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.510
and it will essentially
tell you what it's about.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:35:53.110
[ Music ]

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:57.630
So our next graphic novel will
actually be coming out next year,

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.890
and I believe that it's
going to be just as powerful,

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.580
if not more powerful, than
what you just saw for Yummy.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.750
So we're really looking
forward to that.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.410
So our online presence
continue to grow.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.160
And when I mention the diversity
gap studies we began to branch

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.980
out into other areas,
TV, film, theater,

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.670
New York Times bestseller list,
politics, and the tech industry.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:29.980
So when we looked at, for
instance, the Emmy Awards,

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:35.100
did you know last year that Viola
Davis was the first woman of color

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:40.180
to win an Emmy for a drama in
the whole history of the Emmy's.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:45.120
And then when we looked at
the Academy Awards in film,

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.380
in the 87 years of the Academy
Awards history only one person

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.200
of color has won the
Oscar for best actress.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.770
And who was that?

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:59.780
Halle Berry, right,
2002, in 87 years.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.080
It's amazing, right.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.500
So we began to look at these
different industries and we saw,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:12.820 position:56%
you know, there was a lot, you know,
connections being made, you know,

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.920
of seeing the same
thing happening over

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.180
and over again in different
industries.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:21.160
And so these systemic problems
that we were seeing was, you know,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.730
we were -- it wasn't one of those
-- we were letting our readers know

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.500
that publishing was
not the only industry

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.310
that was facing these things.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.700
Now I don't think the diversity
gap provides all the answers,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:35.270
but I do think that it's
asking the right questions.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:39.670
So a diversity gap
on the tech field,

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:45.010
which you see in the lower
left-hand corner, that was the one

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:52.200 position:56%
that essentially inspired us to run
a diversity staff survey of our own.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.310 position:56%
And so that, we released it at the
beginning of this year and it was --

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.730
and it's called the
Diversity Baseline Survey.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:04.220
And so what that is, is it's
essentially it was taking a look

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.550
at staffing at publishing
and reviewers, right,

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.560
and what the diversity looked
like behind the scenes.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:16.610
Now mostly up until this point most
of the feeling about the diversity

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.170
in publishing behind the
scenes was anecdotal.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.360
You know, people knew
we had a problem

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.880
but they didn't really
know how bad it was,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.220
and there was certainly
no data to really look at.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.310
So when we launched
this we wanted to sort

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.980
of establish a baseline number that
essentially would act as something

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.440
that we would be able to
measure progress against,

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.860
whether it's getting better,
staying the same, or getting worse.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:44.360
So from an industry overall
you could see that, you know,

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:52.260
79% of publishing staff is white,
78% is women, 88% is straight,

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.560
and 92% is nondisabled, right.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.320
And so all in all, you know,
when all was said and done we had

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.860
about 34 publishers participate
and eight major reviewers.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.470
Three out of the five
big publishers --

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:11.330
big five publishers
participated in the survey.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.210
And we were really trying to make
sure that there was a nice mix

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.740
of small, medium, and
large publishers.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:22.460
You know, when you -- when we could
sort of have a very even, you know,

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.960
viewpoint of what to look at.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:30.780
So in the editorial department
there's 82% white, 84% female,

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.490
86% straight, and 92% nondisabled.

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:38.760
So the interesting part of the
survey I felt was when we began

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.920
to look at departments, right.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.260
And we looked at the
executive level jobs.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.010
We looked at the editorial
department.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.310
We looked at sales.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.460
We looked at marketing, and we
looked at book reviewers, right.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.500
And the reason that we singled
out these particular departments,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.420
because we consider these
departments, you know, gatekeepers.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.230
These are essentially
the departments

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:04.640
that have the responsibility
to not only shape, you know,

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.760 position:56%
what the books are, the main product
that we sell, but also the people

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.940
who sell them, the people who
market them, and book reviewers

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.300
who are basically the taste makers.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.960
They're telling you what to
read and what not to read.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.540
And so you can see that the
diversity is a little less

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.840
so at book reviewers and 89%
are white, 87% are women,

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.790
91% straight, and 88% nondisabled.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:39.050
So when we sent the survey out,
1524 reviewers were surveyed,

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:44.050
11,713 publishing employees
were survey,

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.940
which comes out to a
total 13,237 surveys.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.790
The response rate was about 26%.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:59.210
So I think what may be at work
here is a phenomenon known

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.910
as cultural fit.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:06.010
Cultural fit is defined as the
tendency, conscious, or unconscious

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.540
for executives, editors,
marketers, salespeople,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.920
reviewers that work with,
develop, and recommend books by

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.620 position:56%
and about people who look like them.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.920
And I think cultural fit
relates to corporate culture.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.150
And it definitely has something
to do with hiring, okay.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.910
So, you know, just to illustrate,
you know, how this relates to Lee

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.830
and Low Books, you know, how do
our numbers look in terms of,

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:33.450
you know, staff diversity.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:36.520
So you could see that 69% of
the people who work at Lee

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.690
and Low Books are people of color.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:43.850
If we were to drill down to the
departments we have 50% of people

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:46.380
in editorial are people of color.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.590
In marketing we have 75% of
people are people of color.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.500
Sales is 50%, operations 100%.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.370
And we have fluent Spanish
speakers in editorial,

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.260
marketing, publicity, and sales.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:04.700
And then you might be
interested on how the author

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.010
and illustrator mix looks like.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.240
And so 68% of Lee and Low's authors

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.870
and illustrators are
people of color.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.470
So what happens next?

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.240
You know, we have all this data.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.050
I mean, what do we do next?

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.160
And so one thing that we
decided to do from looking

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.290
at this data was we partnered with
Simmons College, because we noticed

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:31.290
that a lot of people who go into
publishing, who become reviewers,

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.500
actually have advanced degrees.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.750
So what this partnership
with Simmons does,

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:40.620
we set up a $100,000 scholarship to
help people of color who are going

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.550
for those degrees, who are destined
to enter publishing, you know,

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.110
and help them a little bit
with that financial obstacle

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.550
of getting those advanced degrees.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.580
We also have an internship that
we've been running for years.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.570
About a couple years
back we switched it

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.860
to an internship for
students of color.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.460
You know, and it's
a paid internship.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.860
So then, you know,
students who, you know,

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.540
can't afford to do unpaid
internships wouldn't have

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.190
that problem serving
an internship with us.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:14.320
Now when Lee and Low started
we could do very little outside

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.700
of the very basics.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.190
You know, we could
publish our books.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.980
We could send them out for review.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.060
But we could do little
else aside from that.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.410
Twenty-five years later
we're able to do more

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:29.090
to influence the big
picture of publishing, okay.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:33.430
So doing more takes
many, many forms.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:38.440
As readers doing more could be
just the act of buying a book.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.600
They say that buying a book
could be a political act.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.900
Well, choosing to buy

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.820
or read diverse books
is a conscious decision.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.530
Now, while inequality and
the lack of representation

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:56.170
in books may seem insurmountable,
it is a problem like no other.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:58.850
So since I'm a business
owner I look at things.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.250 position:56%
I look at problems in a certain way.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:07.990 position:56%
So if a problem exists, the
problem must be studied, understood,

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:16.620
resources allocated, goals set,
solutions tried, failures analyzed,

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.940
and then more solutions tried.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:24.540
It's essentially a process of
rinse, wash, and repeat, okay.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.310
So authors like Kwame,
[inaudible], Jackie,

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:33.580 position:56%
everyone who basically organized
this day for us, they're doing more.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.330
Companies like Lee and Low

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:39.970
and the other publishers
participating today are doing more.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:48.350
And in our world of instant
gratification, on demand, you know,

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:52.650
basically ability, it's
really tough, you know,

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.500
because doing more isn't easy.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.920
Okay, how -- what time of
the day is left in your day

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.670
after you've got done
binge watching, you know,

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:04.000
the whole second season
of Daredevil, you know.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.280
But I want to end with a quote
from a commencement speech

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.530
that Congressman John
Lewis gave last week.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:17.600
As he recounted his days being
a freedom writer in the 1960's,

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:23.020
and Congressman Lewis is quoted
as saying, we didn't give up.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.890
We didn't give in.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.850
We didn't lose faith.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.320
We kept our eyes on the prize.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.120
Thank you.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:50.040
[ Applause ]

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.490
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: So we have
about 11 minutes for questions.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:57.440
And so you've got to ask
yourself, why was that important?

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.420
Writing is a job.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.580
This is an industry you
want to be a part of.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:02.880
This is work.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.050
And so it's important for you
to know how the industry works,

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:10.700
the background of it, you know,
from multiple perspectives.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.640 position:56%
And so you got a lot of information,
a lot of things happening.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.500
I hope you wrote down
things like Simmons College.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.770
And when you research
what their involvement is

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:23.250
in the children's literature
industry some of you may say, well,

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:26.020
this is a path I may
want to go down.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.110
You heard about some
of the imprints.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.500
And that reminded me that maybe
everyone doesn't know what an

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:34.150
imprint is and you may be too
shy to ask that kind of question.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:35.710
No question is silly enough.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.590
If you don't want to
ask it, write it down,

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:41.670
hand it to me when I'm walking
down the aisles, all right.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.950
But there are a lot of
things that Jason shared.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.070
So let's get into questions.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.370
Yes?

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.670
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.730
I'm sorry, we have two
people holding mics.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:55.270
So hold up your hand and then
they will -- hold it up high.

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:57.970 position:56%
They will bring a mic around to you.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.330
Thank you.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.630
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.310
I guess I'll start
with a basic question.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:11.160
You mentioned getting to Lee
and Low through a contest.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.570
What are ways to get your work
to a publisher like Lee and Low?

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:16.870
[inaudible] what's the best way?

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.460
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: We basically,
in terms of manuscripts,

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:27.730
we accept manuscripts that are
unagented [phonetic], unsolicited.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:32.210
We feel that really, you know,
in order to work with people

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.200
who have never, you know,
worked in publishing before,

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.090
not everyone is going to have an
agent out of the gate so it's kind

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.230
of silly to sort of acquire that.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.950
So, yeah, we have a whole page.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.270
It's called writers and
illustrators on our website.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:49.690
And if you go to, you know, the
writing guidelines it has all,

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:53.050
you know, the information for
approaching us with new work.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.540 position:56%
I'd also like to say that if you ask
a question the first six people will

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.000
receive a free book.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.300
So come and get your
free book [laughter].

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.210
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: We
had a question over here.

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:12.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Morgan [inaudible]

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:17.960
and I'm an aspiring
bestseller for children's books.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.850
I wanted to know for people
who are self-publishing,

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:24.390
what is the best route
for distribution?

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.980 position:56%
Because with the larger distribution
companies they don't talk

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.680
to you unless you have
multiple titles under your name?

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.550
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: I mean,
the self-publishing sort

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:39.090
of industry is interesting, you
know, because what it points to is

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:43.170
that basically you're taking on
the task of being a small publisher

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:46.800
of one, you know, of that one
bestseller that you're going to do.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.550 position:56%
So you really have to be comfortable
if you're going to go this route.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:53.640
You know, to do it all, really.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.370
You know, kind of what I was --
when I showed you the leather man,

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:58.920
you got be -- you got to do
all those roles, you know.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.750
And I'm not sure about
like, you know,

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.090
in the early days we were handled

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.320
by a distributor called Publishers
Group West, but I'm not sure

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.980
if they take on self-published
books, you know.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.820
I mean, you may try them
because I do remember

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.270
when I walked passed their
booth at one of the shows

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:18.360
that sometimes they would have an
author there and she only had --

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.450
would have like three books
or something like that.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:23.790
So I think that they may
have decided to take that on.

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.720
So you might check that out, yeah.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.660
Oh, you asked a question,
so here you go.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.340
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me?

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.640 position:56%
Okay. My name is Akonkai [phonetic].

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.310
My question was similar to hers.

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:42.830
If someone wanted to start
a small publishing company,

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:47.770
how do you get distribution and
how do you get your books reviewed?

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.070
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Yeah,
I mean, you know,

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:50.790
we only work with the
one distributor

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.240
so I can only speak to that.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.130
But it really is sort of
like you're trying out,

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.590
you know, for the team, you know.

00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:00.130
And so, you know, once you
had some books would go

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.810
and you would send them, or you
would find the contact to send them

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.620
to them, and then they would
decide whether to take you on.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.290
There's a number of
distributors out there, you know,

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:11.620
and so I think you would have
to make the rounds, you know,

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.170
and hopefully find a good fit.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:15.710
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: And
just to add on to that,

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.670
because those are very
good questions.

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.970
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Yeah.

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.270
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Go
ahead, say your thing.

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:21.570
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Oh no, I was just --

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:25.530
&gt;&gt; Kwame Low: The book,
you got to get the book.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.720
Distribution in this
day and age is --

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:32.250
there's a great equalizer out
there for self-published authors

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:35.090
that allows you get your
books directly to the customer

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.490
without dealing with wholesale
and distribution discounts.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.630
That's called the Internet people.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.710
Like, yeah, like use the
Internet, use social media

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.100
to get your books out there.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.440
You in effect can become the
distributor for your titles,

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.330
and that's -- so let's
start there first.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:56.230
Let's figure out how we're going
to sell our titles, sell our books.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:51:01.570 position:56%
Now, as Jason mentioned, the largest
wholesaler, and I guess distributor

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.540
in the world for trade, is Ingram.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:11.050
And so they have a
program for small presses

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:16.760
and for self-published authors
that will get your books to retail

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.170
and libraries and schools.

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:20.890
So check out Ingram.

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:25.070
But yeah, you all distribute --
you know, get your books out there.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.800
That's most important.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.580
Right here.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:37.060
So with the rise of Amazon and the
role of publishing and the fact

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.460
that Barnes and Noble is the
only major bookstore out there

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:45.880
that now has half the shelf space
that is used to, and with the rise

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.640
of self-publishing, what is the
future of the publishing industry

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.530
for corporate houses,
independent houses?

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:57.860
Is it a shrinking field, or how
can they navigate these changes

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:02.430
as there are more, more
alternatives, or more, more giants?

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.110
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Well, I think
that's a great question.

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:09.360 position:56%
And I really do feel that publishing
is long overdue for a little bit

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.350
of an overhaul in terms of
reimagining how to do business.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.250
Because, you know, as you
can tell from what I --

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.050
when I was talking about
Amazon, I'm not a big fan, right.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:23.610
And I don't like sort of my
terms being dictated, you know,

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:28.870 position:56%
by someone who's not willing to, you
know, have a win win arrangement.

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.930
You know, it's basically
this is what we're doing,

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:32.500
it's our way or the highway, right.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.380 position:56%
And that's not a way to do business.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.580
So I think that, you know, the
Internet can work both ways,

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.500 position:56%
you know, where technology can be --

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.310
work against you, it can
also work for you, you know.

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.370
So I think that, you know, in terms

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.920
of independent publishers they
may have to go out on their own,

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.310
you know, develop,
you know, e-commerce,

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:52.710
you know, that basically works.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:56.220
It isn't just some pretty website
that essentially is some --

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.090
you know, is a glorified catalog.

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:01.420
You know, basically learn
e-commerce, get in there,

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.850
and make it work, you know.

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:06.740
So I think publishing has to
sort of pull itself up, you know,

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.450
by its own bootstraps, and maybe
the old models are outdated

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.360
and they have to be
reformed, you know.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.530
So I think that, you know,
publishers have to act

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:20.610
like the scrappy startups that
were a long, long time ago

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.650
and really think outside
the box and,

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.650
you know, get this business going.

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:27.560
Because I think books are amazing.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:32.080
I think books are an incredible
product that hasn't really,

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.890
you know, lost any of its allure.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:39.830
But the selling channel
needs work though, okay.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.650
And publishers, if they're
going to say, hey, you know,

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.350
we're going to take your book,
we're going to get it out there,

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.270
then they got to do a much better
job of doing that, you know,

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.300
and can't be beholden to,
you know, the big gorilla

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.610
in the room or whatever, you know.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.790
So I hope that answers
some of your question.

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:58.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.430
&gt;&gt; Hello my name is Keisha
Jones [assumed spelling],

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:13.100
as you can see earlier.

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:17.540
Have there been situations where
a self-publisher was so successful

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.490
that a publishing company
wanted to publish their product?

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.790
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Sure.

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.500
&gt;&gt; Has something like that
occurred with your company?

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: It has happened with
us, but there have been some stories

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:31.000
of books that have
been self-published

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.280
and become huge, you know.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.010
What was that book that was --

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.290
Yeah, [inaudible] is a
good example of that.

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:39.840
I mean, there's some amazing --

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.860
you know, where the person
they got rejected a 1000 times.

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:44.650
They said I'm going
to do it on my own.

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:48.730
All of a sudden they were selling,
you know, books hand over fist.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:53.520
And so then a publisher got wind
of that, basically took that book,

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.720
you know, and made it
their own or, you know,

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.230 position:56%
helped them distribute it even more.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:00.850
So, yes, that is --
that does happen, yeah.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.910
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: It happens --
it happens -- it happens a lot.

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:05.210
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Yeah.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:06.510
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: And when you
-- so I'll give you two examples.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.380
One, some of you -- you all
look pretty young though

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.900
so you all may not remember.

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.600
But there was this writer
named E. Lynn Harris.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.200
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Remember that?

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:20.640
And E. Lynn Harris wrote novels
featuring characters that were gay

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.810
and he self-published
these characters.

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:24.810
The Invisible Life
was his first one.

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:28.960
And he ended up becoming a
huge number one New York Times

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.930
bestseller, and I forgot
which publisher he was with.

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:35.110
But more recently,
Fifty Shades of Gray,

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:38.680
and those were e-books
that she published.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.050
So it's very common.

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:43.740
I think we have time for
maybe one more question.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.040
Let's make it good.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.340
Right here, make it good.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.850
&gt;&gt; It looks like you're
out of books,

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:54.570
but I still have a
question [laughter].

00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:56.080
So my name is Lisa
Yearwood [assumed spelling],

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.230
another bestselling
author soon one day.

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:04.260
I wanted to know in this culture

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:13.450
where we have a push towards
brief clips type of reading,

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:18.810
what do you see as the
future of reading in general?

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:20.110
Do you have hope?

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.410
Do you see new ways?

00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:25.780
I see that you have the clip
for the book and that kind

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.540
of reaches a new audience
and draws them in.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:33.290
But there used to be kind of
this [inaudible] for reading

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:37.640
and I was wondering how
you feel about that?

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:42.660
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Yeah, I mean, I -- it
depends on what day you talk to me.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.400
I mean, as I said, I
have great faith in,

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.590
you know, books in general.

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.340
You know, I still think
they're great.

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.290
But, I mean, one cannot, you
know, bury your head in the sand

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:57.600
and basically not look
at the way the world is.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.550
I mean, there's just -- you
know, there's an amazing amount

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:03.720
of alternative entertainment
out there, you know.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.740
I mean from binge watching,
they certainly didn't have

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.450
that when I was growing up,
you know, to, you know, just --

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:14.900
I mean, when I walk down the
aisle and I'm on my commuter train

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:19.300
in the morning and everybody
is glued to their devices,

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.660
there aren't a lot of people who
are reading print books, you know.

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:26.490
And so, you know, I'm not like
looking over people's shoulder

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:29.060
and seeing what they're
doing on their device.

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.620
Are they reading, you know,
maybe on their devices?

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:34.940
So essentially that that
points to e-books, you know.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.480
But, I mean, I can speak
personally from, you know,

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.770 position:56%
e-book sales that essentially that's
not happening for children, right.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:46.230
Maybe it's happening for adult,
but not so much for children.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.470
So for us it's still paper books.

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:51.860 position:56%
It's still books, you know, that
you can hold in your hand, you know,

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.000
and have that, you know,
tactile experience.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.780
So I'm hopeful, you know, because,
you know, I think at the end

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:03.510
of the day, you know, I'm a pretty
smart guy and I might be able

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:04.910
to come up with something for us.

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:08.460
But I'm hoping that, you know,
this industry is also filled

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.610
with smart folks as well and that,
you know, if they want to see books

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.120
around they're going to have
to get innovative, you know,

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.650
and think of new ways sell them.

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:19.870
So it's a bit of a dodge
that answer, you know,

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:24.050
but I don't have all the answers
though is what it really comes

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.210
down to.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.950
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Ladies and
gentlemen, Jason Low [applause].

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:30.620
Thank you, man.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.420
&gt;&gt; Jason Low: Thank you.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:45.640
[ Applause ]

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.820
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: So when we
recap sort of that experience,

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:53.900
what we learned is that we
need to know this business.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.620
Jason knows this business.

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.490
He's known it for 25 plus years.

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:04.160
And you want to be in this world
of changing the lives of children,

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.460
you've got to learn the business.

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:09.970
You have to know the ins and
outs, and so it's important.

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:20.320
The Crossover, which was written
over the course of five years,

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.750
was a novel that had
been rejected quite a bit

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:26.470 position:56%
by publishers, which is nothing new.

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:27.770
The writers who are published

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.380
in this room will tell you
rejection is a part of the game,

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:34.000
and had been rejected quite a bit.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:44.650
And I guess through a little bit
of perseverance I stuck to it,

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:46.850
and eventually was rewarded

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:52.720
with this phenomenal life
changing honor, Newbery Medal.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:56.510
As it happens -- yeah,
free to clap [laughter].

00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:01.040
[ Applause ]

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:11.240
As it happens, there are 14
members of a committee that decide

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.620
which book will be the most
distinguished contribution

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.870
to American literature
for children that year.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:23.740
And one of those 14 members is
here today, who's responsible

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.470
for ultimately changing
my writerly life.

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:31.450 position:56%
Jennifer Brown is the vice president
and publisher at Alfred Knopf Books

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:35.290
for Young Readers, an
imprint of Random House.

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:39.060
Now if you all know, again this
goes back to knowing the business

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.540
and knowing the history,
Alfred Knopf

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.970
and Blanch Knopf published what
famous black [inaudible] of Harlem?

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:52.930
Come on, [inaudible]?

01:00:52.930 --> 01:01:00.740 position:56%
She's -- Jennifer is the former
children's editor of Self Awareness,

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:06.430
the director of the Children's
Literature Center at Bank Street.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.180
She served as a children's
review editor

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.950
for Publishers Weekly for 10 years.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:13.350
She has served on numerous
industry committees,

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:16.960
including the 2014 John
Newbery Medal Committee.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.180
Prior to Publishers Weekly she
was a children's book editor

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.660
at HarperCollins, and an elementary
school teacher, grades K to two.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:28.930
I invited her here because,
like Jason, she's in publishing

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:31.310
but from a different
perspective and I want you all

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:32.850
to be equipped with all of it.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:34.650
Please welcome my friend,
Jennifer Brown.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:47.350
[ Applause ]

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:48.650
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Good morning.

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:49.950
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:53.100
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: So
I just need to start

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.330
by saying I've been thinking a lot
about what happened in Orlando.

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:04.300
And I keep thinking what if that
shooter had had an opportunity

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.900
to read a story that
would change his mind.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:14.070 position:56%
You know, it's in the midst of that
sadness, I think all of us mourning,

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:17.770
what happened there, we had
a celebration of Hamilton,

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:22.180
which is such an extraordinary
feat of theater and story

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:27.190
and revealing the complexity of the
men who helped form this nation.

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:32.370 position:56%
We're sitting in the room of one of
their -- Thomas Jefferson's Library,

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:36.580
so I think we're here to have a
really interesting conversation

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.680
about the many voices
that we need to hear.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.410
So without further ado.

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:47.670
There are so many books,
and the question

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:51.670
for me is how do we get
certain ones to stand out.

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:55.700
So I'm going to talk to you
today as aspiring writers,

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:59.190
but also as people we need
in the publishing industry.

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:02.450
And I'm going to try to collect
some of the voices that I've heard

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:06.450
through my career,
which is rather long,

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:10.140
and just let you know how many
different possibilities there are

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.470
for you.

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:14.750
Some back -- some background
about me as a reader.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.630
These are the books I grew up with.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.460
My brother, who is four
years younger than I am,

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.120
and I remember [inaudible]
of the I Can Read Book Club.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.020
I read aloud to him.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.270
When I taught I read
aloud to my students even

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:27.220 position:56%
after they could read independently.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.760
And my husband and I still
read aloud to each other.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.410
I cannot stress enough the
importance of reading aloud.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:38.720
And these are the books I grew
up with in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.570
In first grade I saw the
movie Oliver with Mark Lester,

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.340
Jeff Wilde, and Ron Moody.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.030
In third grade I played Fanny,

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.920
Scrooge's little sister
in A Christmas Carol.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.170
I wound up writing my
junior paper in college

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:52.850
about the orphan figure in Dickens.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:55.220
You can see that my
obsessions are lifelong.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.320
So I'm going to go through a lot
here, so if you have questions

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.960
at the end that will be great.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.650
I'm just going to speed through.

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:03.670
I fell in love with James
Joyce when I read A Portrait

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:05.300
of the Artist as a Young Man.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.460
I fell in love with this book
because of what it taught me

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.330
about Irish history and
politics through the fights

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:12.830
around Stephen Douglas's
dinner table.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:17.000
I was thrilled to discover
that Ulysses began

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.170
as a short story in Dubliners.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:24.040
I never read Finnegans Wake.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.190
So what's an English major to do?

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:29.470
That's what I did, I
majored in English.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.730
I was bent on avoiding the
profession everybody told me I had

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:37.240
to go into, which was teaching,
though I did end up teaching.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.000
I read Maxwell Perkins, Editor
of Genius, and I saw that he got

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.290
to work with many of
my favorite authors.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:45.480 position:56%
So I decided that's what I would do.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.560
I would move to New York
and be just like Dickens.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.860
I'm sorry Perkins.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.500
But when I went to what was
then Harper and Row to interview

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:57.150
for a job as an adult trade
editor, the head of HR said,

01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:59.600
everyone thinks they want
to be an adult trade editor,

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.640
but you haven't met Bill Morris.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.940
That's Bill.

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.520
He was the director
of library promotion

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.030
for Harper Children's Books.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:12.680
At conferences you are more likely
to see him looking like this.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.380
This is Bill with Jean
Craighead George, who wrote Julie

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.610
of the Wolves and My
Side of the Mountain.

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.930
And that's me with Trev Jones
[assumed spelling] on the left.

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:22.370
Oh, I'm just speeding through here.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:25.210
I don't know what happened, okay.

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:26.920
That me with Bill right
out of college,

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.680
and that's Trev Jones
in the pink blazer.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.150
She was the children's reviews
editor at School Library Journal.

01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:36.280
Bill was my mentor
until he died in 2003.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.730
He introduced me to the most
wonderful people in publishing

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.340
and he was an avid reader.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.920
His favorite book was portrait
of a lady by Henry James.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.260
He taught me everything
about Harper's rich history.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:52.120
This is briefly my circuitous
route, and I'm posting this here

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.310
because you can never make
a mistake, that's my view.

01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:58.460
Every choice I made led
to something interesting.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:01.250
So I started out, as I
said, in marketing as --

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.650
and then an editorial
assistant at Harper.

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:07.850
Then I left to teach K through 12,
but I continued reading manuscripts

01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:11.370
at Harper and also worked
on the annotated catalog,

01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:14.520
which is the backlist
catalog which means anything

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.330
that was published
more than a year ago.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.330
So I went back into that
in the summer with Bill.

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:23.340
Then I was offered a job as a
head teacher and Bill intervened

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.200
and said we need an
educational marketing manager.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.110
And that was at a time when
whole language was taking off.

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:31.850
I don't know how many
of you remember that.

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:33.860
But that was when teachers
were starting

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.330
to use trade books
instead of textbooks.

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:38.030
And I thought, wow, I
get to see, you know,

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:41.380
what the whole country was
doing, what their approach was.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.950
And we had so many
wonderful books at Harper

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:45.770
that I thought this
would be an opportunity

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.310
to really find out
what was happening.

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:51.830
Then I became the reviews
editor at --

01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:57.140
first SLJ as a freelancer with Trev
Jones, who you saw, and also at PW,

01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:00.460
and I ended up staying
at PW for 10 years,

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.820
and then moving to Shelf Awareness.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:07.060
And while I did my work at Shelf
Awareness I also was volunteering

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.080
at the Bank Street
Children's Book Committee.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.680
And that ended up evolving
into the director of the Center

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.500
of Children's Literature there.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.800
And now I'm publishing
director at Knopf.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.320
Why did I chart this as a circle?

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.330
Because you will see -- soon
see how this is all connected.

01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:30.230
In the great green room there
was a telephone and a red balloon

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:35.510
and a picture of the cow --
the cow jumping over the --

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.810
&gt;&gt; Moon.

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:38.110
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Moon, okay.

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:42.800
Do you know how early a child
learns to complete that sentence?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.220
As soon as they can form words.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.360
That's what I discovered when Dr.
Perry Class [assumed spelling] came

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.350
to speak at Bank Street.

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:54.100
Think about the power of that,
that a phrase of yours could be one

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.910
that a child holds close
through his or her whole life.

01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:01.360
In the beginning was the
word and the word was

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.090
with God and the word was God.

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:07.590
Whether or not you are a
believer this is a powerful idea,

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:10.550
that from the word comes a world.

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:12.530
As a writer that is what you do.

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:15.090
You create a world with words.

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:17.690
What you want to do is invite
young readers into your world

01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:20.790
with those very first words.

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:22.750
Where's papa going with that axe?

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.110
Does anybody know what that's from?

01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:26.160
[ Inaudible ]

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.780
Very good.

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:32.820
We know by the end of that first
paragraph that Fern is going

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:37.560
to rescue this little pig, that's
going to turn out to be Wilbur.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.900
Good thing the plane had seatbelts

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.140
and we had been strapped
in tight before takeoff.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.470 position:56%
Without them that last jolt would've
been enough to throw Vonetta

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:52.040
into orbit and Fern
across the aisle.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.010
Still, I anchored myself and
my sisters best as I could

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:57.300
to brace us for whatever came next.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.010
Those clouds weren't
through with us yet

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.670
and dealt another Cassius
Clay left and a right jab

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.790
to the body of our Boeing 727.

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:08.570
That's the opening to One Crazy
Summer by Rita Williams Garcia.

01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:10.760
Right away you wonder
where are they going?

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.630
Why are these three
sisters traveling alone?

01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:17.540
And Delfina's mention of Cassius
Clay places us in a historical era

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.290
and hints at the civil
rights movement that's going

01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:20.780
to be the setting for
the entire novel.

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:27.130
My name is India Opal Buloni and
last summer my daddy, the preacher,

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.490
sent me to the store for a
box of macaroni and cheese,

01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:31.480
some white rice, and two tomatoes,

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.680
and I came back with
a dog [laughter].

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.860
Now, if you go to the Kerlan
Collection at the University

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:41.510
of Minnesota, you will discover
just how many drafts it took Kate

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:44.190
DiCamillo to come up
with that first.

01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:46.680
Walter Dean Myers'
papers are there also.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.670
And there are several other
wonderful institutions

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:51.990
that have those kinds
of papers available.

01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:53.290
Some of them are online.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.870
So if you want to see
me after we can talk

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:57.240
about how you can research
some of those things,

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.070
because they're really instructive.

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:04.910
I just put Jon Klassen's I Want My
Hat Back here as a way of thinking

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:10.790
about format, because he does
something really interesting here.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.630
There's no word wasted.

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:14.890
He doesn't say he said, she said.

01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:18.950
He shows you by the color
of the type who's talking.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:22.950
And one of the wonderful things
is the bear is looking for his hat

01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:26.750
and he's asking of a variety of
animals and no one's helping him.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.420
So he finally says,
thank you anyway.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.770
And what happens when
you read it aloud

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:34.520
to children is they start going
thank you anyway, and they make it

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.410
into this little musical refrain.

01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:37.710
It's uncanny.

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:39.020
No matter who you read
it to, how many classes,

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:42.750
what age, they all do that.

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:46.910
I love showing this book because A
Hole Is To Dig is by Ruth Krauss.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.570
She wrote it and Maurice
Sendak illustrated it.

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:53.020
She picked him, which never
happened in the 1930's.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:56.580
She was a member of the Writers
Lab along with Margaret Wise Brown,

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:59.850
Crockett Johnson, which was Ruth
Krauss' husband, who wrote Harold

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:04.980
and the Purple Crayon, and they all
invented this children's literature

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.370
for very young children.

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:10.160
At that time there was very little
being published for young children,

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:13.380
and certainly not the way they
talked about the world or saw it.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:15.970
So I'm just going to show
you a couple spreads here.

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:18.590
A face is so you can make faces.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:21.290
Huh, rugs are so dog have napkins.

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.120
A hole is for a mouse to live in.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.740
Ruth Krauss used to say the story
-- she actually published at Harper

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.230
and the legend was that she
thought she would be sued by one

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:33.940
of her former students because
she basically just wrote

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:37.500
down everything they said.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.540
The sun is to tell you
when it's every day.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.890
I just love these.

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.380
You can just pour over them.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.400
Okay, I wanted to touch
on information books,

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.060
because this is a really
booming area as well.

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:53.650
And this -- what I love about
this book is that she --

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:58.540
it takes you into Tony Sarg,
who is very approachable.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:01.290
He created the Balloons
Over Broadway,

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:03.650
the Thanksgiving Day
parade balloons.

01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:07.380
But he started as a
puppeteer and a toymaker.

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.820
And you can see Melissa's
notes here.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:15.310 position:56%
And most authors and artists do
give you a window into their process

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:17.460
if you go into their website.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.500
And I just think that she's
such a wonderful resource.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.850
Her journal pages look
just like her books.

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:29.140
How Many Jellybeans I have here
because Andrea Menotti was trying

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:32.920 position:56%
to explain to her children how math
works and she couldn't find anything

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.470
to explain it so she
wrote this book.

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:41.470 position:56%
And in his acceptance speech, Yancey
Labat, who is the artist for this,

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:45.540 position:56%
thanked his publisher for creating a
special casing to house this foldout

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.970
which shows actually
1 million jellybeans.

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:50.950
And later I can tell
you how he did that.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.450
But I just love kids being able

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:55.060
to actually see what
1 million looks like.

01:12:55.060 --> 01:13:02.150
The Cook Prize is a prize
that Bank Street came up with

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:05.370
to encourage the publication
of STEM books, science,

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:07.450
technology, engineering, and math.

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:10.090
And I wanted to mention
this in the Irma Black Award

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:14.730
because the Irma Black Award is
for a book that works together

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:17.540
with both words and pictures,

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.510
and both of these prizes
are selected by children.

01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:25.430
The -- you can register
online and you find

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:28.400
out what the four finalists
are and you get an opportunity

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.700
to have all the children voting.

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:32.820
And I included Moonshot

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:35.850
because Brian Floca took
10 years to write it.

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:37.470
He uses the endpapers for a lot

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:41.320
of the information he wasn't
able to fit into the book.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.940
And he is another who
shares his research,

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:48.570
his sketch stages,
before his final art.

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:50.100
We Are America.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.760
This is one of my favorite books,

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.940
and I think it's so
timely right now.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:57.640
This was a book that Walter Dean
Myers wrote in response to 9/11.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.500 position:56%
He thought I was one of those people
who was critical of my country

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.070
and I wanted to look again at why
I live here and why I love it.

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.810
I'm going to get emotional, okay.

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:12.470
So, and his son, Christopher Myers,
who's on the left, did the artwork

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:15.330
for it and did a huge
amount of research himself.

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:19.460
And they showcase individuals who
I hadn't known about in history,

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.060
and these giant murals which are
then, you know, printed in these --

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.330
this very nice oversized book,

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.950
but it doesn't do justice
to the beautiful murals.

01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:36.530
And again, Walter draws from the
founding fathers in these documents

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:40.540
and it just gives you that sense
of complexity of who these men were

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.070
and what they were struggling with.

01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:45.250
This was a juxtaposition
that I loved.

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:51.000
It's the Mayflower on the left and
present day refugees on the right.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.750
And that is a theme that goes on
through the book and really plays

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.400
up the importance of this
country's immigrants and the people

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.140
who were here before we came.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.830 position:56%
We Were There, Too, I have this here

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:07.900
because Phillip Hoose discovered
Claudette Colvin's story

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.560
when he was doing the research
for We Were There, Too,

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.020
which was about young people
who made a difference.

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.640
And he tried for years

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.570
to get Claudette Colvin
to do her full story.

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:22.870
She was 14 years old when
she refused to sit --

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:29.410 position:56%
she was 14 years old when she
refused to stand up on a Montgomery,

01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:33.020
Alabama bus nine months
before Rosa Parks.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.140
And her story is very complicated.

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.590
This book is extraordinary.

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:41.630
And she only agreed to an interview
with him after she retired,

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:43.490
and it'll become clear why.

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:47.010
But the two of them toured
together to promote this book,

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:49.010
and it's extremely moving.

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:54.570
To me it was a story persistence
and trust and partnership.

01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:58.310
And I have Gene Luen Yang here
because he's going to come

01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:00.770
up in a few minutes
again, but Boxers

01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:03.070
and Saints is an extraordinary
way to look

01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:05.590
at the Boxer Rebellion
from both sides.

01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:10.150
And by the end you feel like
they both really had a reason

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:16.460
for fighting, and that's the beauty
of what Gene Luen Yang does here.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.740
There are even panels that
are identical in both books,

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:23.350
but you get to see the
perspective of each narrator

01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:27.640
so you really get a sense of just
how complicated the situation was.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.600
I'm just touching on
beginning readers.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.130 position:56%
It was really interesting to me that
these began both at Random House

01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.960
and at Harper and Row in 1957.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.890
So there was this kind of bubbling
up of necessity to have books

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:44.440
for children who wanted
to read independently.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.520
And I have these two here just
to give you a sense of how --

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.450
again, how format is changing.

01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:56.130
I feel like there's so much more we
can do now with printing and online

01:16:56.130 --> 01:17:01.110
so you can really see what
form your story needs to take.

01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:03.460
I love what [inaudible]
does with panels.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.070
Who would have thought of
panels for beginning readers?

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:09.700
And Francoise Mouly did something
very similar with her Tune Books.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.480
Francoise is the art
director for The New Yorker,

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.050
and she also developed
her own magazine

01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:17.820
with her husband, Art Spiegelman.

01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:20.040
So they, too, are using
cartoon panels

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.260
to teach children how to read.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.030
Kevin Henkes is one of
my favorite writers.

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:27.400
He started when he was 19.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:32.250
He did a series of
books called Penny,

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:34.590
and with each book her
world gets a little bigger.

01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:38.410
I have him here because he also
writes for very young children,

01:17:38.410 --> 01:17:40.840
Wemberly Worried being one of them.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.340
Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse is
for the newly independent child.

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.480
And The Year of Billy
Miller is a novel.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.020
And I'm going to talk about a few
other authors who run the gamut.

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:56.850
Pam Munoz Ryan, her
biography of Marian Anderson.

01:17:56.850 --> 01:17:59.650
Echo, which is her most
recent, gorgeous book,

01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:02.090
three different perspectives
that come together.

01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:06.380
Esperanza Rising, which is
kind of her family story.

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:09.050
Kwame Alexander, Acoustic Rooster

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:12.780
and His Barnyard Band picture
book [applause], yay, Crossover,

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.830
fabulous middle grade
novel, and He Said She Said,

01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:17.130
which is his [inaudible].

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:20.850 position:56%
We mentioned the same one, see that.

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:26.100
Grace Lin, she does Ugly
Vegetables as a board book.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.740 position:56%
Ling and Ting is a beginning reader.

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:31.370 position:56%
Where the Mountain Meets the Moon is
her Newbery Honor middle grade book.

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:35.510
So these are just some -- I think
it really helps sometimes to think

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:43.120
about author studies and what
you're -- what your format can be.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.380
Jacqueline Woodson,
obviously, Each Kindness,

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:48.170
which is this wonderfully
open ended story

01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:52.040
where it just leaves both the
narrator and the reader thinking

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.610
about what could've
been done differently.

01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:58.640
Show Way [inaudible] book
and, of course, her memoire,

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.480
Brown Girl Dreaming in poetry.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.220
Marilyn Nelson is another
poet I adore.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.700
Beautiful Ballerina, a
very simple picture book.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:10.080
How I Discovered Poetry is
her memoir of becoming a poet.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.880
And Emmett Till should have won
the Pulitzer Prize in my view.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.960
And Walter, Walter was one of the
first people I met in publishing.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.520
And he just never stopped.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.440
I mean, he was always researching.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.670
Every time he went to
a new town he would go

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:27.310
to the antique stores
and look for books.

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:29.500
And he started collecting
old photographs

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.290
and that became Brown Angels.

01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:35.330
He also discovered the story behind
At her Majesty's Request in one

01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:37.940
of those antique stores as well.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.810
And again, Monster was
-- broke every format.

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:48.740
He created a genre with this
I think, the idea of a script,

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.210
to my knowledge, I can't get
another one that came before that.

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:55.000
I wanted to mention Neil Gaiman

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.800
because I think he does something
that's really instructive

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.150
for writers, which is
he Tweets all day long.

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:03.450 position:56%
I don't know many of you follow him.

01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:08.000 position:56%
And then he crafts a blog at the end
of the day that's primarily composed

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.430 position:56%
of his Tweets, and it helps me think
about how we can use our writing

01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:16.600
and our thinking throughout
the day to reflect.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:21.740
So I just wanted to mention that
if any of you have a chance, okay.

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.680
So I have [inaudible] I've
gotten away from my notes

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.930
because I'm just trying
to speed through.

01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:29.350
Let's see.

01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:33.220 position:56%
So basically I wanted to just talk a
little bit about the people I've met

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.090 position:56%
in my travels and some of the things

01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:37.500
that they had to say
about publishing.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:45.550 position:56%
And also to talk about how, you
know, I only saw a few hands I think

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:48.520 position:56%
when I looked around of those of you
who wanted to go into publishing,

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.330
but it's such a great way to learn
the inside if you want to write.

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:54.860
And I'm just going to single

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:58.280
out Mya Mutain [assumed
spelling] who is back here.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.980
Mya started as our
intern last fall --

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:08.150
last fall at Knopf and now she's
a full-time editorial member

01:21:08.150 --> 01:21:09.450
of Random House.

01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:14.060
So Mya is one of those people with
a double life who you're going

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.560
to hear more of in a moment.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:21.180
So, sorry, I forgot
-- I've lost my notes.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.480
So this is Calvin Reid.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:29.600
Calvin, when I got to PW, oh
gosh, it was probably 2005,

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.060
he was the only person
talking about comics.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:35.120
And he was the only person
talking about e-books.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.610
And he said -- I said, Calvin,
how did you get into publishing?

01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:40.590
And he said, well, I
came to be an artist

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:43.690
and I got a job at Library Journal.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:47.750
But Calvin is really such
a generous human being.

01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:51.430
When America Born Chinese landed
on my desk at Publishers Weekly

01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:55.560
when I was the children's editor,
I didn't know what to do with it.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.980
Calvin said, you know,
you need to review this.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.280
This is a children's book.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.370
And I said, I wouldn't know
how to evaluate it, Calvin.

01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:04.320
So he reviewed it in his comics
column, but then he proceeded

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.340
to teach me everything he knew
about comics, pacing, color,

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:13.690
the use of kind of telescoping
in and then coming back out.

01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.900
He was so generous.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:20.690
And he said -- he joined PW during
an alternative comics movement,

01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:23.800
and any process like pantographic

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.660
and [inaudible] were just
starting superhero comics,

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:32.890
and he knew that PW was the
perfect vehicle to make the case.

01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:36.000
Kwame talked about
children's books as activism.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.660
And, you know, we talked a little
bit about what might've happened.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:42.620
How would people behave differently
if they had the compassion

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:45.220
of a children's book
that made a difference?

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.160
And I think, you know, what Calvin
did was decide this is the way I'm

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.690
going to be able to get
comics out in the world.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.320
Phoebe Yeah, who is
also very involved

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:02.140
in this we need diverse books
movement, was introduced

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.930
to publishing through Jane
Yolen, who is an author

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:08.080
and who also taught at her college.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:15.980
John Adamo, our director
of marketing, loved music

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.420
and publishing and he ended
up going into publishing,

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:22.430
but he still plays in a band.

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.750
This is James Perry on the
left, Ken Kong on the right.

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:28.820
James said he always was read to
as a child and he wanted to go

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.320
into publishing because he
felt it would make a difference

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.620
in the world.

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.090
And Ken, I always like to
tell stories like this,

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:38.980
Ken began his attempt in the
legal department at Golden Books.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:42.090
And when Golden Books was
acquired by Random House he stayed

01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:44.870
and he's just gone up
and up and he's now one

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:47.880
of our finance business managers.

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:52.970
Ali Biber wanted to
come to into publishing

01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:55.430
because of how creative it was.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:58.190
Lisa Clark, this was
my favorite, she said,

01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:00.020
a senior executive I admired said,

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:03.440
figure out what makes your
heart sing and follow that path.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.150
She's head of our HR division
and she treats everyone

01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:10.020
as if it's a problem
solving situation.

01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:13.290
She knows that she can work
it all out, and I think she's

01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:15.920
so committed to children's books.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.980
Okay, so now I'm going
to give you a little,

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:21.370
just a tiny bit of advice here.

01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:24.950
Adam Silvera, some
of you may know him,

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:27.190
he write a book called
More Happy Than Not.

01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:32.370
He approached me at the Pen
Writers Voices program and he said,

01:24:32.370 --> 01:24:34.800
you know, I'd really like
to review children's books.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.380
I work at Barnes and Noble.

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:38.450
And I said, well, send
me some reviews

01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.060
and I'd be happy to look at them.

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.480
He was an excellent
writer obviously,

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.050
and he started reviewing
for Shelf Awareness.

01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:48.190 position:56%
He also ended up being a [inaudible]
manager at Books of Wonder,

01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:51.710
which is a small independent
children's bookstore in New York.

01:24:51.710 --> 01:24:56.000
So my advice is to get
into your local bookstore,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.190
offer to write shelf talkers.

01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:00.670
See if they need help shelving.

01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:03.450
Maybe there's a way you
could help with events.

01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:06.430
Go to your local library, see
if there opportunities there.

01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:08.800
These are the people who
really know children's books.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.060 position:56%
And if you want to learn a lot about
who's coming up, who's coming in,

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:17.000
you know, to actually
see writers speak,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.470
these are wonderful resources.

01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:22.160
B. B. Lewis told the story
once of just trying to break

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.430
into children's books and going
every day at lunch time when he was

01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:31.130
on break and asking his
local bookseller to walk him

01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:33.970
through her favorite books.

01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:39.840
The other is to volunteer.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.450
As I mentioned, I volunteered
at the Children's Book Committee

01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:48.760 position:56%
at Bank Street and that ended up
turning into a three day a week job.

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.200
And I think there so
many ways to get involved

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.510
if you want to get involved.

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:55.950
There's also SCBWI.

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:59.450
How many of you know about that?

01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:02.280
Society of Children's Book
Writers and Illustrators,

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.340
they have conferences
all around the country.

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.210
They have a newsletter that
helps with copyright information

01:26:07.210 --> 01:26:11.690
and who are the new agents, who
might be looking for new clients.

01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:21.350 position:56%
And you can -- you can work at their
local conferences and get involved.

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.450 position:56%
They also have one on one manuscript
critiques who pay a little bit more,

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:27.170
but it's really worth it.

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:31.710
And the other thing
is, literary agents.

01:26:31.710 --> 01:26:35.620
Many of them are based
all around the country,

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.940
but even if you aren't
near one you could offer

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:41.430
to critique manuscripts
for them from afar.

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:45.450
And sometimes that's how
certainly the person who is the hub

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:49.630
of our department now started,
and she also worked at Algonquin

01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:55.110
as a volunteer while she
was at North Carolina.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:59.040
So I think I'm just going
to turn it over now.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.510
Thank you very much.

01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:15.950
[ Applause ]

01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:20.220
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Publishers
Weekly, Shelf Awareness,

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:23.490
writing shelf talkers, some
of this stuff may sound

01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:26.510
like you have no idea what she's
saying, what she's talking about.

01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:27.970
Some of you already know.

01:27:27.970 --> 01:27:29.810
But those are key things.

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:31.970
And so you're taking these notes.

01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:36.190
A master class is where students
come to learn from an expert.

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.830
So some of this stuff you may not
know, but the experts know it.

01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:41.240
So write that stuff down.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.490
The other thing we learned that was
really major here is the importance

01:27:45.490 --> 01:27:51.160
of knowing people and sort of being
around and surrounding yourself

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.950
with people in the industry.

01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:58.110
It's -- we don't like to often
say it but people hook people

01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:00.640
up when they know you,
and when they like you.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.940
Am I right?

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.540
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
That's how it happens.

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.270
If I like you, yeah.

01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:08.690
If I don't know you,
then I don't know you.

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.950
I can't know what I don't know.

01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:12.370
My dad liked to say that.

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:13.670
What does that mean [laughter]?

01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:22.890
And so here's my example,
my experience.

01:28:22.890 --> 01:28:28.540
In 2008 I got invited to a party
at Scholastic by a friend of mine.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.940 position:56%
I didn't know anybody at Scholastic.

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:33.300
But I said -- my wife was like,
you got to go to the party, Kwame.

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.170
You got to be in the
room where it happens.

01:28:35.170 --> 01:28:36.980
I got to the party.

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:42.200 position:56%
It's in the penthouse of Scholastic,
11th floor or whatever floor it is.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.020
I'm walking around,
I'm like, yeah, hey,

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.370
I'm just -- I'm Kwame Alexander.

01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:49.330 position:56%
I've written some -- a lot of poems,
you know, done my thing [laughter].

01:28:49.330 --> 01:28:52.420
And I don't really know why
I'm there but I'm just there.

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.620
And so somebody introduces
me to Lois Bridges.

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:58.180
Lois Bridges works for
Scholastic Professional,

01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.820
which is the educational side,

01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.950
they're publishing
teacher resources.

01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:04.250
And so we hit it off.

01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:05.550
We talked and then I'm out.

01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:08.000
That was 2008.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.170
It's now 2016.

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:17.290
Scholastic eight years later just
published my professional kit,

01:29:17.290 --> 01:29:19.240
book, videos, the whole nine.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.990
And who was the publisher?

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:23.470
Lois Bridges.

01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:28.310 position:56%
Eight years ago I met her and I'm
just a student who is writing poems.

01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:32.020
And now I'm like one
of her major authors.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:35.150
You all were in the Jennifer Brown.

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:38.430
How often are you in the
room with a publisher

01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:40.730
of Alfred Knopf Books
for Young Readers?

01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:42.330
That just doesn't happen.

01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:43.630
People would [inaudible].

01:29:43.630 --> 01:29:46.210
And so I'm not saying bombard
her with your manuscripts,

01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:49.130
but I'm saying keep that in mind.

01:29:49.130 --> 01:29:52.640
Speaking of Scholastic, Cassandra
Pelham grew up in Delaware

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:57.390
and graduated from
Spellman you all [laughter].

01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:59.710
She is a senior editor
for the Graphics

01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:02.050
and Scholastic Press
Imprints at Scholastic

01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:06.250 position:56%
and is edited award-winning number
one New York Times bestselling books

01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:08.880
like Smile.

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.460
Which is another about
Jennifer's presentation,

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.860 position:56%
is that she mentioned so many books.

01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:19.640
You got to -- you got
to read these books.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:24.330
Cassandra spends her time enjoying
the arts, hanging out in Brooklyn,

01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:27.490
and just pretty being
awesome and fabulous.

01:30:27.490 --> 01:30:29.510
You all give it up
for Cassandra Pelham.

01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:51.610
[ Applause ]

01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:53.150
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: Good morning.

01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:54.450
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:58.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: I want to thank
Kwame Alexander, Jacqueline Woodson,

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.670
and We Need Diverse Books for
inviting me to participate

01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:06.330
in this symposium, and the
Library of Congress for hosting us.

01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:10.760
This is my first time here
and I am simply elated.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:14.390
Inside I'm like, oh my
gosh, we're at the Library

01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:19.100
of Congress right now, but I
will try to keep it together

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:21.620
for the next 20 or so minutes.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:24.760
I can't make any promises
beyond that.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:28.400
I'm here today to talk a bit
about my journey in publishing.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.910
My parents are really
academically oriented,

01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:37.300
and between them they have seven
undergraduate and graduate degrees.

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:43.710
This means I was raised in a home
filled books, books on shelves,

01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:47.050
books stacked in piles in
every available surface,

01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:50.240
books in overflowing boxes.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:56.060
They were mostly books about God,
the black experience, psychology,

01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:02.370
finance, and my dad's fraternity,
all topics that I can now get into.

01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:06.600
But when I was a kid I found them
to be extraordinarily boring.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:10.830
It was my older brother's room
that held the jackpot, fiction.

01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:14.410
He had all of the good
stuff, the classics.

01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:16.890
And I tore through his
book along with my own.

01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:21.750
So I was that 10 year old kid
whose favorite books were Roll

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:25.930
of Thunder Hear My Cry by Mildred
D. Taylor, and East of Eden

01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:28.870
by John Steinbeck [laughter].

01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:30.740
My brother is six years
older than me.

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:33.900
We're very close and it was
he who taught me to read books

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:37.770
about pictures using
Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.

01:32:37.770 --> 01:32:40.990
From then on you couldn't
keep me away from books.

01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:43.590
I loved living in imagined worlds.

01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:49.130
So that's what I did until I
enrolled at Spelman College

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:52.010
in Atlanta, Georgia as a
childhood development major

01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:53.730
with a minor in creative writing.

01:32:53.730 --> 01:32:56.820
I had the intention of
eventually working with kids

01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.720
in some capacity and writing.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.690
So a semester passed and I
realized something was missing.

01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:07.490
I wasn't reading as
much as I used to.

01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:11.520
And I wasn't feeling as passionate
about my studies as I knew I could.

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:15.010
I wanted to explore literature and
the history of the written word

01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:17.370
in a way I hadn't previously.

01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:19.550
So I switched to an English major

01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:23.080
and dropped the creative writing
minor, because I also realized

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.280
that I liked writing a
lot more when I did it

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.910
on my own time and in my own time.

01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:32.880
At Spelman I read books by writers
I had never been exposed to before

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.730 position:56%
because I was rarely assigned books
by writers of color in grade school.

01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:41.260
Alice Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks,
James Baldwin, Julia Alvarez,

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:44.390
Octavia Butler, [inaudible],
the list goes on.

01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:48.750
This was a whole new
kind of education.

01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:52.330
My mind was thoroughly
blown and I was in heaven.

01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:55.670
Spelman is where I read
Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi

01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:58.490
for the first time, a
book that changed my life

01:33:58.490 --> 01:34:01.340
and would form my career later on.

01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:05.040
As I neared the end of my
sophomore year I still was not sure

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.300
of what I would actually
do with an English degree.

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:13.010
I often ask myself, what do
people do with English degrees?

01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:15.890
Yes, reading books,
writing papers about books,

01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:19.660 position:56%
and talking about books is all quite
lovely, but I knew I couldn't live

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.680
in my little literary non-revenue
generating world forever.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.390
People would often
ask me if I planned

01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:29.910 position:56%
to be a teacher or go to law school.

01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:33.310
My answer was always
no, no, thank you.

01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:37.090
With this complete lack of
clarity on my own life I started

01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:39.430
to look for a summer job.

01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:42.550
I very much wanted to
do something meaningful,

01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:45.110
something that would
actually mean something to me,

01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:48.620
and do all the studying I
had done so far it justice.

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:52.350
I did not just want to go back to
halfheartedly selling Cutco knives

01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:57.050 position:56%
out of my parents' house in Delaware
like I had the summer before.

01:34:57.050 --> 01:35:00.340
Spelman has an office of career
planning and development.

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:04.800
And one day I spent hours there,
browsing their entire catalog

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.690
of internship brochures
and applications.

01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:12.540 position:56%
I looked at every single piece of
paper in every single filing cabinet

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.780
and found a few things
that I thought I could do,

01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:18.680
but nothing that sounded like it
would ignite a fire inside of me.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.980
Kind of dramatic, right?

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.850
I was quite a vocational
romantic at 19.

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:27.570
I was feeling kind of bummed and
uninspired when I spotted a pile

01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:30.730
of miscellaneous envelopes
on a small table.

01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:33.890
Among them a familiar
red logo peaked out.

01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:39.420
I grabbed just that one envelope
from the pile and opened it.

01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:41.260
In it were five applications

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:45.540
for something called the Scholastic
Children's Defense Fund Fellowship.

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:49.520
I was immediately intrigued
because, like many kids,

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.100
I had grown up reading
Scholastic books,

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:56.820
and I had especially been obsessed
with Scholastic Book Club flyers.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:00.570
I read an application and
I saw that I could apply

01:36:00.570 --> 01:36:03.500
to be a summer fellow
assigned to one of a variety

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:08.010 position:56%
of departments, including editorial.

01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:12.660
Editorial, something stirred
in my spirit and I started

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:16.150
to get really excited because
I knew that this was it.

01:36:16.150 --> 01:36:20.240
This was the meaningful
summer job that I would do.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.900
Being an editor had never once
crossed my mind, but sure,

01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:26.070
I had often been happy to
tell my friends what was wrong

01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:29.100
with their book reports
and term papers.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.220
I love to read books,
and think about books,

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:34.170
the write about books,
and talk about books.

01:36:34.170 --> 01:36:35.710
So why not?

01:36:35.710 --> 01:36:38.200
The applications at the
fellowship would take place

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.890
at Scholastic's headquarters
in New York City

01:36:40.890 --> 01:36:42.350
and housing would be provided.

01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:44.200
So at the very least if I got

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.250
in I could put off selling
Cutco knives for another summer.

01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:53.730
So I got in along with four
other college students of color,

01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:56.030
because this fellowship was
specifically geared toward

01:36:56.030 --> 01:37:00.130
introducing people of color to the
publishing industry with the hope

01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:02.000
that they might someday
become full-time employees.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.870
I was assigned to my first
choice, editorial, and was placed

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:12.130
in Cartwheel Books, a Scholastic
imprint for very young readers.

01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:15.960
That summer I read a lot
of slush, unsolicited

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:18.060
and unagented [phonetic]
manuscripts,

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:23.440 position:56%
wrote a lot of reader's reports, and
wrote a lot of rejection letters.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.100
But I also got the opportunity
to write the first draft

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:31.060
of an early reader, and everyone
I worked with was really nice.

01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:34.320
In addition to our departmental
duties, the fellows had to work

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.620
on a group project together.

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:40.840
We were tasked with developing a
book proposal with Doug E. Fresh

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.770
that would be presented at
an acquisitions meeting.

01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:47.710
It was very cool and I was like,
yes, this is what editors do.

01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:51.250
They develop book proposals
with a human beatbox [laughter].

01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.930
But it wasn't all fun, games,
and sitting around coming

01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:57.800
up with clever ideas
with Doug E. Fresh.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.410
In addition to our departmental
duties and the work we did

01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:03.290
on the group project
evenings and weekends,

01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:05.120
we also had weekly mentor meetings

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.060
with the programs director,
Karen Proctor.

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:10.660
During these meeting we would
discuss the articles and books

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:13.400
that Karen had assigned
to us as required reading,

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.980
pieces about leadership, diversity,
corporate culture, and success.

01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:23.120
And we would also talk about
all our little intern drama,

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:26.120
because that housing I
mentioned that was provided, we,

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:29.250
the fellows who worked together
so intensely on the group project,

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:32.730
and we're already around
each other for so many hours,

01:38:32.730 --> 01:38:34.030
we also lived together

01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:36.980
in [inaudible] College
Housing in Manhattan.

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:41.560
This was a very intense, very
different sort of bonding.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:46.790
I was always tired and I struggled
to find time and space to be alone.

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:49.660
But I was working harder than
I ever had up until that point.

01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:51.350
I was learning.

01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:52.650
I was growing.

01:38:52.650 --> 01:38:56.500
And I was, somewhat
reluctantly, stretching.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:00.030
The five of us were being urged
to reach deep inside ourselves

01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:04.930
and bring forth every fiber of
our potential, and it was hard.

01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:07.770
And while both living and
working with the same small group

01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:11.840 position:56%
of people could be painful at times,
who knows if those of us who weren't

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.550 position:56%
from New York could have figured out
how to be a summer intern in big,

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:19.030
confusing, expensive New York City.

01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:21.870
Sponsored housing was
essential to my --

01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:25.650 position:56%
was essential to my participation in
the program and part of why I'm able

01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:29.020
to be here today at the
Library of Congress [laughter].

01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.860
And here's a fun fact,
when I eventually moved

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.890
to New York City permanently I
rented an apartment off the same

01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:37.750
train line I took to
Scholastic everyday as an intern.

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:41.370 position:56%
That's how much a part of my comfort
zone that summer housing had become.

01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:45.350
I made me feel like New York
was possible and manageable,

01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:48.350
both as an intern and beyond.

01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:52.140
Fortunately, in the past 10
years I have since branched out

01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.820
and ridden other trains [laughter].

01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:57.960
So I went back to school.

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:00.450
I applied to be Scholastic
Children's Defense Fund Fellow,

01:40:00.450 --> 01:40:03.420
for the summers following
my junior and senior years.

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:06.980
And I participated in the program
for a total of three summers.

01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:10.160
The second summary I was assigned
to Arthur A. Levine Books,

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.820
publisher of Harry Potter.

01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:16.240 position:56%
That was the summer Harry Potter and
the Half Blood Prince was published.

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.810
It's difficult to explain
how incredible being

01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:21.170
at Scholastic for that moment was.

01:40:21.170 --> 01:40:25.970
Our group project that summer was
to organize a panel discussion

01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:29.720
of diverse writers and artists that
the entire company was invited to.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.950
And the third summer our group
project gave us the opportunity

01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:37.020
to travel to New Orleans.

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:41.090
It was one year after Hurricane
Katrina, and we were tasked meeting

01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:44.120
with educators and
librarians and then presenting

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:46.890
to Scholastic what we
learned along with a plan

01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:51.230 position:56%
for how Scholastic could help the
schools and libraries still in need.

01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:57.860
At this point I had graduated and
had three transformative summers

01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:59.750
as a Scholastic CDF Fellow.

01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:04.980
By that time I had decided
I want to be an editor.

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.760
When I thought about it
it made perfect sense.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.760
And at Scholastic I could use my
English degree as well as invoke

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.360
that abandoned early
childhood development major.

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:18.470
All I needed was to be exposed
to editorial as a career path

01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:21.790
and a realistic chance
at making it happen.

01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:25.750
My third summer as a fellow
I was assigned to graphics,

01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:28.510
Scholastic's Graphic Novel Imprint,

01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:33.290
which had been established the
year before, and Scholastic Press.

01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:36.050
They were in need of
an editorial assistant.

01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:40.240
So at the end of my third summer
they created a position for me.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:43.160
I am now senior editor for
those same two imprints.

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.740
I have a particular
passion for comics

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:48.660
and acquiring graphic
novels for every reader.

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:51.670
I've edited a number of New York
Times and USA Today bestsellers,

01:41:51.670 --> 01:41:54.660
as well as Eisner Award winners.

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.150
I have the pleasure of working with
some of the most talented writers

01:41:57.150 --> 01:42:00.600 position:56%
and cartoonists around, such as
Reyna Talgameyer [assumed spelling],

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:06.180
Kazu Kibuishi, Mike Maihack,
Jeff Smith, and Kate Messner.

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:09.740
Professionally these past 10
years have been incredible.

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:13.200
I would like to say that one major,
essential theme of my career,

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:17.400
which I talk about any chance
I get, has been mentorship.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:20.530
I've had several brilliant
mentors over the years,

01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:23.480
and my growth through those
relationships has been at the core

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.420
of my personal and
professional development.

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:28.900
But one thing I recently
learned is that it's important

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:33.080
to identify both mentors
and sponsors.

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.820
Mentors usually operate
as sounding boards

01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:38.640
and offer guidance
on an informal level.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.940
Conversations might be more
personal and anecdotal.

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:46.320
Sponsors take more of a directly
professional investment in you

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.550
and use their influence to
market you to someone else,

01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:53.250
thereby creating or furthering
an opportunity for you to move

01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:55.710
to the next level in your career.

01:42:55.710 --> 01:42:58.170
I mention this because this is
something I wish I had learned

01:42:58.170 --> 01:42:59.880
early on.

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.500
I want to thank you all for coming

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:05.660
and for listening to
me tell my story.

01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:08.060
While I hope it provides
some insight into one way

01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:12.290
of building a career in publishing,
it is only one person's story.

01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:13.750
However, it would be nice

01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:18.110 position:56%
to see publishers start a
widespread reinstitution of programs

01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:21.480
like the one I came through
that make a point of trying

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:25.380
to expose more college students
and recent graduates of color

01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:28.050
and various socioeconomic
backgrounds

01:43:28.050 --> 01:43:30.570
to the publishing industry.

01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:33.920
Just last week three college
students and one recent graduate

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.080
of color began participation

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:39.700
in what's being called the
Apprentice Program at Scholastic.

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:44.280
It's a variation of the Scholastic
Children's Defense Fund Fellowship.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.340
I wish each and every
one of you the best

01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.550
on your individual
publishing journeys.

01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:51.220
I hope someday that I
have the opportunity

01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.510
to hear or read all about it.

01:43:53.510 --> 01:44:16.040
[ Applause ]

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.090
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Let us go
right into Q and A, question

01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:22.630 position:56%
and answers for Cassandra and Jenny.

01:44:22.630 --> 01:44:25.690
We have a question
over here on my left.

01:44:25.690 --> 01:44:29.550
Give me one second to get
the microphone to you.

01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:31.850
Up front.

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.380
&gt;&gt; Lisa Yearwood [assumed
spelling], aspiring bestseller.

01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:40.750
Okay, thanks for that.

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:43.200
I just wanted to ask you

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.620
if you could tell us some
rookie mistakes you see

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:52.700
with unpublished authors
in their manuscripts?

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:58.140
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown:
Do you want to start?

01:44:59.530 --> 01:45:01.540
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham:
Rookie mistakes.

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:04.640
I think one thing that
authors sometimes --

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.060
or aspiring authors sometimes
do is they kind of go

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.940
with what they think is
trendy and what's selling.

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:16.350
You know, I think you have to
write what you're passionate about,

01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:20.060
and only you can write the story
that you've chosen to write.

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:23.280
So I think sometimes when
people are trying to ride a wave

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:27.300
and do what they think is just
selling that sometimes the passion

01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:29.990
and authenticity doesn't
come through in the voice.

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:35.360 position:56%
So I would just say to write what
you are passionate about and what --

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.030
you know, what you believe
in and what you truly --

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:39.430
what story is truly burning
a hole in your heart.

01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:46.580
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: I would say the
other thing that I sometimes see is

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:48.620
that someone is in
such a rush to send it

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:51.520
that they haven't fully
developed the ideas.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.240
And I know some people
enjoy being part

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.390
of a writer's group
and others do not.

01:45:58.390 --> 01:46:02.150
But if you have one
trusted reader who can --

01:46:02.150 --> 01:46:07.120
who knows you well as a
writer and can really urge you

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.270
to do your very best
before you send it in.

01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:15.820
So many things come through that
a lot of editors, myself included,

01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:18.880
are looking for a reason
to set that one aside.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:22.970
But if we can really see heart
in there and a true voice,

01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:27.710
as Cassandra was saying, I
think that's your best shot.

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:32.680
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Jenny, can you
tell us -- give us a breakdown,

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:38.920
the top 10 jobs in the
children's publishing industry?

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:43.030
Or not top 10, but give me 10.

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:44.750
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Like
starting positions you mean or?

01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:46.480
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Or just
what are some of the positions

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.020
that are available for
people who are interested

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.390
in that career, the careers?

01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:50.690
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Yes.

01:46:50.690 --> 01:46:51.990
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Because we
talked about -- I mean, we all --

01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:55.710
everybody wants to write, but what
are some other sort of ways in?

01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:58.130
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Well, that
was why I wanted to include some

01:46:58.130 --> 01:47:02.320
of the other people that I've
come across who I really admire.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:06.660
Because there's marketing,
sales, finance.

01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:11.190
Maybe you're great with
people, HR, and the internships.

01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:13.930
You know, Cassandra mentioned
the one that she came

01:47:13.930 --> 01:47:16.410
in with and Mya came in to ours.

01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:17.890
And I think you had exposure

01:47:17.890 --> 01:47:20.240
in several different
departments, did you, Mya?

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.030
Or was it just editorial?

01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:24.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.340
A lot of different things.

01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.770
And then you get to try
your hand at, you know,

01:47:26.770 --> 01:47:29.390
writing flap copy and
things like that.

01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:31.090
But sales is another
great way, you know,

01:47:31.090 --> 01:47:34.020
just to kind of see what your
-- how many books are out there

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:36.500
and how do you make
those books stand out.

01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:39.840
And that's why I think being in
a bookstore is really helpful

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.170
or in the library, seeing what
kids ask for again and again.

01:47:43.170 --> 01:47:48.060
You get that sort of experience
of just being with the children

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:53.000
who are your end readers, or the
teens who are your end readers.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.400
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: There is a --

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:59.030
there's a young lady at
Houghton Mifflin who is --

01:47:59.030 --> 01:48:02.370 position:56%
she's just responsible for Tweeting.

01:48:02.370 --> 01:48:03.900
She just Tweets.

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.610
She's a digital -- a
social media specialist.

01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:10.200
Just so many different
opportunities.

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.500
Next question.

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:14.790
Yes, over here.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:22.540
&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is
Lorraine Rogers Jackson.

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:28.520
And I have a question about
being diverse in genres.

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:29.820
I am an author.

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:34.180
I have a children's series, but I
also just wrote a fantasy novel.

01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:37.500
And what I find is that
it's met with much surprise

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.760
that I wrote in this genre.

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.290
And upon research I see
that there's not a lot

01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:44.500
of diversity in this genre.

01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:50.720
So what is the commitment to
not only offering diverse books,

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:53.110
but also offering diversity
in genres

01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:55.780
where a lot of diversity is not?

01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:58.640
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Good question.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: I mean, I think
there's been a call for diversity

01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:06.310
across all platforms, formats,
genres, you know, age groups.

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.790
You know, I think -- I could
say I did a number of things

01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:11.780
and people might look surprised
that I -- you know what I mean?

01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:13.930
I think it just goes
along with the territory,

01:49:13.930 --> 01:49:16.500 position:56%
of being one of one or one of a few.

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:20.450
So I mean I would say that there's
a commitment to it across the board

01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:23.860
and people are looking for
diversity in all aspects.

01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:26.850
So I wouldn't let those people
discourage you, you know,

01:49:26.850 --> 01:49:31.360
and feel like you shouldn't be in
that space because that happens --

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.950
that could be, you know, any space.

01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:34.880
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Yeah, true.

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.180
I would agree.

01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:37.480
And I would also say that fantasy

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:41.360
and science fiction right now are
really experiencing of a rebirth

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:44.390
from what I can see at least from
the things that we're getting in

01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:47.860
and some the things that
are resonating with teens.

01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:52.160
Because I would even say,
you know, Victoria Aveyard is

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.240
in that fancy sci-fi world.

01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:57.900
And we have something called
aluminate on our list,

01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:00.840
which also kind of breaks the
barriers with sci-fi and fantasy.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:03.410
So, yes, we need those
diverse voice.

01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:05.710
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.660
&gt;&gt; Yes, I did come today
more as an author than --

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.270
or an aspiring author than
anything else, but as I listen

01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:21.860
to you all it is inspiring also
to hear what publishing can do.

01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:24.710
And I'm curious, as a --
as a mid-professional,

01:50:24.710 --> 01:50:26.680
or someone who's not
necessarily out of school

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.240
but maybe changing professions,
where does that fit in for --

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.960
is this -- if I look at
sort of agents and things

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.240
like that they seem to
be on the younger side,

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.540
those that enter the field.

01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:38.880
How, if you're a mid-professional,
can you --

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.250
or how is it to transition
into publishing?

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:44.720
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown:
Well, it's interesting.

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.940 position:56%
I mean, there are really -- I always
call publishing the last great

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:51.290
apprenticeship because it
really is so much of kind

01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:54.170
of learning how it all
works from the inside.

01:50:54.170 --> 01:50:57.460
But I know a number of people who
started in publishing and then went

01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:02.680
into librarianship, and I feel like
librarianship is a wonderful way

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:09.050 position:56%
to learn about children's literature
and also sort of feed that part

01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:10.350
of yourself, if you will.

01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:13.490 position:56%
And, you know, Simmons was
mentioned by Jason and also by Kwame

01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:16.380
and they have a wonderful program.

01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:19.140
And it might be easier in
some ways to enter publishing

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:24.120
through that door than to actually
start with the starting salary,

01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:28.330
which we've all lived through
on the publishing side,

01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:30.570
or also in academic publishing.

01:51:30.570 --> 01:51:32.830
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: Yeah, I
can't speak to it personally just

01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:34.200
because I came right out
of school and I've been

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.700
at the same company
for the whole time.

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:39.090
But even -- there's a bunch
of publishers, big and small,

01:51:39.090 --> 01:51:41.070
but at the same time
it's such a small world.

01:51:41.070 --> 01:51:45.360
And I've seen people once they kind
of get in there and they, you know,

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.640 position:56%
might be an assistant marketer or
an assistant publicist or, you know,

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.900
they kind of move around
and see what opens up,

01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:54.440
because sometimes people tend to
stay in their jobs for a long time

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:57.480
in publishing and then
sometimes they move around a lot.

01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:02.620
So, you know, even if
sometimes if you see a position

01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:06.170
that might not necessarily be the
perfect one for you, you might want

01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:08.150
to think about just kind of
getting in with that company

01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:10.950
and then seeing the potential
for moving around a bit.

01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.360
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Mya?

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:23.360
&gt;&gt; Hi, so I've been in publishing

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.550
for seven months at
Penguin Random House.

01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:28.720
And I wanted to ask the question
of, I've noticed when it comes

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:31.710
to publishing diverse voices,
and it's only been seven months

01:52:31.710 --> 01:52:34.710
and I've already noticed this, that
the battle really only just begins

01:52:34.710 --> 01:52:36.600
when a manuscript is acquired.

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:40.420 position:56%
There -- the difference between a
book doing incredibly well and doing

01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:43.350
like so so comes down to
budget, comes down to marketing

01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:47.180
and publicity, which books get
the most support from those areas.

01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:49.630
It's not just editorial,
which is where I work.

01:52:49.630 --> 01:52:55.770
And I wanted to know if there's
any advice on how to help ensure

01:52:55.770 --> 01:52:59.240 position:56%
or champion diverse books with those
mark -- with the marketing teams,

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:02.290 position:56%
with the publicity team, with the
teams that put together the budgets,

01:53:02.290 --> 01:53:05.390
so that books with diverse
characters have a chance

01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:07.130
to really succeed?

01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:08.430
Because they don't
have that support,

01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:11.730
even if the book is fantastic, even
if it should be a Newberry winner.

01:53:11.730 --> 01:53:13.750
No one will see it
because mark -- there's --

01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:15.930
the teams aren't supporting
it as much.

01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:18.900
And, of course, there's
always a reliance on numbers.

01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:21.590
I oftentimes hear things like,
well, the numbers for this kind

01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:24.550
of book don't -- aren't very high.

01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:28.550
The numbers for books in fully like
Muslim universes aren't very high

01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:30.140
so we shouldn't give the budget.

01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.970
We shouldn't make the budget
too high for this book

01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:33.810
because we don't know
if it will sell.

01:53:33.810 --> 01:53:37.640 position:56%
There's a lot of ideas of publishing
diverse books being a risk

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:40.740
in the publishing industry,
which makes it harder

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:42.980
for diverse books to succeed.

01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:46.490
So as like an editorial assistant,
as someone who's trying to help,

01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:49.280
and as an aspiring writer
of color, I want to know how

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:53.530
to combat these things so I can
make it easier for writers of color

01:53:53.530 --> 01:53:56.360
with stories of people of color
to succeed in the industry?

01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.570
It's a long question, sorry.

01:53:58.570 --> 01:54:00.160
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Good question.

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:03.580
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: I do
think that's changing, Mya.

01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:07.550 position:56%
I think that the [inaudible] diverse
books movement has brought a lot

01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:09.630
of attention to this very thing.

01:54:09.630 --> 01:54:12.520
And I think what we're starting
to see in Publishers Weekly now

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:18.230
with the rights announcement is
that people are spending more

01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:21.100
on books by people of color.

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.390
I know in Knopf we
have two coming up.

01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:27.760
One is called I Am Not Your
Perfect Mexican American Daughter.

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.410
It's a first novel by a
published poet on the adult side.

01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:37.610
And another is The Stars Beneath
Our Feet by David Barclay Moore.

01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:43.840
And because of the investment we
made in acquiring those books,

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.110
the sales and marketing
budgets are expected

01:54:46.110 --> 01:54:48.810
to be commensurate with that.

01:54:48.810 --> 01:54:55.510 position:56%
So I think there is this push now to
really support those books in ways

01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:59.690
that maybe hadn't been true before.

01:54:59.690 --> 01:55:00.990
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: And for me,

01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:03.270
I try to talk about the books
[inaudible] agents I get

01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:04.730
in house, with my colleagues.

01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:06.790
You know, if I'm excited about
something I'm working on I'm like,

01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:08.460
hey, like this is in the folder.

01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:10.290
Because we have like a folder
that we upload our mainstreams.

01:55:10.290 --> 01:55:11.680
Hey, have you read that?

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.190
Like I really love it,
I'm excited about it.

01:55:14.190 --> 01:55:18.280
This woman [inaudible] so I, you
know, a lot of this industry is

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.480
about relationships, and
that can be true even just

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.410
within your own little
departments and in your house.

01:55:23.410 --> 01:55:26.010
I sometimes, you know, pull people
and say hey, like, you know,

01:55:26.010 --> 01:55:28.420
I'm really excited about this,
like, you know, I think --

01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:31.880
or if I hear something that's going
on in the world and on the Internet

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:34.310
or something, and I'm like, hey,
this book sounds like, you know,

01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:35.630 position:56%
we may be able to push it, you know,

01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:38.410
because this thing
is going on online.

01:55:38.410 --> 01:55:40.340
So, yes, and sometimes
it can be a --

01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:42.790
you know, a bit of a
struggle for the --

01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:46.130 position:56%
if you're at a company that everyone
allocates their marketing dollars

01:55:46.130 --> 01:55:49.530
in different ways, but sometimes
it -- you know, you just have to --

01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:53.500
it gets a little competitive so I
just try to talk about the books

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.370
that I'm -- that I'm excited
about and that I'm working

01:55:56.370 --> 01:56:00.220
on any chance I get because there's
no one else there that's going

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:01.970
to advocate as much
as I am for that book

01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:05.500
in house, like in my department.

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:06.800
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
So another way to look

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:15.580
at it is can you really afford
to wait for the marketing staff

01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:18.130
to figure out how to market you.

01:56:18.130 --> 01:56:21.220
And the answer is no, we cannot.

01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:24.260
And which is why what Jason
said, what Jenny said,

01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.540
what Cassandra said, is
so important in terms

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:29.580
of everyone learning the
business side of publishing,

01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:31.280
because you really have to --

01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.570
you really have to know
how to market yourself

01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:36.700
and how to promote yourself.

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:42.640
And so I just had a novel come
out on April 5 and I told one

01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:46.780
of my publicists, I said, look,
let's send out a press release

01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:52.540
to the Rickey Smiley Morning Show.

01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:54.040
And she was like, who's
Rickey Smiley [laughter]?

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.340
And I was like, yeah,
well that makes sense.

01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:02.770
And so if we sort of wait on
people to figure things out --

01:57:02.770 --> 01:57:04.890
we got to operate on two fronts.

01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:09.210
We have to sort of
simultaneously educate and we have

01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:10.550
to sort of do our own thing.

01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:12.140
Like that never stops.

01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:15.690 position:56%
As a writer you constantly have to
promote yourself and figure out ways

01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:18.320
to get your book into
the marketplace.

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.510
That's just my aside.

01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:22.420
The next question.

01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:24.720
Yes, right here in the middle.

01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:31.900
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Rene
Gervais [assumed spelling].

01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:35.440
And I've heard a lot of
rumors about the slush pile.

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.640
And I just want to know like
how much hope is in slush

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:43.180
if you're not agented and not
solicited, how much hope is there

01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:46.110
in just submitting your work?

01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:49.940
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: Well,

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:53.860
we do read the unsolicited,
unagented manuscripts.

01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:55.380
Well, everyone has
a different policy

01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:56.680
so I won't say that, you know.

01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:57.980
But every -- even every imprint

01:57:57.980 --> 01:57:59.290
within Scholastic has
a different policy.

01:57:59.290 --> 01:58:04.060
When I was an intern it was my job
to go through the pile and read.

01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:07.150
But some gems have come
out of the slush pile.

01:58:07.150 --> 01:58:09.690
I believe The Skin I'm
In by Sharon Draper came

01:58:09.690 --> 01:58:12.360 position:56%
out of the slush pile, and so did --

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.700
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown:
Is it Sharon Slate?

01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.150
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: I'm
sorry, Sharon Slate, yes.

01:58:17.150 --> 01:58:21.960
Sorry. And Shadow Shaper by
Daniel Jose Older also came

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.680
out of the slush pile.

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.570
So there is a hope, you know, I
can't give you an equation for it,

01:58:28.570 --> 01:58:32.300
but I think there is some.

01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:34.670
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: We also
read some of the slush.

01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:38.940
I will say, you know, when
I was an editorial assistant

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:42.830
at Harper we found If You Give
a Mouse a Cookie, but it was one

01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:46.050
of 12,000 unsolicited manuscripts.

01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:51.010
So if you can, try to get
to an SCBWI conference.

01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:52.380
You'll meet agents.

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:56.420
You'll meet other writers who
can give you their experiences

01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:57.750
in submitting manuscripts.

01:58:57.750 --> 01:59:02.360
I just think they are such a
font of information, and it --

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:06.660
even if you just do the one
on one critiques you'll meet

01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:09.510
with either an agent or an
editor and they'll often --

01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:10.810 position:56%
you know, if they see promise there,

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:13.440
they'll say send me your
revision or, you know,

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:15.770
send me the whole thing
when I'm back at my desk.

01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:19.610
So it's just such a great, again as
Kwame was saying, a way to network

01:59:19.610 --> 01:59:22.820
and make sure that your is read.

01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:25.420
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: And so
the website is scbwi.org.

01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:30.030
And it's an international
organization.

01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:32.750
They have two national
conferences, one in February

01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:36.100 position:56%
in New York and one in August in LA.

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:39.860
So the August one is apparently
obviously coming up soon

01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:42.330 position:56%
and you can still register for that.

01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:45.220
But there's a local chapter.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:48.190
There's a -- I know there's
a Norther Virginia chapter.

01:59:48.190 --> 01:59:50.360
[ Inaudible ]

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.440
Mid-Atlantic, that's what
it's called, Mid-Atlantic,

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.470
and their conference is
in October at [inaudible]

01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:56.680
at Holiday Inn in [inaudible].

01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:02.040 position:56%
And that's a great place for you all
to start, to start at the regional

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:04.040
and then go to the national level.

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:09.010
There's a Children's Book Guild in
Washington, D.C. The Washington --

02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:11.330 position:56%
the D.C. Children's -- or the
Children's Book Guild of Washington,

02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:14.980
D.C., and that's a great place
because they have monthly sessions

02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:18.850
where they bring in
speakers like Jason Reynolds

02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:20.870
and [inaudible] writers
and publishers

02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:23.270
who are already doing --
who are doing this work.

02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:27.370
And you get to interact and
network with other writers as well.

02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:29.230
Last question.

02:00:29.230 --> 02:00:32.310
Yes.

02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:35.900
&gt;&gt; Hi, I write YA novels
and verse and I just wanted

02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:38.420
to get any comments --
or hear any comments

02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:41.350
on the future of that genre.

02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:43.090
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Well,
thanks to people Jackie

02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:46.260
and Kwame I think it's
in very good shape.

02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:47.770
Keep going.

02:00:47.770 --> 02:00:49.070
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Actually,

02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:53.900
we have time for a few
more questions I'm told.

02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.490
How cool is that?

02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:57.510
Yes [inaudible].

02:00:57.510 --> 02:01:02.040
[ Inaudible ]

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.580
&gt;&gt; Here I am, okay, there I go.

02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:07.260
I'm a high school English
teacher and, of course,

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:10.920
on that level there really
isn't a place for mentorship.

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:16.620
So how could I go about, I guess,
acquiring a mentor such as,

02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:21.320
you know, a Kwame Alexander or,
you know -- you know, do I --

02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:24.110
on what level -- I don't
want to stalk anybody or --

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:29.780
but I always have business cards on
me so how do I maneuver that field?

02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:34.680
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: Kwame, how
do you [inaudible] [laughter]?

02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:36.980
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: What a
great question [laughter].

02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:43.360
So here's the short answer to that.

02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:48.390
I remember Nikki Giovanni telling
me about a similar situation

02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:50.150
where somebody was
looking for a mentor.

02:01:50.150 --> 02:01:53.040
She's was like, you
don't look for a mentor.

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.700
A mentor finds you.

02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:56.550
And how does a mentor find you?

02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:59.910
A mentor finds you by you
putting yourself in a situation.

02:01:59.910 --> 02:02:03.630
And so Nikki called Tony
Medina, she called me,

02:02:03.630 --> 02:02:06.360
she called a few other people,
and she said I'm doing a book

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:11.210
and it's 100 best African
American poems of all time.

02:02:11.210 --> 02:02:12.580
And I need some help.

02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:15.780
I need you all to go out
and find the younger poets.

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:17.660
Who do you suggest?

02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:18.960
There was no money.

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:21.070
There was no accolades.

02:02:21.070 --> 02:02:23.020
There was no name on the cover.

02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:26.020
She was like, I want you to do
the work and we were like, yeah,

02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:29.980
all right, and we all did the work
and we all found poets that we knew

02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:33.570
and loved and could recommend.

02:02:33.570 --> 02:02:39.070
You do that enough, by default
someone becomes your mentor

02:02:39.070 --> 02:02:40.370
because you're putting in the work.

02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:42.600
Mentor is really about
you doing the work.

02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:46.190
It's not necessarily about
someone doing the work for you.

02:02:46.190 --> 02:02:47.850
It's about you doing
the work and through

02:02:47.850 --> 02:02:53.070 position:56%
that relationship they're
providing you guidance and direction

02:02:53.070 --> 02:02:56.020
and support and encouragement.

02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:00.300
So, you know, I got a
couple projects if you want

02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:03.450
to help me on [laughter].

02:03:03.450 --> 02:03:05.680
But that's my answer to it.

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:09.240
I don't know, do you have
anything to offer, Jenny,

02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:11.080
about that -- about mentorship?

02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:13.470
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: I you're right
about the mentor finding you.

02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:17.620
You know, it's putting yourself in
those places where you're exposed

02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:19.920
to the people who can really
impart something to you.

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:25.630
I mean, I mentioned Bill, and Bill
was such a mentor to so many people

02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:30.420 position:56%
that they -- when he passed away and
left some money to the Association

02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:35.010 position:56%
of Library Services to Children they
established an evaluation program

02:03:35.010 --> 02:03:38.070
for young librarians, or
not even young librarians,

02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:41.680
but people who were just
starting in their library careers,

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.100
to teach them how to evaluate.

02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:46.370
And they had people like Deb
Taylor, who's been the head

02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:52.510 position:56%
of the [inaudible] Committee and
teaching how to evaluate nonfiction.

02:03:52.510 --> 02:03:54.670
And just recently I will say

02:03:54.670 --> 02:03:57.770
that the CSK Committee
approached [inaudible]

02:03:57.770 --> 02:04:00.840
about sending two librarians

02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:04.710
into the Bill Moore
seminar, sponsoring them.

02:04:04.710 --> 02:04:09.480 position:56%
And I think those, you know, people
who mentor also begat other mentors.

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:15.510 position:56%
So I think there's an opportunity by
going to some of the author events

02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:22.580
at CBWI, meeting those agents
and editors and designers

02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:26.800
who you feel can really teach you
something and just staying in touch

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:29.040
and letting that develop.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.560
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: And I will
say that I have a couple of mentors

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:34.370 position:56%
that don't even know that they're
my mentors, because I am just trying

02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:37.950
to absorb everything that I can
from them when I see them speak

02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:40.250
or in conversation, or
even on social media

02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:44.520
if you follow the people who you
really admire and look up to.

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.020
Just trying to absorb and
learn from just every --

02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:49.750
you know, when you see
people speak, just every bit

02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:51.810
of kernel of wisdom that you can.

02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:55.290
And, I mean, I think that's
a great way to learn, too.

02:04:55.290 --> 02:04:58.660
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: I have a friend
who, she's a brilliant writer,

02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:01.760
when she was starting out and I
would call and I would say, look,

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:05.570
I'm going doing an anthology,
I need a 20 page story.

02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:07.880
Can you send it to
me in three weeks?

02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:09.180
And she did it.

02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:10.900
I never did the anthology.

02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:13.990
A year later, let's write a
collaborative novel together.

02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:16.320
You write the first 100
pages, I'll do the next.

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.570
She wrote 100 pages, I
gave her notes on it.

02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:21.560
I never wrote my 100 pages.

02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:24.330
Then I did a writer's retreat and
invited her and said we're going

02:05:24.330 --> 02:05:26.180
to do -- we're going to
work on a project together

02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:28.710
and had a great time at
the writer's retreat.

02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:30.860
And the project never happened.

02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:33.900
We had sort of interaction
and working on stuff,

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:35.530
but it never came to fruition.

02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:40.550
She just got a two book
deal with HarperCollins.

02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:45.690
And it's because over the
course of four years that she

02:05:45.690 --> 02:05:48.660
and I had established this sort
of connection and interaction,

02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:50.950
and so she was the benefit
of whatever [inaudible]

02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:55.860
of knowledge I had and access,
and she put in the work.

02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:01.500
But if she had turned down
-- if she had not said yes,

02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:04.360
if she had not walked through
that door that first time,

02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.850
maybe it wouldn't have
happened in that manner.

02:06:06.850 --> 02:06:10.250
And so I think you just -- if you
want to find a mentor you got to --

02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:11.550
you got to walk through doors.

02:06:11.550 --> 02:06:14.710
You got to put yourself
in that space.

02:06:14.710 --> 02:06:16.010
Right, Jenny?

02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:17.310
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Right, Kwame.

02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:18.610
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Yeah.

02:06:18.610 --> 02:06:19.910
Yes, right here.

02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:21.280
She's had her hand up so long.

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:25.130
&gt;&gt; My name is Faye
Montgomery [assumed spelling]

02:06:25.130 --> 02:06:29.580 position:56%
and I'm an aspiring graphic novelist
as well as an intern at MacMillan

02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:32.440
and North Hampton Press
for the summer.

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:35.060
So my question for you ladies is,

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:39.340
how is the graphic novel
publishing sector different

02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:44.040
from publishing a work of
prose or a picture book?

02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:45.440
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: Do
you mean editorially or?

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:50.000
&gt;&gt; Everything, because it
seems that it's relatively new.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.110
I mean, comics have been around
for much longer and I'm wondering

02:06:54.110 --> 02:06:56.570
about the editorial
side, the publicity side,

02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:59.580
anything you have to share.

02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:04.470
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: Well, comics
are -- it's kind of its own thing,

02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:09.920
but at the same time at Scholastic
we publish comics as trade books.

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:14.180
So we do publicize and market
them as children's trade books,

02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:15.840
much in the same way that, we know,

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:19.020
we send them out to the
same reviewers and we --

02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:24.110 position:56%
you know, but there are -- you
know, they have a lot of comic shows

02:07:24.110 --> 02:07:27.830
that we can physically target,
like the Comic Con, San Diego,

02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:29.150
New York are the major ones.

02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:30.850
There's some smaller shows

02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:35.490
like Emerald City Comic
Con [inaudible] festivals

02:07:35.490 --> 02:07:37.770
that get a lot of pick up.

02:07:37.770 --> 02:07:41.420 position:56%
So I think the cool thing about
doing comics at a major publisher is

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:45.500
that you kind of get the best of
both worlds in that it's a comic

02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:48.550
and it's a graphic novel,
but it's also being marketed

02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:53.340
in the larger scheme of the list.

02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.640
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: Well,
and I would say, you know,

02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:57.030
some of us are still learning
how to do it, you know,

02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:59.840
without putting Penguin Random
House on the spot, but you know,

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.800
we've had some nice
hits like Roller Girl.

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:06.270
And, you know, I just acquired one.

02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:08.080
That was the first thing I
acquired when I got there

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:12.000
and it's called Rickety
Stitch and it's a trilogy

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.290
and it's two guys who've been
friends since second grade

02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:17.290
and they have a whole
comics following online.

02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:19.730
But can we translate
that to the marketplace?

02:08:19.730 --> 02:08:21.730
That's going to be
a question for us.

02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:23.630
But where you are,
actually at MacMillan,

02:08:23.630 --> 02:08:26.750
for a second you have a
font of information there

02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:29.100
with Mark Siegel and his team.

02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.870
So I think we're all
still trying to figure it

02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:34.530
out because the kids have
gotten there faster than we did,

02:08:34.530 --> 02:08:37.300
and librarians and booksellers are
on board, and now we have to figure

02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:39.950
out how to get that to them.

02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:42.020
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: And
I will say that part of --

02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:44.300
to have the equivalent of
self-publishing or, you know,

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:46.270
using the Internet
to further your craft

02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:51.590 position:56%
as web comics have been huge for,
you know, kind of getting out there,

02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:54.120
putting your work online,
having work to show.

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:57.390
Because I'm always -- I'm on
Tumblr, I'm on web comic sites,

02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:59.380
I'm always looking at Instagram.

02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:03.190
You know, I sign up people
from a variety of ways.

02:09:03.190 --> 02:09:09.890
So I would encourage you
to think about that, too.

02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:14.990
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] from -- how was --
do you just edit the manuscript

02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:18.500
or you also look at
like the panels and?

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:19.800
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: Yes, so most

02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:23.010
of the graphic novels I've edited
it's the same person doing both

02:09:23.010 --> 02:09:24.310
writing and illustrating.

02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:26.640
I only have a couple projects
where it's more than one person.

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.370
So you are definitely looking
at it as a whole, the words

02:09:29.370 --> 02:09:32.010
and the artwork, they
tell the story together.

02:09:32.010 --> 02:09:35.550 position:56%
So I've kind of -- it's almost like
I had to learn to be an art director

02:09:35.550 --> 02:09:40.570
in a way as well as an
editor, because it doesn't --

02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:44.290
it doesn't work without, you
know, looking at both as a whole.

02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:49.030
But, you know, my editorial
letters are, you know,

02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:51.050
similar to my [inaudible]
about characters

02:09:51.050 --> 02:09:53.500
and plot and theme and pacing.

02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:58.060
You know, so, you know,
it's different

02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:00.610 position:56%
in some ways and the same in others.

02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:02.190
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: I think
the biggest difference

02:10:02.190 --> 02:10:06.340
that I've noticed is
that it's important

02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:08.940
to take those emotional
moments in a graphic novel,

02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:10.240
too, and give that space.

02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:12.610
You know, I think one of
the things that I've seen is

02:10:12.610 --> 02:10:15.520
that sometimes there's a tendency

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.740
to have the pacing be
the same throughout,

02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:20.190
and just giving those moments

02:10:20.190 --> 02:10:24.030
where you really give
say a four panel stretch

02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:27.980
for an emotional moment or
connection between two characters,

02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:31.690
just thinking through where do
you want that emphasis to be.

02:10:33.630 --> 02:10:37.460
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Over here.

02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:41.310
&gt;&gt; My question has a little
bit to do with being --

02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:45.610 position:56%
not being author illustrator as
well and how to insert the diversity

02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:47.990 position:56%
or the multicultural aspect to that.

02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:51.030
If you write a universal story and
you don't want to have, you know,

02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:55.900
animals as your characters, can you
put in as an art note or something,

02:10:55.900 --> 02:10:57.980
or you in your query,
like I would like this

02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:00.310 position:56%
to not default to a white character.

02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:01.720
You know, I want this --

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:03.020
if you don't pick names

02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:05.400
like Gracelyn [assumed
spelling], you know, Ting and Ling.

02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:09.300
I mean, how else do you indicate
that this is a universal story,

02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:14.290
but I want my characters to
reflect multicultural America?

02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:18.460
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: I think
you would say just that.

02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:20.750
You know, I think -- I think
you would just say that.

02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:22.550
I don't think there's anything
wrong with saying that.

02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:25.120
[ Inaudible ]

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.620 position:56%
Yeah, or in the -- in the manuscript
if you put it in parenthesis.

02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:30.460
If you're writing a picture
book or a graphic novel

02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:34.410
and to just make it clear what
your vision is for you characters.

02:11:34.410 --> 02:11:37.700
I think that's completely
reasonable and helpful.

02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:40.210
You know, because you don't want
to get down the line and, you know,

02:11:40.210 --> 02:11:43.700
have -- there's been
a misunderstanding --

02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:45.380
you know, a misunderstanding
or a miscommunication

02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.970
or the editor has a
different vision than you,

02:11:47.970 --> 02:11:50.280
or thought that you had a
vision that you didn't have.

02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:55.190
So I think just being as clear
and upfront as you can be is --

02:11:55.190 --> 02:11:56.530
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: And
so I'll add to that.

02:11:56.530 --> 02:11:58.210
That sounds good [laughter].

02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:01.930
But it doesn't always
work like that,

02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:04.810
and you're not always
necessarily thinking like that.

02:12:04.810 --> 02:12:08.890
So I wrote a book about a
rooster that stars in a jazz band

02:12:08.890 --> 02:12:12.950 position:56%
with Duck Ellington and Mules Davis.

02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:21.530 position:56%
So it's animals and so I didn't put
in my query letter or in my contract

02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:24.610
that the animals had to be black.

02:12:24.610 --> 02:12:25.910
I wasn't thinking like that.

02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:29.910
But when I got illustrations back
the illustrator had inserted a

02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:35.370
farmer in the book and the
farmer defaulted to white,

02:12:35.370 --> 02:12:38.270 position:56%
which is a whole other thing because
when you think about the history

02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:40.530
of jazz musicians and
their relationship

02:12:40.530 --> 02:12:43.220
with their white managers and
agents, that's a whole other thing.

02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:47.290
I'm getting to deep for you all.

02:12:47.290 --> 02:12:51.460
So I said to the publisher,
nah, not so much.

02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:53.980
And he said, no, we like it.

02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:57.930
And I said, nah, not so much,
we're not going to do that.

02:12:57.930 --> 02:13:00.080
Let's take the farmer out.

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:02.910
And so it's just, I mean,
you just got to say it.

02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:04.730
You just got to say it.

02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:06.410
And you got to stick
-- you got to be --

02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:12.960 position:56%
you got to be persistent and you
got to stick to your guns, you know,

02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.050
if it's not in the contract
or the query letter.

02:13:16.050 --> 02:13:19.970
Last question.

02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:25.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:26.870
My name is [inaudible] and I'm a
high school English instructor,

02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:30.820
but I wanted to comment
on mentorship.

02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:36.620
And I think finding a mentor
there's a process of giving.

02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:39.950
I have been promoting
authors for about 15 years

02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:42.700
and my first author was
a Random House author.

02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:47.320
And I called Random House and
told them there's this new book,

02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:51.430
I have the review copy, and I
want to get in touch this author.

02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:54.860
I would like to promote
her, but I don't --

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.590
I'm not asking for anything.

02:13:56.590 --> 02:14:00.660
I'm doing it for the
families in my community.

02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:05.610
Through that escalated more
authors, more connections.

02:14:05.610 --> 02:14:09.630
I have a group of authors
now that are not just people

02:14:09.630 --> 02:14:14.240
that I have helped,
but their friends.

02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:17.680
I never knew that I would
create that but these are people

02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:22.530
who would definitely
help me if I needed it.

02:14:22.530 --> 02:14:25.480
So I think -- I mean,
that's an isolated story,

02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:28.670
but I think that there
is a process of giving

02:14:28.670 --> 02:14:30.230
if you are seeking mentorship.

02:14:30.230 --> 02:14:34.490
So you have to give a little bit
of yourself in any way you can.

02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:36.850
My question really quickly is,

02:14:36.850 --> 02:14:43.380
what is trending amongst the
teen population as far as writing

02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:44.780
and what they're reading?

02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:49.720
Is it style of writing
or is it plot?

02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:53.770
I've asked my teens what
do you prefer, a good plot

02:14:53.770 --> 02:14:56.310
or an excellent --
or a different style

02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:58.420
of writing that you can relate to?

02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:01.260
And a lot of them are
sort of 50 50 so I'd

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:03.470
like to get comments
to see what you think.

02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:09.510
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Pelham: I wouldn't say
that it's one or the other either.

02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:13.650
I mean, I think if [inaudible]
you know, I think it just depends

02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:15.530
on the preference of the reader.

02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:19.360
I think I tend to gravitate
toward character driven stories.

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:22.650
I love a really well-developed
character

02:15:22.650 --> 02:15:26.880
that I emotionally connect to,
and then get into their world

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:29.350
and into their plate and
what's going on with them.

02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:34.010
Some people just like that fast,
you know, plot driven, you know,

02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:35.500
what's happening, how
you getting there?

02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:37.000
Okay, it happened, oh my gosh.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.390 position:56%
You know, so I think it just depends
on the preference of the reader.

02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:44.990
I wouldn't -- I haven't heard of a
trend regarding that sort of thing

02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:46.290
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Brown: I would agree.

02:15:46.290 --> 02:15:48.650
I think, you know, if I think
about myself as a reader

02:15:48.650 --> 02:15:52.030
and the kids I've taught,
they read really widely.

02:15:52.030 --> 02:15:55.800
So they would read, you
know, The Babysitters Club

02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:00.650
and they would also read,
you know, Newberry winners.

02:16:00.650 --> 02:16:05.530
And so I think that's
also true of teens.

02:16:05.530 --> 02:16:06.830
With [inaudible] it's
been interesting

02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:10.270
because it is the sci-fi, very plot
driven, but there's also this kind

02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:14.520 position:56%
of moral question at its center so
you kind of get pulled into the plot

02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:17.610
but you end up doing some deeper
thinking around, you know,

02:16:17.610 --> 02:16:20.230
what is my responsibility
to my community

02:16:20.230 --> 02:16:24.230
and how do I make a
difference as an individual even

02:16:24.230 --> 02:16:26.380
if it means going against
everybody else.

02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:29.770
So I think that teens are
really keyed into those kinds

02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:32.470
of searching questions as they're
making sense of who they are

02:16:32.470 --> 02:16:34.040
as they're becoming adults.

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:38.270
And I think they can read a
wide range of things to try

02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:40.610
to answer those questions
for themselves.

02:16:45.050 --> 02:16:47.560

going to take a five minute break

02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:52.080

Nikki, they were asking about
how do you find a mentor.

You don't find a mentor,
a mentor finds you.

Well, speaking of mentors,
there's a --

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:35.220
there are a few mentors
of mine in the room,

I'd like to quickly bring

Jamie Fox had a good one.

02:19:28.050 --> 02:19:31.260
And now Anya has old me
I've got three minutes.

02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:32.560

02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:34.970
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Maybe
two and a half minutes max.

02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:36.690
What's your master class?

02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:41.530
Process before progress.

02:19:41.530 --> 02:19:45.570
I think in our industry, and as
writers in general, I think so many

02:19:45.570 --> 02:19:47.150
of us want what we want, right.

02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:48.780
Everybody thinks that
they have the [inaudible],

02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:53.850
but the American classic, but no
one is willing to go through all

02:19:53.850 --> 02:19:57.190 position:56%
of the things that it takes to
actually create something that is --

02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:59.420
so we had this discussion about
-- I've been here the whole time,

02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:01.350
about like what about
the slush pile.

02:20:01.350 --> 02:20:06.490
And what really nice editors
won't say is that a lot of stuff

02:20:06.490 --> 02:20:09.170
in the slush pile is
slush [laughter].

02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:13.720 position:56%
Right? Because they're very -- there
are very few people who are willing

02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:15.430
to really put in the work, right.

02:20:15.430 --> 02:20:19.290
Kwame tells you that his book was
rejected a whole bunch of times,

02:20:19.290 --> 02:20:23.030
but he didn't tell you how
many times he wrote the book.

02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:24.330
Right? So I think these
are the things,

02:20:24.330 --> 02:20:26.010
there's this process
before progress.

02:20:26.010 --> 02:20:29.610
The industry is slow,
period, first of all.

02:20:29.610 --> 02:20:33.440
The slowest of all the industries,
the arts media industries.

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:36.770
But what also has to happen is the
amount of time they take editing

02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:39.020
and critiquing and trying
to figure out your book,

02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:43.590
you have to take twice as long
writing it, figuring it out,

02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:47.450
nailing your voice, your style,
breaking rules, learning the rules,

02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:50.100
breaking them again, finding a
mentor, listening to your mentor,

02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:52.000 position:56%
not listening to your mentor, right.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.030
All of the things, right, and
I think that would be sort

02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:58.800
of my [inaudible] master
class, process first.

brave as you are.

&gt;&gt; HI, I'm Ellen Oh.

02:22:59.370 --> 02:23:01.370
&gt;&gt; My name is Dhonielle Clayton.

02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:04.040
&gt;&gt; And I started We Need Diverse
Books with a bunch of people

02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:07.910
who really care about
diversity in the industry

02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:12.130
because not enough kids get
to see themselves represented

02:23:12.130 --> 02:23:13.430
in the books that we read everyday.

02:23:13.430 --> 02:23:18.400
And not seeing yourself is like
being told that you don't exist.

02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:21.820
&gt;&gt; We Need Diverse Books
is so important and crucial

02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:25.970
because every kid deserves to
be the hero of their own story.

02:23:28.050 --> 02:23:34.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And when I was a kid I read a lot
of books that did not have anyone

02:23:34.650 --> 02:23:36.040
that looked anything like myself.

02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:40.400
&gt;&gt; As a child of mixed race I
did not see myself in books.

02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:46.590
&gt;&gt; And I didn't get to see any sort
of queer characters until I was 19

02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:48.050
or 20 years old, which is
far too late in the game.

02:23:48.050 --> 02:23:50.220
&gt;&gt; My first book with
a gay character,

02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:57.870 position:56%
there was a random gay kiss at one
point in the story and I was ashamed

02:23:57.870 --> 02:23:59.250
for reading the story because
I thought everyone would know

02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:00.550
that I was reading a gay book.

02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:04.120
&gt;&gt; As a teenager there
were not any books

02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:05.420
about young adults who were black.

02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:06.720
&gt;&gt; I would agree with that.

02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:08.040
I did not have that at all.

02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:11.130
So I am so happy that your
books exists and I want more.

02:24:11.130 --> 02:24:16.130
&gt;&gt; I looked everywhere for a
book with a Latina character

02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:17.430
and I couldn't find one anywhere.

02:24:17.430 --> 02:24:19.110
And it was all that
I wanted as a child.

02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:23.280
&gt;&gt; I didn't see any characters
that looked like me or my husband,

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:24.580
or what my daughter looks like.

02:24:24.580 --> 02:24:28.260
&gt;&gt; I didn't grow up with any trans
kids in middle grade literature.

02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:35.130
To see yourself, and to see people
like you, who are facing issues

02:24:35.130 --> 02:24:36.430
like you in books is life-changing.

02:24:36.430 --> 02:24:41.310
&gt;&gt; It's important for me to
write books where dealing

02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:46.190
with mental health issues
is normalized and seen

02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:47.550
as something that isn't shameful.

02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:51.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I write stories for every kid who
has ever had to show up at school

02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:55.980
with a doctor's note in their bag
dreading the moment that they have

02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:57.650
to pull it out and
pass it to a teacher.

02:24:57.650 --> 02:25:00.220
&gt;&gt; I am the mother
of biracial children.

02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:03.040
I write for everyone.

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:06.120
&gt;&gt; I write gay characters in my
books because I want the guys

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:08.510
who used to shove me into lockers,

02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:11.220
I want those guys to be able to
look at a queer character and root

02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:14.500
for him, and root for
her to win in the story.

02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:18.040
&gt;&gt; I want to make sure that
everyone is included in my stories.

02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:20.130
&gt;&gt; And I think what
novels do so well is

02:25:20.130 --> 02:25:23.740
that they give us the context
that makes us understand

02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:26.450
that people are people,
love is love,

02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:29.090
lives are lives, teens are teens.

02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:32.250
&gt;&gt; And I really just wanted to show
that any girl can be in every girl.

02:25:32.250 --> 02:25:35.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I am thinking of me as a child
and I'm thinking of all of you guys,

02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:37.820
and all the people
that you want to see.

02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:41.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; To all the young people out there
who are growing up in communities

02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:43.510

my books are to serve as
a symbol and a way for you

02:25:49.290 --> 02:25:51.040
to feel a little less
ashamed of where you're from.

02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:52.340

a lot of people tell you

that you're not enough,
or you're too much.

02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:59.320

Thanks, Kwame.

who we've decided cannot bread the

02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:16.580

rooms talking and planning

02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:19.890
and scheming and, you
know, all of the people

02:30:19.890 --> 02:30:21.210
from We Need Diverse Books.

02:30:21.210 --> 02:30:25.650
I feel like we're trying to
do this work every single day

02:30:25.650 --> 02:30:31.680
to get the room to look like this,
and to get the publishing houses

02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:33.840
to look like this,
and to get our body

02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:35.850
of literature to look like this.

02:30:35.850 --> 02:30:38.980
So I'm so grateful for
all of you all showing

02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:40.710
up and being in the room.

02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:43.500
I got a call this morning.

02:30:43.500 --> 02:30:47.200
I was thinking of this, you
know, life happens, right.

02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:52.020
You wake up and you're trying to
do your work and you're on deadline

02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:56.700
or you're not on deadline and
things just constantly happen.

02:30:56.700 --> 02:31:03.400
So I was on the train this morning
and I got an e-mail from a woman

02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:06.210
at Brigham Young University.

02:31:06.210 --> 02:31:09.680 position:56%
And she was saying -- she was saying
that she was putting together this

02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:13.690
and thought -- she was putting
together a book about literature

02:31:13.690 --> 02:31:18.660
and children's psychology, and
it went on and on, and she wanted

02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:23.640 position:56%
to know if I would contribute to it.

02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:28.140
And it came through my
publicist and she said,

02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:29.650
how should we respond,
do you want to do this?

02:31:29.650 --> 02:31:32.020
And I said, why don't
you just forward it me.

02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:34.090
So she forwarded it
to me and I said --

02:31:34.090 --> 02:31:35.820
I wrote Thorma [assumed spelling]
back and I said, you know,

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:38.530
I've published more than 30 books.

02:31:38.530 --> 02:31:41.340
I've won a ton of awards.

02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:45.510
I've been writing for
more than 25 years

02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:50.870
and I have never once been invited
to Brigham Young University.

02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:56.050
And I said, it could be because
I'm writing as someone who is out.

02:31:56.050 --> 02:32:00.460 position:56%
It could be that I'm writing as
someone who is out as a black woman.

02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:06.450
Or it could be that my literature
is just not respected by this --

02:32:06.450 --> 02:32:09.870 position:56%
by the children's literature
program at Brigham Young University,

02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:13.920
and I think a lot of you know
it's a Mormon University.

02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:18.490 position:56%
But whatever the reason is I feel
like historically I've been silenced

02:32:18.490 --> 02:32:21.350 position:56%
by your university and, as a result,

02:32:21.350 --> 02:32:23.300
I don't want to have
my name attached to it.

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:29.680
And I think one thing that
happens a lot for writers is

02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:32.990
that there are places,
especially for writers of color,

02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:38.090
for queer writers, where we
get silenced and we get banned

02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:44.760
and our literature gets rejected by
some reason because world that is

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:48.310
in that position of power for
deciding how that work is going

02:32:48.310 --> 02:32:53.570
to be represented are not in the
world does not understand the work

02:32:53.570 --> 02:32:55.970
that we're trying to
put into the world,

02:32:55.970 --> 02:32:59.020
or finds that it might be
destructive to the world.

02:32:59.020 --> 02:33:03.500
Or whatever the reason is,
it can be a dangerous place

02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:06.790
when you don't have
your people behind you,

02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:10.000
when you don't have people
in a room who are saying,

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.490
I get what you're saying,
it's important,

02:33:12.490 --> 02:33:14.880
it's valid, it needs to be here.

02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:18.640
The writer, Archer Lord,
said that we should wake

02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:21.470
up knowing we have work to
do and go to bed knowing

02:33:21.470 --> 02:33:22.960
that we've done our work.

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:28.030
And even though writers like us
have been writing for many years

02:33:28.030 --> 02:33:31.900
and writing many books,
there's still so many stories

02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:36.030
that go untold every day, and
there's such an importance

02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:38.380
for those stories to
be in the world.

02:33:38.380 --> 02:33:41.220
So I completely agree with Jason.

02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:43.620
I think that those
stories have to be written

02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:45.040
and rewritten and rewritten.

02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.390
I rewrote Brown Girl Dreaming 31
times before it's the book that's

02:33:49.390 --> 02:33:50.690
out there.

02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:52.490
It took me 3 1/2 years.

02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:55.530
[ Applause ]

02:33:55.530 --> 02:34:02.240
And it is so much about the
process and processing everything.

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:05.300
As writers we walk
through the room --

02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:08.670
we walk through the world and it
feels like our skin is pulled back

02:34:08.670 --> 02:34:11.600
and we're taking all the stuff
in, everything that happens

02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:14.610
to us every day, the way
people look at us, the way --

02:34:14.610 --> 02:34:18.270
the things people say, the e-mails
we get, the things our children say

02:34:18.270 --> 02:34:23.440
and don't say, and we take
it in and then we process it

02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:26.530
and we put it back out
into the world in some way

02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:29.660
that we can hopefully better
understand it ourselves.

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:31.980
I always say I write because
I have all these questions,

02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:33.940
not because I have answers.

02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:38.050
And the writing process
helps me figure it out.

02:34:38.050 --> 02:34:43.870
I remember reading Nikki
Giovanni's book Knoxville,

02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:47.840
which started out as a poem
and then became a picture book.

02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:52.400
And it was the story of being
in Knoxville in the summer

02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:57.220
and the food you ate, and it
was a very ordinary moment put

02:34:57.220 --> 02:35:00.460
on the page and made extraordinary.

02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:03.160
And that's what our lives
are, as people of color,

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.940
as women, as queer people.

02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:08.190
Our lives seem very ordinary to us.

02:35:08.190 --> 02:35:10.370
The fact that we are
still here and able

02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:13.900
to tell our stories
is extraordinary.

02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:19.100 position:56%
And that's why those stories need to
be on the page, for our daughters,

02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:21.930
for our sisters, for our
sons, for our ancestors

02:35:21.930 --> 02:35:25.050
who weren't even allowed
to read and write.

02:35:25.050 --> 02:35:26.940
We have a right to
tell those stories.

02:35:26.940 --> 02:35:31.110
And I think the -- as Audrey
[assumed spelling] said again,

02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:33.910
the machine is going to try to
grind us into the ground, right.

02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:37.270
Every day someone's going to
say your story is not valid,

02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:40.090
or they're going to say we
already published some story

02:35:40.090 --> 02:35:43.120
like that written by someone
who does not look like you,

02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:47.400 position:56%
or they're going to say it's not
good enough, or your family is going

02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:50.140
to say don't be putting our
business out into the world.

02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:54.300
But whatever it is there are going
to be these constant silencers.

02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:57.690
So I've known I wanted to be a
writer since I was seven years old.

02:35:57.690 --> 02:35:59.520
My family was part of
the great migration.

02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:04.120
My mom came from Greenville, South
Carolina to Brooklyn, New York

02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:07.870
and settled us in this section
of Brooklyn called Bushwick.

02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:12.310
And writing was not an option.

02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:14.570
My mom didn't have this idea
that I was going to bring --

02:36:14.570 --> 02:36:17.240
she was going to bring four
children to New York City

02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:19.620
so that one kid aspired
to be an artist.

02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:22.010
You know, you were supposed
to aspire to get a job

02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:24.610
and get the hell out of her house.

02:36:24.610 --> 02:36:27.560
And so when I was saying
that I wanted to be a writer,

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:28.860
I wanted to be a writer, my mother

02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:31.210
and grandmother didn't
understand that,

02:36:31.210 --> 02:36:32.680
but I knew that writing
was something

02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:35.680
that I wanted to do no matter what.

02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:38.710
And I think when you
look at the writers

02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:43.630
who do eventually become
household names it's

02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:46.310
because they're writing
no matter what.

02:36:46.310 --> 02:36:49.180
They're writing whether or
not someone publishes them.

02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:51.510
They're writing whether or
not they get the good reviews.

02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:54.370
They're writing whether or not
there are trolls on the Internet,

02:36:54.370 --> 02:36:57.020
you know, saying mean
things about their book.

02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:01.210
They're writing because they have
to write and because they have

02:37:01.210 --> 02:37:05.300
to put their stories out into
the world and they have to --

02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:07.120
this is their power in the world.

02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:14.220
And so I think we don't just write,
we kind of bleed that writing.

02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:17.750
And so when I first
started writing I took --

02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:19.440
I majored in English in college.

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:21.330
I took a whole bunch
of writing courses.

02:37:21.330 --> 02:37:23.170
I still take writing classes.

02:37:23.170 --> 02:37:26.970 position:56%
If there's a writer I love, I find
out where they're teaching and I sit

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:31.580 position:56%
in on their class just because
there's always something I can learn

02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:33.410
about the process of writing.

02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:38.050
When I was a kid I was really
afraid of poetry, so I --

02:37:38.050 --> 02:37:41.760
as an adult I had to kind of
work through that and really read

02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:47.710
and reread poetry and study poets
and find the poets who I understood

02:37:47.710 --> 02:37:50.780
and just crack that code of poetry

02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:54.070
because I didn't want
that fear to silence me.

02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:57.060
And I think so often it is
our fears that silence us

02:37:57.060 --> 02:37:58.360
and keep us from writing.

02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:05.260 position:56%
And I think it's asking ourselves
the question, what do we want to say

02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:07.580
and what do we want to
change and how do we want

02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:09.610
to change it through our words?

02:38:09.610 --> 02:38:13.770
And so with writing for children,
you know, it's that slippery slope.

02:38:13.770 --> 02:38:15.800
You can't be didactic.

02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:17.200
You -- I would say I write --

02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:19.600
I don't write to teach,
I write to learn.

02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:21.580
If I wanted to teach
I'd write textbooks.

02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:23.750
So I think sometimes people go
and think I'm going to write

02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:26.520
for young people because
I want to teach them this

02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:27.980
or I want to show them that.

02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:30.860
And kids read for the
same reason we read,

02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:32.690
they read to hear a great story.

02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:35.300
And through that great
story they learn empathy.

02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:38.540
They learn understanding,
and they learn how

02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:40.430
to -- they become empowered.

02:38:40.430 --> 02:38:42.730
But the first step of
that writing is getting

02:38:42.730 --> 02:38:44.940
that good story on the page.

02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:49.280
And then after taking -- I
took those writing classes

02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:52.080
and I finally found a publisher
at Bantam Doubleday Dell,

02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:55.340
which is now Random House,
and worked with Wendy Lamb,

02:38:55.340 --> 02:38:57.340
who was queen of the slush pile.

02:38:57.340 --> 02:39:00.420
She's the one who found
Christopher Paul Curtis and lots

02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:04.750
of other great writers and
then eventually came to work --

02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:10.440
came to write at Penguin where I've
been working with the same editor

02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:13.600
for 14 years now, which
is kind of crazy.

02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:18.980
But -- and who lets me write
basically what I want to write,

02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:23.830
but I write what I
care deeply about,

02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:25.940
and I care deeply about
young people.

02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:30.880
As WNDB talks about seeing images
of themselves in the world,

02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:34.820
because for me as a child
those images were absent.

02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:38.500
You had to look long and hard
to find reflections of yourself.

02:39:38.500 --> 02:39:41.720
Not only reflections of yourself,
but reflections of yourself

02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:44.660
that were written by
people who look like you.

02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:48.730
There were lots of books that
were written by white folks

02:39:48.730 --> 02:39:50.990
about black people, but
there -- I couldn't --

02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:53.600
I had a hard time finding
books where the --

02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:59.800
where I could trace the book to
an African American female author.

02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:01.630
So it was really important to me.

02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:03.920
And it was a journey.

02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:08.570
So I am going to read a short
section from my adult book,

02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:11.030
and I'm not leaving the
world of children's books

02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:13.780
for good, I'm coming back.

02:40:13.780 --> 02:40:20.570
But I was thinking in terms of what
our stories are and the importance

02:40:20.570 --> 02:40:23.090
of putting those stories
on the page.

02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:25.340
This book is a biography

02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:29.260
of the neighborhood I grew
up, which is Bushwick.

02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:33.500
So Bushwick -- so all the
Bushwick stuff is true,

02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:38.000
and then fictive element of
it are the four young women

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.600
who are walking through
this real place.

02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:47.640
And I think with writing you're
constantly breaking the rules.

02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:53.120
So I think it's so important to
read across genre, to read poetry

02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:56.290
and fiction, to read
children's books and adult books,

02:40:56.290 --> 02:40:58.820
because you create --
each time a writer sits

02:40:58.820 --> 02:41:03.120 position:56%
down to create a book you're telling
a new story and you're telling it

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.790
in a way that only you
can tell that story.

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:10.920
So, unfortunately, with publishers
sometimes they can be lazy

02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:13.540
so they want to see
how that book is going

02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:15.010
to have an impact on the world.

02:41:15.010 --> 02:41:18.720
So you can't say, well, remember
[inaudible] Between the World

02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:24.270
and Me, or remember Claude McKay's
Manchild in the Promised Land

02:41:24.270 --> 02:41:26.970
or Alice Walker's Color Purple.

02:41:26.970 --> 02:41:29.220
And then they go, oh yes, so
you're writing a vignette.

02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:31.210
Oh yes, so you're writing
about that experience.

02:41:31.210 --> 02:41:34.730
So you have to have some kind
of mirror, but you also have

02:41:34.730 --> 02:41:38.020
to have this original,
original story.

02:41:39.430 --> 02:41:41.730
So --

02:41:50.350 --> 02:41:55.350
Sorry. This is Kwame's copy of the
book that I promised to bring him,

02:41:55.350 --> 02:41:57.320
so I didn't want to dog ear it

02:41:57.320 --> 02:41:59.680
because then he would think
I was giving him some used

02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:00.980
stuff [laughter].

02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:02.800
[ Inaudible ]

02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:04.600
You have yours.

02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:08.770
Oh man, sorry, this is Jason's
copy of my book but [laughter].

02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:16.940
I imagine the women my father
brought home, taking a place

02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:18.880
until my mother returned.

02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:22.010
Each shh, my kids are sleeping.

02:42:22.010 --> 02:42:27.000 position:56%
Each, oh Lord, look at your
precious babies, brought her closer.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.860
I lay in bed and listened as
the clink of ice in glasses

02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:33.390
and the hush laughter gave
way to size and moans.

02:42:33.390 --> 02:42:36.590
I imagined waking up with a
new woman, her hair in curlers,

02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:40.410
holding her robe closed with one
hand, asking if I wanted pancakes

02:42:40.410 --> 02:42:45.050 position:56%
or cereal, scouring the cabinets for
the last of the Aunt Jemima syrup,

02:42:45.050 --> 02:42:49.190
sprinkling a bit of cinnamon
and sugar when there was none.

02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:53.610 position:56%
I imagined strong, sure hands
pulling my hair into tight cornrows,

02:42:53.610 --> 02:42:56.910 position:56%
telling my brother to take his thumb
out of his mouth, kissing my father

02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:59.750
on the lips as he headed
off to work.

02:42:59.750 --> 02:43:02.640
I imagined the four of us at the
kitchen table, the thick stink

02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:07.060
of boiling chitins gone, replaced
by hot sauce and white rice

02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:10.520
and the woman who came to stay
until my mother returned asking

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:12.990
if I wanted a little or a lot.

02:43:12.990 --> 02:43:15.830
Years later I would tell this to
Sister Sonja [assumed spelling],

02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:19.570
wanting her to know that I had
dreamed our family whole again,

02:43:19.570 --> 02:43:23.330
that I had believed
wholeness was on its way.

02:43:23.330 --> 02:43:27.170 position:56%
In a jar on the counter of Poncho
Store there were pickled pigs' feet,

02:43:27.170 --> 02:43:30.640
and he'd scoop up -- that he
would scoop out into brown paper.

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:32.170
When you said I want
to choose my own,

02:43:32.170 --> 02:43:34.470
Poncho said no choosing, I choose.

02:43:34.470 --> 02:43:37.260
His old man eyes moving
over your body,

02:43:37.260 --> 02:43:40.860
and if you were hungry
enough you let him.

02:43:40.860 --> 02:43:44.220
I imagined the four of us,
brother, father, new woman, me,

02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:47.810
sucking the last of the pickled
meat from the pig's foot bone,

02:43:47.810 --> 02:43:51.070
wrapping the cartilage and
bone back into the brown paper,

02:43:51.070 --> 02:43:53.610
washing it down with Dr. Pepper.

02:43:53.610 --> 02:43:57.000
Pork rinds were packaged
and sold for 15 cents

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.720
with hot sauce sprinkled
into a plastic bag.

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:01.510
You almost had a meal.

02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:06.250
My brother ate his without the
sauce, sometimes adding more salt.

02:44:06.250 --> 02:44:09.200 position:56%
On good days our father took us
around the corner and let us buy ham

02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:12.800
and cheese heroes, the boiled ham
cut into thin slices and layered

02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:16.070
over Italian bread already
spread thick with Mayo.

02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:19.520
Some days my brother preferred
the square cuts of spiced ham

02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:24.450
with its tiny speckles of
white fat, that was before.

02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:28.040
The woman who came didn't tiptoe
through our house in the night,

02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:31.950
didn't ask for just a taste
when my offered her whiskey,

02:44:31.950 --> 02:44:35.400
didn't sit with us eating
pig's feet and spiced ham.

02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:38.470
She came by way of the Nation
of Islam, her head wrapped,

02:44:38.470 --> 02:44:41.860
her dark dress draping
down below her ankles.

02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:44.650
She said my name is Sister
Loretta, her Bible --

02:44:44.650 --> 02:44:48.310
her body a temple covered and
far away from my father's.

02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:51.410
Her thin face free of
swine filled makeup

02:44:51.410 --> 02:44:54.720
with which unenlightened
women painted their faces.

02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:57.860
She said, I know how
amazing and lovely I am.

02:44:57.860 --> 02:45:01.090
When she looked down at us
and smiled her dark face broke

02:45:01.090 --> 02:45:05.540
into something open and
hungry and beautiful.

02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:07.900
She said your father is
ready to change his life.

02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:10.370
She said, the food you're
eating is the white devil's plan

02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:12.150
to kill our people.

02:45:12.150 --> 02:45:14.950
She came into our apartment
on a Sunday morning pulling

02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:19.670 position:56%
down dusty pots and pans from the
cabinet to wash in warm soapy water,

02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:21.320
humming slowly as she worked.

02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:24.450
My father at the table
reading from the Koran,

02:45:24.450 --> 02:45:28.710
a watery Brooklyn sunlight
falling over the pages.

02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:30.510
Her hands were large and moved

02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:33.060
as thought they had always
known our tiny kitchen,

02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:36.900
with its yellowing sink and
peeling linoleum counter.

02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:41.110 position:56%
I watched them, imagining they were
my mothers, and that they were again

02:45:41.110 --> 02:45:43.330
in Sweet Grove with our broken --

02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:45.430
and that we were again
in Sweet Grove

02:45:45.430 --> 02:45:48.200
with our broken stove
and dusty bookshelves.

02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:50.930
I sat in the kitchen
doorway, my knees pulled

02:45:50.930 --> 02:45:54.300
up to my chin, eyes
lifted toward her.

02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:56.580
Her breasts were heavy
beneath the dark dress,

02:45:56.580 --> 02:45:58.190
but she wasn't a heavy woman.

02:45:58.190 --> 02:46:02.050
Still, her body seemed to hold
promises of curves, of the soft

02:46:02.050 --> 02:46:05.720
and deep spaces I was just
beginning to understand.

02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:09.480
One day I'd have full
breast, hips, and large hands.

02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:15.150
One day my body would tell the
world stories beneath the fabric

02:46:15.150 --> 02:46:17.960
of my clothes.

02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:23.600
So one thing, when I was writing
Another Brooklyn I realized

02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:28.330
that so many of the
stories on the page --

02:46:28.330 --> 02:46:33.530
in the world are not always
representative of the kind

02:46:33.530 --> 02:46:36.060
of intricacies of our growing up.

02:46:36.060 --> 02:46:40.350
I always say, you know, especially
in families of color, you know,

02:46:40.350 --> 02:46:42.630
you throw a stone and you
hit the uncle in prison.

02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:45.110
You throw another stone and
you hit the poor relatives.

02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:48.110
Or they throw a stone and hit
you, their poor relatives.

02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:52.690
But there are all these nuances to
our community, all these stories

02:46:52.690 --> 02:46:56.870
that have not been told because
of this layer of shame to them.

02:46:56.870 --> 02:47:02.570
And I think that if we tell
those stories with the level

02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:06.320 position:56%
of deep respect that we have, I'm
thinking of When I Was the Greatest,

02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:09.160
Jason's book, and the first time
reading that and thinking, wow,

02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:10.570
he's nailing all of this.

02:47:10.570 --> 02:47:11.870
He's telling the truth.

02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:16.340
And for fiction that's the first
point that we need to bring

02:47:16.340 --> 02:47:19.440
to the page, is that
deep and important truth

02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:21.480
and then the rest follows.

02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:24.780
So I'm happy to be here
in the room with you all.

02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:26.930
And now Kwame is coming up
and I'm going to sit down

02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:29.060
and we're going to
talk junk [laughter].

02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:30.860

Jaqueline Woodson.

[ Applause ]

02:47:40.060 --> 02:47:51.680
Before we get into the Q and A I
just wanted to recognize a woman,

02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:58.350
activist, poet extraordinaire who
is here today and just have her,

02:47:58.350 --> 02:48:02.150
if she wouldn't mind,
answer that question

02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:04.840
of how do you find a mentor.

02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:07.780
You all -- and then the other
thing is, how cool would it be

02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:10.980
like for you all to get
a picture of like Nikki

02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:12.280
and Jackie on stage together.

02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:14.510
You all give it up
for Nikki Giovanni.

02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:27.410
[ Applause ]

02:48:27.410 --> 02:48:33.980
Nikki, can you just share, if you
wouldn't mind, with the writers

02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:38.440
and business people and
students who are here today,

02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.760
how do you answer the question,
how do you find a mentor?

02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:55.300
&gt;&gt; Nikki Giovanni: I was listening
to Jacqueline and I realized,

02:48:55.300 --> 02:49:00.220
you know, I'm no good
at things like this.

02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:06.440
I'm not. I'm here because the
magic word to me is Kwame.

02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:08.050
And they said you were
going to be here.

02:49:08.050 --> 02:49:13.590
And I've had some health problems
and Jenny is wonderful to me,

02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:16.200
and I love her so much, and
Jenny said she would drive me

02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:19.820
over because she knows when
we say Kwame we have to go.

02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:24.530
I'm hoping you do Aruba
or someplace like that.

02:49:24.530 --> 02:49:28.020
I think that, at least
for me you know,

02:49:28.020 --> 02:49:30.230
where I am is the only
thing that matters to me.

02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:32.440
I'm just not helpful to any of you.

02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:34.800
The only thing that matters
to me is where I am now.

02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:37.240
And what I know is that I am a part

02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:38.960
of a generation that
no longer exists.

02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:41.160
You and I were talking
about it recently.

02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:45.130
I'm a part of the generation of
segregation, and that's over,

02:49:45.130 --> 02:49:47.940
no matter what bullshit
you're going through,

02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:49.350
no matter who makes you unhappy,

02:49:49.350 --> 02:49:53.010
no matter what you don't
see, none of that, it's over.

02:49:53.010 --> 02:49:59.330
You are a part of the generation
finished with segregation.

02:49:59.330 --> 02:50:00.630
So you're going forward.

02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:03.800
When we look at, because I love
books so much, I really did,

02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:07.910
when we look at The Crossover, when
we look at Brown Girl Dreaming,

02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:10.230
you are part of another generation.

02:50:10.230 --> 02:50:15.040
And looking at what you have
to do, you can use the history,

02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:17.310
there's no question, because
there's a lot of history out there,

02:50:17.310 --> 02:50:18.650
but you don't know what we knew.

02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:21.290
You know something else.

02:50:21.290 --> 02:50:24.160
And I think it's so important
for the young writers to write

02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:29.800
about what they do know so we end
up, what I know best right now,

02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:32.750
I'm sitting here with two
writers that I totally admire,

02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:37.010 position:56%
when we look at The Crossover and
when we look at Brown Girl Dreaming,

02:50:37.010 --> 02:50:40.180
we're looking at some -- I
couldn't have written those.

02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:44.400
You couldn't write
Gemini, my [inaudible].

02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:48.660 position:56%
You couldn't write what I wrote
because I came up fighting a system.

02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:50.800
And you came up now
having to create something.

02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:52.100
Am I making sense?

02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:53.400

&gt;&gt; Nikki Giovanni: And I
think it's so important.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:59.120
You know what made me really angry,
that they actually had the nerve

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:04.310
to correct, as they put it, roots.

02:51:04.310 --> 02:51:07.880
I can't think of anything
dumber than somebody -- I can't.

02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:09.630 position:56%
It made me -- it just pissed me off.

02:51:09.630 --> 02:51:11.330
How in the world if you're going

02:51:11.330 --> 02:51:13.510
to redo something, redo
Gone With the Wind.

02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:20.490
That's the truth.

02:51:20.490 --> 02:51:22.870
And somebody says, oh you know,
we found out more information.

02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:24.170
You didn't find out anything.

02:51:24.170 --> 02:51:28.230
Alex wrote his story, leave
it alone, show it again.

02:51:28.230 --> 02:51:30.430
But Alex's story is what it was.

02:51:30.430 --> 02:51:33.390
And now all of a sudden it's
like we're going to show you, oh,

02:51:33.390 --> 02:51:36.240
Kunta went out and the reason
that he got captured was

02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.540
that he was looking for a girl.

02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:38.840
I mean, it's just crap.

02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:40.840
And he wanted to go over
to Timbuktu so that he --

02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:43.570
it just made me so
angry, you have no idea.

02:51:43.570 --> 02:51:48.420
And I'll never forget Scarlett
pulling up those carrots

02:51:48.420 --> 02:51:50.760
at the halftime, for those
of us who've seen it,

02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:53.270
at the halftime point and saying
I'll never be hungry again.

02:51:53.270 --> 02:51:57.390
And we know, we know our history,
we know that the reason Scarlett

02:51:57.390 --> 02:52:00.650
and her family were not hungry
at that point was that the slaves

02:52:00.650 --> 02:52:04.620
that they had mistreated took
the yams that they hidden,

02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:07.220
Sherman didn't recognize
yams, Sherman knew carrots,

02:52:07.220 --> 02:52:08.790
everybody knows carrot tail.

02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:11.160
You put carrots --
everybody knows carrots.

02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:12.460
Sherman knew carrots.

02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:13.760
He burned the carrots.

02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:16.270
He didn't know the yams
because they looked like rocks.

02:52:16.270 --> 02:52:20.790
And it was the rocks, it was the
yams, that they said, Ms. Scarlett,

02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:22.460
here's something for you to eat,

02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:24.340
which she would've
never done for them.

02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:30.000
We are a great people and that's
what -- that has to be shown.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.600

that you only dream about,
and people who have done it

under circumstances you
could never imagine.

And Jackie and I write, we
both wrote books in verse.

02:52:52.970 --> 02:52:56.500

for Jackie Woodson.

Over here.

02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:49.920

02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:54.890
&gt;&gt; Hello, oh sorry.

02:53:54.890 --> 02:53:56.720
My name is Alexis Smithers
[assumed spelling],

02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:00.610
and I'm a queer black
writer, and I wanted to know,

02:54:00.610 --> 02:54:02.460
I write from [inaudible].

02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:05.220
I had to write a story
I could survive in

02:54:05.220 --> 02:54:08.000
and I was wondering
how do you write --

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:12.200
how do you create in a way
that you forgive yourself

02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:15.670
so that you can still
live in this world

02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:19.480
and not stay stuck in
the story you write?

02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:22.770
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Forgive myself for what?

02:54:22.770 --> 02:54:25.030
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot -- as
you said, there's a lot of shame

02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:29.160
in like the family sector when you
write about that kind of stuff.

02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:32.230
And I was wondering if you have
to forgive yourself for the things

02:54:32.230 --> 02:54:35.270
that you promised you
would keep a secret?

02:54:35.270 --> 02:54:36.570
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: I
never made any promises.

02:54:36.570 --> 02:54:40.020
But I did -- you know,
it's interesting

02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:42.120
because when I was writing
Brown Girl Dreaming,

02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:46.450
because it's my story,
right, and I have --

02:54:46.450 --> 02:54:50.640
there are four kids in our family,
and each of us would probably tell

02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:56.150 position:56%
that story differently, because kids
have different experiences inside

02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:58.270
the same family.

02:54:58.270 --> 02:55:02.520
And so I -- and that's
why it's a memoir,

02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:04.480
right, because it's my memory.

02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:06.880
And one thing I was
respectful though,

02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:11.160
I did show my siblings the
parts that they showed up in

02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:13.020
and asked them if it was okay.

02:55:13.020 --> 02:55:15.380
You know, did they feel okay with
me putting this in the world,

02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:18.660
just because I want to keep --
they're my family, you know,

02:55:18.660 --> 02:55:22.110
and I want to keep
them as close as I can.

02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:24.470
So I did ask them was that okay.

02:55:24.470 --> 02:55:26.970
And the one thing that my
brother didn't want me to talk

02:55:26.970 --> 02:55:30.720 position:56%
about his dad, because he has a
different dad, and I respected that.

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:35.350
So I didn't -- and I didn't feel
any shame in not telling that story

02:55:35.350 --> 02:55:37.440
because my sense was
that's Roman's story

02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:39.530
for him to tell when he's ready.

02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:43.290
And it was [inaudible] who
said how can I tell my story

02:55:43.290 --> 02:55:44.980
when you're standing on my throat?

02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:49.930
And I think that happens
a lot that people try

02:55:49.930 --> 02:55:53.300
to tell other people's stories,
and that's when it gets dangerous,

02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:54.940
and I didn't want to
tell anyone else's.

02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:56.240
I wanted to tell mine.

02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:57.870
And that was my story.

02:55:57.870 --> 02:56:02.740
And I didn't want to -- I didn't
feel like with Roman's story

02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:06.050
that I was hiding anything because
it's like he's my brother, here's,

02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:08.290
you know, now he looks
different than we do,

02:56:08.290 --> 02:56:11.800
and it was what I understood
at that time about who he was.

02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:13.560
But I think it, you know,

02:56:13.560 --> 02:56:16.630
Audrey Lord said your
silence will not protect you.

02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:18.100
We can sit in our corner as new --

02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:20.930
as bottles and we will
still be no less afraid.

02:56:20.930 --> 02:56:24.080
And I really believe that
it's so important to not walk

02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:28.440
through this world fearful
of anything, because that --

02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:32.420
because that's the
world silencing you

02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:34.970
and it's important
not to be silenced.

02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:39.780
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Over here.

02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:41.310
&gt;&gt; How did your family --

02:56:41.310 --> 02:56:45.970
oh, how did your family respond
to that book in particular?

02:56:45.970 --> 02:56:49.420
But -- like are they
fans of your work?

02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:50.720
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: You
know they -- I think --

02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:52.720
I think it's complicated.

02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:56.000
My sister loves it because, of
course, she comes off sound --

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:57.690
you know, being [inaudible].

02:56:57.690 --> 02:57:01.410
I don't know if my
older brother read it.

02:57:01.410 --> 02:57:04.290
He is happy to have it on his shelf

02:57:04.290 --> 02:57:07.610
but I don't think the
bind is cracked.

02:57:07.610 --> 02:57:08.910
And Roman loves it.

02:57:08.910 --> 02:57:10.410
Roman is really proud of me.

02:57:10.410 --> 02:57:14.520
So, sadly, my mom died about
a year into the writing of it

02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:21.080 position:56%
so she never got to see it as it is.

02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:23.320
And my relatives in South Carolina,

02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:27.370
many of whom are still
witnesses, they like it.

02:57:27.370 --> 02:57:33.840
They actually helped me with a lot
of it, so I think they're happy.

02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:38.340
I think family is always
nervous when family writes a book

02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:40.350
because it's like,
do I dare crack this?

02:57:40.350 --> 02:57:42.880
What am I going to find inside?

02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:47.580
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Jackie, I
was telling everyone earlier

02:57:47.580 --> 02:57:50.680
that this symposium,
this master class,

02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:55.700
came together because I was
talking to my editor and I said,

02:57:55.700 --> 02:57:58.800
do you have any editors of color?

02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:00.100
You know, what's going on?

02:58:00.100 --> 02:58:01.400
Are you working on that?

02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:03.520
And she was like, nah, I
haven't been able to find any.

02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:04.950
There aren't any out there.

02:58:04.950 --> 02:58:08.260
And so part of that
to me is a cop out.

02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:12.760
And part of that is, well,
I need to make sure that --

02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:15.270
do my part to make sure
there are editors of color

02:58:15.270 --> 02:58:17.770
who are -- who are on the horizon.

02:58:17.770 --> 02:58:21.290
And so I texted you and I
said, let's do a symposium,

02:58:21.290 --> 02:58:24.210
a master class, at the
Library of Congress.

02:58:24.210 --> 02:58:28.620
And so I just wanted you to speak
to that, like addressing that issue

02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:30.990
when an editor says, well, there
aren't a whole lot of editors

02:58:30.990 --> 02:58:35.600
of color out there and what that
means and what's the responsibility

02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:38.850
of the people in the
audience and so forth?

02:58:38.850 --> 02:58:43.380
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: It's such a
good question in terms of I think

02:58:43.380 --> 02:58:48.880
that one thing We Need Diverse
Books is doing is they're having --

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:53.690
they're doing internships
in publishing

02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:57.920
and money is going toward
getting people a place to live

02:58:57.920 --> 02:59:01.670
in New York while they're doing
their internship because that's one

02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:04.360
of the hardest things is to be
able to afford New York City

02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:06.680
where so much of the
publishing is happening.

02:59:06.680 --> 02:59:10.250
I mean, we know all the
editors of color in publishing,

02:59:10.250 --> 02:59:13.420 position:56%
especially African American editors.

02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:14.720
We know both of them.

02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:17.820
I mean, there are a couple
[laughter] who are so,

02:59:17.820 --> 02:59:23.690
but I remember Jason and I
talking and he was saying

02:59:23.690 --> 02:59:26.330
that someone was asking, he didn't
have anyone locked and loaded

02:59:26.330 --> 02:59:31.560
to say, look here's someone
and that's the hard part,

02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:35.510
to be pushing for this
change and not knowing

02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:40.190
where to find the people
who could do the work.

02:59:40.190 --> 02:59:44.460
So I think that it's hard, and
I think it is so important.

02:59:44.460 --> 02:59:46.840
I think it's great to
want to be a writer.

02:59:46.840 --> 02:59:53.880
I think editors change the world
in that they get us into the world

02:59:53.880 --> 02:59:56.130
and they get these great
books into the world.

02:59:56.130 --> 02:59:58.330 position:56%
So I don't know, I mean, I'm excited

02:59:58.330 --> 03:00:00.040
for what We Need Diverse
Books is doing.

03:00:00.040 --> 03:00:03.720
I'm excited for anyone who
is thinking about going

03:00:03.720 --> 03:00:07.360
into the role of being an editor.

03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:08.660
Children's books is really fun.

03:00:08.660 --> 03:00:13.760
We all know each other and it's
a -- it's a great place to be so.

03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:15.910
And also, the publishing program

03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:19.800
at City College is a great place
that's trying to groom more people

03:00:19.800 --> 03:00:22.040
of color to go into publishing.

03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:29.200
On June 16, or is it the 19th,
Amistad is having its 30th

03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:32.090 position:56%
or its 50th, 30th anniversary party.

03:00:32.090 --> 03:00:37.230
And Amistad is that
black imprint at Harper.

03:00:37.230 --> 03:00:39.500
So I don't know, it's
a party that's open

03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:41.410 position:56%
to the public so people should come.

03:00:41.410 --> 03:00:44.730
It's at Mist in Harlem and there's
going to be a lot of networking.

03:00:44.730 --> 03:00:48.780
A lot of times when we get together
that kind of networking happens.

03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:53.120
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Amistad was
founded by a man by the name

03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:57.910
of Charles -- I want to say Harris,
but he was the publishing director

03:00:57.910 --> 03:01:00.200
at Howard University Press.

03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:05.370
And then he founded a black
publishing company called Amistad

03:01:05.370 --> 03:01:09.560
and it became an imprint of Harper.

03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:12.230
And that was 30 some years
ago when was doing --

03:01:12.230 --> 03:01:13.530
you know, 40 some years ago

03:01:13.530 --> 03:01:16.160
when he was doing what Jason
did with Lee and Low in '91.

03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:19.170
And so it starts out with
this vision, this dream,

03:01:19.170 --> 03:01:22.790
and it can really expand
if you stay with it.

03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:26.980
And so -- and I was
published by Amistad.

03:01:26.980 --> 03:01:31.140
You're published by Amistad
with Another Brooklyn, so yeah.

03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:32.680
Ellen, you have a question?

03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:34.480
Right here?

03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:41.510
[ Inaudible ]

03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:45.060
[ Applause ]

03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:46.860
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Where
are you going to be interning?

03:01:46.860 --> 03:01:51.170
[ Inaudible ]

03:01:51.170 --> 03:01:53.280
Oh, cool.

03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:55.140
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: We have a
question right here in the front.

03:01:55.140 --> 03:01:57.980
He's going to bring the mic to you.

03:01:57.980 --> 03:02:01.990
&gt;&gt; Nikki Giovanni:
I have a question.

03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:03.490
Because you said with
the [inaudible]

03:02:03.490 --> 03:02:06.250
and of course I've spoken --
I would speak for the devil,

03:02:06.250 --> 03:02:08.820
it doesn't matter because
what I have --

03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:12.390
what I have to say I have to say
and it's not going to change.

03:02:12.390 --> 03:02:16.210
I just wonder, why
you wouldn't let them

03:02:16.210 --> 03:02:21.400
or have them have your
work as a part of it?

03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:23.540
&gt;&gt; Jaqueline Woodson: Why I -- why
I wouldn't do it at that point?

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:29.690
Because I felt like it was
a dishonest representation

03:02:29.690 --> 03:02:36.680
of what they -- and it
wasn't, it was for a magazine

03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:37.980
that she was putting together.

03:02:37.980 --> 03:02:40.850
And I felt like if you're
representing the people

03:02:40.850 --> 03:02:42.590
in this magazine but
not representing them

03:02:42.590 --> 03:02:46.440
at your institution, that
just felt dishonest to me.

03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:47.800
&gt;&gt; Nikki Giovanni: Have
you spoken to them?

03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:49.340
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: This was
this morning, so I e-mail her.

03:02:49.340 --> 03:02:52.070
I haven't gotten her response yet.

03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:55.880
But it'll be a long dialogue, I can
keep e-mailing forever [laughter].

03:03:01.230 --> 03:03:04.190
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
He's bringing the mic.

03:03:04.190 --> 03:03:06.640
&gt;&gt; How do you feel
about hard stances?

03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:11.320
Because I think it's, you know, so
the Jacqueline Woodson of today,

03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:15.050
right, a person who has sort of
transcended the wall that a lot

03:03:15.050 --> 03:03:17.930
of people in this room are
trying to get to the wall, right.

03:03:17.930 --> 03:03:20.820
So how do you feel about these hard
stances that you're making in terms

03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:22.940
of what are the hard
lines that you're coming

03:03:22.940 --> 03:03:24.490
into because there are people
that are trying to come

03:03:24.490 --> 03:03:26.320 position:56%
into the industry that you -- right?

03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:29.580
Are there things that
you need to hold firm to?

03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:32.230 position:56%
Are there things that -- the
compromises that are coming your way

03:03:32.230 --> 03:03:34.030
that you need to navigate?

03:03:34.030 --> 03:03:37.700
I mean, what could you -- what
light could you shine on that?

03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:40.940
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Well,
I think all of us can --

03:03:40.940 --> 03:03:45.130
I mean, I think Kwame and
Nikki can speak to it, too,

03:03:45.130 --> 03:03:49.410
in terms of there are -- there
are deep personal beliefs you have

03:03:49.410 --> 03:03:51.750 position:56%
that you never cross the line about.

03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:55.830
I remember for two administrations

03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:58.110
in a row I was invited
to the White House.

03:03:58.110 --> 03:04:01.280
And I was like, no, I'm not
going because I don't believe

03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:04.280
in the work these people are doing.

03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:06.980
And my publisher kind of leaned

03:04:06.980 --> 03:04:08.590
on me a little bit and
said this is great.

03:04:08.590 --> 03:04:09.890
This is great publicity you need.

03:04:09.890 --> 03:04:11.640
And I'm like, no, I can't do that.

03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:13.350
And I've never regretted it.

03:04:13.350 --> 03:04:17.720
And I think that the stuff
that you feel deep, you know,

03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:20.770
at your core about
being the thing that --

03:04:20.770 --> 03:04:22.460
you know, for me, I
was like I'm not going

03:04:22.460 --> 03:04:25.460
to be the smiling black
person in that photo.

03:04:25.460 --> 03:04:31.900
And so that's stuff that you feel
deeply about is important to you

03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:34.820
and you can't sell
your soul on that.

03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:41.490
I think that something like
this 20 years ago, what --

03:04:41.490 --> 03:04:43.700
20 years ago it would've
been an issue

03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:46.990
because it wouldn't have been 20
years of not being invited there.

03:04:46.990 --> 03:04:52.040
So I think some of the earlier
journals and stuff if they asked me

03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:56.550
to contribute I did it without even
thinking about it because I wanted

03:04:56.550 --> 03:05:00.120
that kind of recognition.

03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:02.260
But I definitely do --
I mean, and this is --

03:05:02.260 --> 03:05:04.230
this is going to be
from the womb in terms

03:05:04.230 --> 03:05:07.470
of having these deep personal
beliefs and not wanting

03:05:07.470 --> 03:05:10.960
to over -- to compromise.

03:05:10.960 --> 03:05:14.710
What do you think?

03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:16.010
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: I agree.

03:05:16.010 --> 03:05:18.340
I mean, I think you have to decide
for yourself what are those lines,

03:05:18.340 --> 03:05:19.860
and that comes from
how are you raised?

03:05:19.860 --> 03:05:23.900
You know, what are
your ideas and ideals?

03:05:23.900 --> 03:05:29.460
What kind of artistic and writerly
integrity are you going to have?

03:05:29.460 --> 03:05:30.760
And you got to decide that.

03:05:30.760 --> 03:05:34.020
And the thing is, if
you just yourself,

03:05:34.020 --> 03:05:36.930
if you're just authentic you
can never sort of get caught,

03:05:36.930 --> 03:05:41.380
or get caught up because
you're always being yourself.

03:05:41.380 --> 03:05:45.280
Nikki likes to say, or in this -- I
quote this a lot in this interview

03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:47.690
with Claudia Tait [assumed
spelling] of black women writers,

03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:51.240
Nikki talked about
dancing naked on the floor.

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:56.790
And you do it and, if you like
it, cool, if you don't, go home,

03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:58.290
but I'm going to do what I do.

03:05:58.290 --> 03:06:01.590
I think you just got to
do that, whatever it is.

03:06:01.590 --> 03:06:05.440
And it may evolve because
we don't remain the same.

03:06:05.440 --> 03:06:10.160
We grow, but you do have to be
authentic, that's what I think.

03:06:10.160 --> 03:06:13.770
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Right
there in the striped suit.

03:06:13.770 --> 03:06:15.070
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Yes.

03:06:15.070 --> 03:06:19.790
We'll come to you next.

03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:21.090
Yeah.

03:06:21.090 --> 03:06:22.800
&gt;&gt; This question is for
both Kwame and Jacqueline.

03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:26.470 position:56%
A number of people in the room might
know this, but I don't know this,

03:06:26.470 --> 03:06:32.190 position:56%
how did you come into writing novels
in verse and who influenced you?

03:06:32.190 --> 03:06:35.710
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: So, ladies and
gentlemen, that was Ruth Foreman,

03:06:35.710 --> 03:06:41.310
who is an esteemed poet and was
the author of several books,

03:06:41.310 --> 03:06:43.990
including We Are the
Young Magicians,

03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:46.090
which won the Bonar Poetry prize.

03:06:46.090 --> 03:06:48.860
Sonya Sanchez [assumed spelling]
was the -- selected that book.

03:06:48.860 --> 03:06:51.180
She also wrote a book
called Renaissance.

03:06:51.180 --> 03:06:54.510
And so, yeah, so Ruth
Foreman you all.

03:06:54.510 --> 03:07:01.290
[ Applause ]

03:07:01.290 --> 03:07:02.590
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
The first book I wrote

03:07:02.590 --> 03:07:04.470
in verse was a book
called Locomotion.

03:07:04.470 --> 03:07:07.460
And it was a collection of poems
told from the point of view

03:07:07.460 --> 03:07:10.980
of an 11 year old boy
who was in foster care

03:07:10.980 --> 03:07:12.720
and separated from his sister.

03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:18.430
And he's in the fifth grade and
his teacher introduces poetry

03:07:18.430 --> 03:07:21.730
and different forms and he realizes

03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:26.790
that he can tell his
story through this form.

03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:30.320
So -- and that -- this
is where his genius lies.

03:07:30.320 --> 03:07:35.270
And so I didn't know that I was
going to write a book in verse,

03:07:35.270 --> 03:07:39.320
but as I wrote and rewrote I
realized that I would be breaking

03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:43.510 position:56%
that first rule of writing, which is
show don't tell, if I had this story

03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:47.900 position:56%
of this boy writing poetry and the
whole book wasn't representing that.

03:07:47.900 --> 03:07:52.820
And so that -- at that point
I was reading a ton of poetry

03:07:52.820 --> 03:07:56.220
and researching different form --
you know, studying different forms.

03:07:56.220 --> 03:07:58.700
So when I got the Brown
Girl Dreaming,

03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:02.930
again I knew I was writing a memoir
and I was writing down memory,

03:08:02.930 --> 03:08:06.190
and I know that memory came in
these small moments with all

03:08:06.190 --> 03:08:07.880
of this white space around it.

03:08:07.880 --> 03:08:10.590
So the form was decided that way.

03:08:10.590 --> 03:08:11.890
It made sense.

03:08:11.890 --> 03:08:14.000
And then as I went back --

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:18.190
as I started rewriting I realized
I wanted to begin to shape it

03:08:18.190 --> 03:08:23.640
so that the poetry
was more intentional.

03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:29.000
And then I added the haiku, so it's
interspersed with all these how

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:34.530
to listen haiku, and those were
to basically be this kind of pull

03:08:34.530 --> 03:08:36.770
out on how one becomes a writer.

03:08:36.770 --> 03:08:40.770
So the writing and the rewriting
helped decide what the eventual

03:08:40.770 --> 03:08:42.130
form was.

03:08:42.130 --> 03:08:45.450
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: I think
for me it -- and this is --

03:08:45.450 --> 03:08:47.820
we can sort of bring this
back full circle because we're

03:08:47.820 --> 03:08:53.470
about to close out, and this
is a black arts movement event,

03:08:53.470 --> 03:08:55.280
tribute, celebration.

03:08:55.280 --> 03:08:59.850
For me, when I look back at the
poets that I read and studied

03:08:59.850 --> 03:09:04.190
when I -- and got excited about
in college and beyond, it was --

03:09:04.190 --> 03:09:10.060
it was Haki Madhubudi's But
He Was Cool, but him was cool,

03:09:10.060 --> 03:09:12.030
him was refrigerator cool.

03:09:12.030 --> 03:09:13.330
And it was sort of taking these --

03:09:13.330 --> 03:09:17.590
and Nikki Giovanni's I Was Born in
the Congo, which is a real cool,

03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:19.740
hip way to say once upon a time.

03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:22.620
I mean, but it really --
you know, and so these poets

03:09:22.620 --> 03:09:26.620
from the black arts movement were
writing these stories in one poem.

03:09:26.620 --> 03:09:28.920
They were giving you
a beginning, a middle,

03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:31.660
and an end in 20 and
30 and 40 lines.

03:09:31.660 --> 03:09:34.470
And, of course, that came
from the Harlem renaissance,

03:09:34.470 --> 03:09:36.080
Lakes and Hughes.

03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:39.250
I woke up this morning
about half past three.

03:09:39.250 --> 03:09:41.690
All the ladies in town
were gathered around me.

03:09:41.690 --> 03:09:43.090
Sweet gals was a moaning.

03:09:43.090 --> 03:09:44.390
Sylvester is going to die.

03:09:44.390 --> 03:09:46.460
And a hundred pretty ladies
bowed their heads to cry.

03:09:46.460 --> 03:09:49.060
I woke up a little later,
about half passed four.

03:09:49.060 --> 03:09:51.600
The doctors and undertakers
both at my door.

03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:53.520 position:56%
Tell all my mourners to mourn in red

03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:55.970
because there ain't no
sense in me being dead.

03:09:55.970 --> 03:09:57.270
He's telling a story.

03:09:57.270 --> 03:09:58.570 position:56%
And so you're getting these stories.

03:09:58.570 --> 03:10:01.210
And so when I started writing
poetry I was telling stories

03:10:01.210 --> 03:10:02.510
in these poems.

03:10:02.510 --> 03:10:05.500
And so it was -- it took
me maybe about 15 years,

03:10:05.500 --> 03:10:07.320
but I feel like it was a
natural progression to get

03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:10.780
to the point where, okay,
well, I sort of figured out how

03:10:10.780 --> 03:10:13.750
to have fun telling
stories and poems,

03:10:13.750 --> 03:10:18.230
how can I now group these poems
together and tell a story novel

03:10:18.230 --> 03:10:20.060
in a full, complete novel.

03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:22.510
And the first book that I read
that sort of showed me that that

03:10:22.510 --> 03:10:24.180
that was possible was two books.

03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:26.610 position:56%
It was Sharon Creech's Love That Dog

03:10:26.610 --> 03:10:31.810
and it was Hope Anita Smith's
Keeping the Night Watch

03:10:31.810 --> 03:10:33.630
and The Way a Door Closes.

03:10:33.630 --> 03:10:38.520
And those are really
phenomenal novellas in verse.

03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:40.360
We have time for one more question.

03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:41.690
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
We have one right there.

03:10:41.690 --> 03:10:42.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Yes, right here.

03:10:42.990 --> 03:10:44.730
Yes, thank you.

03:10:44.730 --> 03:10:48.870
&gt;&gt; So I probably should have asked
this question a little earlier,

03:10:48.870 --> 03:10:52.750
but it came to mind when
you were standing up there.

03:10:52.750 --> 03:10:56.980 position:56%
When you go to a publishing company,
where does the money come from?

03:10:56.980 --> 03:11:00.500
Do you have to have your own money
to establish your own company?

03:11:00.500 --> 03:11:03.420
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: That's
a great, great question.

03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:09.460
So in terms of publishing
a book, so publishers --

03:11:09.460 --> 03:11:12.610
mainstream publishers pay you.

03:11:12.610 --> 03:11:16.310
They give you an advance
on signing, and that --

03:11:16.310 --> 03:11:19.660
and what an advance means
is that they'll publish --

03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:22.110
it's a money upfront
and then a whole --

03:11:22.110 --> 03:11:25.180
once those books sell
enough to cover

03:11:25.180 --> 03:11:27.520
that advance then you
start getting royalties.

03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:30.050
Usually 10% escalating to 12%.

03:11:30.050 --> 03:11:34.310
So there's this whole
financial system to it.

03:11:34.310 --> 03:11:35.840
Self-publishing is different.

03:11:35.840 --> 03:11:40.820
Self-publishing you pay to
publish your book and then --

03:11:40.820 --> 03:11:43.850 position:56%
and then all the money that comes --

03:11:43.850 --> 03:11:47.100
that you sell the books
for you earn, right.

03:11:47.100 --> 03:11:48.490
So then you cover -- you put --

03:11:48.490 --> 03:11:51.100
you put up your own advance
and then earn it back.

03:11:51.100 --> 03:11:55.460
And then once you've paid yourself
off from paying for that book all

03:11:55.460 --> 03:11:57.760
that money is money that's yours.

03:11:57.760 --> 03:12:00.190
So there -- some people
self-publish,

03:12:00.190 --> 03:12:03.790
some people go the mainstream
route, some people self-publish

03:12:03.790 --> 03:12:06.110
when the mainstream
doesn't buy their book.

03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:09.110
The thing about the mainstream
is you have a publicist,

03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:12.780
you have an editor, you have a
person who designs your cover.

03:12:12.780 --> 03:12:17.150
You have all of these
people in house that,

03:12:17.150 --> 03:12:18.450
you know, the publisher pays.

03:12:18.450 --> 03:12:21.600
Self-publishing you have to pay
for all that yourself and you have

03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:22.900
to sell the book yourself.

03:12:22.900 --> 03:12:25.440
You know, you have to get
it out there yourself.

03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:27.370
So, does that makes sense?

03:12:27.370 --> 03:12:28.860
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: All
right, let's end with this.

03:12:28.860 --> 03:12:32.120
Jackie, I'm going to
ask you five questions

03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:36.260
and you just give me the
first, you know, your answer.

03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:38.800
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Okay.

03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:42.120
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: When I say
John Steptoe what comes to mind?

03:12:42.120 --> 03:12:43.940
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Stevie.

03:12:43.940 --> 03:12:45.240
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Stevie.

03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:46.540
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Alexander:
My name is Robert

03:12:46.540 --> 03:12:48.120
but my mama don't call me
no Robertie [phonetic].

03:12:48.120 --> 03:12:49.420
I love that book.

03:12:49.420 --> 03:12:50.720
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: John Steptoe.

03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:52.020
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Does everyone know Stevie?

03:12:52.020 --> 03:12:54.060
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: You got
to know Stevie, John Steptoe.

03:12:54.060 --> 03:12:56.820
He got his book deal
when he was 18 or 19.

03:12:56.820 --> 03:12:58.120
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Was he?

03:12:58.120 --> 03:12:59.630
I didn't realize he was that young.

03:12:59.630 --> 03:13:00.930
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Eighteen, 19.

03:13:00.930 --> 03:13:02.230
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: [inaudible]
Steptoe is the first book I read

03:13:02.230 --> 03:13:06.940
that had people that looked like me
and talking like the people I knew.

03:13:06.940 --> 03:13:08.850
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: What
are you reading now?

03:13:08.850 --> 03:13:15.220
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Oh, right
now I am reading Gail Foreman's new

03:13:15.220 --> 03:13:19.860
book, and I am also reading --

03:13:19.860 --> 03:13:23.170
well, my son is reading
Jason Reynolds new book,

03:13:23.170 --> 03:13:30.320
and he won't peel it off and let me
finish reading it, and I am also --

03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:33.340
I can't remember what else.

03:13:33.340 --> 03:13:35.690
It's on my iPad, that's so bad.

03:13:35.690 --> 03:13:38.440
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Why is
children's literature important?

03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:39.970
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
Children's literature is important

03:13:39.970 --> 03:13:45.440
because children are going to
change the world, and they're open

03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:47.810
and they're honest
and they're hungry

03:13:47.810 --> 03:13:51.370
and we were all children once.

03:13:51.370 --> 03:13:53.300
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Do
you have a favorite word?

03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:57.090
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson: Do
I have a favorite word?

03:13:57.090 --> 03:14:01.600
That's a good -- I think ding-dang
is what I say most [laughter].

03:14:02.940 --> 03:14:07.830
That's two words, there's a hyphen.

03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:11.130
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Last
bit of advice you want to --

03:14:11.130 --> 03:14:17.030
or statement or quotation that
you want to offer to these --

03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:20.250
just start it with a
text between you and I.

03:14:20.250 --> 03:14:23.750
I mean, you -- we make -- we make
things happen when we want to.

03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:26.740
And so what do you want to leave
-- what's the last bit of --

03:14:26.740 --> 03:14:31.200
piece of information you
want to leave them with?

03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:32.500
&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
You have the power.

03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:34.690
So just know that.

03:14:34.690 --> 03:14:36.110
There's no excuse.

03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:38.300
You have the power.

03:14:38.300 --> 03:14:41.110
And you have the power
to change the world.

03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:43.450
It's every single day.

03:14:43.450 --> 03:14:46.510
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Ladies and
gentlemen, Jacqueline Woodson.

03:15:16.260 --> 03:15:18.440
and inspiration and information.

03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:19.930
It was invaluable.

03:15:19.930 --> 03:15:21.580 position:56%
Did you all feel like it was worthy?

03:15:21.580 --> 03:15:23.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

for doing the wonderful work.

03:15:47.840 --> 03:15:50.510
