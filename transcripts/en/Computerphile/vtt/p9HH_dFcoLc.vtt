00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
The difference between Bitcoin and cash, is that cash is fungible.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.140
At least if it's a coin - if it's a gold coin.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.980
It's really no different from any other gold coin

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.080
and so one is as good as another.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.580
That's not quite as true with notes

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.880
because notes have serial numbers

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.940
but let's ignore that for the time being.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.860
Now, there's other things that're fungible.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.580
like ears of corn, or in the old days, sheep.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.460
In Roman times,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.780
if twenty sheep wandered from Marcus's farm into Crasus's farm,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.900
then the corp could just simply tell Crasus to give Marcus twenty sheep back.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.000
And any twenty sheep, it didn't matter.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.840
But nowadays, of course

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.000
sheep have got electronic passports clipped into their ears.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.460
So if that were to happen between two Italian farmers nowadays,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.140
then Marcus could go and get exactly the right twenty sheep back from Crasus.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.400
So here's an example of how technology has made sheep

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.740
from a fungible asset into a tractable asset.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.940
Now Bitcoin's the same, because every Bitcoin carries with it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
pointers to its entire history.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.340
So you can see everybody's who's owned that Bitcoin or parts of it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.740
ever since these parts were originally mined.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.980
And so you can see where the parts of Bitcoin were stolen at one time or another

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.160
or probably went through money laundering schemes

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.100
or probably were used in the drugs trade

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580
or various other objectionable qualities

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.880
that might cause the authorities to want to call them in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.780
and have a close look at them.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.640
What about the money laundering thing, then?

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.540
How does that work?

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.200
At present, in England,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.060
you can't get a good title to stolen goods

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.160
um

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.460
But until 1995, you could

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.640
because there was a law called "The Law of Market Overt."

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.340
So if I stole your horse,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.720
and I went and sold it in Cambridge Market

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.040
between dawn and dusk

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.800
then somebody who bought it from me

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.980
in good faith would end up owning the horse

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.160
and all you could then do was to sue me

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.000
or get me hanged or sent to Virginia.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
Now this was abolished in 1995

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
because it was being abused

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.780
but the rule survives in the law of money and banking.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.060
Now, if you go to a Barclays Banking ATM,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.940
for example, and you get out a twenty pound note,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.440
then even if that twenty pound note was stolen last year in a bank robbery,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.800
that's not your problem.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.180
That's Barclays Bank's problem.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.920
because you got it from a regulated financial institution.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.740
And so your title to it is certain

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.800
Similarly, if you go to John Lewis's,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.580
and you buy a toaster for 30 quid,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.840
and you pay with a 50 and you get a 20 pound note in your change

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.160
Then you own that 20 pound note

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.340
because it's another rule that says

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.080
that if you get something, for value, in good faith,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.200
right?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.300
Then, so long as that something is money

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.440
you get good title to it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.200
So

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.200
the Bitcoin people have been lobbying

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.560
for at least five years

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.220
to have Bitcoin to be declared money.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.040
Because if Bitcoin becomes money

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.740
then they think that many of the problems around stolen Bitcoins

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.340
and Bitcoins that were used in the drugs trade and so on

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.840
would go away.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.400
So we've been looking into this

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.900
and it turns out that it isn't quite true.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.160
Now no government has yet admitted that Bitcoin is money

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.300
But even if a court were to find that Bitcoin is money,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.800
as courts, for example, found that carbon credits could be treated as money

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.260
for some purposes;

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.600
then it doesn't get the Bitcoin criminals off the hook.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.380
And the reason for this is

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.480
that to get good titles for something that was once stolen

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.980
you have to do it in good faith.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.820
Now, what's the meaning of "in good faith?"

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.040
Somebody might argue

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.280
that you can't a Bitcoin in good faith

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.540
because everybody knows that so much bad stuff goes on in Bitcoin.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.420
But even if you don't buy that argument

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.680
there's another problem

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.140
which is that many people in the Bitcoin world have set up

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.000
what they call "Bitcoin Mixers"

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.960
or even "Bitcoin Laundries,"

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.420
where the idea is you take along your stolen Bitcoin

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.460
or the Bitcoin you got from selling hashish on the sheep market, or whatever,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.600
you put this black Bitcoin into a pot

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.840
and nine other people come along and put in their white Bitcoins into the pot

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.860
and you shake the pot very, very hard

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.100
and you kind of hope that you get ten white Bitcoins out.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.100
Now the law is quite clear on this,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.960
that if there's money laundering

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.840
then you can't have good faith.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.780
And so if you put one black Bitcoin

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.380
and nine white Bitcoins into a pot

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.880
and you shake it

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.760
then if Bitcoins are held to be money

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.480
what you get out is ten black Bitcoins.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.520
Sorry, guys.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.320
Asking for Bitcoin to be money was the wrong thing to ask for.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.140
Because if Bitcoin had simply remained a commodity,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.560
you know, like pig iron bars, or whatever,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.720
then this magic wouldn't happen.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.820
The stolen pig iron bar would still be a stolen pig iron bar.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.380
You would put the one black Bitcoin and the nine white Bitcoins into a pot

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.360
and then you'd shake them

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.340
and some unlucky sod would get the black one out.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.940
In that case, of course,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.000
economics kicks in

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.520
because then nobody's got an incentive to take part in a money laundering scheme.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.460
Now, the interesting thing about this

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.440
is that if Bitcoin becomes money

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.740
or is treated as money for some purposes

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.800
then this is a really mortal threat,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.340
to those cryptocurrencies which provide built-in laundries,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.340
such as Monero and Zcash,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.340
Now in Zcash, for example,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.340
most of the time it works just like Bitcoin

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.840
and there's a fully traceable blockchain of who passed on a coin to whom.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.900
But you can, if you want,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.480
take your Zerocoin and you can put it back in the mine

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.460
and have it remined

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.240
and get one out that's nice and shiny and new,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.560
in the sense that it's indistiguishable from all the other coins mined in that round.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.180
Just the same as if you'd been re-casting a gold bar.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.860
You're taking a gold bar to a crooked foundry

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.040
or a bent goldsmith

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.740
and got it turned into something that was untraceable.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.840
But the affect of this

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.960
according to the law of money and banking,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.380
is actually to poison every single coin that  comes out of that mine.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.480
And this would lead regulators to ask themselves

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.800
whether or not they should simply instruct regulated Bitcoin exchanges

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.180
not under any circumstance to change cash

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.880
or other cryptocurrencies

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.800
into currencies such as Zcash or Monero

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.380
on the grounds that these were designed

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.860
for the purpose of money laundering.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.960
and therefore there was an issue of obstruction of justice.
