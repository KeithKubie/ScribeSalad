00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:01.333
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can figure out

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.363
what the limit of x squared
plus one over sine of x is

00:00:04.363 --> 00:00:07.358
as x approaches infinity.

00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:08.461
So, let's just think about what's going on

00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.040
in the numerator and then
think about what's going on

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.481
in the denominator.

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.220
So, the numerator, we
have x squared plus one.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.309
So, as x gets larger and larger and larger

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.788
as it approaches infinity,
well, we're just squaring

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:21.476
it here so this
numerator's gonna get even,

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:23.430
approach infinity even faster.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.851
So, this thing is going to go to infinity

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.767
as x approaches infinity.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.505
Now what's happening to
the denominator here?

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.631
Well, sine of x, we've seen this before.

00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:35.852
Sine of x and cosine of x are bounded,

00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:37.300
they oscillate.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.611
They oscillate between
negative one and one,

00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:43.055
so negative one is gonna
be less than or equal to

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:46.228
sine of x which is going to
be less than or equal to one.

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:49.212
So, this denominator's going to oscillate.

00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:50.617
So, what does that tell us?

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.540
Well, we might be tempted
to say, well the numerator's

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.063
unbound and goes to infinity
and the denominator's

00:00:55.063 --> 00:00:57.740
just oscillating between
these values here.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.928
So maybe the whole thing goes to infinity.

00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:02.865
But we have to be careful because one,

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:04.793
the denominator's going between positive

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:06.627
and negative values.

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:08.583
So, the numerator's just going to get more

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:10.040
and more and more positive

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.956
being divided sometimes
by a positive value,

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:13.452
sometimes by a negative value.

00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:15.799
So, we're gonna jump between
positive and negative.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.157
Positive and negative.

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:21.324
And then you also have all
these crazy asymptotes here.

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:24.669
Every time sine of x becomes zero,

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:27.653
well then, you're gonna
have a vertical asymptote.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.278
This thing will not be defined.

00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:30.474
So you have all these vertical asymptotes.

00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:32.643
You're gonna oscillate
between positive and negative

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:35.037
just larger and larger values.

00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:37.254
So, this limit does not exist.

00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:38.833
So, it does not exist.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.083
Does not exist.

00:01:43.013 --> 00:01:44.551
And we can see that graphically.

00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:45.880
We described it in words,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.877
just inspecting this expression,

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:49.805
but we can see it
graphically if we actually

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:51.163
looked at a graph of this,

00:01:51.163 --> 00:01:52.835
which I have right here.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:56.967
And you can see that as x goes
towards positive infinity,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.139
as x goes to positive infinity,

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:02.169
we, depending on which x we
are, we're kind of going,

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:05.165
we go, we get really large, then we had a

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:06.778
vertical asymptote than
we jump back down and

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:08.450
go really negative, vertical asymptote,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.029
up, down, up, down, up, down,

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.630
the oscillations just
get more and more extreme

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.277
and we keep having these
vertical asymptotes

00:02:15.277 --> 00:02:16.325
on a periodic basis.

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.873
So it's very clear that
this limit does not exist.
