00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.812
(applause)

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:15.248
Many corporations
use that hash tag

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.516
to promote their products.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.785
Famed cleaning product Mr. Clean

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.286
- [Audience] Awww.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.523
- Never forget.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.558

A. Apparently this is the most
depressing day of the year.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.200
Explains why it took three
hours to get out of bed.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.869
Hash tag bluemonday.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.039
I don't think I like
humanized Mr. Clean.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.206
- [Andrea] No.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.543
B. Mom, stop asking when
there will be a Mrs. Clean.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.545
Hash tag bluemonday.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.047
(laughter)

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.282 align:start size:97% position:3%
C. The one thing I can't clean
is the blood off my hands.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.850
I wish I could bring
back those villagers.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.218
We were so young.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.486
Hash tag bluemonday.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.722
(applause)

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.425
I mean, it's called Mr. Clean

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.692 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause he was
special ops, right?

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.761 align:start size:84% position:16%
He would come in if
you needed to solve a-

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.263
Paul Scheer?

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:05.098 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I'm gonna say C, I think
that that's 100% right.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:08.735 align:start size:97% position:3%
I wish it were C, I tell
you the correct answer is A.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.236
- [Andrea] Oh my God.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.504
- I know this is the most
depressing day of the year.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.039
Explains why it took

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.408
Someone get that guy an ice
cream sandwich or something.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.510
- He's been cleaning
for his entire life,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.746 align:start size:84% position:16%
just give him another
day of a break,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:20.747
(laughter)

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.282
I mean, he has a terrible life.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.018
- I'm so tired of seeing my
own reflection in toasters.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:25.885
(laughter)

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.587
The monotony.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.823
- I do wonder if that tear
would actually be better

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:30.990
than anything else that he uses,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.459
like a real tear from Mr. Clean?

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.694
- Well, that's where the
cleaning product comes from

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.895
- [Paul] His tears!

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.498
- Yes, they come from
Mr. Clean's tears,

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:39.332
which has the high concentration

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.600
- With like a bottle

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.937
- of cleansing power and
so all day long, yeah.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.306
The government sent him
to Nam as an experiment

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.875 align:start size:88% position:13%
to get the most thorough
cleaning product

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.978 align:start size:88% position:13%
so all of his flashbacks
mean clean appliances

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.279
for you, the consumer.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.948 align:start size:88% position:13%
- When he went up, he
would light up a village

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.483
and fill up 17 gallon jugs.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.751
(laughter)

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.223 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- But some of those tears
were mixed for villager tears.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.224 line:0%
(laughter)

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.226 line:0%
- [Chris] They were, yes.
