00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.763
Let's look at the answer to our on-chip directory

00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:05.990
quiz. We said that we might run out of these

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.979
partial directory entries, and the question is what do we

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.320
do now? And the answer is, the same thing we

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.384
did when we ran out of room in a

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:19.340
cache. And that is replace an existing entry, possibly using

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.652
a replacement policy such as LRU. The really interesting question

00:00:23.652 --> 00:00:25.636
is what do we need to do when we replace

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.730
a directory entry?
