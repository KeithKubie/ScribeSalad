&gt;&gt;Aaron: So is this for you?

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.076
Will a flipped classroom work

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:16.966
in your subject area
and grade level?

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:18.976
We think the answer is
yes, and here's why.

00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:22.746
So how do you flip
a science class?

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:25.116
Take your direct instruction,
put that on a video.

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:28.026
All that time you get
back, labs, labs, labs.

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:30.236
Get your kids involved
in hands on learning.

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:32.646
In fact, start going
down the road of inquiry.

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:34.786
Have your students
engage in a question

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:38.136
and an investigation before
you supplement then with some

00:00:38.136 --> 00:00:39.126
of that video content.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.286
&gt;&gt;Jon: In math class, it's
like the biggest no brainer

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:42.206
in the flip classroom.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:46.196
Kids struggle with math content,
so put the problems and how

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:48.366
to do that on the video, so
that when they're in class,

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:49.416
they get the help
that they need.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.906
But don't just solve problems,
make sure you're also bringing

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.556
in problems and projects

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:55.726
that enhance the learning
environment for your students.

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:57.646
&gt;&gt;Aaron: Can you flip
a class like English

00:00:57.646 --> 00:00:59.096
that isn't real content heavy?

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:00.406
The answer's yes.

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:03.136
Think about the mechanics,
the mechanics of language,

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.546
the mechanics of grammar,
the mechanics of writing.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.476
Those are the type

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.926
of instructional things
you could put on a video,

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.156
so that you can get your
time back in your class

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:14.866
to actually get the students
involved in the writing process.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.446
You could also use those
videos as a remediation tool

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:18.876
for students who
come to your class

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.486
without the prerequisite skills.

00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:23.396
&gt;&gt;Jon: What about a practical
subject like art or woodworking?

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.656
Well, make a video on techniques
and tools the students would use

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:30.856
so that in class, they can apply
those same techniques and tools.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.916
So that in class, the
students are making things.

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:35.996
&gt;&gt;Aaron: Social studies
teachers can leverage video

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.936
to deliver concept overviews.

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:40.716
That way, you can get class time
back to get students involved

00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:43.516
in dialog and reading
original documents.

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:45.956
That way, they're learning
more about why things happen

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:48.086
in history that just
what happened in history.

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:50.076
&gt;&gt;Jon: Can you flip a
physical education class?

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.436
Of course you can, so
make a video on how

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.466
to serve a volleyball, so
when the kids come to class,

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:57.506
they can serve volleyballs, or
how to play a particular game

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:59.586
so that when they come to
class, they can play the game.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.686
This frees up class time
for teachers who are bogged

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:04.596
down with too much
explanation and rule giving.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.886
&gt;&gt;Aaron: What about students who
learn at a pace that's different

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:09.686
than the pace that the
teacher is teaching?

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:12.276
They could be a student who
learns very, very quickly,

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:14.456
or a student who might
learn a little more slowly.

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:17.666
Well, having a flipped classroom in
place gives the students control

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.026
over the pace at which
they're exposed to content.

00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:21.966
A student can watch a
video at double speed

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:26.806
and hear the content faster,
or a student can also pause...

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:29.336
or a student can also pause
and rewind if they need

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:32.126
to hear content or
slower or multiple times.

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.376
&gt;&gt;Jon: The common thread
in all of these examples is

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:37.226
that lower level skill
and concept stuff is done

00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:39.676
on the video so that the
"in class" time is used

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:41.306
for higher order thinking,

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:43.976
deeper learning and
more engagement.
