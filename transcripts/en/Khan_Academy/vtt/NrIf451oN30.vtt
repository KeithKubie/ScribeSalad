00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.920
We're on problem 103.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:14.420
And it says, if n and k
are greater than 0,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.350
is n over k an integer?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.660
So essentially they're asking,
is k divisible into n.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.630
So let's see, statement
1 says, n

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.120
and k are both integers.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.070
And that's good that they told
me that, because I was

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.320
assuming it incorrectly.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.210
So they're saying n and
k are both integers.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.780
Well that still doesn't
help me much.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.240
n could be 2 and
k could be 100.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.710
And 2 over 100, is 1/50.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.690
That's not an integer.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.180
Although n could be 4
and k could be 2.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.990
And that would be an integer.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.950
4 over 2 is 2.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.670
So statement 1 by itself
doesn't help me.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.500
Statement 2 says n squared and
k squared are both integers.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.800
Well once again, I don't see
this as helping me much.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.530
If n and k are both integers, of
course when you square them

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.280
they're going to integers.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.410
You take any integer and you
square it you get an integer.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.762
You take any other integer
and you square

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:21.520
it you get an integer.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.760
So this actually gives me no new
information relative to 1.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.050
So, I'm just trying to see
if I'm missing something.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.330
But as far as I can
tell it's E.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.360
Both statements together
are not sufficient

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.890
to answer this question.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230
I mean, I can give you a case.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.970
n could be 4, k could be 2.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.300
And then, n over k would
be an integer.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.400
And both of these would
satisfy both of these

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.830
conditions.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.730
Or it could be, 2 and 4.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.160
In which case, n over
k aren't integers.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.210
They don't actually
differentiate

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.940
between n and k at all.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.010
So it's E.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.940
Next problem.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.080
104.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.950
If the average arithmetic mean
of six numbers is 75, how many

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.020
of the numbers are
equal to 75?

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.350
OK, so six numbers
are equal to 75.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.930
How many of them are
equal to 75?

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.930
Let me go scroll down
a little bit.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.550
The first statement says,
none of the six numbers

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.810
is less than 75.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.810
So none less than 75.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.270
So this is interesting.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.770
If I have six numbers.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.170
And their average is 75 and none
of them are less than 75,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.200
they essentially all
have to be 75.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.240
Let's say the first
number is 75.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.340
Now let's just say that I had
some number above 75 in the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.230
list. Let's just say for
argument that there was a 76

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.060
in the list. It doesn't
have to be an integer.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.990
They're not assuming that.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.200
But let's say I had 76 in the
list. In order for the average

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.370
to be 75, I would have to offset
this number that's one

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.130
more than 75 with another
number that's

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.500
one less than 75.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.480
But they told us that none of
the numbers are less than 75.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.380
So if I have a number greater
than 75, I have to have a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.440
corresponding number less than
75, or several of them to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.820
balance off that number.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.590
Or you could have several
balancing several.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.880
It can get complicated.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.880
But the general idea is, is that
if no numbers are less

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.840
than 75, you can't
have any numbers

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.700
greater than 75 either.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.290
So this actually tells you
that all six are 75.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.040
So statement 1 alone
is sufficient.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.090
Statement 2 says, none
of the six numbers is

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.990
greater than 75.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.700
Well it's the same argument.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.450
If I have a number,
let's call it a.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.120
Let's say it's one of the
numbers that's in my list. And

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.010
it's greater than 75.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.830
In order to average down to
75, I'm going to have to

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.190
have-- well let's say
a is less than 75.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.200
Because we're using statement
number 2.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.040
If a is less than 75--
let's say 75 is here

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.960
in the number line.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.520
I'm just doing ad hoc
diagrams. So a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.800
is less than 75.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.090
In order for the whole group
to average to 75, I have to

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.370
have some number that's bigger
than 75 to balance off the a.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.700
Let's call that b.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.410
But they're saying that
we have no numbers

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.330
greater than 75.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.400
So we have no numbers
greater than 75.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.020
We can't have any numbers less
than 75 either and all the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.660
numbers have to be
equal to 75.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.740
All six of them.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.530
So once again 2 is
also sufficient.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.460
So each of these statements,
independently, are sufficient

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.420
to answer this question.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.800
Actually they both answer the
question that all six are

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.770
equal to 75.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.020
That was interesting.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.360
Problem 105.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:16.780
Is the absolute value of
x equal to y minus z?

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.440
OK.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.440
Absolute value of x equal
to y minus z.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.910
All right.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.260
So in statement number 1,
they tell us that x plus

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.335
y is equal to z.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.900
So let's see if we can do
some substitution. z is

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.470
equal to x plus y.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.490
So if we substitute z into this
top equation we get the

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.015
absolute value of x is equal
to y minus x plus y.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.090
So that means that the absolute
value of x is equal

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.980
to y minus x minus y.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.280
And that says that the absolute
value of x is equal

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.460
to minus x.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.390
Because the y's cancel out.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.670
Well I don't know if
this is true still.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.480
This would apply to any
negative number.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.870
If I have a negative
1, negative 1

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.595
absolute value is 1.

00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:14.020
And negative negative
1 is 1 as well.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.610
So this would apply if x is
0 or some negative number.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.850
But they don't tell us that.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.340
So we don't know if
this is true.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.520
Statement 2 tells us-- well
there you go-- statement 2

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.660
tells us that x is
less than 0.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.670
So this tells us x is definitely
a negative number.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.120
And if you put any negative
number into this, which we got

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.360
from this condition and this
condition, if you put this

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.070
into that, you know this is true
for any negative number.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.090
The absolute value of any
negative number is the

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.870
opposite of that number.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.260
So you need both of
these statements.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.920
And obviously statement
2 alone is useless.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.810
Because if you just say x is
less than 0, you don't know

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.640
anything about y or z without
this condition right here.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.710
So both statements together
are sufficient.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.080
But individually, they are
reasonably useless.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.900
106.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.150
We're getting up there.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.490
What was the total amount of
revenue that a theater

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.120
received from the sale of 400
tickets, some of which were

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.470
sold at x percent of full price
and the rest of which

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.515
were sold at full price?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.240
So let's say we have the reduced
price tickets and the

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.900
full price.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.360
So R is the number of reduced
price tickets and F is the

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.780
number of full price tickets.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.955
So R plus F.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:40.740
So the the total number
of tickets was 400.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.570
What was the total amount
of revenue?

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.510
And then the total amount of
revenue generated is going to

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:53.440
be equal to the price
of full price times

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.890
the full price tickets.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.010
So P times F where P is the
price of full priced.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.270
Plus the number of reduced
tickets and that's sold at x

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.770
percent of the full
price tickets.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.760
Whatever x is. x percent.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.750
we'll convert it to a decimal
at the appropriate time.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.460
So this is what the initial
problem description tells us.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.180
That the total number of
tickets is 400 and then

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.360
whatever-- of its x percentage
of P-- so whatever the full

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.230
price is times the full price
tickets plus-- this would be

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.390
the reduced price times the
reduced price tickets-- equals

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.880
the total revenue.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.640
Now let's see if we can
figure this one out.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.610
x is equal to 50.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.770
Well this by itself just
tells us that this is p

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.789
over 2 right here.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.880
This x is 0.5.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.290
It's 50%.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.880
Remember they said x percent.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.810
So this just makes this
equation, it turns it into,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:58.310
0.5 times P times R
plus P times F is

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.780
equal to the revenue.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.450
And we still have
one, two, three

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.470
unknowns and two equations.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.220
So that by itself
isn't enough.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.260
We actually have
four unknowns.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.230
R, P, F and revenue.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.340
Four unknowns, two equations.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.750
Not good enough.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.370
2, full price tickets
sold for $20 each.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.390
So the price of a full
price ticket is $20.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.510
So now, this is interesting.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.500
Now we could take this
and substitute

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.700
it into this equation.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.530
Because we now know what the
price is, the P variable.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.310
And so if we use both of these
conditions, we have 50% of a

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.080
full price-- well, that's $10--
times the number of

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.290
reduced price tickets plus $20,
times the number of full

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:51.090
price tickets, is equal to
the revenue generated.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:57.220
And then we know that a total
of 400 tickets are sold.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.770
R plus F is equal to 400.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:04.080
Well even now, we still just
don't have enough information.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.350
They would have to tell
us either R or F.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.800
Or they would have to tell us
the total amount of revenue

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.930
generated in order for us--
well, actually that's what

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.640
they want to figure out.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.820
They want to know the total
amount of revenue.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.390
So in order to figure that out,
we would have to have at

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.980
least one more condition
to solve for R.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.720
And then be able
to solve for F.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.970
We have to know R or F to
figure out the revenue.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.640
Let me just make sure I'm not
missing something here.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.490
Yeah, there's no other way to
just-- you can't just separate

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.520
out an R plus F.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.810
So I'm going to say that E, both
statements together are

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.060
not sufficient.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.370
I'm pretty sure I'm right.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.720
I'm don't think I'm missing
anything right here.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.830
Some of which were sold at x
percent of full price and the

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.270
rest were sold at full
price, which is $20.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.110
So R plus F is 40.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.670
And then we have 10R is
equal to revenue.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.390
Yeah.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.790
We have three unknowns and two

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.290
equations, two linear equations.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.280
Not good enough.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.560
Next problem.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.790
Oh, I'm over time.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.580
See you in the next video.
