&gt;&gt; Hello my name is Cheryl Lederle and I work

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.270
in the Education Outreach
Department of Library of Congress.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.180 position:69%
We are thrilled to welcome you to the Second
Annual Online Conference for Educators.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.210
Our session today, Teaching
with Historical Newspapers.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.580 position:63%
Now I'd like to introduce our presenter.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.470
Megan Halsband is a Reference
Librarian of Serials

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.840
and Government Publication
Division of Library of Congress.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.240 position:58%
She is part of a team of Reference
Librarians that work in the Newspaper

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.380 position:70%
or Current Periodical Reading Room to provide
onsite and offsite reference assistance

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.770 position:63%
for the library's Newspaper, Periodical,
and Government Documents Collections.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.870 position:58%
Megan also serves as a Specialist
for library's Comic Book collections.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.150
Welcome Megan.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Cheryl
and welcome everybody.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.440
Hopefully, we'll get some good
discussion during today's session

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.850 position:61%
and I'll just go ahead and get started.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.410 position:67%
Today I am going to talk with you about
Chronicling in America, an ongoing resource

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.260 position:67%
from the National Digital Newspaper Program
which is collaboration between the Library

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.670 position:59%
of Congress, the National Endowment
of the Humanities and state partners .

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.590
We frequently get the question
-- why use newspapers?

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.260
Are newspapers primary sources?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.690
And yes, they are.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.440 position:56%
That's the answer we generally give.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.690 position:69%
A more in-depth explanation would be primary
sources are the raw materials of history --

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.080 position:61%
original documents and objects which
were created at the time of your study.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.040 position:70%
They are different from secondary sources --
accounts or interpretations of events created

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.840 position:64%
by someone without first-hand experience.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.600
So what is chronically America?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.510 position:61%
Chronicling America is digitized copies

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.420
of historic newspapers from
across the United States.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.120 position:59%
We recently expanded the date coverage
to include issues of newspapers

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.950
from the early cross of the US
capitals -- so going back to 1789.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.930
Currently, 43 state partners,
DC and Puerto Rico, participate

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.320
and we have over 11 million pages.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.390
The goal of the program has
been to enhance access

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.020 position:64%
to historic American newspapers
hopefully from every state and territory.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.880 position:72%
Once we progress long enough to apply emerging
technologies to the products of the US.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.690
newspaper program.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.670
Including Chronicling America.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.530 position:72%
To develop best practices for the digitization
of historic newspapers and to provide free

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.660 position:72%
and open content that's available to everyone.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.700
Here's a map of this current
participating state partners.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.020 position:59%
We have over 300,000 pages in French,
Italian, German, Spanish, and Finnish.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.370
And actually as of this year
[inaudible] will have the option

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.460 position:61%
to select any public domain content
published -- even published after 1922.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.780
I believe the date range
for that goes up to 1963.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.080 position:63%
So in the coming years, we will actually
have additional content passed 1922.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.540 position:63%
There's over 2,000 titles at the moment.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.700 position:56%
The titles that were actually
selected for inclusion were selected

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.960
by the state partners themselves.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.870 position:75%
Generally, they're not available elsewhere
online and were identified by the state partners

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.710 position:59%
at risk for loss without preservation.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.590 position:67%
Something you might note is that there are
only select dates available for each title.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.140 position:56%
Sometimes this can be because they
were only a certain number of issues

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.730 position:75%
that were available at the time of digitization.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.210
Sometimes those are the only
issues that exists anywhere.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.790 position:59%
Each title is researched and selected
by the state partners, as I mentioned,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.240 position:64%
and if the state partner continues the
program and identifies additional issues,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.750
I believe they do try to add new
issues as they are discovered.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.400
All right, so what you might
notice is the search bar that's

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.540 position:61%
on the homepage of Chronicling America.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.750 position:58%
This is the, sort of, default search.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.110
We call it the Simple search.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:27.560 position:56%
You can select a state, a date range
by year, and enter keywords in.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.320 position:56%
The searching is a proximity search,
so it will search the words you type

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.920 position:56%
in within five words of one another.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.210 position:64%
And generally, we find that this is
pretty useful for most keyword searching.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.340 position:61%
Once you've entered a keyword search,
what you'll see is something like this.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.330 position:64%
I did a search for presidential election.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.220
The results allow you to visually
scan the pages and take note

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.620 position:73%
of how many times the terms appear on the page.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.560 position:66%
So the red box that you see there, you can
kind of observe whether the terms are part

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.840 position:75%
of the head line -- whether there a caption from
an image -- whether there are any images or not.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.310
Excuse me.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.030 position:73%
The default sort is relevant but you can change
that to date, title, or state, I believe.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.990 position:72%
Something that you might find useful, as well,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.140
is seeing how many times the
terms appear on the page.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.420
Pages that have fewer words,
total per page, will rank higher.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.410
So, it can be as you see here,
where ads will come up first.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.660
But sometimes the ads are
actually very interesting.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.620 position:69%
For a variety of reasons they include images
and, that kind of, gives you a feeling

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.160
of what popular reaction was like.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:12.340 position:73%
What you might notice, here, is that the --
you can see that there are some ways of sorting

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.370
and limiting as I mentioned, but
also that the search resulted

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.730
in 130,245 results containing
presidential elections.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.390
Which is quite a few.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.190 position:66%
You can limit it to show only front pages.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.180 position:56%
Often front pages -- front page
results include headlines and images

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.950 position:70%
which you might find useful in the classroom.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:42.760 position:66%
Another way to limit, might be to select a
particular state or particular date range.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.060 position:63%
But you can also use the advanced search
feature to narrow your results further.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.950 position:58%
So, this is the advanced search page.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:02.310 position:63%
And just in case you have not discovered
this yet, I -- all of the pages --

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.180
the images should be hyperlinked,
so you can go back to the page

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.860 position:61%
or go into the page on your own, later.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.900 position:73%
So, as I mentioned the -- excuse me [coughs] --

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.790
the Simple search defaults to
what I call the proximity search

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.040 position:61%
which you see in the lower left corner.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:31.230 position:59%
The Advanced search allows you to do
a couple different types of searching.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.270
The Any, All and the Phrase search.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:41.780
You can also enter a date -- a more
specific date range -- then years.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.380 position:61%
It allows you to select from a calendar
view, which can be useful if you know

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.710 position:70%
that you're looking for reporting on a
particular -- particular event say, you know,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.580 position:67%
the election of 1860 and reporting on that.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.200
So, from November in 1860 you can
search for presidential election

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.880
and get a more narrow result list.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.040
One thing to bear in mind when
using the date range though,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.390 position:61%
is that instantaneous news may not have
been the norm during the time period

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.100
that you're researching.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:25.570
Even though technological advances
such as telegraph and cable wire,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.140 position:64%
cable news service existed,
instantaneous reporting was not the norm.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.300 position:72%
And so, it could take days for events be re --
that happened on the east coast to be reported

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.150
on the west coast and vice versa.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:45.000
Especially the earlier you get.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.920
So to go back to the search results
-- sorry that's a little blurry --

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:59.160 position:69%
what you'll see is individual pages with the
keywords you selected highlighted in red.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.670 position:69%
This we call Hit Highlighting and it allows,
as I mentioned, you to visually browse.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:11.210
Something that I wanted to mention
was that sometimes you might find

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.150 position:59%
that the expected language or keywords

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:19.800
that you're using are not actually
use during the time period.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.440 position:56%
Similarly, headlines were not used
in the same way that they are today.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:34.920 position:64%
One example, that I will show in a little
bit is actually the election of 1860.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:41.700
Headlines did not read like
they did in even 1916.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.900
It just said Election across
one tiny part of the page.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.570
So, just bear that in mind
when you're searching.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.520 position:58%
It may depend on the time period,
what kind of results you are getting.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:01.160 position:70%
Sometimes, you can also get additional useful
keywords by reading some of the articles

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.610 position:67%
that you might not have thought of as well.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:13.550 position:75%
&gt;&gt; So clicking on one of the results pages will
show you this -- each page has a permanent link.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.040 position:66%
It will allow you to view the entire page.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.100 position:75%
Include the highlighted keywords and it includes
the citation information on the top and bottom

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.430
and persistent link at the bottom
which is not pictured here.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.430 position:58%
But I will talk about it in a minute.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.310 position:64%
This is the toolbar that's on every page.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:40.450 position:59%
From left to right you'll see the Zoom
In Zoom Out buttons, the Home button,

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.630
the Fullscreen button, the
Image Drop Down menu is --

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.340
actually allows you to navigate
between pages of the issue.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.770
You can also navigate between pages
or view all the pages of an issue.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.090
Click through the issues.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.530 position:63%
See all issues of that particular title.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.190
Which we'll talk about in a minute.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.300 position:59%
That's what we call the calendar view.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:11.560 position:69%
You can also view the text behind the image,
save the image as a PDF or JPEG to file

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:19.260 position:58%
or clip a detail from the image which
I'll go over in a couple minutes.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.000 position:56%
So, the Zoom feature allows you to
focus on the keywords that you found

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.800 position:66%
or read smaller text in a particular page.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:37.100 position:73%
What you can see on this image here, hopefully,
is that the Zoom feature is outlined in red

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.760
in the box on the top right corner.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:50.270 position:56%
So if you -- I've used this as an
example, where, if you want to, say,

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:55.050 position:72%
clip this image as a detail, what you would
do would be to go to that clipping tool that's

00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:04.410 position:72%
on the right of the toolbox and it will allow
you to save a JPEG of that image for your use.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.960
Which you can repurpose into
a, you know, presentations,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.720
online presentations, you
can print out, save to file.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.290 position:61%
As I mentioned, all the material that's
available here is freely available.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:25.100 position:56%
There's no known rights restrictions
associated with this material.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.160 position:58%
It should all be in the public domain
as far as the library is aware.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.890 position:58%
So your stud -- you and your students
can feel free to use this material

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.320 position:64%
for your research and your presentations.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.080
One thing people find particularly
useful is that permanent link.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.180
Which you see -- I've, kind
of, tried to highlight here,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.230
that's the same link that's
at the bottom of every page.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.360 position:75%
It doesn't include the keyword Hit Highlighting,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.900
but it will always get you
back to that same page.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.340
And as you can see, you can --
there's a link to print the image

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.930
as well as downloading the image.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.570
So you don't -- One thing that I
forgot to say, you don't have to be

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.410
on the clipping tool to get
to that persistent link.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:11.120
It's on every page.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.660
And the zoom feature allows you
to, kind of, control, you know,

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.010 position:72%
the type of image that you end up downloading.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:26.880 position:73%
So, in addition to some of those tools, one
thing that you might find useful in the digi --

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.460 position:73%
along with the digitized content from
Chronicling America are the newspaper histories

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:37.330 position:61%
that were created by the National
Digital Newspaper Program participants.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.950 position:56%
These histories tell the story of
newspapers selected for digitization

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.700 position:66%
and how they fit into the state's history.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:49.020 position:70%
Because histories can provide context for the
newspapers and enable you and your students

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.110
to provide a more in-depth
analysis of the materials.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.910 position:72%
For example, oops, let me go to this next one.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:02.850 position:72%
So what you'll see is a link to the Calendar
View and then the beginning of that essay here

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.350
on the New York Tribune and
the New York Daily Tribune.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.750
This can be a particularly
significant if you are researching,

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.700
for example, political elections.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.280
You know, did the paper have
a party affiliation?

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.400 position:56%
In the 19th century many newspapers
were either Republican or Democratic

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.920 position:64%
and had a very specific political stance.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.160
If you're researching the
Civil War, you might see it --

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.210
was this newspaper published in
the Northern or Southern State

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.170
and all this information can
impact how you read the content

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.450 position:59%
that you're finding in the newspapers.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.010
So, for -- I just picked
out a quick example here.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:54.960
This particular clipping it
says, "Election Results Hoorah.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.220
Buck and Breck on Their Heads."

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.930 position:63%
It doesn't actually say Lincoln elected.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.770
That's what it's talking about.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:08.440 position:75%
It's from a November, 1860 issue of the Nebraska
Advertiser which was decidedly Republican

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:19.780 position:72%
and as the essay says, the editor was
actually a great admirer of President Lincoln.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:25.500 position:63%
He had a feisty attitude towards Bourbon
Democrats i.e. Southern Democrats.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.360 position:56%
So, I found this image pretty funny.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:34.340
But you'll find little gems
like this throughout.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:41.930 position:72%
And sometimes it really does require, kind
of, just browsing and seeing what's available.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.970
But, you can on occasion
find funny things like this.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:53.930 position:75%
You know, as I was kind of talking about,
depending on what you are researching, you know,

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:59.240
may depend kind of how you
utilize Chronicling America.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.910 position:64%
But, something you might find useful for
your classroom are the Recommended Topics

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.780 position:75%
which are guides to various subjects and
periods using newspapers in Chronically America.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:18.760 position:69%
So, whether you need some ideas for -- for
projects for your students or, just kind of,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.090 position:61%
want to get a feel for how -- We might
suggest you use some of the newspapers.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.050 position:70%
You'll find quite a variety of examples here.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:34.290 position:63%
There are over 250 Topics Pages which
have been created by LC Reference staff.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:39.470 position:66%
Which include, I am sorry, which are
organized by subject as well as age range.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:46.830 position:70%
There's also just a generic alphabetical list
of Topics Pages which just has the full list.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.980 position:64%
And we're creating new ones all the time.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.630 position:63%
And, if there's something that you don't
see on our list that you would like,

00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:00.120 position:56%
send us an Ask a Librarian question.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.040
The link will be at the end
of this presentation.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.320
And let us know.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.050
We're happy to take suggestions.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.930
Because we really want teachers to
find these useful and to be able

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:15.790
to have their students use
them in the classroom.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:24.390 position:61%
So each of these pages, as I mentioned,
addresses a variety of topics,

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.060 position:69%
but one consistent thing that you'll find it
throughout them, is that they include links

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.600
to -- list of important dates,
suggested search terms

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.660 position:70%
and strategies, and links to sample articles.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:43.460 position:63%
So here you'll see some suggested
search strategies and some sample links.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:50.030 position:69%
Generally, the topics-- they're bigger hits.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.670
You know, the -- it's not an
exhaustive resource and given

00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:00.850 position:66%
that we're continuously adding
additional content to Chronicling America.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:06.480 position:63%
The results that you get using the
keywords will actually change over time.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.020 position:72%
You know, there will be additional information
that you might find, additional articles.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.800
We just have selected or curated
some that we find, you know,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:23.320 position:66%
interesting because of their
perspective or their, you know, a headline

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.840
or an image that they've included.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:34.450 position:61%
We try to include newspapers from
across the country when creating these.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.120 position:72%
You know, not just focusing on the East Coast.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.380 position:73%
As you can see, we have the Los Angeles
Herald, the Seattle Star, the New York Tribune,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.390
and the Pensacola Florida Journal.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.200 position:63%
And so, you know, trying to get a wide
perspective on this particular election.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.910 position:61%
And we try to do that with all of them.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.150
I just selected a few of the--

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.250
Since we mentioned that we're going
to be focusing this presentation

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:09.330
on presidential elections, I
listed a few of the Topics Pages

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.760
that we've created specifically
related to elections.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:22.270
So, what you'll see here are
links to these, these elections.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:27.670 position:59%
June -- Chronicling America is similar
to Newspapers.com in a certain way

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.240
and very different in another way.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:39.770 position:72%
Chronicling America is a free resource so, you
know, everything that we have from the images

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.780 position:73%
to the data behind it is all open and viewable.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:53.230 position:63%
The [inaudible] Newspapers.com and other
services like that generally don't tend

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.390 position:66%
to make all of that information available.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:02.630 position:67%
That being said, they also have the ability
to include content that is protected

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.340
by US copyright if they are
able to obtain clearance,

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:13.100
which we do not provide any
access to copyrighted content.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.270
&gt;&gt; So that would be, I think, would
be one of the major differences.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:22.680 position:70%
I do like as well that we've decided to
include newspapers that are at risk for loss.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:28.930 position:70%
There's actually a surprising number of
materials that are not available in libraries

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.020 position:61%
and not available -- that are widely --

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:38.620 position:72%
that are not widely available and so sometimes
you only find issues in special collections.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:44.180 position:73%
So, hopefully, through this program we're, kind
of, making more of that material available.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:50.280 position:69%
The Newspaper and Current Periodical
Reading room staff actually have an RSS feed

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.680 position:66%
which we highlight certain topics in
Chronicling America, as well as, you know,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.310
This Day in History and other
things which you can subscribe

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.480 position:70%
to through the Chronicling America home page.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.410
If you're at all interested, we
try to do it about once a week.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:11.160 position:63%
We don't try to spam everybody but
you'll also be able to get announcements

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:17.260 position:69%
about when we add new content to Chronicling
America or when we reach certain milestones.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.580
A year-and-a-half ago or so when
we reached 10 million pages,

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.150 position:61%
we kind of talked that up a little bit.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:28.450 position:69%
But, sometimes we find very funny things and
on This Day in History that are kind of fun.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:35.460 position:58%
So using the Zoom and the Clipping
tool can, kind of, help overcome some

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:41.190
of that tiny print and/or fading.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:50.030 position:66%
You can also download the JPEG and then if
you have an image editor of some kind use

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:56.800 position:63%
that to enhance the contrast and that
can sometimes help with the readability.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:03.770 position:69%
You know, part of the issue with some of
that material is that that was the best copy

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:08.770 position:59%
that was available to digitize from --
whether it was original or microfilm.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:16.470 position:67%
And so, there isn't really a whole lot that
we can do about it now, outside of using

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:22.670 position:69%
and image editing software because it just--
the raw material was in that bad of shape.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.840 position:56%
I generally tend to use the Clipping
tool and then an image editor.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.420
You don't even have to have
something like Photoshop,

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.860 position:66%
you can just use something very simple and
just increasing the contrast does help.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.420
Another set of Topics Pages
that we've created our kind

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.250
of events related to presidential
administrations.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.110
So, for example, the impeachment
of Andrew Jackson

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:53.090 position:73%
or Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet which
was kind of the celebratory event that happened

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.510
after his -- after his presidency.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:01.860
Where he sent the Navy off
on a worldwide expedition.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:09.040 position:59%
The Cleveland's cancerous growth is
actually a fairly popular one as well,

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.000
just because it's kind of strange.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.750
I forget exactly what it says.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.990 position:73%
I think he has some sort of abscess in his jaw.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.470
There's a lot of strange things
that kind of come up newspapers.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:30.480 position:72%
Sometimes viewing the PDF can be more helpful.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.180 position:64%
It can-- depending on how often that page
that you're looking at has been accessed,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.300 position:56%
it may take a minute for it to load.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:46.200 position:64%
The-- a lot web browsers keep a cache and
so if it hasn't really been loaded much,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:52.260 position:58%
your web browser may take a minute to
load the entire page and resolve it.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.380 position:59%
Just bear that in mind because they
are -- they can be fairly large files.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.820 position:56%
So, I've included a number of links
here at the end of the presentation.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.080
The first link, obviously,
is to Chronicling America.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:11.530 position:59%
The second link is to Ask A Librarian,
which is our mine reference service.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.720
As I've mentioned you can
select and-- most of the new --

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.420
library's reading rooms including
newspapers and current periodicals.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.530
Don't worry though if you don't
know which reading room to select,

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:29.540 position:61%
the librarians across the library know
when to refer it to other reading room.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.150
[cough] Excuse me.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:39.280
So, if-- if you're not sure where
to send it don't worry about it.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.180 position:67%
There's a direct link to the recommended
topics which we were talking about just now

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:50.180
and you can find that whole
list by subject or date range.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:57.680 position:67%
The -- the always great Teachers page there
in the middle which has links to a number

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.830 position:73%
of resources including the Analyzing Newspapers
Teacher's Guide which I haven't really talked

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:11.430 position:70%
about here in this presentation much but that
can be quite useful with your students when,

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:17.230 position:73%
you know, you've identified an article for them
to look at and so it provides them with kind

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:21.200
of questions about, you know ,how
to take a look at the newspaper.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.330
You know, who was writing it?

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.530
Who was the audience of the time?

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.220
Is it an ad?

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.950
Is it, you know, an opinion piece?

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.300 position:67%
How, you know, what's the context for this?

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:43.670 position:75%
And so, that guide can be really useful when
you're working with your students on newspapers.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.930
The [inaudible].

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:51.190 position:63%
The Education Outreach office does have
a great blog which has a number of posts

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:57.030 position:64%
that include Chronicling-- references to
Chronicling America and using newspapers.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.110
There's actually a few links
in the next couple slides.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.550 position:58%
Diana just mentioned if you're trying

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:06.170
to access Chronicling America right
now you may get an error message

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.870 position:61%
because there's a lot of use right now.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.300
So, sorry about that.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.680
Just keep trying.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.830
Hopefully, it will eventually
catch u.p And as Cheryl mentioned,

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.990 position:61%
the teacher's guide offers questions
to help your students look more closely

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:27.280 position:56%
and think more deeply and then
activities for following up on that.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.940 position:63%
And in some of the guides they'll pair
newspapers with materials from the Print

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.250
and Photographs section and
other areas of the library,

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.530 position:70%
so that can be really useful and interesting.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:47.840 position:69%
Some K-12 resources just specifically, there
is actually a special prize for the best use

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.100 position:75%
of Chronicling America for National History Day.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.220
In case you're using that --
you're doing National History Day.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.220
And then the National Endowment

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.010 position:56%
for the Humanities has developed a
number of teacher resources as well.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.660
So these are some links to some of
the primary source sets developed

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.910
by the Education Outreach Office
which include newspaper materials.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:15.850 position:73%
Women's suffrage is particularly relevant given
some of the examples that I brought in earlier.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:22.130 position:73%
Votes for Women, it was an ad about
presidential elections before actually the 19th

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.170
Amendment occurred.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.800
I believe that was from 1906, so
that was before Universal Suffrage.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.160
So, that might be something if
you're interested in that topic.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.550
Looking at, you know, votes

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.140
for women pre-Universal Suffrage
versus post-Universal Suffrage.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:47.840 position:72%
The Spanish-American War has kind of contin
-- has been continually popular topic as well.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:59.470 position:64%
A lesson plan on the Titanic which Cheryl
actually wrote and that's quite good.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.920
And then, some links to some of the
blog posts that include references

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.920 position:59%
to Chronicling America and newspapers.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:17.780
And again the Titanic, 12 Years
a Slave, presidential elections.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:28.360 position:70%
I was trying to do a little bit of digging on
some presidential elections and I mentioned

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.360 position:58%
at the beginning of this talk, one of
the curious things when I was looking

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.210
at Lincoln's first election, was
how the newspapers reported it.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.940 position:58%
And there were six to eight columns
of text in the newspapers of the time

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.540 position:64%
and sometimes the only headline you got
was "Election" across one of the columns.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.400
It wasn't a full page headline.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.830 position:72%
Sorry Jody [Assumed Spelling], you're correct.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.610
19th amendment is not equal
to Universal Suffrage.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.150
Sorry. You're right.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:06.870 position:70%
So, the election of 1860 was interesting not
only because of looking at how it was covered

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.990 position:56%
in the newspapers but also depending
on whether the newspaper was

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.660
from a Northern or Southern state.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:22.700 position:72%
I found a few reports from Louisiana papers
and Virginia papers which even, you know, two,

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.960
three, four days after the
election would not acknowledge

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.050 position:61%
that Lincoln had actually been elected.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:37.140 position:75%
It-- the text was kind of saying "If Lincoln was
elected" or "If -- " the black -- What at is it?

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.460
Something about the black
Democrat with a black Republican.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.470
It was something very interesting.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:50.910 position:73%
So, I think, students would have an interesting
time, kind of, looking at how the coverage

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:58.130 position:73%
of a particular election, you know, happened
depending on where the newspaper was published.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:08.020 position:75%
And I pulled a little, an image here that -- the
Hawaiian Star than included some interesting,

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:14.580 position:73%
I can't -- I forget if these -- I think these
are lithographs of the presidential candidates.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:19.330 position:66%
And what might be interesting to students
now, that I was discovering, is, you know,

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:23.490
for a very long time there
were generally four parties.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.890
Even up until about a hundred
years ago, four or more parties

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.890
that were participating in
the presidential election.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.590
It wasn't just a two-party race.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:41.280 position:70%
And so, here you can see the four candidates,
which I thought was kind of interesting.
