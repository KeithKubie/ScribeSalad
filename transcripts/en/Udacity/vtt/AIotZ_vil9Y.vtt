00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.040
&gt;&gt; All right, so, so how does this work, Charles? How do you do single link

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.780
clustering? Again, assuming the distances are distances in

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.290
the plane, just because it makes it easy.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.943
&gt;&gt; Right. So you just keep finding the

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.138
clusters that are closest, and you defined it as

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:16.120
where the, the two closest points in two clusters

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.527
are what makes them, is what defines their distance.

00:00:19.527 --> 00:00:19.893
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:21.493
&gt;&gt; And so if I look at this, if you

00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:25.452
look at, look at the big outer circle. you'll, you'll notice

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:27.635
that each of, you start with any one of those

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:29.995
points and it's always going to be closer to one of

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:32.650
its neighbors on the circle than to, say, one of

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.830
those four points in the middle of the circle. Right?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.920
&gt;&gt; They're close to each other.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.910
&gt;&gt; They're close to each other.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.625
&gt;&gt; If we start doing mergings, it, it ought

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:41.930
to look something like this, right? Where we've got,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.250
I don't know. [SOUND] Maybe. [SOUND] But little by

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.300
little it's going to be linking these things up.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And that's the key thing there that you were drawing

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.970
before that the bridge between the two big circles, every point there is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.950
always going to be closer to one of the points on the outer

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.800
circle clusters than it's ever going to be. To anything else. And so,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.140
you're going to end up making, one big cluster,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.170
out of the outer shell. Which is kind of weird.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.850
&gt;&gt; It is a little bit weird. You get these kind of stringy

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.110
clusters because two things are close to each other if they're close anywhere.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.570
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.390
&gt;&gt; So, I don't know. To my eye, the best one is

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.880
the bottom right. But it wouldn't do that because k equals 2.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.120
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.480
&gt;&gt; So to my, for what's, for what's left,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.010
I guess I like the upper right. But that's

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.320
not what single lane clustering would do. It would actually kind of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.680
walk around the circle and link things up. Like in the lower left.
