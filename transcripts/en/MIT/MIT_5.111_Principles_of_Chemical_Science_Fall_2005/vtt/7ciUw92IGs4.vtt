00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.588
We also saw,
or we tried to understand what

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:26.142
the free energy actually was.
And we said that when you have,

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:29.966
for example,
an exothermic reaction,

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:36.411
that not all of that energy
released is going to be released

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:41.000
in a form that can do useful
work.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.375
Some of that energy that is
released, some of that delta H,

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:50.175
for example,
goes into, or can go into the

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.717
vibrations and rotations of the
product molecules,

00:00:54.717 --> 00:01:00.000
that energy of which is not
able to do useful work.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.244
And so the amount of energy
that we can actually use to do

00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:09.569
work is this free energy,
is delta G right here.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.249
So it can be something less
than delta H.

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.849
We also saw a condition,
which was the oxidation of

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:23.002
glucose, where delta G was
actually greater than delta H.

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:28.062
And that is the case where we
have some of that internal

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:33.031
energy locked up in the
reactants which now is released

00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:38.000
in the form of this useful work
delta G.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.800
And I think we had just started
to talk about this term delta S,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.685
which is the change in the
entropy for the reaction.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:49.657
And we talked about how to
calculate it.

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:53.390
We calculate it from the
absolute entropies of the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.733
reactants and the products.
Delta S for a reaction then is

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:02.000
the absolute entropy of each one
of a product.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.567
Times the appropriate
stoichiometric number summed

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.135
over all the products.
And then minus the absolute

00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:13.359
entropy of each one of the
reactants times that appropriate

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.072
stoichiometric number summed
over all the reactants.

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:19.985
And it is the difference
between the two,

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:22.388
delta S for the chemical
reaction.

00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:26.538
And S is an absolute entropy
that is a result of the third

00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:29.451
law of thermodynamics,
which I mentioned,

00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:34.704
I think, last time.
You will talk about it a lot in

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:38.542
detail in 5.60.
Let's look at an example here

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:43.426
at the change in entropy.
Because I want to show you that

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:48.922
you can have a change in entropy
that is large enough to make an

00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:51.713
endothermic reaction
spontaneous.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:56.249
You can have what we call an
entropy-driven reaction.

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.000
For example,
the melting of ice.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.657
To melt ice,
to go from the solid form of

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:07.955
water to the liquid form,
that is an endothermic

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:11.064
reaction, 6.95 kilojoules per
mole.

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:16.643
However, going from the solid
form of water to the liquid form

00:03:16.643 --> 00:03:20.849
there is a great increase there
in the entropy,

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.056
in the disorder.
And it is that increase in the

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:31.000
disorder that allows that
reaction to be spontaneous.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.481
We can calculate the entropy
change for that reaction.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:40.638
That entropy change then is the
absolute entry of the product,

00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:44.950
which is liquid water,
minus the absolute entropy of

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.825
the reactant,
which is solid water.

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:51.629
And you can see that delta S
here is positive.

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.265
Is there a question I can help
you out with?

00:03:55.265 --> 00:04:00.000
Did you have a question?
Can I help you out?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.749
Okay.
That delta S is positive.

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.781
We have increased the disorder
of the system.

00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:12.371
And it is that positive delta
S, then, that gives us a delta G

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:16.495
that is negative,
meaning our reaction in this

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:21.078
direction from solid to the
liquid is a spontaneous

00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:24.102
reaction.
Delta G here is delta H,

00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:29.692
6.95 minus the temperature at
which the reaction is proceeding

00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:34.000
times that change in the
entropy.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.149
And, in this case here,
delta G now is minus 1.57

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.608
kilojoules.
That reaction is spontaneous,

00:04:41.608 --> 00:04:46.795
even though it is endothermic.
And it is that increase in the

00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:50.426
entropy that is driving this
reaction here.

00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:54.835
Now, I want you also to notice
something right here.

00:04:54.835 --> 00:05:00.109
And that is that the change in
the entropy usually is in units

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:04.000
of joules per degree Kelvin
mole.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.060
Delta H, just about always,
is in units of kilojoules per

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.042
mole.
Remember when you're working

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:15.837
with delta H,
bells ought to go off in your

00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:19.090
head.
Remember that you probably have

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.150
to do a unit conversation here
from joules to kilojoules.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.481
This catches a lot of students
on an exam, so I am trying to

00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:34.000
give you some fair warning about
this.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.882
Now, what I want to talk about
is this free energy of

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:45.199
formation, delta G sub 
f nought.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:51.194
The Gibbs free energy of
formation is analogous to the

00:05:51.194 --> 00:05:56.963
enthalpy of formation.
This is what we looked at the

00:05:56.963 --> 00:06:01.384
last time.
The Gibbs free energy of

00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:06.551
formation, delta G sub f,
our nought for our standard

00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:12.512
state, which is one pressure,
is the free energy formation of

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:18.474
one mole of a compound from its
elements in their most stable

00:06:18.474 --> 00:06:24.137
form at the standard state.
It is analogous to the heat of

00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:30.000
formation, only it's the free
energy of formation.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.386
It is tabulated for you just
like the enthalpy of formation

00:06:35.386 --> 00:06:38.544
is.
You can look up the free energy

00:06:38.544 --> 00:06:42.724
of formation for every compound
that is known.

00:06:42.724 --> 00:06:46.996
However, unlike the enthalpy of
formation here,

00:06:46.996 --> 00:06:51.733
the free energy of formation
you can also calculate.

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:57.213
You can calculate from this
expression, delta G equals delta

00:06:57.213 --> 00:07:02.434
H minus T delta S.
If you've got a reaction for

00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:06.869
which you have defined the free
energy of formation,

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:12.086
so if you know the free energy
of formation of a molecule and

00:07:12.086 --> 00:07:16.782
you know the delta S for the
reaction that defines that

00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:21.391
enthalpy of formation,
then you can calculate the free

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:26.347
energy of formation for every
molecule, which is different

00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:32.451
from the enthalpy of formation.
That you do have to look up,

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:37.531
but you can actually calculate
the free energy of formation

00:07:37.531 --> 00:07:43.048
given that you know the enthalpy
of formation and given that you

00:07:43.048 --> 00:07:48.127
know delta S for the reaction
that defines that enthalpy of

00:07:48.127 --> 00:07:50.579
formation.
Questions on that?

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.468
OK.
But why is this free energy of

00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:58.022
formation so important?
Well, that's what we have got

00:07:58.022 --> 00:08:03.398
to look at right now.
Here is a reaction that

00:08:03.398 --> 00:08:07.049
produces one mole of carbon
dioxide.

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:12.889
The delta G for this reaction
is minus 394 kilojoules per

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:16.435
mole.
The delta G for this reaction

00:08:16.435 --> 00:08:22.797
is defined as the free energy of
formation for CO two.

00:08:22.797 --> 00:08:25.509
Why?
Because this reaction,

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:31.871
as written, produces one mole
of CO two from the elements that

00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:37.365
compose CO two --
But the elements in their most

00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:40.205
stable form.
The elements are carbon.

00:08:40.205 --> 00:08:43.832
And the most stable form of
carbon is graphite.

00:08:43.832 --> 00:08:47.933
And the element is oxygen.
NO two is the most

00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:52.113
stable form of oxygen at one bar
pressure and our room

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:55.425
temperature which we are working
with here.

00:08:55.425 --> 00:09:00.000
That is the free energy of
formation of CO two.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.091
And this is very important
because that free energy of

00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:10.374
formation of a molecule defines
the molecule's stability

00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:14.312
relative to decomposition to its
elements.

00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:18.059
For example,
the forward direction here,

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:22.766
this delta G is negative.
It is spontaneous in the

00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:27.184
forward direction.
When delta G of formation is

00:09:27.184 --> 00:09:31.699
negative for a molecule,
what we say is that the

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:39.000
molecule is thermodynamically
stable relative to its elements.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.866
Because the formation of that
molecule, that delta G is

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:47.381
negative.
The reaction as spontaneous is

00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:50.266
written in the forward
direction.

00:09:50.266 --> 00:09:54.412
It is not spontaneous in the
reverse direction.

00:09:54.412 --> 00:10:00.000
The reverse direction,
this delta G would be positive.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.134
So because the delta G for this
reaction is negative,

00:10:04.134 --> 00:10:08.349
we say that CO two is
thermodynamically stable

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:13.120
relative to decomposition to its
elements, carbon and oxygen.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.937
This is important.
The sign of the free energy of

00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:19.879
formation for a molecule is
important.

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:23.537
Had the free energy of
formation of CO two been

00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:27.831
positive, we would have said
that was thermodynamically

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:33.000
unstable relative to
decomposition to its elements.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.649
Because this forward reaction,
delta G would have been

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:41.947
positive, but the reverse
reaction would have been

00:10:41.947 --> 00:10:44.228
negative.
Reverse reaction,

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:48.614
there would be a spontaneous
tendency for CO two to

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:52.210
decompose.
But this is an example where CO

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:58.000
two is stable relative to
decomposition to its elements.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.326
Here is an example of a
molecule where it is

00:11:02.326 --> 00:11:08.161
thermodynamically unstable
relative to decomposition to its

00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:13.091
elements, benzene.
I write a reaction here that is

00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:19.128
the formation of one mole of
benzene from the elements in the

00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:23.957
most stable form.
The free energy of formation of

00:11:23.957 --> 00:11:29.289
a mole of benzene here is
positive, 124 kilojoules per

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:32.338
mole.
It is positive.

00:11:32.338 --> 00:11:36.889
What does that mean?
Well, it means that the reverse

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:39.566
reaction, delta G,
is negative.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:44.206
It means that benzene has a
thermodynamic tendency to

00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:49.024
decompose into its elements.
It is unstable relative to

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:54.556
decomposition into its elements
because it has a positive delta

00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:57.501
G.
It is the reverse reaction that

00:11:57.501 --> 00:12:02.459
is spontaneous.
But even though a reverse

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:07.967
reaction may be spontaneous,
it can also be really pretty

00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:11.409
slow.
When was the last time you saw

00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:16.524
a pint of benzene decompose to
graphite and hydrogen?

00:12:16.524 --> 00:12:20.655
Not recently.
And so even though you have a

00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:26.163
thermodynamic tendency to
decompose, it doesn't mean that

00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:31.770
the rate is going to be fast
enough for you to see that in

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:38.181
any reasonable amount of time.
There is a thermodynamic effect

00:12:38.181 --> 00:12:42.475
and there is a kinetic effect,
and you are going to talk about

00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:46.838
the kinetic effect in much more
detail with Professor Drennan a

00:12:46.838 --> 00:12:50.287
few weeks from now.
But, at the moment right here,

00:12:50.287 --> 00:12:53.313
we've got two different names
to talk about,

00:12:53.313 --> 00:12:56.480
thermodynamic stability and
kinetic stability,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.000
so to speak.
And that is the following.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.286
We call a molecule stable or
unstable.

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:07.549
And when we use those terms,
stable and unstable,

00:13:07.549 --> 00:13:11.457
we are referring to the delta G
of formation.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:16.075
We are referring to the
thermodynamic tendency of the

00:13:16.075 --> 00:13:19.628
molecule to decompose.
So benzene here is

00:13:19.628 --> 00:13:25.134
thermodynamically unstable with
respect to decomposition to its

00:13:25.134 --> 00:13:29.918
elements.
However, benzene is what we

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:32.837
call nonlabile.
These terms,

00:13:32.837 --> 00:13:38.135
labile and nonlabile,
refer to the rate with which

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:42.351
that thermodynamic tendency is
realized.

00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:47.540
Because the rate of
decomposition is so slow such

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.945
that you never see it,
we say benzene is nonlabile.

00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:59.000
Nonlabile means it is not going
to decompose.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.102
Not because it doesn't have the
thermodynamic tendency to,

00:14:04.102 --> 00:14:07.414
but because the rate is just
too slow.

00:14:07.414 --> 00:14:12.606
However, if benzene's rate for
decomposition was very fast,

00:14:12.606 --> 00:14:15.649
we would call it a labile
molecule.

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:18.335
But it is not.
It is nonlabile,

00:14:18.335 --> 00:14:21.647
but it is unstable.
Unstable refers to

00:14:21.647 --> 00:14:26.391
thermodynamic tendency.
Labile and nonlabile refers to

00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:31.762
the kinetic, the rate at which
that thermodynamic tendency is

00:14:31.762 --> 00:14:36.877
realized.
Well, like the enthalpy of

00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:42.411
formation, delta H sub f,
like that, delta G sub f,

00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:48.719
the free energy of formation,
well, that can also be zero.

00:14:48.719 --> 00:14:52.924
For example,
for the elements hydrogen,

00:14:52.924 --> 00:14:57.351
oxygen, chlorine,
xenon, all those gases,

00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:02.000
free energy of formation is
zero.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.032
Just the same way in which we
described it last time for the

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:11.382
enthalpy of formation.
For the elements bromine here

00:15:11.382 --> 00:15:15.220
and mercury in the liquid form,
delta G sub f,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.717
free energy of formation is
equal to zero.

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:22.726
For the elements carbon in the
form of graphite,

00:15:22.726 --> 00:15:25.455
sodium, iron,
iodine, all solids,

00:15:25.455 --> 00:15:31.000
their free energy of formation
is also equal to zero.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.532
Because those are the elements
in their most stable form at our

00:15:36.532 --> 00:15:39.833
standard state.
However, look at this.

00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:44.830
The free energy of formation of
bromine in the gas phase,

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.916
that is not equal to zero.
It is not equal to zero because

00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:55.449
bromine in the gas phase is not
the most stable form of bromine

00:15:55.449 --> 00:16:00.000
at our standard state.
Liquid bromine is.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.089
Delta G of formation of bromine
in the gas phase is not zero.

00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:11.570
Likewise, here the free energy
of formation of diamond,

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:16.441
that is not zero,
because diamond is not the most

00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:22.023
stable form of the element
carbon at one bar pressure at

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.967
room temperature.
Graphite is.

00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:31.056
It is important to look at the
phase of the elements that you

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:36.626
are dealing with.
Do you want to calculate delta

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:40.478
G for a reaction?
Well, just like calculating

00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:45.292
delta H for the reaction,
you can use the free energy of

00:16:45.292 --> 00:16:48.356
formation.
You need to know the free

00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:52.646
energy of formation for every
one of the products,

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:56.673
multiply that by the
appropriate stoichiometric

00:16:56.673 --> 00:17:02.827
number and sum that all up.
And then you do the same here

00:17:02.827 --> 00:17:07.018
for the reactants.
You need to know the free

00:17:07.018 --> 00:17:12.575
energy of formation for every
single one of the reactants,

00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:16.377
multiplied by the
stoichiometric number,

00:17:16.377 --> 00:17:21.933
sum that all up and take the
difference, and you will have

00:17:21.933 --> 00:17:26.028
the free energy for that
chemical reaction.

00:17:26.028 --> 00:17:31.000
Notice this is products minus
reactants.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.454
Just like calculating
enthalpies from the heats of

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:39.454
formation, that was products
minus reactants.

00:17:39.454 --> 00:17:44.818
However, when we calculated
enthalpies from bond enthalpies,

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:47.818
that was reactants minus
products.

00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:51.181
That is something you do have
to know.

00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:56.090
Likewise, you can also
calculate delta G for a reaction

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:01.363
now from knowing delta H for
that reaction and also knowing

00:18:01.363 --> 00:18:06.982
delta S for that reaction.
You've got your choice,

00:18:06.982 --> 00:18:11.896
to use the free energies of
formation that you can look up

00:18:11.896 --> 00:18:16.896
or from knowing the enthalpy for
a reaction and knowing the

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:21.379
entropy for that reaction,
you can calculate delta G.

00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:24.827
You've got your choice with
delta G here,

00:18:24.827 --> 00:18:30.000
depending on what information
you're given or know.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.142
Now what we want to talk about
is our ability or inability to

00:18:37.142 --> 00:18:44.523
control the spontaneity of some
chemical reaction to control it

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:49.047
by virtue of adjusting the
temperature.

00:18:49.047 --> 00:18:55.714
Let's take this example here.
This is sodium bicarbonate,

00:18:55.714 --> 00:19:03.085
better known as baking soda.
This is what you put into the

00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:08.936
dough of some kind of baked
goods that you want to make,

00:19:08.936 --> 00:19:14.042
muffins or cakes.
You put it in there in order to

00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:17.659
lighten the batter.
And, of course,

00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:24.042
the way this works is that the
sodium bicarbonate decomposes.

00:19:24.042 --> 00:19:30.000
It decomposes to form CO two
and water.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.543
And when it decomposes it does
so in the oven and the CO two

00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:39.395
and the water then expand,
they evaporate,

00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:45.221
but in that dough they kind of
make bubbles before they totally

00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:48.791
evaporate.
And around those gas bubbles

00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:54.335
the dough kind of hardens a
little bit and eventually the CO

00:19:54.335 --> 00:20:00.770
two and water are driven off.
But what it leaves behind is a

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.910
very porous structure in the
dough.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:09.358
It leaves you something that
you can actually put your teeth

00:20:09.358 --> 00:20:12.313
into.
Have you ever tried putting

00:20:12.313 --> 00:20:17.762
your teeth into some cake where
somebody left out the sodium

00:20:17.762 --> 00:20:20.717
bicarbonate?
It is an interesting

00:20:20.717 --> 00:20:23.118
experience.
I have done it.

00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:27.274
Important here.
But this is a reaction that is

00:20:27.274 --> 00:20:33.000
very endothermic,
plus 136 kilojoules per mole.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.017
It is, however,
a reaction where there is an

00:20:37.017 --> 00:20:42.062
increase in the entropy.
We're increasing the entropy a

00:20:42.062 --> 00:20:45.145
lot here, increasing the
disorder.

00:20:45.145 --> 00:20:49.349
And let's calculate delta G for
this reaction.

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:55.048
Well, delta G for this reaction
at room temperature is plus 36

00:20:55.048 --> 00:21:00.000
kilojoules per mole.
It is non-spontaneous.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.656
You know what?
That is good because you don't

00:21:03.656 --> 00:21:08.393
want that reaction to start when
the dough batter is still

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:13.296
sitting on the kitchen counter
because at that point you are

00:21:13.296 --> 00:21:17.534
not going to be able to harden
the dough in any way.

00:21:17.534 --> 00:21:21.939
But let's try to make this
reaction now spontaneous by

00:21:21.939 --> 00:21:26.260
increasing the temperature.
Let's make this term here

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.000
negative, more in absolute
value.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.161
We want to make this term
larger than delta H so that we

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:40.699
can have a negative delta G.
Well, we can do that by raising

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:45.860
the temperature to a baking
temperature, 350 Fahrenheit,

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.957
which is about 450 degrees
Kelvin.

00:21:48.957 --> 00:21:53.838
Now, when we calculate delta G
at 450 degrees Kelvin,

00:21:53.838 --> 00:21:59.000
what we find is that delta G is
now negative.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.468
And now we've got a spontaneous
reaction.

00:22:02.468 --> 00:22:06.543
Now, when you get up to this
baking temperature,

00:22:06.543 --> 00:22:11.312
this reaction proceeds readily
in the forward direction.

00:22:11.312 --> 00:22:15.647
We have adjusted the
spontaneity of this particular

00:22:15.647 --> 00:22:20.242
reaction by increasing the
temperature, by making this

00:22:20.242 --> 00:22:25.184
second term, the T times delta
S, by making that larger in

00:22:25.184 --> 00:22:31.309
absolute magnitude than delta H.
We have made that reaction

00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:34.951
spontaneous.
There are reactions for which

00:22:34.951 --> 00:22:40.192
we can control the spontaneity
by adjusting the temperature.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:44.901
And let's take a look at that.
Well, as you know here,

00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:49.253
delta G is the linear function
of the temperature.

00:22:49.253 --> 00:22:53.162
Let me just draw a dependence.
And, actually,

00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:57.692
this is for the decomposition
of sodium bicarbonate.

00:22:57.692 --> 00:23:04.000
Let me just draw delta G as a
function of the temperature.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.893
The slope of this line here is
minus delta S for that reaction.

00:23:09.893 --> 00:23:14.361
You can see that.
This is going to be the slope.

00:23:14.361 --> 00:23:19.209
I am plotting it versus T.
The intercept is delta H.

00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:23.296
It is the enthalpy change for
this reaction.

00:23:23.296 --> 00:23:29.000
And now let me just draw a zero
here, a dotted line.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.170
I drew that zero because I want
you to see that at some

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:39.340
temperature right here,
that I am going to label T star,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.978
that delta G is equal
to zero.

00:23:42.978 --> 00:23:48.914
What that means is that at this
temperature the sign of delta G

00:23:48.914 --> 00:23:51.978
is changing.
You can see that for

00:23:51.978 --> 00:23:57.436
temperatures less than T star,
the value of delta G nought

00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:02.127
here is greater than zero,
meaning the reaction is

00:24:02.127 --> 00:24:07.513
non-spontaneous.
For temperatures greater than T

00:24:07.513 --> 00:24:11.486
star right in here,
you see that delta G nought is

00:24:11.486 --> 00:24:14.162
less than zero.

00:24:14.162 --> 00:24:17.324
It means we have a spontaneous
reaction.

00:24:17.324 --> 00:24:21.621
We have controlled the
spontaneity of this reaction by

00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:25.756
the use of temperature.
Let's calculate the value of

00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:30.297
the temperature at which the
spontaneity of this reaction

00:24:30.297 --> 00:24:33.010
changes.
Let's do that.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:37.270
To do that, we are going to set
delta G nought here equal to

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.096
zero,
and then we are just going to

00:24:41.096 --> 00:24:45.066
solve for T star.
We are going to solve for that

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:48.387
value of T star,
that for this delta H and that

00:24:48.387 --> 00:24:51.780
delta S, will make delta G
nought equal to zero.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.812
Let's do that.
Well, then T star is delta H

00:24:54.812 --> 00:24:59.000
over delta S.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.356
If I plug in for the
decomposition of sodium

00:25:03.356 --> 00:25:09.333
bicarbonate, the delta H and the
delta S, then T star is 406

00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:13.790
degrees Kelvin.
So your sodium bicarbonate is

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:19.464
not going to decompose until you
get to this temperature.

00:25:19.464 --> 00:25:25.137
At least for this reaction,
it appears we can control the

00:25:25.137 --> 00:25:30.000
spontaneity of this chemical
reaction.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.181
And that is the case.
In general, if you have a

00:25:34.181 --> 00:25:39.636
reaction that is endothermic,
that is delta H is greater than

00:25:39.636 --> 00:25:43.909
zero, and if that reaction
increases in entropy,

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:48.454
delta S is greater than zero,
that reaction will be

00:25:48.454 --> 00:25:53.818
spontaneous for temperatures
greater than some temperature T

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:56.909
star.
You can see that by the signs

00:25:56.909 --> 00:26:02.117
of the reactions here.
If delta H up here is positive

00:26:02.117 --> 00:26:06.282
and delta S is positive,

00:26:06.282 --> 00:26:09.388
then you've got to increase
this second term,

00:26:09.388 --> 00:26:13.129
T delta S, the absolute
magnitude of it enough so that

00:26:13.129 --> 00:26:16.870
it is larger than delta H.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:21.317
And you are subtracting the
two, well, that is when you are

00:26:21.317 --> 00:26:23.647
going to get the delta G
negative.

00:26:23.647 --> 00:26:27.741
For large enough temperatures
the delta G will be negative.

00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:32.922
But suppose we have a reaction

00:26:32.922 --> 00:26:37.207
that is exothermic,
delta H is less than zero,

00:26:37.207 --> 00:26:41.785
and a reaction that decreases

00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:45.487
the entropy, delta S is less
than zero.

00:26:45.487 --> 00:26:50.454
I plotted that now as a
function of the temperature.

00:26:50.454 --> 00:26:55.811
And you can see that the slope
of this line has changed.

00:26:55.811 --> 00:27:00.000
We now have this positive
slope.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.712
Well, in this particular case
you are going to have a

00:27:04.712 --> 00:27:09.878
spontaneous reaction whenever
the temperature is less than

00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:13.775
some temperature T star.
Because right here,

00:27:13.775 --> 00:27:18.034
that is our T star.
And so for temperatures less

00:27:18.034 --> 00:27:23.471
than that, delta G is negative.
For temperatures greater than

00:27:23.471 --> 00:27:29.000
that, delta G is positive.
Again, you can see that.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.879
If delta H is less than zero,
this delta H will be negative.

00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:37.187
And delta S here is going to be
negative.

00:27:37.187 --> 00:27:41.157
We are going to have a negative
times a negative.

00:27:41.157 --> 00:27:44.714
That is a positive.
And so, since delta H is

00:27:44.714 --> 00:27:48.022
negative, T is going to have to
be small.

00:27:48.022 --> 00:27:50.917
This is going to be a positive
term.

00:27:50.917 --> 00:27:55.962
T is going to have to be small
so that in absolute value it is

00:27:55.962 --> 00:28:02.000
not larger than delta H in order
to get a negative delta G.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.550
However, suppose we have a
reaction that is exothermic,

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.764
delta H less than zero,
and delta S is greater than

00:28:10.764 --> 00:28:13.629
zero.
We are increasing the entropy

00:28:13.629 --> 00:28:16.494
here.
Well, this is the best of all

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:19.359
worlds.
When you have an exothermic

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:23.741
reaction that increases the
entropy, this reaction is

00:28:23.741 --> 00:28:29.050
spontaneous at all temperatures.
Delta G is going to be negative

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:33.931
for all temperatures.
Because delta H is negative.

00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:36.206
And then you have minus T delta
S.

00:28:36.206 --> 00:28:40.000
Well, delta S is positive.
So you have a negative number

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.517
plus a negative number,
or a negative number minus a

00:28:43.517 --> 00:28:46.482
positive number,
delta G is always negative.

00:28:46.482 --> 00:28:50.068
Spontaneous at every
temperature for those reactions.

00:28:50.068 --> 00:28:53.517
You cannot control the
spontaneity of the reaction.

00:28:53.517 --> 00:28:56.827
And then, finally,
you can have a situation where

00:28:56.827 --> 00:29:00.482
you have an endothermic
reaction, delta H greater than

00:29:00.482 --> 00:29:03.839
zero.
And the worst of all cases,

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:07.518
delta S less than zero.
You are decreasing the entropy.

00:29:07.518 --> 00:29:10.107
You are making the system more
ordered.

00:29:10.107 --> 00:29:12.832
In that case,
you have a reaction that is

00:29:12.832 --> 00:29:16.102
never spontaneous.
Again, you can see it from the

00:29:16.102 --> 00:29:18.214
sign.
If delta H is positive and

00:29:18.214 --> 00:29:21.961
delta S here is negative,
a negative times a negative is

00:29:21.961 --> 00:29:25.708
a positive, so we have a
positive number plus a positive

00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:30.000
number, delta G is positive at
all temperatures.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.072
So with temperature there we
also cannot adjust the

00:29:38.072 --> 00:29:44.046
spontaneity.
This is very important to

00:29:44.046 --> 00:29:50.666
understand.
Now, what we have been talking

00:29:50.666 --> 00:30:01.000
about so far is delta G's that
have been delta G nought's.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.053
We have been talking about
delta G's, free energies of

00:30:06.053 --> 00:30:10.916
formation in our standard state
of one bar pressure.

00:30:10.916 --> 00:30:15.016
What that means,
for delta G nought,

00:30:15.016 --> 00:30:20.641
what that means is that
the partial pressures of your

00:30:20.641 --> 00:30:25.313
reactants and your products,
they are all one bar.

00:30:25.313 --> 00:30:30.844
Delta G nought for a reaction
is the free energy change for

00:30:30.844 --> 00:30:35.611
that reaction when there is one
atmosphere of each,

00:30:35.611 --> 00:30:42.000
or one bar of each of the
products and the reactants.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.294
Let's take this famous
reaction, argon plus boron going

00:30:47.294 --> 00:30:51.411
to carbon plus deuterium,
A plus B, C to D.

00:30:51.411 --> 00:30:55.725
This delta G nought,
here, is a delta G for a

00:30:55.725 --> 00:31:01.901
reaction under the conditions of
one bar partial pressure for D,

00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:07.980
one bar partial pressure for C,
one bar partial pressure for B,

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:14.257
one bar partial pressure for A.
That is what that means.

00:31:14.257 --> 00:31:18.678
But, you know what,
that's not the situation you

00:31:18.678 --> 00:31:21.500
usually have.
Say, for example,

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.886
you are going to start this
reaction.

00:31:24.886 --> 00:31:31.000
You start the reaction with one
bar of A and one bar of B.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.508
But, of course,
you don't have any C or D yet

00:31:35.508 --> 00:31:39.197
because you haven't run the
reaction.

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:45.141
What we've got to be able to do
is to calculate delta G for

00:31:45.141 --> 00:31:49.752
conditions which aren't at the
standard state,

00:31:49.752 --> 00:31:54.568
which aren't at one bar D,
one bar C, one bar B,

00:31:54.568 --> 00:31:58.257
one bar A.
We've got to be able to do

00:31:58.257 --> 00:32:02.416
that.
And the way you do that is

00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:05.670
represented here by this
expression.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:11.061
Where this expression came from
is again a subject of great

00:32:11.061 --> 00:32:14.780
interest in 5.60.
You will see where this

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:20.450
expression comes from when you
take 5.60, but right now we are

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.540
going to use it.
This is going to allow us to

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:29.746
calculate delta G from knowing
the standard state delta G

00:32:29.746 --> 00:32:35.284
nought.
It is going to allow us to

00:32:35.284 --> 00:32:40.030
calculate delta G for the
reactants and products at any

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.984
given pressure.
You see this is delta G equals

00:32:43.984 --> 00:32:48.993
delta G nought plus RT ln

00:32:48.993 --> 00:32:53.036
of the following.
This has the partial pressure

00:32:53.036 --> 00:32:58.045
of product C divided by a
reference pressure raised to the

00:32:58.045 --> 00:33:02.000
appropriate stoichiometric
number.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.500
And that is multiplied by the
partial pressure of the product

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.025
D divided by a reference
pressured raised to the

00:33:10.025 --> 00:33:12.500
appropriate stoichiometric
number.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.700
And that is all over the
partial pressure of A divided by

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.275
a reference pressure raised to
that appropriate stoichiometric

00:33:21.275 --> 00:33:25.325
number times the partial
pressure of the other reactant

00:33:25.325 --> 00:33:29.299
over some reference pressure
raised to the appropriate

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:35.416
stoichiometric number.
That ratio is something that we

00:33:35.416 --> 00:33:39.604
call a reaction quotient.
We call it Q.

00:33:39.604 --> 00:33:45.114
It is the ratio of
instantaneous partial pressures.

00:33:45.114 --> 00:33:51.616
We might be running a reaction,
and at any time the reaction

00:33:51.616 --> 00:33:57.016
may not be complete.
At any time we could stop the

00:33:57.016 --> 00:34:01.456
reaction.
We can figure out or measure

00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:06.368
what the partial pressures of
reactants and products are.

00:34:06.368 --> 00:34:11.807
And we can calculate what this
Q is knowing what those are from

00:34:11.807 --> 00:34:15.228
a measurement.
That is what the reaction

00:34:15.228 --> 00:34:18.912
quotient is.
Now, our reference pressure is

00:34:18.912 --> 00:34:22.596
going to be one bar.
What I am going to do,

00:34:22.596 --> 00:34:26.543
and what you can do in this
reaction quotient,

00:34:26.543 --> 00:34:31.543
is that I am going to put
P(rf), the reference pressure as

00:34:31.543 --> 00:34:36.363
ones in here.
And so I am not going to

00:34:36.363 --> 00:34:40.893
explicitly write it out.
And that is just fine,

00:34:40.893 --> 00:34:44.537
as long as you put the
pressures then,

00:34:44.537 --> 00:34:48.969
here, in units of bar.
So this is the reaction

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:53.795
quotient, the form of it that we
are going to use,

00:34:53.795 --> 00:35:00.000
as long as you put the
pressures here in units of bar.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.116
We've got to remember this
because I am now going to use

00:35:05.116 --> 00:35:10.790
this in a very interesting way.
This is going to give me delta

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:16.558
G at any arbitrary pressures of
the reactants and the products.

00:35:16.558 --> 00:35:21.581
How am I going to use this?
I am going to start to talk

00:35:21.581 --> 00:35:25.953
about the equilibrium constant
for the reaction.

00:35:25.953 --> 00:35:32.000
I've got my famous A plus B
going to C plus D reaction.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.973
And you already know that all
reactions have some kind of

00:35:37.973 --> 00:35:42.559
equilibrium.
There is a forward reaction and

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:47.360
there is a reverse reaction.
And we know that,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.093
as we said, delta G is less is
zero.

00:35:51.093 --> 00:35:57.386
If delta G were less than zero
for this reaction as written,

00:35:57.386 --> 00:36:04.000
then it is the forward reaction
that is spontaneous.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.071
If delta G is greater than zero
for the reaction as written,

00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:17.183
then it is the reverse reaction
that is spontaneous.

00:36:17.183 --> 00:36:22.696
And now, here comes the really
important point,

00:36:22.696 --> 00:36:29.767
and that is if delta G is equal
to zero for that reaction as

00:36:29.767 --> 00:36:36.000
written then we are at chemical
equilibrium.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.821
When delta G is equal to zero,
then we are at equilibrium.

00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:46.314
Notice this is not delta G
nought equal zero.

00:36:46.314 --> 00:36:52.136
This is delta G equals zero.
That is what defines chemical

00:36:52.136 --> 00:36:58.365
equilibrium, when that delta G
that I just showed you is equal

00:36:58.365 --> 00:37:02.870
to zero.
Here is that expression again

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:07.720
that I showed you.
Delta G is delta G knot plus RT

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:13.460
ln of this reaction quotient.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:19.696
What I am saying is that
we are at equilibrium when this

00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:23.556
delta G here,
this one is equal to zero.

00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:25.733
Not that one.
This one.

00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:31.682
If that is the case --
If you are at equilibrium,

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:37.873
then I can take this equation
here, and what I am going to do

00:37:37.873 --> 00:37:44.166
is move delta G nought to this
side, and the result is delta G

00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:49.944
nought is equal to minus RT ln
of this reaction quotient.

00:37:49.944 --> 00:37:54.793
See where I am going?

00:37:54.793 --> 00:38:00.158
Delta G was equal to zero.
That let me then solve for

00:38:00.158 --> 00:38:08.000
delta G nought is equal to minus
RT ln of this reaction quotient.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.466
Now, under this condition,
when delta G is equal to zero,

00:38:15.466 --> 00:38:21.199
this reaction quotient Q has a
special name.

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:28.000
And that special name is a
thermodynamic equilibrium

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.690
constant.
When we are at equilibrium,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:37.972
this reaction quotient is that
equilibrium constant K.

00:38:37.972 --> 00:38:41.659
This defines the equilibrium
constant.

00:38:41.659 --> 00:38:47.539
What the equilibrium constant
tells us is about the relative

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:52.422
proportions here of the products
to the reactants.

00:38:52.422 --> 00:38:59.000
If the equilibrium is large,
we've got a lot of products.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.350
The numerator has got to be
large relative to the reactants.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:11.916
If the equilibrium constant is
small, well, then we've got few

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:15.576
products relative to the
reactants.

00:39:15.576 --> 00:39:19.774
The quotient,
Q, that reaction quotient,

00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:25.909
is equal to the equilibrium
constant when delta G is equal

00:39:25.909 --> 00:39:30.000
to zero.
Not delta G nought.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.444
And so that is where this
expression comes from.

00:39:34.444 --> 00:39:39.645
Delta G nought is equal to
minus RT times the log of the

00:39:39.645 --> 00:39:44.373
equilibrium constant. If

00:39:44.373 --> 00:39:50.141
you know delta G nought for a
reaction, you can figure out the

00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:54.680
equilibrium constant.
If you know the equilibrium

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:59.030
constant by knowing,
say, the partial pressures

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:04.326
present of the products and the
reactants at equilibrium,

00:40:04.326 --> 00:40:10.000
you can work backwards and get
delta G nought.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.312
Now what we are going to do is
rearrange these equations here a

00:40:17.312 --> 00:40:22.148
little bit.
We are going to rearrange them

00:40:22.148 --> 00:40:28.635
in a form so that it will be
easy to tell whether or not

00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:35.134
you're at chemical equilibrium.
We are going to use this

00:40:35.134 --> 00:40:39.315
reaction quotient,
Q, as a measure of whether or

00:40:39.315 --> 00:40:42.340
not we are at chemical
equilibrium.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.966
We are going to compare Q to K.
When Q is equal to K,

00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:50.613
we are at equilibrium.
Remember what Q is.

00:40:50.613 --> 00:40:55.239
Q is the ratio of the
instantaneous partial pressures

00:40:55.239 --> 00:41:02.000
of the products to the reactants
at any time during the reaction.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.614
K is the ratio of the
equilibrium partial pressures of

00:41:06.614 --> 00:41:11.751
the products to the reactants.
Now we are going to work on a

00:41:11.751 --> 00:41:16.975
formalism that is going to allow
us to easily compare Q to K,

00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:21.415
so that we can tell whether or
not we're at chemical

00:41:21.415 --> 00:41:23.679
equilibrium.
Let's do that.

00:41:23.679 --> 00:41:28.990
Here is the expression that I
wrote earlier that allowed me to

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:33.430
calculate delta G at any
arbitrary pressures for the

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:39.223
products and the reactants.
Here is the expression that I

00:41:39.223 --> 00:41:43.286
got when delta G was zero when
we were at equilibrium.

00:41:43.286 --> 00:41:47.809
And then delta G is equal to
minus RT ln of K.

00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:52.486
What I am going to do right now
is I am going to take this and

00:41:52.486 --> 00:41:54.863
substitute it in.
Let's do that.

00:41:54.863 --> 00:42:00.000
I am going to substitute this
into this more general form.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.588
When I do that,
I am going to get minus RT ln

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:09.282
of K plus RT ln of Q.

00:42:09.282 --> 00:42:12.828
This is just a simple
substitution.

00:42:12.828 --> 00:42:18.251
But now what do I have?
I have the difference between

00:42:18.251 --> 00:42:22.319
two logs.
I have a minus ln(K) here plus

00:42:22.319 --> 00:42:26.907
an ln(Q) here.
The difference between logs is

00:42:26.907 --> 00:42:34.000
the log of that quotient of the
arguments of those logs.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.394
So I have RT times ln of 
Q over K.

00:42:39.394 --> 00:42:43.062
This is the difference in the
logs.

00:42:43.062 --> 00:42:48.995
That is then the log of the
quotient of the arguments of

00:42:48.995 --> 00:42:52.987
those logs.
This is going to be great,

00:42:52.987 --> 00:43:00.000
here, because look at what we
are going to be able to do.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.868
Remember what Q is,
the ratio of instantaneous

00:43:04.868 --> 00:43:09.304
partial pressures.
And you know what K is.

00:43:09.304 --> 00:43:14.065
The ratio of partial pressure
at equilibrium.

00:43:14.065 --> 00:43:17.636
Bottom line here is the
following.

00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:23.803
If Q is less than K,
what that means is we don't

00:43:23.803 --> 00:43:30.078
have enough products formed
compared to what we should have

00:43:30.078 --> 00:43:35.866
at equilibrium.
That is, when Q is less than K,

00:43:35.866 --> 00:43:41.229
we haven't got enough products
compared to what we need for

00:43:41.229 --> 00:43:45.020
chemical equilibrium.
If Q is less than K,

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:50.198
well, then up here in this
expression for delta G we have

00:43:50.198 --> 00:43:53.527
the log of a number smaller than
one.

00:43:53.527 --> 00:43:58.150
The log of a number smaller
than one is going to be

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:02.142
negative.
If Q is less than K,

00:44:02.142 --> 00:44:06.428
then our delta G is going to be
negative.

00:44:06.428 --> 00:44:11.250
And notice, this is delta G,
not delta G knot.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:17.250
If our delta G is negative,
then the reaction is going to

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:21.535
be spontaneous in that forward
direction.

00:44:21.535 --> 00:44:26.678
On the other hand,
if we've got a situation where

00:44:26.678 --> 00:44:32.753
Q is greater than K.
That is, where we have more

00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:37.851
products than what equilibrium
says we should have.

00:44:37.851 --> 00:44:42.338
Well, in that case,
Q over K is going to be a

00:44:42.338 --> 00:44:47.947
number greater than one.
And the log of a number greater

00:44:47.947 --> 00:44:51.924
than one is always going to be
positive.

00:44:51.924 --> 00:44:57.736
And so our delta G for the
reaction as written is going to

00:44:57.736 --> 00:45:03.676
be greater than zero.
And so the forward reaction is

00:45:03.676 --> 00:45:07.513
not spontaneous,
but the reverse reaction is

00:45:07.513 --> 00:45:11.261
spontaneous.
And what is going to happen is

00:45:11.261 --> 00:45:15.990
that the chemical reaction will
proceed in the reverse

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.292
direction.
It will use up all of those

00:45:19.292 --> 00:45:24.824
extra products that we had for
whatever reason to try to attain

00:45:24.824 --> 00:45:28.572
equilibrium.
Here is another way to look at

00:45:28.572 --> 00:45:32.981
it.
I am going to plot here Q

00:45:32.981 --> 00:45:40.137
versus the time of a reaction.
And we know when Q is equal to

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:44.073
K, we are at chemical
equilibrium.

00:45:44.073 --> 00:45:49.917
Suppose we start in a
condition, some time t equal

00:45:49.917 --> 00:45:56.834
zero, where Q is less than K.
If Q is less than K what that

00:45:56.834 --> 00:46:03.752
says is that we don't have
enough products compared to what

00:46:03.752 --> 00:46:09.000
we need for chemical
equilibrium.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.110
When Q is less than K the
reaction is going to proceed in

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.216
the forward direction.
It is going to make the

00:46:18.216 --> 00:46:23.418
products so that we can attain
equilibrium, so we can make

00:46:23.418 --> 00:46:27.615
enough products so that we get Q
is equal to K.

00:46:27.615 --> 00:46:33.000
The reaction will proceed in
the forward direction.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.544
If, however,
we start in a situation where Q

00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:42.512
is greater than K,
that means we've got too many

00:46:42.512 --> 00:46:48.536
products compared to what our
chemical equilibrium says we

00:46:48.536 --> 00:46:52.975
should have.
And so what is going to happen

00:46:52.975 --> 00:46:59.000
is that the reverse reaction is
going to proceed.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.579
It is going to use up those
products and form more reactants

00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:11.154
so that it can attain the
equilibrium value for the

00:47:11.154 --> 00:47:16.841
partial pressures of the
products and the reactants.

00:47:16.841 --> 00:47:23.755
Q is going to be our measure of
whether or not a reaction is at

00:47:23.755 --> 00:47:27.769
chemical equilibrium.
Very important.

00:47:27.769 --> 00:47:32.492
Questions?
R is the gas constant.

00:47:32.492 --> 00:47:37.138
It is something that will be
given to you,

00:47:37.138 --> 00:47:40.764
you can look up.
Other questions?

00:47:40.764 --> 00:47:42.697
Okay.
See you later this week.
