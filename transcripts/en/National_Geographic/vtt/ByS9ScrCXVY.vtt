Hilaree:<i> So many things
 went awry everyday.</i>

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.408
<i>It was a lot of hard work.
 And to get to base camp</i>

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:11.244
<i>when I think of all the times
we almost threw in the towel,</i>

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.913 line:0%
it was, a total relief.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.750
Both: Oh, we made it.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.651
Climb on.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.887
We're at what...
like 11,000 feet

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.289
<i> we have 7,000 to go.</i>

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.060 line:0%
( audience applause )

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.395 line:0%
So, we made it to
base camp, which...

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.998 line:0%
felt like kind of
a huge accomplishment

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.135 line:0%
in of itself,
was to get to 13000 feet

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.804
to get out of the jungle.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.008
We all struggled
so hard individually,

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.609
in that jungle.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.644
Everything looked the same.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.215
You know, we're all like pretty
much A-type personalities.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.184
And trying to, you know

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.085
rely on people who you
can't communicate with.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.355
Then, finally, you know, we,
we come out above all of this.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.091
And it was like
coming out from, like

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.193
being pinned under
water or something.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.894
And all of a sudden
we could breathe.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.863
And we're like "Oh my Gosh,
we're, we're in our environment.

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:09.468
We're where we can, you know
take control of our own destiny.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.638
And we're at base camp."

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.206
<i> This was the transition</i>

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.309
<i> basically coming out of
 the jungle.</i>

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:20.980
<i>For us to come out of the jungle
and see white snow and glaciers</i>

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.150
<i> was really an
amazing time in the trip.</i>

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.753
But, we'd lost so many
days under town arrest

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.656
and we'd lost so many days
trying to find porters that

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.558
we were rushed and we were
stressed at this point.

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:34.661
And at no point in those
30 days had we spent

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.163
more than two nights
in any one place.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.699
Except for when we were in
Putao under town arrest.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.734
So we were hustling
and we were trying

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.335
to switch over all of our gear.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.338
We got to...

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.406
high camp, October 30th.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:50.009
The next day was Halloween.
And I remember this because

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.913
I got on the satellite
phone and I called home.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.883
And I remember,
my kids asking me

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:00.620
where their Halloween
costumes were.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.421
Because,
I'd put them in this bin

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.656
and I'd forgotten
to tell my husband

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.958
and they didn't know where
their Halloween costumes were.

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.328
And so I'm like talking
on this phone, like

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.563
directing him through the
house to find this bin

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.098
to find their
Halloween costumes.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.567
And I was like
"This is so weird."

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.104
And then... my older son

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.173
you know,
he's seven at the time

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:24.010
and he was having a really
hard time learning to read.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.145
And, he'd been working
on it really hard

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:29.581
so he picked up his book and
read to me over the phone.

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.316
And, I mean I'm going to, yeah

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:34.320
like, it was, I was... crushed.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.957
So I had this going on
all at the same time.

00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:42.194
That we're trying to turn around

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:45.131
go through all of our gear
that we hadn't seen in weeks.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.933
And we had one day to do it
in, and that was Halloween

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.836
and then the next day
we were climbing.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.038
<i> So, we started pulling
 out all of our food</i>

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.840
<i> and trying to divvy it
 up and we realized that</i>

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.009
we had actually lost a lot
of food along the way.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.278
We hadn't cut it out as a way of

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.313
cutting our bags or
anything like that.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:02.982
But, we had lost snack bags

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:06.752
and I think some of it
got left in villages.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.421
We'd lost a lot of rice because

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:11.024
there were military outposts
in some of these villages.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.260
And in order for us to
move through that village

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.862
they essentially bribed
us out of bags of rice.

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:20.199
So, we were losing some of these
food supplies along the way.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.001
And when we sat down and
sorted it out, we were like

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.637
"Okay, we have enough
for eight days of food

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:25.672
to climb this mountain.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.474
And if we really stretch it
out we've got ten days."

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.643
But, that's taking
everything with us.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:35.681
That leaves us basically nothing
for 130 miles walking out

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.517
after trying to climb
this mountain.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:45.224
( instrumental music )

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.993
Cory:<i> You know Mark and I
 looked and we thought</i>

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:49.762
<i>you know, we should go this way</i>

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.965
<i>avoid some of the technicality
 of the lower ridge.</i>

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.167
<i> And Hilaree thought we
 should go another way.</i>

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:59.939
Hilaree:<i> Even just from the get
go trying to pick out camp one</i>

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.176
There was... dissension.

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:08.080
( sound of wind howling )

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.382
Mark:<i> It turned out that</i>

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:12.485
<i> Hilaree had made the
 right call for camp one.</i>

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:15.387
<i>It's just hard making these
decisions so far out there.</i>

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:19.325
( instrumental music )

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.894
Renan:<i> Big day.
 Going up a giant couloir</i>

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:24.264
<i> with technical climbing
 with heavy packs.</i>

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.666
( bleep )

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:33.105
Emily:
<i>People were kind of just like,
this is real, it's serious.</i>

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:34.407
<i> But, at the same time</i>

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.642
<i> I was just right there
 with everyone else.</i>

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:40.479
A lot of the things that I did
today I've never done before.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.182
Cory: Kinda sketchy some
of it too, right?

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.684
It was kind of scary.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.654
You are going up 55 degrees,
60 degree ice slope.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:55.327
( sound of tent flapping )

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.696
Whoa!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.005
( instrumental music )

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:12.511
Hilaree:<i> This mountain is
 full of surprises.</i>

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.449
<i> We have followed yet
 another dead end.</i>

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.450
<i>So, we have to backtrack an hour</i>

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.486
<i>and basically drop elevation.</i>

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.856
<i> Then do some steep snow
 and ridge climbing.</i>

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:26.726
And then...

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:29.762
And then, I don't know.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:33.833
In reality, the peak was, like

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.468
this Alpine version
of the jungle.

00:05:36.468 --> 00:05:40.238
It was up and down.
There was no straight way.

00:05:40.238 --> 00:05:43.743
We kept having dead ends, uh...

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:45.611
it was really hard.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:49.282
I think, as a team we became
really focused on climbing.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.984
But, we sort of lost
that team dynamic.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.653
We stopped focusing
on each other

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:57.690
and how... the team was
gonna get to the summit.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.093
<i> This was our second
 day out of base camp.</i>

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:04.397
<i>And we were already in this
crazy Alpine environment.</i>

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.066
<i> And that second day we
 reached a dead end.</i>

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:09.134
We had to come back
down to camp one.

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:12.238
And then start day
three over again.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:15.942
And, I think it was
a really kind of...

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.345
rude awakening for
all of us that

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:22.281
the mountain wasn't going
to be this sanctuary.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.919
This place... that
we would un-map

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.787
and magically arrive
at the summit.

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.823
It was going to be
a lot of hard work

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:34.193
and we were very
thin on resources.

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:37.296
<i> Right here,
we're basically standing on</i>

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.831
<i>the Tibetan-Burma border.</i>

00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:43.068
And... we were just on
our second dead end

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:44.737
coming up from camp two.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.139
And trying to figure
out our route.

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.508
<i> The climb was steep.</i>

00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:51.910
<i> It was pretty windy, it
 was a little bit colder.</i>

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.113
I was definitely
missing the down pants

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:56.148
that I'd left,
like at 2,000 feet

00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:57.916
in the jungle,
like three weeks earlier.

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:01.187
The big, like 8,000 meter
boots that we didn't bring

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:03.855
and opted for like the
smaller lighter boots.

00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:05.624
<i>This is Emily and I on the face.</i>

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:08.794
<i>And so I know that this probably
like, a total news flash.</i>

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:12.798
But, men and women
are different.

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:13.865
Just a little bit.

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:15.734
We have a different
way of communicating.

00:07:15.734 --> 00:07:16.935
And...

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.906
Emily was definitely my
choice to bring on this trip.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:22.775
And she was really green in
this kind of environment.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:25.411
But, I had the
utmost faith in her.

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:28.214
And she's so strong,
but she's emotional

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.316
and she was nervous
on a lot of this.

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:34.286
And so, I chose to kind of like
hang back and climb with her.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.789
And on this particular
face I had been in front

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.291
and I stopped and I waited
for Cory and Emily to pass.

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:41.693
And I hung back behind
and climbed below her.

00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:43.095
And just, hung out with her.

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:45.297
Plus, she's really funny
and she's super fun

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:46.599
and we climb well together.

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:49.001
But I think as we were moving up
towards the summit

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:51.003
that was sort of
perceived as a weakness

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:52.538
with the rest of the team.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.140
<i> And then again, like</i>

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.475
<i> women talk about things
 a lot more than men.</i>

00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:58.744
<i> And when you get
 on a big mountain</i>

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:01.280
<i> sometimes the guys just
 weren't talking at all.</i>

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.083
And Emily and I were like,
"My toes are cold."

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:07.486
Or "How are you layering? Are
you putting that under this?"

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:08.854
And "Are you going to
wear your balaclava

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:10.923
under your hat or
over your hat?"

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:13.526
We were like,
talking about all these things

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:16.228
that like,
girls talk about like, um...

00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:19.131
I don't know, like "You put
your hands in your armpits

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.033
or down your pants
to keep warm."

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:25.070
And um, I think that was also
like, our kind of chattiness

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.840
and like, "Check my harness"
and "How does my anchor look?"

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:33.645
was again sort of this second
tick against both of us.

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:34.780
And...

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.117
again was sort of perceived as
like another weakness

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:39.551
as we were moving
up the mountain.

00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:42.588
<i>When we got to this face it
was just sort of assumed that</i>

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:44.256
<i> one of the guys was
 going to lead the face</i>

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:45.224
<i>and I was like "Wait a second."</i>

00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:47.659
<i>Like "I'm... I want to climb.
I want to lead this face."</i>

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:50.329
And it was the first sense
I kind of got where, like

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.232
there's a division
going on here.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:54.432
Where the girls are
in this corner

00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:56.135
and the guys are in this corner.

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:58.837
And, in the end
I did lead the face.

00:08:58.837 --> 00:09:01.873
And it was fine, and this
led to our high camp

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:04.277
which was at about 18,200 feet.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:07.380
And we were six days into
the climb at this point.
