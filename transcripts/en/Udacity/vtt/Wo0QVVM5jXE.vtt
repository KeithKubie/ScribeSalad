00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.820
Now, let's actually start looking at

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.060
how we would represent a digital image as a function.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.830
We've already looked at, that I've given all images an axis basically kind of

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.870
traversing, and in continuous variables x and y.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.320
Or, indices in the discreet space, like a matrix, with i or j.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.260
We've also discussed that I want to start representing this image as a matrix,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.000
so here is basically a six-by-six matrix.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.560
Now I've filled this matrix in with some values.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.510
Again, there are values that vary from 0 to 255.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.260
The intensity values of each and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.770
every pixel of this six-by-six just a sample image that we we want to look at.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.500
Now what we want to try to see is, okay, what would this kind of a function or

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
a matrix have in terms of functional characteristics and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.990
how would we actually look at that signal?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.840
One way of looking at this would be in the continuous store form.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.030
And remember when I actually previously showed you this example of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.440
just doing a slice and looking at the variables recorded.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.380
Actually generate a plot very similar to this.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.900
So if I was to just look at the, this axes of six values.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.580
And this, of course, is just a pictorial of a much bigger image.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.610
It would start showing your continuous signal

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.920
varying in different intensity values.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.240
And of course the way we can actually represent that continuous signal,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.720
there are various ways that is possible and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.245
we will be looking at that in a future lecture.

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:24.430
Discrete signal on the other hand would just be these discrete functions at

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.790
each and every index value with no continuation going on between them.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.040
But again, it captures a whole lot of detail in a discrete form for

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.340
an image like this.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.370
Also another way to look at the same matrix, or

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.130
same kina for information would be looking at it with a height map on an image.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.280
So again, on this instance what I do is I look at the y axis and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770
the x, the x axis.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.670
I just turned it around just to help us visualize this better.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.610
And on the third dimension, the top one,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.040
I would be basically showing the intensities.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.860
That's what this image represents.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.270
If you look at the same mandrill image, now remember,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.800
the intensity values of one or higher zero would be black.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.320
So here, for everywhere the blacks are, you see kind of a a valley.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.570
And then you start seeing peaks and a lot of detail where the whites are.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.090
And actually you can see kind of the ridges forming.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.580
So in essence, this starts making it look like small hills, and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.270
mountains, and ranges, and stuff like that.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.640
We'll be looking at it more carefully, and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.230
I'll actually be even showing you animated versions of this in a bit.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.640
That'll start kind of explaining what are the values of these types of, or

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.470
what is the value and what are the advantages of this kind of an image.
