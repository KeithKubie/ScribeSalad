00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.840
How would you apply the principles of classification,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.900
to designing an agent that can solve Raven's progressive matrices?

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.760
In answering this there's a lot of questions to touch on. For example,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.020
will you develop the classification scheme yourself, or are you going to have

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.780
your agent learn it as it encounters new problems. So what would that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.510
classification scheme look like? What percepts will the agent use to classify

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.960
new problems into that classification scheme? Then once it's classified them,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.570
how will that classification actually help it solve the problem? What will it

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.620
be able to do this way that it wouldn't have been able to do otherwise?
