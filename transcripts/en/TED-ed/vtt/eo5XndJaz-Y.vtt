00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:15.393
Ever wonder where most of the food

00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:17.598
you eat every day comes from?

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:19.563
Well, about 60% of the food you eat

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:21.600
is carbohydrates.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.626
As you can probably tell from its name,

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:25.251
carbohydrates contain carbon,

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:25.749
hydrogen,

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.087
and oxygen.

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:29.419
But where do these atoms originally come from

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.719
and how do they join together

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.963
to make delicious foods like fruits and pasta?

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:35.785
It actually all starts with the air

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.170
you are exhaling this very minute,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.149
specifically the carbon dioxide molecules.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.951
Plants are going to breath in

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:44.328
this very same carbon dioxide

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:47.215
through pores in their skin, called stomata.

00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:49.296
Plants drink in water from their roots

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:51.862
to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms,

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:53.046
and their electrons,

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.222
in order to build carbohydrates.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.066
What is that thing?

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.018
Well, that's a special plant organelle

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:00.354
inside the leaves of plants

00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:01.897
called a chloroplast.

00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:04.313
It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:06.107
called chlorophyll.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.366
Each leaf has about 44,000 cells

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.203
and every cell can have anywhere

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:14.197
between 20 to 100 chloroplasts.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:17.659
That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts!

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.989
By now, you've probably guessed

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:21.827
that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:22.870
and you might be wondering

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.657
when the sun is going to make its entrance.

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:28.411
Let's go back to that original molecule of water.

00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.685
The plant has to split this molecule of water

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:32.788
so it can get electrons from it.

00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:36.092
But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself.

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:39.161
It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun.

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.723
So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks

00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:44.546
- carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons -

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:45.663
it can use them to go through

00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:48.136
the rest of the steps of photosynthesis

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:50.634
to transform that original carbon dioxide gas

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:53.847
into a simple carbohydrate called glucose,

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.625
C-6-H-12-O-6.

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:59.027
That little glucose molecule then helps to build

00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:00.782
bigger and better carbohydrates

00:02:00.782 --> 00:02:02.545
like cellulose.

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:05.284
Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:07.376
that our body cannot break down.

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:08.506
We call it fiber

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:10.209
and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce,

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:10.800
broccoli,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.127
and celery.

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:14.912
Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong.

00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:17.568
The plant could also turn that glucose into starch,

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:20.301
a large molecule that stores energy for the plant.

00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:22.217
We love eating starch from plants like potatoes,

00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:22.835
corn,

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:24.161
and rice.

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:26.239
So you see, when you eat plants,

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.675
we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis.

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:30.802
The plant makes things like starch,

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:31.489
which we eat

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.136
and then break back down into glucose,

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:36.192
the first form the plant made.

00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:38.492
Then, the mitochondria in our cells,

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.234
powered by the oxygen we breath,

00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:43.137
can turn glucose into pure energy molecules

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:45.222
called ATP.

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:47.335
ATP powers all work done

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:49.382
by each and every one of your cells,

00:02:49.382 --> 00:02:50.486
things like communication,

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:51.070
movement,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.529
and transport.

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.236
But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP?

00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:57.991
Well, think of it like this.

00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:59.941
You're excited to start your summer job

00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:01.730
at the local ice cream stand,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.440
but your boss has just told you

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.307
that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones.

00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:08.741
What are you going to be able to do

00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.573
with those ice cream cones?

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:11.810
Nothing,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.322
which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars.

00:03:15.322 --> 00:03:17.467
ATP is just like dollars.

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:20.385
It is the currency that all cells of life use

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:21.626
while glucose is,

00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:23.642
well, kind of like ice cream.

00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:26.671
Even plants have mitochondria in their cells

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:30.248
to break down the glucose they make into ATP.

00:03:30.248 --> 00:03:31.821
So as you can see,

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:34.199
humans and plants are intricately connected.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.360
The air we breath out

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.451
is used by plants to make the carbohydrates

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.156
we enjoy so much.

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:40.626
And, in the process,

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:43.303
they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:44.478
we need to breath in

00:03:44.478 --> 00:03:46.601
in order that our mitochondria can break down

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.192
our delicous carbohydrate meal.
