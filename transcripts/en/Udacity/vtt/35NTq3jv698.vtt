00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, I'm guessing is there could be 3 options.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And I'm going to walk through backwards to talk about why

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
they are all so vital to our chronometer that we want to make.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Even if I device the pit itself and does so in a consistent manner,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if we don't know how long those repetitions take, well what good is it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If 10 ticks of our clock corresponds to 10 seconds or 15 or 20,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but we just don't know, well it's not a very useful clock.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Obviously, it has to be isochronous if one tick of the clock is one second

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the next is seven seconds, well again I use this clock.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And all of these required that something be happening over and over

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at regular intervals, which means periodic.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, it would be nice if our clock could run forever without power.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you know how to make a clock that does this, you just invented a perpetual

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
motion machine and send me the diagram please.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, what's really cool is there is a whole field of physics

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
dedicated to phenomena that meet this criteria, simple harmonic motion.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Underlying this field of study, simple harmonic motion is the concept of equilibrium.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So let's talk about that.
