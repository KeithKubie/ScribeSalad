00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:03.284
- [Instructor] Lilyana runs
a cake decorating business,

00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:07.200
for which 10% of her orders
come over the telephone.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.835
Let C be the number of cake
orders Lilyana receives

00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:15.002
in a month until she first gets
an order over the telephone.

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:21.529
Assume the method of placing
each cake order is independent.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.033
So C, if we assume a few things,

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:27.283
is a classic geometric random variable.

00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:29.617
What tells us that?

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:31.254
Well, a giveaway is that we're gonna keep

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:33.813
doing these independent trials,

00:00:33.813 --> 00:00:36.302
where the probability
of success is constant,

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.794
and there's a clear success.

00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:40.030
A telephone order in
this case is a success.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.171
The probability is 10% of it happening.

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:46.267
And we're gonna keep doing
it until we get a success.

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.832
So classic geometric random variable.

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:52.397
Now they ask us, find the
probability, the probability,

00:00:52.397 --> 00:00:54.176
that it takes fewer than five orders

00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:56.702
for Lilyana to get her first
telephone order of the month.

00:00:56.702 --> 00:01:00.943
So it's really the probability
that C is less than five.

00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:04.033
So like always, pause this
video and have a go at it.

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.655
And even if you struggle
with it, that's better.

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:09.991
Your brain will be more
primed for the actual solution

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:11.918
that we can go through together.

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:13.105
Alright. (chuckles)

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.760
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.135
So there's a couple of
ways to approach it.

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:17.672
You could say, well, look,
this is just gonna be

00:01:17.672 --> 00:01:20.742
the probability that C is equal to one,

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:23.705
plus the probability
that C is equal to two,

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.758
plus the probability
that C is equal to three,

00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:30.302
plus the probability
that C is equal to four.

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:32.227
and we can calculate it this way.

00:01:32.227 --> 00:01:34.787
What is the probability that C equals one?

00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:36.816
Well, it's the probability
that her very first order

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:38.284
is a telephone order.

00:01:38.284 --> 00:01:40.117
And so we'll have 0.1.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.861
What's the probability that C equals two?

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:44.024
Well, it's the probability
that her first order

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:45.685
is not a telephone order.

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:47.231
So it's one minus 10%.

00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.867
There's a 90% chance it's
not a telephone order,

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:52.960
and that her second order
is a telephone order.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.906
What about the probability C equals three?

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:59.711
Well, her first two orders
would not be telephone orders,

00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.118
and her third order would be one.

00:02:02.118 --> 00:02:03.426
And then C equals four?

00:02:03.426 --> 00:02:07.887
Well, her first three orders
would not be telephone orders,

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:09.999
and her fourth one would.

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.778
And we could get a calculator maybe,

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:14.010
and add all of these things up,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.244
and we would actually get the answer.

00:02:16.244 --> 00:02:17.220
But you're probably wondering,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.602
well, this is kind of hairy
to type into a calculator.

00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:22.477
Maybe there is an easier
way to tackle this.

00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:24.733
And indeed, there is.

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:25.851
So think about it.

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.592
The probability that C is less than five,

00:02:28.592 --> 00:02:32.759
that's the same thing as
one minus the probability

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:37.651
that we don't have a telephone
order in the first four.

00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:41.234
One minus the probability
that no telephone

00:02:43.582 --> 00:02:44.415
order

00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:46.280
in first

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:49.267
four orders.

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:54.054
So what's this?

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:55.777
Well, 'cause this is just saying,

00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:56.610
what's the probability we do

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.292
have an order in the first four?

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.133
So it's the same thing as
one minus the probability

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.266
that we don't have an
order in the first four.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.987
And this is pretty
straightforward to calculate.

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:07.451
So this is going to be equal to one minus,

00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.603
and let me do this in another color

00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:10.222
so we know what I'm referring to.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.112
So what's the probability that
we have no telephone orders

00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:14.950
in the first four orders?

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.429
Well, the probability on a given order

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.499
that you don't have a
telephone order is 0.9.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.677
And then if that has to be
true for the first four,

00:03:21.677 --> 00:03:25.296
well, it's gonna be 0.9
times 0.9 times 09 times 0.9,

00:03:25.296 --> 00:03:27.644
or 0.9 to the fourth power.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:30.385
So this a lot easier to
calculate, so let's do that.

00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:32.277
Let's get a calculator out.

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:36.444
Alright, so let me just
take .9 to the fourth power

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:40.210
is equal to, and then let
me subtract that from one.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.016
So let me make that a negative,

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.735
and then let me add one to it.

00:03:43.735 --> 00:03:46.485
And we get, there you go, 0.3439.

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.118
So this is equal to

00:03:51.923 --> 00:03:52.756
0.3439.

00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:58.570
And we're done.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.804
That's the probability that it
takes fewer than five orders

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:05.826
for her to get her first
telephone order of the month.
