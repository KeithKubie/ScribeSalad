00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.460
The second choice is the correct one. As x gets bigger and bigger, going toward

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.685
positive infinity, the graph is getting closer and closer to the line y equals

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:13.915
zero from above the X axis. And as x gets closer and closer to negative

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:18.217
infinity, over here on the left side of the graph. The curve of a rational

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:23.270
function is also getting closer to y equals zero but from the bottom this time.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.720
In either case however, the curve never touches the X axis.
