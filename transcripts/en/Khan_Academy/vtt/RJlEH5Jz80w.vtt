00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.650
In the last couple of videos
we figured out the electron

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.880
configurations for atoms that
only had electrons in the s

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.930
and p subshells.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.270
And so we have this
obvious problem.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.670
We also have the d subshell,
which we'll talk about, here,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.580
these bizarre shapes.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.360
And then eventually you even
get into the f subshells,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.740
which are these really kind
of exotic-looking shapes.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.730
And the shapes, they're
interesting to look at and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.120
think about, but they're not
as important for actually

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.490
figuring out the
configuration.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.300
So the question arises, what
happens when we start going to

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.740
the d and f subshells?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.060
So the general way to think
about it is the energy shell

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.120
you're in is equivalent
to the period.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.120
We are in the periodic table.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.280
So, just so it all
fits on one page.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100
The periods were written out
here to left, but then I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.660
wouldn't be able to finish
the whole table.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.580
So this is period one.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.400
Let me write this in
a darker color.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.710
So period one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.300
I think I barely am fitting
on the page.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.630
Right?

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.280
So each row is a period.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.410
And then for the purposes
of figuring out electron

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.240
configuration-- we did this in
the last video-- we want to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.040
put helium-- let me just copy
and paste exactly helium-- we

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.420
want to put helium
in the s-block.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.140
So we want to put helium
right there.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.570
The reason why, just in case
you're curious of why helium

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.900
is put there in the periodic
table, it's because it has

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.720
very similar properties to the
other elements in this column

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.460
or this group.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.830
Each column is called a group.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.270
And we'll talk about valence
electrons and why that leads

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.390
to different properties.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.530
But for electron configuration
purposes, we can

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.890
put it in the s-block.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.370
That's not too hard to
remember because

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.280
it's just one element.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.190
And it kind of makes sense.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.570
1s1, 1s2, et cetera.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.590
And what you do is you draw
blocks around them.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.030
So I've said multiple times
already that this right here

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.280
is the s-block.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.910
This over here on the right
is the p-block.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.930
That's the p-block.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.699
And then this in the middle
right here is the d-block.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.860
And so, if you want to figure
out the electron configuration

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.960
of any atom, the way you think
about it, they fill in this

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.680
order, but when you go from
calcium, calcium would have

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.980
filled out the 4s2, right?

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.370
4s1.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.640
4s2.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.520
So if I just do its fourth
energy shell,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.340
it looks like this.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.130
Calcium is 4s2.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.000
And then you start filling
the d-block, right?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.530
What did I say?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.950
I wanted to do-- so
that's calcium.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.230
So now I want to figure out the
electron configuration for

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.320
iron, right?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.090
Which is in the d-block.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.430
So it turns out-- and this is
kind of an artifact and I'll

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.470
do a little bit more of a
detailed video on this in the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.490
future-- that it actually goes
and backfills the third energy

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.340
shell, because all of a sudden
the d orbitals can kind of fit

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.590
in the gaps of the third
energy shell.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.550
So what you do is, you go one
energy shell above it.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.590
So whatever period you're in
the d-block, you go that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.510
period minus one to figure out
what energy shell the d-block

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.950
is filling.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.090
So iron has one, two, three,
four, five, six elements in

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.220
the d-block.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.270
So it's going to have d6.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.410
But it's not going to be 4d6.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.275
It's going to be 3d6.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.070
And I figured that out because
it's in the fourth period and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.930
I subtracted 1 from that.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.370
So this is kind of the highest
energy eight electrons in

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.480
iron, right?

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.110
4s2.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.740
3d6.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.010
If I said, what are the
electrons that are in the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.600
outermost energy shell?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.210
I would say that there are two
electrons in the outermost

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.640
energy shell for iron.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.150
But if I were to say, which
energy shell has the highest

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.330
energy electrons, it
would be these.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.590
Let me actually do the whole
electron configuration.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.190
Let me pick up another one.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.760
Let me take, I don't know,
copper, right here.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.010
Let me do copper.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.570
So the highest energy electrons
it has are going to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.900
be one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.730
Actually, let me not do copper,
because copper does

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.640
something very interesting
in real life.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.550
So it actually is one of the few
things that kind of is a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.190
special case.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.440
Let me do a different one.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.730
Let me do the whole
thing for iron.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.350
Sorry to be waffling
around so much.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.700
If you wanted to do the entire
electron configuration for

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.710
iron, it would be 1s2.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.910
That's the first energy
shell. soon.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.810
Let me do that in magenta,
right there.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.630
1s2.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.740
And then in, let's say, orange,
then you have 2s2.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.590
And then you have six in the
p section right there.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.240
So 2p6.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.200
Now we're in the third
energy shell.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.840
Let me go switch to
this bluish color.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.220
So then I fill up 3s2.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.230
Remember, this is the s-block.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.480
Then I fill out 3p6.

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:39.720
Fill out those, right there.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.990
Right?

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.770
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.176
And now I'm going to add
these electrons.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.360
Let me pick a nice green.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.340
So then I go to 4s2.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.780
So it's 4s2.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.430
And now this was the interesting
thing, that this

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.260
whole d-block is interesting.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.860
Now I fill out another
d-block.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.120
Or my first d-block.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.070
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.300
But it won't be in the
fourth energy shell.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.590
It'll be in the fourth minus
one energy shell.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.850
It'll be in the third
energy shell.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.500
So this will go to 3d6, just
like we did at the beginning

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.540
of the video.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.880
And so it's in the third energy
shell, so I would

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.470
actually write it here.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.130
3d6.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.280
So if I wanted to write things
in order of which energy shell

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.600
they are, I could have
written it this way.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.810
If I wanted to write
it in order of the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.630
highest energy electrons.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.920
Remember, the shells are kind
of the best way to visualize

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.700
how far away we are
from the nucleus.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.940
So in this case, these higher
energy electrons are going to

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.120
be further in the nucleus even
though it's a higher energy

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.290
state to be in.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.500
If I did it in terms of
energy state, I could

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.070
rearrange these two.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.780
But in most of chemistry,
what matters is what's

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.730
in the outer shell.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.850
So it's interesting that
although we filled our 4s2

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.870
here, and then we kept adding
more and more electrons, those

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.530
electrons were just filling
a lower energy shell.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.030
So in this atom, in the case
of iron, when we talk about

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.320
the electrons in the outer
energy shell, and those are

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.660
valence electrons, and these
are the ones that react.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.720
So that these are called-- let
me do this in a better color--

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.080
valence electrons.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.330
This iron has two valence
electrons, because the outer

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.600
shell is 4s2.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.870
Even though it had these.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.640
Even after filling 4s2, it had
six more electrons, but those

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.930
kind of backfilled the
third energy shell.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.860
So that's one way.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.950
And then, so you might say, well
what happens when we go

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.990
to the f shell or the f-block?

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.720
And so that's these down here.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.940
So in a lot of periodic tables
you see these lanthanides and

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.170
actinides down here.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.280
And they're supposed to fill
in the gap right here.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.575
And that might be a little
hard to visualize.

00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:49.180
And I'll show you why
they do that.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.550
You could have just as easily
made a periodic table that

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.360
looks like this.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.750
Where you insert them in, where
you push everything to

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.870
the right, and you
insert these in.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.490
But obviously this type of
periodic table is a lot

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.750
harder to fit in.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.650
You could have done the
same thing with

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.740
the d-block, actually.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:09.200
So in this one, this is the
s-block, this is the f-block,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.780
and this is the d-block.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.160
And then this is the p-block,
right here.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.480
When we were dealing with the
f-block-- so let's say we

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.870
wanted to figure out, I don't
even know what element this

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:28.660
is, electron configuration for
this atomic symbol La.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.970
So it's filling out this last
incremental electron.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.220
It fills the f-block.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.730
Maybe I should do it
in lower case.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:48.340
So it has one in the f orbital
and this is the sixth period,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.405
but with the f-block
you subtract 2.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.330
So you subtract 2 from it.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.530
So it will be 4f1.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.540
And then 6s2.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:56.860
Right?

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.290
The s-block you just
look at the period.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.810
6s2.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.650
And then if you were to
keep going back, you

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.370
would then go to 5p6.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.650
So then it would be 5p6.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.830
And then it would fill out these
10 in the d-block, right

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.240
there, that are in the fifth
period, but remember you

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.490
subtract 1 from the d-block.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.870
So it would be 4d10.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.120
And then it's 5s2.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.540
And you just keep going
back that way.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.630
And it seems complicated at
first, but just remember, when

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.690
you're in the s- or the p-block
you just look at the

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.460
period you're in, but then when
you start filling the

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.050
d-block, it fills in a-- this is
the d-block-- it fills in a

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.280
subshell that's one lower.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.450
And when you start filling the
f-block, which are these

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.900
really large elements, you start
filling a subshell that

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.980
is two lower.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.020
And so maybe in the next video
I'll do a couple of these

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.930
electron configurations, because
I think I'm already

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.330
out of time.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.730
And I'll actually show you
another way to figure this out

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.515
that's often covered in some
chemistry classes.

00:10:02.515 --> 00:10:04.060
See you
