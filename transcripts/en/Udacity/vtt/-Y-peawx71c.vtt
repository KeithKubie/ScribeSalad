00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Just to make sure that we're all on the same page about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Precedence and the difference between

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Precedence and Associativity,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
let's say that Multiplication and Division have higher Precedence--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that is, you should do them first--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
compared to Addition and Subtraction--and this is how we normally do things.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then what is: 3 * 4 - 8/2?

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Fill in the blank for this quiz.
