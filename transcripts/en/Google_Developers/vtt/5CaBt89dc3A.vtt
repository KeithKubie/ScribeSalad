00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:07.280
TIM BRAY: Hi there.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.354
Thanks for tuning in.

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:10.520
My name's Tim Bray, and I
work in the Identity group

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.080
at Google.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.724
Today with me I have--

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:15.224
BRENO DE MEDEIROS:
My name is Breno,

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.194
and I'm an engineer with
the Identity team at Good.

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:19.360
TIM BRAY: He's being modest.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.470
He's the tech lead
with the Identity team

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.650
I work with at Google.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.190
So there's been a lot of news
just over the last few weeks

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.740
about this major
horrific password

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.690
dump exposed on
the open internet.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.750
I don't want to mention
the company's name,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.689
because they're good people.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.869
We got nothing against them.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:35.660
But the numbers are
kind of spine-chilling.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.110
We're talking about north
of 100 million username,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.870
password records dumped out
there into the open space.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.560
And this might be the
biggest such leak ever.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.597
Really, how bad is it?

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:50.055
BRENO DE MEDEIROS:
I think there's,

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:53.130
to some extent, an
overreaction, in the sense

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.700
that we've had occasional
breaches like this, perhaps

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.880
not to exactly this
magnitude, but large breaches.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.950
And those are
repeated occurrences.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.500
So it's something
that we sort of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.810
come to expect that you're going
to hear about large password

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.735
databases being compromised
and leaked into the internet.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:16.860
TIM BRAY: So why is it bad?

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.085
Why is this a bad thing?

00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:19.327
What problems does it cause?

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:21.410
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: Well,
obviously for the company

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.290
that lost the password database,
it's an embarrassing event.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.704
And it's also an
inconvenience for the users,

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:32.245
because they're going to force
their users to sort of recover

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:33.120
their accounts.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.600
TIM BRAY: That's right.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.470
I had to change mine.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.870
Yep.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.911
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: Right.

00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:38.020
Some users might have
difficulty doing this,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.200
so they will probably
lose a number of customers

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.034
after that event.

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:46.200
And so there's a big impact
to the company involved.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010
But for the users, there
is also a big impact,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.840
because many users have a
small number of passwords

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.040
that they reuse across sites.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.210
And so what is going to happen
is once the developers crack

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.890
these passwords and they have
the association of the username

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.940
to the password, they can
attempt to compromise accounts

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.064
in other sites using
those credentials.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:11.730
TIM BRAY: Right.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.260
But the passwords
were encrypted,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.920
so shouldn't we be safe?

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.970
BRENO DE MEDEIROS:
It actually depends

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.010
a lot on the type of
encryption that was used.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.720
For instance, when you have
encryption or hashing that

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.530
doesn't involve salts,
then techniques,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.730
such as Rainbow Tables, which
is a highly parallelizable

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.980
technique so attackers can, for
instance, run jobs in any cloud

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.710
service and crack a very large
percentage of the database,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.592
given some amount of time.

00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:47.050
TIM BRAY: This is
really bad stuff.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.730
And many of the people who
listen to the GDL series here

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.484
are app developers themselves.

00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:54.900
So what can we
tell app developers

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.390
to avoid them
being the next news

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.639
story about their passwords
having been dumped?

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.680
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: Right.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.060
As an app developer,
you're worried

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.434
about the reputation
of your app.

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:05.160
You're worried
about losing users

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.960
once they can't
recover account stuff

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.360
during an event like this.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.470
And if you can't afford
to invest this security

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.625
effort to protect your
password database,

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.980
it's better to not be in the
business of having passwords

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.390
to start with and managing them.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.022
TIM BRAY: Roughly
speaking, give me

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:27.730
a rough idea of the
scale at which Google

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.370
does this kind of work
at protecting them.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.160
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: Google has
a fairly large security team.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.350
We are talking about
hundreds of people,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.760
considering not only the
core of the security team

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.490
but also embedded security
people in other teams.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.090
And also, many of them are
well-known professionals

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.980
that had a reputation
established

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.280
before they joined Google.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.570
The security
community is growing,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.600
but it's a skill that
is in short supply.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.477
TIM BRAY: Right.

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:03.310
And let's be honest.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.930
My opinion is that in the case
of the big internet companies,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.530
most of them are pretty good.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.400
Facebook, to be honest,
is really quite good.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.840
So if I'm going to do that, get
out of the password business

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.860
and rely on Google or Facebook
or Twitter or Microsoft

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.610
or whoever for that, that's a
pretty tough decision to take.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.890
I'm going to put my
eggs in their basket.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.190
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: Right.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.280
TIM BRAY: How do I get
comfortable with making

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.530
that kind of a decision?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.946
BRENO DE MEDEIROS:
I think it just

00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:35.420
starts with a realistic
assessment of how good a job

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.920
you can do in-house.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.460
I think it's very
easy to see the risks.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.480
What happens if
the system is down?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.070
Or what happens if the system
has been compromised itself?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.165
As opposed to understanding
your internal risks.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.540
Many people think that the
internet companies are divided

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.660
into the ones that know
that they have been hacked

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.460
and the ones that don't.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.875
And so do you really
have a good grasp on what

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.740
is happening, in terms of
security of environment?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.750
Can you assess the
risk correctly?

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.750
Can you assess the cost and
how often your system will not

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.320
be operational also?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.645
So you have to make a
cost-benefit analysis

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:26.750
with all the risks involved and
look at the operational records

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.680
of these companies and assess
it as any other technology

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.084
or outsource service
you might use.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:35.750
TIM BRAY: Right.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.830
Let me expand on one point
that Breno made there.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.371
He's talked about the companies
that know they've been hacked

00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:41.700
and the ones that don't.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.110
Two things from that.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.390
Even the best companies
get hacked sometimes.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.540
I sit here at Google, and I see
emails go by sometimes saying,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.410
oh, obscure cross-site scripting
vulnerability discovered

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.742
in line 8,035 of this file here.

00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:56.950
I guess the difference is
that at a place like Google

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.110
we have people whose
job it is to notice that

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.940
and to fix it when it happens.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.370
The thing that really
troubles me is not

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.070
so much the individual
site getting hacked

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.190
is when a popular web framework,
like Node.js or Rails, gets

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.270
hacked and has a
zero-day vulnerability,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.270
you're looking at 100,000
sites all of a sudden

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.040
being wide open to attack.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.469
So let me follow up.

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.260
Let me just emphasize
a point you just made

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.999
or get you to do that.

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.290
You said, well, you have to
do a cost-benefit analysis.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.831
It sounds like the
same kind of thing

00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:29.790
you do when you outsource
your financials or your HR.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.685
Is that really a good
way to think about it?

00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:34.185
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: I'm sure if
you outsource your financials

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:37.490
you are taking a set of
risks that would be different

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.620
if you kept them in-house.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.600
So yes, I would
say it's similar.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.530
In addition to the
cost-benefit ratio,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.700
you also need to look at
the realistic, like measures

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.810
of the benefit.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.300
Because you may have
additional benefits.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.860
You may reduce friction
on account sign up,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.820
and you might reduce
friction on login.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.580
Because if the users
come to your site

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.530
and they are already
logged in to an Identity

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.580
Provider, such as
Google or Facebook

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.230
or a common Identity
Provider, Microsoft,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.960
they will probably have
an easier time logging

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.650
into your site.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.020
And so you might see increased
measures of user engagement,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.720
of account creation
and user acquisition.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.380
In addition to the
standard cost-benefit ratio

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.250
of outsourcing some
technology, there

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.210
is potentially a
large untapped benefit

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.644
that you are missing out on.

00:07:31.644 --> 00:07:32.560
TIM BRAY: Fair enough.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.180
That's a good point.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.263
Perhaps the most crucial
point in the relationship

00:07:35.263 --> 00:07:37.729
between your app and
a user is that moment

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:39.020
when they first sign up, right?

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.340
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: Right.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.450
TIM BRAY: And
anything you can do

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.510
to reduce the friction of
getting somebody signed

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.246
up and on board is a
major business plus.

00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:47.620
And if you can do that and
reduce risk at the same time--

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.840
Now if you really must be
in the password business,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.880
if for some reason, regulatory
reasons or whatever,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.787
you must be in the
password business,

00:07:55.787 --> 00:07:58.120
there's a lot of good online
resources about how to hash

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.874
and how to crypt and
how to salt and so on.

00:08:02.874 --> 00:08:04.290
If you were going
to do this, what

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.900
would be your top couple
of recommendations?

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.949
I guess the first
one would be don't.

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:09.990
BRENO DE MEDEIROS: Right.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:15.000
I think the actual security
of implementing the password

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.170
system is, in some
sense, the easiest one

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.430
to get it right, because there
are good references online.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.600
The hardest thing to do
is the overall integrity

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.540
of your password operations.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.950
You are going to have to expose
the password verification

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.600
system eventually to
a login box somewhere.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.429
And then you have to worry about
your whole stack leading up

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:43.770
to the point where you contact
your password database to have

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.680
security in depth
so you can have

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.860
multiple roadblocks
to a developer

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.620
actually gaining administrative
control over your password

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.440
system and extracting
the password database.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.714
I think that's the hard
part, quite frankly.

00:08:59.714 --> 00:09:00.630
TIM BRAY: Fair enough.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.730
But our recommendation
would be don't do it.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.980
Get out of the
password business.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.600
Thank you for tuning in.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.142
Breno and I are both
pretty easy to find online.

00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:13.600
