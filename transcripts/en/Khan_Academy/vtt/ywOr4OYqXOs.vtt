00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.110
In the last offer--
in the last video,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.110
not the last offering.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.690
I guess it was a bit of both.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.480
We had completed our Series B.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.800
We had gone back to the till.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.050
Got another round of venture
capital funding.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.790
And we raised $10 million more
that's going to help us build

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.610
out the website and do some
marketing, and hire up some

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.720
more engineers and
other employees.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.810
And to do that we had to sell
one million shares.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.550
We essentially sold them
at $10 a share.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.475
And so after that offering,
well, our pre-money valuation

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:35.380
was $30 million and our
post-money is now $40 million.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.910
That's the value of our assets
as-- I mean, the website,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.560
that's kind of an arbitrary
valuation.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.880
And I've gotten a letter
asking, well, how

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.720
do you value that?

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.460
And that's a whole subject
for another playlist.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.180
And I will do that.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.670
I will do a whole playlist
on valuation, eventually.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.080
But, to get there, the first
thing to understand is just

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.870
the capital structure
and how capital

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.920
markets work in general.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.160
So that's what we're
doing here.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.020
But anyway, so after you got the
$10 million-- you had $30

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.230
million before, you get $10
million, your post-money is

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.190
$40 million.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.980
And we had to issue a million
extra shares to do it.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.760
So before the money we had three
million and now we have

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.180
four million shares.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.650
So let me draw what our balance
sheet looks like.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.560
So we had $1 million and then
we raised $10 million more.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.210
So if we look at the left-hand
side of our balance sheet, we

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:36.400
have $11 million in cash, and
we have our website and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.560
intellectual property.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.750
Maybe we have some
patents now.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.000
So you can say assets
of the firm.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.890
I guess you could say non-cash
assets, right?

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.140
That's cash.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.290
And some of them could be
intangibles, like branding.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.880
Or maybe we made some small
acquisitions of other people.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.700
And we'll do more videos on
actually the mechanics of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.610
acquisitions and all that.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.290
But you get the idea.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.570
These are all of the other
assets of the firm, whatever

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.930
they may be.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.450
And then on the equity side,
because we have no liability,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.880
so in this case assets will
be equal to equity.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.390
On the equity side of the
equation we just have four

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.640
million shares.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:23.330
1/4 went to the Series B guy,
1/4 went to the Series A guy.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.720
He had bought a million shares,
I think it was at

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.340
$7.50 a share.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.120
Then the angel investor had
given us a million shares at,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.990
and I think it was $5 a share,
that was the angel.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.100
And then there's me and my
buddies, we split the last,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.310
that first million
shares five ways.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.710
And if I wanted to draw my
sliver, I still have my

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.990
200,000 shares.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.440
And we could keep doing that.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.800
We could get a Series C
and a Series D that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.140
will keep us going.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.820
But let's say that a couple of
other people have decided to

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.550
sell socks on the internet.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.140
And we realize this
is becoming a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.480
very competitive space.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.850
And we really want to just
lay down the gauntlet.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.370
And make sure that ours is
the dominant player.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.230
Because we figure that whoever
gets the biggest market share

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.540
fastest, is going to become the
Amazon.com and everyone

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.630
else is going to turn into
these me-too players and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.560
they're all going to
go out of business.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.230
So size has benefits
in this situation.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.580
So we don't want to do these
piddly $10 million offerings

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.790
and $20 million offerings.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.840
We want to go big time.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.360
We say, you know what?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.310
We're going to expand our
company huge, we're going to

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.990
push marketing hard.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.580
And so we want to raise
a lot of money.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.390
Let's say-- let me make up a
number-- let's say we want to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.820
raise, I don't know, we want
to raise $50 million.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.730
$50 million to invest in
the business and do

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.700
some hard-core marketing.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.620
And it happens to be at a time--
let's say it's 1999.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.810
The stock market is
racing ahead.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.240
People would love to get in
on this kind of stuff.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.080
So we say hey, let's do an
initial public offering.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.640
And then that has
two benefits.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.390
One, we will be able to raise a
lot of money for the firm to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.990
invest in maybe building
distribution centers or the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.180
marketing that I talked about.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.060
And the other side benefit,
which we won't really talk

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.930
about much at the board meeting,
but all of these

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.140
people right now, they're all
holding these shares, right?

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.880
I have these 200,000 shares.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.019
This angel investor has
this million shares.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.000
And there's really not a lot
they can do with them, right?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.740
Maybe the angel investor, maybe
he had an expensive

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.960
divorce settlement and he has to
make some alimony payments

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.350
now, and he doesn't really
have the cash.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.380
He can't do anything with
these shares, right?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.560
Same thing with these VCs.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.740
These VCs are accountable
to their investors.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.750
And they can say-- like, this VC
can say oh, you know what?

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.310
I bought those shares at $7.50
per share, and then this guy

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.290
came and bought it at $10 per
share, so I already got a 33%

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.150
gain on my investment.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.630
But the investors aren't that
impressed by that, because

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.910
you're still holding
the shares.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.120
You can't really say they're
worth $10 until you actually

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.480
turned them into $10.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.670
Or you turn them into
actual cash.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.730
So, by doing an initial public
offering, all of a sudden all

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.630
of the players will
have liquidity.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.310
Which means they can
exchange what they

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.730
have, including myself.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.520
So they can exchange what they
have for actual cash

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.170
if they need to.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.150
So how does that work?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.296
So I would go to an investment
bank, although they've all

00:05:19.296 --> 00:05:21.680
turned into commercial
banks now.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.080
But we're talking in
a pre-2008 world.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.540
I would go to an investment
bank and I'd say-- or more

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.370
likely they would come to me
and say hey, you guys could

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.600
raise big money in the public
markets right now.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.030
Why don't you do an IPO?

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.400
And in a few seconds you'll
realize why they are

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.540
so keen to do it.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.650
And I say, sure.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.910
We can raise a lot of money.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.180
And also we'll be in the press,
so that'll be free

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.450
marketing in and of itself.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.900
So I say sure, do
all of the work.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.240
So what they'll do, is there
will be a lead underwriter.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.890
Let me write that down,
lead underwriter.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.060
And that's essentially the
person who does all of the

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.200
legal work.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.190
They're going to file documents
with the SEC that

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.370
describe the company.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.540
And they're going to
make models and

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.350
projections and all that.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.000
And then they're also going to
have people riding along with

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.260
them, other banks.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.310
And they're going to
form a syndicate.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.670
A syndicate is just a group of
banks that work together to

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.860
kind of handle a larger
transaction than any one of

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.970
them would be willing to
handle by themselves.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.230
And it kind of spreads the
risk amongst them.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.080
So the bottom line is what the
banks do, other than doing all

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.430
the legal work.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.030
They'll value the company and
then they'll go to all of

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.280
their clients.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.670
So all of the people who trade
through that bank, all of the

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.160
institutional clients, all of
the hedge funds that have

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.460
their prime brokerage accounts
at those banks.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.890
And just so you know, a prime
brokerage account is just like

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.510
a brokerage account, but
it's a brokerage

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.510
account for big guys.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.740
It's a brokerage account for
people managing $100 million

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.110
and not their E-Trade account.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.570
That's all a prime
brokerage is.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.540
And they'll go to these guys and
say hey, we have this hot

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.860
IPO issue, socks.com.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.380
And we've done our models,
and we think this is

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.320
a $5 billion market.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.680
We think that this company is
worth-- we think this company

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.350
is worth at least $100 million
in its current form.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.560
So once again realize, I mean,
even though we're kind of

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.700
doing something a little
different now, all of the

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.130
other things were essentially--
you could call

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.270
them private offerings.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.950
Or private placements
in some way.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.130
Essentially these were
private equity sales.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.710
And I know that word is used
a lot, private equity.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.570
And that's what venture capital
essentially is.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.520
Although normally when people
talk about private equity,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.870
they're not talking about
venture capital.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.510
And I'll do a whole other
video on that.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.210
But venture capital
fundamentally is private

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.030
equity, right?

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.670
Because these shares that you're
selling, they're not

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.280
traded on a public exchange
like the New York Stock

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.240
Exchange or the NASDAQ, or
something like that.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.010
So anyway, back to what
we were doing.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.466
These guys, these banks, they
go to their clients and say

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:50.310
hey, I have this
hot new issue.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.260
And they'll kind of
gauge sentiment.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.030
They'll talk to clients, they'll
talk to each other,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.630
and they say, oh you know
what the demand is.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.080
And they'll essentially come up
with some price, which is

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.860
essentially as a high a price
as-- they want do a high price

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.290
because obviously as a company,
I want to sell the

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.510
stock for as much as possible.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.550
But they don't want to do it
so high that the stock

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.250
doesn't trade up.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.570
Most banks, you want your
IPO to look like this.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.690
This is the first
day of trading,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.030
this is your IPO price.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.970
They want it to look like that,
so that in the future

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.960
when there's an IPO, people
get excited to get in it.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.000
If this IPO-- if the stock just
did this, if it started

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.560
collapsing, one, people
will lose

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.070
interest in IPOs in general.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.800
And then people will get
suspicious about this company.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.159
And I'll do a whole
video on that.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.049
So, how do the mechanics work?

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:40.580
Well, they'll say, hey, you want
to raise the $50 million,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.750
well you could do it
a couple ways.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:48.800
We say hey, we're willing to
issue another-- let me think

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.490
of the best way to explain--
we're willing to issue another

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.740
ten million shares, right?

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.040
And I'm not drawing
it proportionally.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.030
Let's say we're willing to
issue another ten million

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.100
shares, and this should be a
lot higher, because this is

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.560
four million right here.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.850
We're willing to issue a another
ten million shares,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.760
how much money can
we get for it?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.940
And let's see, these bankers
talking to essentially the

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.030
market, and talking
to each other.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.040
They say hey, we think we can
justify these guys, and we're

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.080
going to do it for a little
bit lower than they're

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.710
actually worth.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.980
But we think the market will buy
the fact that these guys

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:26.790
are worth, I don't know, let's
say they're worth $80 million

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.180
in their current incarnation,
right?

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.840
Which essentially says, before
we raise the money, we have

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.800
$80 million, we have four
million shares.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.590
So they're saying $20 a share.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.650
So if we go and issue another
ten million shares at $20 a

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:50.220
share, we'll actually
raise $200 million.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.830
Actually, for the sake of-- so I
don't have to edit my math--

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.650
let's say that's how much we
wanted to raise, $200 million.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.990
So essentially what these guys
will do, our board of

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.530
directors will issue
these new shares.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.160
And then this syndicate of
banks, led by the lead

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.870
underwriter will then sell it
to their brokerage clients.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.390
To mainly institutional
investors, but it might be

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.400
some favored rich guys.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.310
If it's not that favored of an
IPO, maybe you might get a

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.880
call as well.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.100
And they'll sell it
to all of them.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.360
And you say, why are
they doing that?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.980
Why are they doing all of this
work for the company, helping

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.330
them raise $200 million?

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.170
And they're going to the pain
of the legal work, and they

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.910
had to put a team of maybe
ten guys on this.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.120
And they had to make models,
and it probably took them

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.930
maybe two or three
months to do it.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.140
That's a lot of work,
what do they get in

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.880
exchange for all of this?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.080
Well they actually
get a commission.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.450
And that commission, at least
historically, has been 7% of

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.060
the offering.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.640
7% of the offering.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.090
And now you get a sense of why,
in a good market, when

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.070
you can do these things, why it
has, in history, paid to be

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.410
an investment banker.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.610
Because 7% of $200 million--
and frankly it's not a lot

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.120
more work to do a $200 million
offering than it is to do a

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.890
$20 million offering,
it's probably

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.220
about the same amount.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.030
But 7% of $200 million
is $14 million.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.090
So actually these guys aren't
going to see $200 million.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.010
They're going to see 200
minus 14 million.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.690
So they're going to
see $186 million.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:26.570
And then these bankers are going
to split $14 million.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.200
And that probably is about
two months of work

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.240
for maybe ten guys.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.980
So you can imagine-- and of
course they have the whole

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.590
bank that has the support, and
they have all these-- not

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.440
anyone could do this.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.910
You have to have what they
call retail distribution.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.590
You have to have kind of a
channel that you can plug

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.630
these shares into to
actually get rid of

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.860
the ten million shares.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.480
You see, it's a fairly
profitable business.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.220
So that's what an initial
public offering is.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.530
For the first time, a company
is selling shares to the

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.290
public, that is not just to
these private investors.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.090
And usually on an initial public
offering, although it's

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.770
not always the case, these
guys aren't selling their

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.600
shares as much as they
would like to.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.690
They're usually locked in for a
certain period, just because

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.770
it looks bad if, especially the
insiders-- those were the

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.450
founders of the company--
actually sell their shares.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.750
But six months later, then I
can go and sell my shares.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.130
Maybe if I do it on a small
amount, I can go and sell it

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.890
in the NASDAQ.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.590
And I have a publicly traded
price, so on any given day, I

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.650
know exactly what my
shares are worth.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.030
And this is an important
thing to realize.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.490
Because a lot of times when
people buy a stock they're

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.110
like, oh, I've invested
in that company.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.280
Well, kind of.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.000
When you normally buy a stock
on an exchange, as the New

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.470
York Stock Exchange, you're
just buying the stock from

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.240
somebody else.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.940
You're not buying the stock
from that company.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.070
So when you pay $100 for an IBM
stock-- I've run out of

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.490
space, that's why I'm just
talking and not drawing, let

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.110
me erase this.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.500
I've run out of time, too.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.910
But I think this is an
important point.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.050
When you buy stock from someone
else-- so if I give my

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:03.240
$100 and I get a stock
certificate of IBM, most of

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.700
the time, if I were to do this
today, I'm just-- this is me,

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.220
with a mustache-- I'm just
getting it from some other

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.680
dude, right?

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.970
Well maybe he's happy
because he got $100.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.980
He's got a top-hat.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.850
And this is what happens in the
stock market every day.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.660
So when I buy that, I'm not
really investing in IBM.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.290
I'm just buying the money--
I'm just buying that share

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.790
from another guy.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.960
We're just exchanging shares.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:36.520
In an IPO, if I'm one of the IPO
investors-- this is me--

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.090
my $100 in this situation--
let's see we're

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.090
dealing with socks.com.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.490
Maybe that's it's ticker
symbol, SOCK.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.370
This time it's actually
going to the company.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.970
It's actually going to the-- or
the website, in this case.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.670
Of course 7% is being
re-directed to

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.330
the investment bankers.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.600
So when you buying from and IPO
you really are, to some

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.710
degree, making an investment.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.160
Just like if you were doing
a venture capital.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.950
You really are making an
investment in a company.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.960
Your money will then be used by
the company to hire people

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.250
and build factories
and make out a

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.590
website and do marketing.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.610
In this case, you're essentially
just trading

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.560
shares in a secondary market.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.880
Secondary market just means
that it's not going to the

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.600
actual company.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.940
It's just going to another
shareholder who bought it

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.070
before you.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.460
Anyway, I've really gone
over my time limit.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.710
So I'll see you in
the next video.
