00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.190
More people are diagnosed with skin cancer
in the US than any other cancer combined.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.430
In fact, melanoma--a highly dangerous type
of skin cancer--is estimated to claim one

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.870
life every hour.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.759
So what if you could lower your risk of skin
cancer….by changing the color of your skin?

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.760
Ok, this is a big subject, so let’s start
with the science.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.040
Everyone has something in their skin called
melanin, a biological pigment that gives us

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.150
the color of our skin, hair, and eyes.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.671
The cells in our epidermis that make this
pigment are called melanocytes, and everyone

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.960
has the same number of them, but everyone’s
melanocytes make different amounts of melanin,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.400
and different kinds.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.070
Melanin serves a few very important purposes
besides giving your skin its color.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.021
When you’re outside, your skin is being
exposed to the ultraviolet rays of the sun.

00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.750
UV radiation is just that--radiation--and
prolonged exposure can damage the DNA of your

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.750
skin cells.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.430
With enough damage, that DNA can start to
malfunction and the life cycle of your skin

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.730
cells is disrupted, potentially causing uncontrolled
replication and leading to cancerous growths.Your

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.940
body’s lookin’ out for you though, and
has a couple of defense mechanisms in place--one

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.280
of which is...your melanocytes.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.630
Inside your melanocytes are little melanin-producing
factories called melanosomes.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.160
If the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the
cell, the melanosome is the powerhouse of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.200
the melanocyte.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.470
And there are two kinds of melanin produced
by these melanosomes--eumelanin, a darker

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.390
pigment, and pheomelanin, a light-colored
pigment.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.520
Eumelanin blocks UV photons from damaging
the skin, so those without a lot of it--people

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.470
with lighter skin--are at higher risk of sun
damage.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.979
So when your skin is exposed to more sun,
your melanocytes are ‘turned on’ to produce

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.130
more of this UV-blocking melanin to protect
your cells.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.080
How much melanin--and which kind--your skin
makes is controlled by your genes.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.210
That’s why some people’s skin tone deepens--or
is making more melanin--when exposed to sunlight.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.430
Others can’t produce more than a certain
amount of melanin, and so find their skin

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.210
exposed to more damage...resulting in sunburn!

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.340
So, more melanin equals darker skin tone and
equals more protection from the sun’s harmful

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.340
rays.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.670
The big takeaway from all this detail is that
those with more melanin, particularly eumelanin,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.500
are at decreased risk for skin cancer.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.750
And now, researchers have explored how that
level of protection can be artificially induced

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.920
for those who don’t have it naturally.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.350
It turns out that the melanosomes that produce
the two different types of melanin have different

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.599
pHs, and remember the melanosome is that little
pigment making machine inside your melanocytes.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.750
Eumelanin, the dark, highly protective pigment,
is produced by melanosomes that are less acidic

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.590
than the melanosomes that produce pheomelanin.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.560
So researchers have posited--and now shown--that
they can actually change the relative amounts

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.420
of which kind of melanin your melanosomes
produce.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.770
Inhibiting a certain enzyme, called sAC, can
make melanosome pH less acidic and allows

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.180
those cells to produce more eumelanin--meaning
darker pigmentation and increased protection

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.260
from skin cancer.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.290
We’re still not exactly sure why pH influences
what kind of melanin your melanosomes produce,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.760
and this is an area that researchers are hoping
to explore further.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.849
It’s important to note that this is different
from regulating melanin production by changing

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.209
the way your genes are expressed, it’s not
genetic editing.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.930
This new research could instead result in
a pharmaceutical drug that induces pigment

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.760
production-- potentially for use by populations
vulnerable to skin cancer, or those with pigmentation

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.380
conditions that they’d like to treat.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.830
This is still in the very early stages though,
being tested in mice and human skin cells

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.830
in petri dishes.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.019
It’s a long way away from practical applications
in humans.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.250
Ok, so the science is super cool.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.870
But the color of someone's skin has been something
that defines and often divides humans for

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.870
millennia.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.879
So if it becomes possible for us to change
that color in a very fundamental way for medical

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.319
purposes, what does that mean for our conception
of things like race?

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.210
Would its use be ethical?

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.790
The authors of the study note at the very
top of their research that skin pigmentation

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.540
has not only health implications, but also
very important psychosocial ones- a reminder

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.530
that science doesn’t happen in a vacuum
and its results and takeaways go out into

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.650
an imperfect world...and that’s something
we need to consider.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.330
What do you think about this research?

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.519
news.

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.519
And, fun fact!

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.360
The scientific word for sunburn is erythema
solare.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.909
Thanks for watching.
