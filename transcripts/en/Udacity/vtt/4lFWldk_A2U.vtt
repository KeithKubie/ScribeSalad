00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.150
Now that we have a better idea
of what makes up Sunshine,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.920
let's talk about the ideal state
where a production-quality

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.490
Android app should be.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.350
While it's easy to immediately dive into
the minutiae, let's take a step back and

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.860
look at the big picture.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.260
What are the goals of
an amazing Android app?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.870
It actually starts with create
a vision for all of Android.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.320
Create a vision for Android.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.160
And all Android apps
have three main pillars.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.030
Enchant Me, Simplify My Life,
and Make Me Amazing.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.720
Enchant Me revolves around the idea
that your app should both look and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.170
act effortlessly,
through well-placed animations and

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.970
a feeling that the app was designed
specifically for the user.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.970
Simplify My Life involves making
the app easy to understand.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.570
Whether it's for a new user just trying
to figure out what exactly your app

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.590
does, or a returning user,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.660
where you're trying to make the
experience as frictionless as possible.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.920
Make Me Amazing is about leveraging the
strengths of Android to build apps that

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.670
contribute to building a whole
greater than the sum of its parts.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.519
Integrating into one another, and
extending beyond a single entry point

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.820
app, you need to remember to
launch to get any benefit.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.480
Many of these concepts
shouldn't be foreign to you.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.660
Making a great experience for

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.610
users should always be in
the forefront of your thoughts.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.290
Let's take a look at Sunshine to see
exactly where we are with each of these.
