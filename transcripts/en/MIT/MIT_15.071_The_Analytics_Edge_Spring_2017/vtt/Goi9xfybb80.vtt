00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.880
Let us introduce
the method we use

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.080
for predicting
the bucket number.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.500
It is called-- it is a
method called classification

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.530
and regression trees.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.090
In this case, we use
multi-class classification.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.120
There are five classes,
buckets one to five.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.320
To give you an example,
let us consider

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.490
patients that have two
types of diagnosis:

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.280
coronary artery
disease and diabetes.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.180
So if a patient does not have
a coronary artery disease,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.200
we'd classify the
patient as bucket one.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.480
If it has coronary
artery disease,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.350
then we check whether the
person has diabetes or doesn't

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.470
have diabetes.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.400
If it has diabetes, then it's
bucket five, very high risk.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.160
And if it doesn't have
diabetes, but given

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.380
it has coronary
artery disease, it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.250
is classified as bucket three.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.860
So this is an example in which
we only have two diagnoses

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.970
and we will state
how the method works.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.880
In the application of Hawkeye,
the most important factors

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.090
were related to cost
in the beginning.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.970
So in the beginning,
the classification tree

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.680
involved divisions
based on cost.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.990
For example, if the patient
had paid less than $4,000--

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.560
so this is bucket one
classification-- if it paid

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.320
more than $4,000,
then we further

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.250
investigate whether the
patient pays less than $40,000

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.940
or more than $40,000
and so forth.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.820
As the tree grows, then
the secondary factor

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.570
is utilized later in
the classification tree

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.720
involve various
chronic illnesses

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.229
and some of the medical
roles we discussed earlier.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.700
For example, whether
or not the patient

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.040
has asthma and
depression or not.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.500
If it has asthma and depression,
then it's bucket five.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.740
If it doesn't, then we
consider a particular indicator

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.440
indicating hylan
injection, which

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.990
is an indication
of a possible knee

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.770
replacement or arthroscopy.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.850
So if this indicator is equal
to 1, then it's bucket three.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.000
If it's indicator is equal
to 0, it's not present,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.660
then it's bucket one.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.320
So let us give some
examples of bucket five.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.270
So an example is as follows.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.680
The patient is
under 35 years old,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.540
he has between 3,300 and 3,900
in claims, coronary artery

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.410
disease as a diagnosis, but no
office visits in the last year.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.960
Another example of a
category of a patient that

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.680
is classified as
bucket five are claims

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.180
between $3,900 and $43,000
with at least $8,000

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.010
paid in the last 12 months,
$4,300 in pharmacy claims,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.030
and acute cost profile
in cancer diagnosis.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.480
And another final example is
more than $58,000 in claims,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.260
but at least $50,000 paid
in the last 12 months,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.290
but not an accurate profile.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.079
Classification trees
have the major advantage

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.030
as being interpretable
by the physicians who

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.210
observe them and judge them.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.970
In other words, people
were able to identify

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.250
these cases as reasonable.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.590
In other words,
the human intuition

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.990
agreed with the output
of the analytics model.
