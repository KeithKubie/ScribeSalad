SPEAKER: I'm just so honored
and privileged to introduce

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.930
Betty Soskin.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.500
BETTY SOSKIN: Thank
you very much.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.074
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.074 --> 00:00:14.910
Thank you, [? Anna. ?] Hello.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:30.510
When I first came into the
parks, I actually-- well,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.120
I guess where I wanted
to start is with a film.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.120
You can imagine the
kind of challenge

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.510
that women faced
by our filmmakers

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.490
when they were asked
to do the orientation

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.260
film for our park, which
represented probably

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.130
the greatest
mobilization of workers

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.930
since the building
of the pyramids

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.460
or the Great Wall of China.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.205
This was Franklin Delano
Roosevelt's great Arsenal

00:00:58.205 --> 00:00:59.820
of Democracy.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.390
And every man, woman,
and child in the country

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.629
was involved in some capacity.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.980
They say it took
seven people at home

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.970
to support each life on the
home front, on the battlefields.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.340
So our filmmakers,
though consigned

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.630
to coming up with a
15 or 20 minute film,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.570
decided for us that
they would not do that.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.480
What they did was they
did two complete films,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.320
one 24 minutes that tells the
story of the national effort

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.270
across the country.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.160
Because, of course,
we're not a local park.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.840
We're a national park.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.980
And that film is called
"The War at Home,"

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.420
and it's a 24-minute film.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.980
And then they did a number
of fragments of films

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.860
because there were so many
aspects to that homefront story

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.150
that there was no
way to deal with it.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.590
There was a story of 120,000
Japanese and Japanese-Americans

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.450
interned, lost two and a
half years of their lives,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.460
and much of their
treasure; the story

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.880
of African-American migration
out of the Southern states;

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.610
the story of
women's emancipation

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.000
into nontraditional labor
for the very first time;

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.130
story of that great
explosion at Port Chicago,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.460
which vaporized two Kaiser
ships to the loss of 320

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.740
men, 202 of them being
black dock workers.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.590
There were so many
stories so that they

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.050
did fragments of
films that we could

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.530
use as conversation starters.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.770
But the one that
I use because I'm

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.730
in the theater three
to five times a week,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.240
and I'm there using a film that
limits itself to telling just

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.746
what happened in the city
of Richmond, because that's

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:43.120
the only part of
the story that I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.953
could talk about with
any kind of authority.

00:02:44.953 --> 00:02:46.980
Because that's the
history that I lived.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.590
I was a 20-year-old
clerk working

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.550
in a Jim Crow segregated union
hall in the middle of Richmond.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.500
And the story that this
tells-- this film tells--

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.110
is about that city during
those years of 1942 to 1945.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.410
So after the film is
over, I'll put my life

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.510
into context of that
history for you.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.050
As the credits
roll, you're going

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.960
to find my name among the
consultants to the filmmakers.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.360
Of course, the reason
that that list is so long

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.460
is because everybody
on the staff

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.730
was a consultant
to the filmmakers.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.570
And not only that,
but I didn't have

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.130
any idea what a consultant
to a filmmaker was or did.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.640
So there was no
way for me to get

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.740
a sense of what this finished
product was going to be.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.170
All I knew was that over a
two and a half or three year

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.610
period, every now and then,
we'd get a block of text

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.182
to be wordsmithed.

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:48.140
Or we'd get stills from
the Library of Congress

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.320
or the National Archives.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.790
And I'd say, OK.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.380
But I was really
in over my head.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.590
I had no idea what this finished
product was going to be.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.060
And when it was finally
released to us, just

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.280
before the opening of
the visitor's center

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.340
and I saw it for
the first time, it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.910
may interest you to know
that I was disappointed.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.090
I didn't like it at all, partly
because the history as I had

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.680
lived it was nowhere in sight.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.340
I was really here.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.029
I was here as a
20-year-old clerk, working

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.880
in a Jim Crow segregated
union hall, somewhere

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.570
in the middle of Richmond,
in a temporary building

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.900
because the unions,
the labor movement,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.960
wasn't yet racially
integrated and wouldn't

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.920
be for another decade.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.810
So that in order to comply
with the wishes of Kaiser,

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.290
the unions had created
auxiliaries which

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.340
was a fancy name for Jim Crow.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.060
There was one at
Marinship at Sausalito.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.080
There was another
in West Oakland.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.840
There was a third in
Richmond, and that

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.130
was Boilermakers Auxiliary 36.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.720
And that's where
I spent my days.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.250
You you'd asked me, I'd
have told you at the time

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.480
that all the shipyard
workers were black.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.160
Because the only
people I saw where

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.690
the people that came to my
window to get their addresses

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.340
changed on three
by five [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.540
cards, which is what
I was doing to save

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.020
the world for democracy.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.480
And as you can see, it worked.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.285
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.250
But I was nowhere
near the shoreline,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.195
nowhere near a shipyard.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.830
I never saw a ship
under construction.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.270
Nor did I ever see a
ship being launched.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.055
That entire history
had been lost to me.

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:35.090
I came in every day in a
carpool, went home every night,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.790
having no sense of that
bigger picture at all.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.010
If you had known me
two years before then,

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.610
you'd have known little
Betty [? Charbonet ?],

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.490
who was a little Cajun-Creole
child who'd come out

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.290
from New Orleans in 1927.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.760
That was the year that the
city fathers in New Orleans

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.080
had chosen to bomb the levees
against the rising Mississippi

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.760
to save St. Charles Avenue and
upper-- the Garden District.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.450
And they sacrificed the seventh
and ninth wards and the Treme,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.530
which was our ancestral home.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.610
In that year, my mother had
arrived at 6th Street Station

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.270
in Oakland with three
little girls and everything

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.210
we had left in a couple
of cardboard suitcases

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.990
to join Papa George Allen.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.890
This was her father.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.010
He had already come.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.620
He was out here since
the First World War

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.490
and was working as a waiter in
downtown Oakland on Clay Street

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.380
and living on 76th Avenue in
a little shotgun bungalow that

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.315
was shared with my mother's
two brothers and a sister,

00:06:42.315 --> 00:06:45.980
and Aunt Louise, who was
his third wife that we were

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.530
no longer calling grandmother.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.260
She was Aunt Louise.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.600
And we would wait
there for my father

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.750
who would join us in
a couple of months

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.270
when things were
settled in New Orleans.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.320
And I would spend my childhood
and my adolescence in Oakland,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.450
East Oakland, as a child of the
service workers' generation.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.240
Our fathers and our
uncles were the red caps,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.710
and the poor importers, and
the waiters, and the cooks,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.400
and the janitors,
and the laborers.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.140
Our mothers were $0.50 an
hour domestic servants,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.610
taking care of white
people-- children and white

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.380
people's homes, because
that's who we were as a nation

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.980
in those years.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.130
I graduated from
Castlemont High School

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.442
with only two opportunities
for employment open to me.

00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:38.900
I could have worked
in agriculture,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.096
or I could have worked
as a domestic servant.

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:46.160
My older sister Marjorie, who
was a beautiful young woman

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.110
and a talented
artist incidentally,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.580
spent the first five
years of her marriage

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.680
as half of a domestic team.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.210
Her young husband
was the chauffeur,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.490
and Marjorie was the housekeeper
for a family in Piedmont.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.620
And by living on the premises
with Thursdays off, which

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.940
was traditional, they
could save every penny

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.440
they earned for the down
payment on their first home.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.020
And this was a
traditional pathway

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.110
into the middle class
for African Americans.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.490
This is what my life
would have been.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.440
This was the prescription,
except that there

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.340
was a third choice.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.740
And it was the one I
was wise enough to take.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.010
I married Mel Reid whose
family had made their way out

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.350
from Griffin, Georgia at the
first cannon shots of the Civil

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.539
War.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.799
And Mel, his father,
and his grandmother

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.450
were all born in Berkeley
General Hospital.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.530
And in 1942, Mel was
in his senior year

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.760
at the University
of San Francisco,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.730
playing left half back
for San Francisco Dons.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.740
And what 19-year-old
wouldn't prefer that?

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.130
Which is what I did.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.950
So I escaped the life
that my sister had left.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.490
But I share that
history with you

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.010
in order to
illustrate that being

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:14.360
a clerk even in a Jim Crow
segregated union hall in 1942

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.060
was a step up.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.390
My folks were proud of me.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.500
I was being a clerk.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.630
I wasn't taking care
of white people's homes

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.962
or white people's children.

00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:28.200
I was a clerk,
which in 1942, would

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.610
have been the equivalent
of today's young women

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.260
of color being the first in
her family to enter college.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.950
Because that's who we were as
a nation back in those years.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.460
Now, scroll ahead with
me to 15 years ago.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.420
And 15 years ago, I'm
back in Richmond, back

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:54.010
after over 20 years as
a suburban housewife,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:10:00.000
after raising four
children to adulthood,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.330
after outliving two husbands,
and after lots and lots

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:11.860
of decades of learning
lots of lessons.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:17.720
And now by 15 years ago,
I'm pretty sophisticated.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.070
And I'm back in Richmond this
time as a field representative.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.940
Remember the California
State Assembly?

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.440
I'm working with Dion Aroner.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.340
And when Dion term
limited out, I

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.630
stayed on as a
field representative

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.690
for her successor,
Lonnie Hancock,

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:41.290
whose only now term limiting out
of the California State Senate.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.710
I'm in a one person
satellite office in Richmond

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.410
and doing constituency work.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.060
And with the rest
of field staff,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.000
I'm helping to determine
what kind of legislation

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.670
might be needed out of the five
cities of West Contra Costa

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.505
County over which my office sat.

00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:00.880
And if you're
wondering whether I

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.010
became a genius between the
time I was 20 and 15 years ago,

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.200
may I quickly assure you that
that's anything but true.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.180
This was not a case of
personal achievement,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.740
not for one minute.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.460
Nor is it a case
of black history

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.240
to be remembered as such.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.300
That arc of my life
from 20 to 15 years

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:32.060
ago illustrates how much social
change occurred in this nation

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.190
over those intervening years.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.560
And that's something
that we all did,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.770
all of us, black
and brown and yellow

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.360
and straight and gay and trans.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.940
It's what we all did,
all of us, all of us.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.980
Some of us did it kicking
and screaming, and some of us

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.310
are still kicking and screaming.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.790
And all of us didn't get
there at the same time,

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.490
not by a long shot.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.670
But enough of us completed
that complete arc

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.480
that my life so well represents.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.350
To this day, social
change initiated

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:17.880
in those years
between 1942 and 1945,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.400
that exhilaration
of social change,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.620
continues to radiate
out of the Bay Area

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.000
into the rest of
the nation, which is

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.900
enough to build a park around.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.170
Now, it didn't mean that
we all got there together

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.980
or that some of us
didn't freeze in place.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.575
A lot of us froze on issues.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.170
Open housing took a
lot of folks not ready

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.990
to have their families
living with the family that

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.174
didn't look just like
theirs right next door,

00:12:52.174 --> 00:12:55.940
you know, worried
about property values.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.040
And then more of us peeled
off on the decision of "Brown

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.640
v. the Board of Education."

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.590
Why should my children
be bussed across town

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.090
to suit your social agenda?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.600
And then more of us, either
because they had forgotten

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:21.190
or had never known, that it
took $47.25 a week to support

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:28.900
a family of five if you
were white-- our fathers

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.290
and our uncles were all
members of the service workers'

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:37.650
generation, and they
earned $25 to $35 a week.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.510
Pullman porters earned
$18 a week plus tips.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.150
And that's what initiated
the first thoughts

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.500
of affirmative action.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.720
It was never a case of quotas.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.710
This is what we're doing.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:06.080
Now, long about 1970,
maybe just before that,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.120
there began to rise in the
Department of Interior,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.730
in the National Park Service,
a sensitivity to the fact

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:21.390
that though every single
taxpayer in the country

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.030
was funding the creation,
the development,

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.050
and the maintenance of
this incredible system

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.110
of national parks.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:35.340
It was only the people
with the leisure time

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.630
and the financial
resources who could afford

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:44.620
to visit them, only that.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.700
And they began to see
the need for urban parks,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.790
taking parks to the people.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.010
And in the city of
Richmond had come

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.840
into being one of
those urban parks.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.320
And the planners
were gathered here

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.890
to determine the shape of that
park, because each of them

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.080
was made of whole
qualths-- each of them

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:15.150
had to be designed
without patterns to go by.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:20.100
This park had been
created, legislation

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.560
carried by George
Miller, supported

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.270
by Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:34.220
had come into being defined
by scattered sites that

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.740
lay throughout the
city of Richmond, sites

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.170
that we either owned
privately, commercially,

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.750
by nonprofits, civically.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.930
We would own nothing.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.530
How do you create a park
without any federal lands?

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.817
And that's what we
were being asked to do.

00:15:54.817 --> 00:15:56.400
How do you create a
national park that

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.842
doesn't have any boundaries?

00:15:57.842 --> 00:15:59.300
The only one that
vaguely resembled

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.570
it may have been the one
in Lowell, Massachusetts.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.840
But in that case, the
federal government

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.250
had gone in, purchased
the textile mills,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.830
transformed them into
arts and cultural centers.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.530
And over time, the entire
city of Lowell, Massachusetts

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.690
became a national park.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.690
That's one model.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:25.410
And here, with the planners
gathered here, in my district,

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:31.010
in an area where I was not
even aware of a national park,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.920
though my office-- that
little satellite office--

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.160
was less than a mile
from the Rosie Memorial.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.500
But it had not occurred
to me to ever connect

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.490
to visit the Rosie
Memorial because that

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.600
was a white woman's story.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.000
The women in my family had been
working outside their homes

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
since slavery, because it
had always taken two wages

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.630
to support black families.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.109
So I didn't see
any relationship.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.099
That was a white woman's story.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.609
But when the community
meetings began

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:15.640
to be organized because those
owners of those properties

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.099
had to be met with-- the
community had to be met with--

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.980
to make those decisions along
with the planners of what shape

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.420
this park was going to take.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.950
And this was when I met
the national parks, based

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:37.210
on my first PowerPoint, where
I saw for the first time

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.790
that incredible, incredible
building, the Ford Assembly

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.120
Plant that was designed
by Albert Kahn,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.620
built between the
years of 1929 and 1931,

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.250
to assemble Model A Fords.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.980
It was taken over during
the war and turned out

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.590
thousands and thousands
of tanks and jeeps

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.160
for the war in the Pacific.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.190
But that building
had been constructed

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.960
on state-owned land--
built on air rights, one

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.110
of the earliest that
used that concept.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.510
And I'm the only one in the
room that represented the state,

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.520
and therefore incorporated,
at first informally

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.910
as a consultant, but
I'm the only person

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:30.290
of color in the room
and the only person

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.870
who can look at the PowerPoint
and instantly see them

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.660
as sites of racial segregation.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.210
Because what gets
remembered is determined

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.980
by who's in the room
during the remembering.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.110
There was no grand conspiracy
to leave my history out.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.480
There simply wasn't
anybody in that room who

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.700
had any reason to know that.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.880
Unfortunately, for all of
us, all of those planners

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.850
were graduates of
"Sesame Street."

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.530
And in my pantheon of
civil rights leaders,

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:08.760
there had always been
a place for Jim Henson

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.490
and his children's television
workship and Mr. Rogers.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.300
Because they spent
several decades

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.310
humanizing America's children.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.830
And by 15 years ago, those
kids were all grown up.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.480
And by then, they're sitting
around corporate boardrooms

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.380
throughout the country.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.460
They're in the forestry service.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.910
They're in the State Department.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.830
They're in the
national parks service,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.190
Department of Interior.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.110
Now they're in Microsoft,
and Apple, and Google.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.829
And they all knew it
wasn't easy being green,

00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:47.370
and they knew that one of these
things is not like the other,

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.540
and it doesn't matter one bit.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.780
And they were not only
willing but anxious

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.670
to know what was missing
in their PowerPoint.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.760
And for the first time since
I was that 20-year-old clerk

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.180
working in that Jim Crow
segregated union hall,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.165
I'm in a position to learn
the rest of this story.

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:09.880
It was a marriage
made to heaven.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.610
I read everything I
could about Mr. Kaiser.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.430
The studies-- the
doctoral theses,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:25.300
the master's papers-- were
just beginning to come out.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.470
The University of California,
Dr. Spivik, Professor

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.360
[? Litvak, ?]
Margaret Archibald,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.930
they were just beginning to
come out and available to us.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.380
And I could, for the first time,
learn about Mr. Henry Kaiser,

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.880
and immediately fell in love.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.630
I mean, here was a man
that dropped out of school

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.980
at the age of 13, only had
an eighth grade education,

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.580
came into Richmond as
a cement contractor

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.445
who had never built a ship.

00:20:54.445 --> 00:20:58.680
He had to go to the library
to find out how you do that.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.680
He was a man who had such
confidence in himself

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.780
that he knew that if he simply
introduced the mass production

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.700
techniques that Henry Ford was
using in auto manufacturing

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.340
that he could revolutionize
ship building.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.444
All he needed was enough hands.

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:19.110
And he didn't care
what color they were,

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.500
and he didn't care who
they were attached to.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.900
He just need enough hands.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.370
And nothing I ever
read about him

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.090
would have suggested to me
that he was a social reformer,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.460
not by any long shot.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.770
He was simply a
smart industrialist.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.470
He knew not only
that, but he knew

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.080
where the greatest
pool of available labor

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.640
existed in this country,
in the five southern states

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.790
of Mississippi, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Texas,

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.260
and Louisiana, whites coming
off the Dust Bowl, blacks

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.150
recovering from the slow
mechanization of cotton--

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.480
everybody bouncing from the
Great Depression of the '30s.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.310
Possible for a black
man to be standing

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.280
on the sidewalk in
Jackson, Mississippi,

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.290
where Southern tradition
would demand that he step off

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.580
into the gutter if a
white person approached,

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.360
and that man could be
tapped on the shoulder

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.320
by a Kaiser recruiter
and find himself,

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.720
two weeks later, in
the city of Richmond,

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.860
riding in the front of the
bus 10 years before Rosa Parks

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.750
would refuse to give up her
seat in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:32.960
Into a city with a
population of 23,000, only

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.610
Henry Kaiser would
have the audacity

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.780
to bring in a
workforce of 98,000

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.670
black and white
Southerners who were not

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.200
going to be sharing drinking
fountains, schools, hospitals,

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.970
housing, any kind of public
accommodations for another 20

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.000
years back in their
places of origin.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.650
That's not going to
happen until the '60s.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.390
We're talking 1942.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.330
And there's no time for focus
groups and diversity training.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.050
They've got to cut it.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:13.250
They've got to negotiate at
the individual level every day

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.930
in order to get through it
without killing each other.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.120
These are black and
white Southerners.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.810
And because they're all
living under the common threat

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.540
of fascist world
domination, there's

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.330
no time to take on a broken
social system, no time

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.040
to do anything except take on
the mission of their leader,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.030
which is pure and simple-- build
ships faster than the enemy can

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.470
sink them.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.920
And together,
together, behind a man

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.790
who referred to the bow of
the ship as the pointy end--

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:54.190
you've got to love
Mr. Kaiser-- they

00:23:54.190 --> 00:24:00.320
completed 747 ships in three
years and eight months.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.140
747 ships.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.080
By way of comparison, Mr.
Moore at Moore Dry Dock, who

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.270
was a traditional ship builder,
had been building ships

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.712
since the First World War,
Mr. Moore completed 100.

00:24:15.712 --> 00:24:19.910
Bechtel Corporation
completed 93 at Marinship.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.530
And Henry Kaiser and his
merry band of sharecroppers

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.310
completed 747 ships
and right here

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:32.190
in San Francisco Bay
outside of Richmond.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.906
They helped to turn
the course of the war

00:24:33.906 --> 00:24:36.530
around by out-producing
the enemy.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:42.860
And in the process, they
accelerated the rate

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.170
of social change
so that to this day

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.530
it's still radiates
out of the Bay Area

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.150
into the rest of the nation.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.300
This is still where
the visionaries

00:24:54.300 --> 00:25:00.670
come define constituencies
for their wildest dreams

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.994
because of what
happened right here.

00:25:04.994 --> 00:25:05.910
That's rather amazing.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.830
They say if you'd dropped
a quarter on the deck

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.640
at that time, it would
be welded into place

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.422
before you could pick it up.

00:25:16.422 --> 00:25:18.346
[CHUCKLING]

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.970
It began to occur
to me along the way

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.500
that if we had a place on
the planet where we could

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.670
go back and revisit that era,
not by the myth that we made up

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.390
about it-- you know, none of
that Greatest Generation stuff

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.990
or today's American
exceptionalism--

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.760
but if we could go back and
revisit that era in truth,

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:46.430
as it was lived by those of us
who lived it, what we could get

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:53.590
is a baseline against which
to measure how far we've come.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.650
But we have to know
where we started.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:01.350
We have to know in order to
find out how far we've come.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:06.360
And that became my reason
for becoming a park ranger

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.440
at the age of 85.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.770
Because that history was so
important and so forgotten.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.580
It is so important that
today's generations know,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.020
because we still have
a long way to go.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.680
But we have to
know-- and in knowing

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.700
is the hope for the future.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.580
And I like to end my talks
giving you my personal history,

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.710
which is rather remarkable,
if only because it

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.150
was lived by so many.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.330
It's not mine alone.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.160
But my great-grandmother, Leon
[? Teanbro ?] [? Allen, ?] was

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.850
born into slavery in 1846 in
St. James Parish, Louisiana.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.792
Enslaved until she
was 19, at which time

00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:53.750
she was freed by the
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.700
Mary George [? Allen, ?] who
was a corporal in the Louisiana

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.340
State Colored Troops, fighting
on the side of the North

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.800
in the civil war,
together over time,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.850
they brought into
the world 13 children

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.625
in their home in
St. James Parish.

00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:17.790
My mother was born to
their eldest son George

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:22.570
and his 14-year-old wife who
only lived until my mother was

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.480
seven months old.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.370
But my great-grandmother
lived to be 102,

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:32.860
dying in 1948, three years after
my experience in that Jim Crow

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.440
union hall.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:42.360
My mother was born in 1894
and died at 101 in 1995.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:48.865
And I was born in 1921 and
will celebrate my 95th birthday

00:27:48.865 --> 00:27:52.000
in another 10 days.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.910
And that means that
the three of us

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.710
were all adults
at the same time.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.270
I was 27 years old,
married and a mother,

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.920
by the time my
slave ancestor died.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.160
I knew her as a
matriarch of my family.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.680
And all of that American
history-- from the Dred Scott

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:20.230
decision, the Civil War,
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:25.580
Reconstruction, "Plessy v.
Ferguson," Sacco and Vanzetti,

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.850
Rosenbergs, Lindbergh's
flight, Amelia Earhart's loss,

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.965
the First World War, all the
way to Martin Luther King

00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:37.980
and Malcolm X, and Fannie
Lou Hamer, and Emmett Till,

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.300
and House on American
Activities Committee,

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:49.680
and Kent State, People's
Park, to September 11th,

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:56.900
and Occupy, and Michael
Brown, Trayvon Martin, 20

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.715
kids in a Connecticut
classroom and 14

00:28:59.715 --> 00:29:04.930
in San Bernardino, nine people
in a prayer circle in North

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:12.560
Carolina, in Orlando,
Florida-- all of that

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.950
happened within the
lifetime of three women who

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.880
were adults at the same time.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.560
And add to that the fact
that on January 20th of 2009,

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.650
I'm the seated guests on the
Capitol mall, guest of George

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.750
Miller, my representative,
with a picture

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.990
of my great-grandmother
in my breast pocket,

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:36.320
witnessing the
inauguration of America's

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.690
first African-American
president.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.610
In the shadow of the
Lincoln Memorial, Lincoln

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.620
whose life was
contemporary with the life

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:51.356
of my great-grandmother,
that's how fast the time goes.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.053
If that doesn't blow your
mind, check your pulse.

00:29:58.053 --> 00:29:59.320
[CHUCKLING]

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.100
Because that's how
fast the time goes.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.940
I know how my generation
met the threat of its day.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.180
It was a very real threat
of fascist world domination.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.920
And I know that we did that
under a severely flawed

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.580
social system.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:27.070
But we nonetheless
prevailed, and our children

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:30.460
and our grandchildren-- and
some of you in this room

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.080
are now facing a new threat.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.525
The threat of fascist
domination may be passed.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.170
But the threat of
rising sea levels,

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.840
global warming, climate
change, are with us now.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:54.610
And they will have to-- you
will have to-- match and exceed

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.620
that great mobilization in
order to save the planet.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.720
And you're going to do it under
a still flawed social system.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.250
Because the nature of democracy
is it will never stay fixed.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.740
It wasn't intended to.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.350
We have a constitutionally
protected right to be wrong,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.015
protected right to be bigots.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:27.640
We also have this incredible
system of national parks,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.410
where it is now possible
for us to revisit almost

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:37.260
any era in our history--
the scenic wonders,

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.980
the contemplative places,
the heroic places,

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.750
the shameful places,
and the painful places,

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:51.800
in order to own that
history that we may process

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.630
that history, in order
to move into a more

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:00.530
compassionate future together.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.990
And that's what the national
parks has come to mean for me.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.910
There's a place
on the film where

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:13.870
Agnes Moore, a Rosie,
still living, says,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.840
"It was the greatest coming
together of the American people

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.180
that I have ever lived through."

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.180
And when she first
used to say that,

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.100
when I would stand
against the wall watching

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.760
the faces of the audience
watching the film,

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.400
and I would hear her
say that, and I'd

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.500
think, how could she say that?

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.090
Come on, Agnes, that's crazy.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.820
That's not true.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.880
And somewhere around my 90th
birthday, I aged into a place

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:44.240
where the concept of
conflicting truths dawned on me.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:49.310
And I realized that we
all create our own reality

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.330
and that there are many,
many truths, and many of them

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.680
are in conflict.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.284
But this is not an
either/or world.

00:32:58.284 --> 00:33:00.590
It is both/and.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:05.010
And I wished I'd known that
when I was a 14-year-old.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.940
But that's what
the park has come

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.190
to mean to me, the place where
those conflicting truths can

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.690
coexist.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.110
So thank you very
much for coming.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.030
I thank you very much.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.230
Are there any questions?

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.140
AUDIENCE: My question
has to do with what

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.090
you think is the greatest
migration of people

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.690
coming together,
given that there

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:28.940
are these different realities.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.510
I'm just curious--

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.926
BETTY SOSKIN: I
didn't understand.

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:32.482
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about Rosie

00:33:32.482 --> 00:33:34.940
the Riveter saying this is the
greatest migration of people

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.660
coming together.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.410
BETTY SOSKIN: Yes.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.826
AUDIENCE: So I'd
like to know what

00:33:37.826 --> 00:33:40.400
you think is for you-- your
own personal reality-- what

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.040
is that greatest
migration for you?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.960
BETTY SOSKIN: I think that
that coming together was not

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.640
an aware coming together.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.720
We came together
out of an emergency.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.530
And we did it under a
completely broken social system.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.600
So it is remembered
in different ways

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.940
by different blocks of people.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.390
It is nostalgic for the Rosies.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.860
It is the proudest day that
some women that I work with

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.130
can look back on.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.350
And it is not that.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.850
For the coming together does not
represent that for me at all.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.159
Because I grew up in California.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:24.260
I grew up as a second
generation Californian, not as

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.980
an African-American.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:30.980
And because that
was true, I wasn't

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.739
equipped for the great
migration that came in.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:38.820
Because inadvertently,
Henry Kaiser

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.010
imported the entire system
of racial segregation

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.159
along with those people.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.870
And I was in a world
that I'd not grown up

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.489
in without leaving home.

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:53.140
And so the coming together
has mixed messages for me.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.440
I think that maybe
that will always be.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.980
I think people come together
in different configurations

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.570
at different times.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.080
AUDIENCE: You shared
some great stories

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.350
and personal recollections
of sort of-- every generation

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.290
we have challenges.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.710
And you hit on that at the end.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.540
With all of the
experience that you

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:25.400
have through the life
that you've lived,

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.590
do you think we-- [LAUGHS] what
are our shots in the future?

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.160
Do you think we'll be able to
rise to these new challenges,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.140
from what you've seen?

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.191
BETTY SOSKIN: Yeah.

00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:36.920
I think that every generation
has to recreate democracy

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.550
in its time.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.800
Because it's a participatory
form of governance

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.610
that requires all of us.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.950
And the 39% turnout in
the last general election

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.440
does not bode well for our
ability to even sustain

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.030
ourselves as a nation.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.590
The ways in which I am glad that
my time is coming to an end,

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:00.189
because I have no idea what
you guys are going to do.

00:36:00.189 --> 00:36:02.001
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.000
We are leaving behind a mess.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.368
[LAUGHS]

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.720
But it is true that the power to
recreate democracy is with you.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.740
When I was in grammar school
or even in middle school,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:24.200
I really believed
that the Constitution

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.890
with the Bill of Rights
was an entitlement that

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.500
came with me at birth.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.410
And my outrage in the '60s as
an African-American activist was

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.600
based on that belief
that this is my rights,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.460
and you cannot take
it away from me.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.380
And I somehow evolved
to a new place

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.250
where I now see them
as not deeds at all

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.600
or entitlements
but as blueprints

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.280
with which every generation
has to recreate democracy.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.265
That's all they are.

00:36:55.265 --> 00:36:59.780
They were dreams and visions
of the Founding Fathers.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.350
And each generation
has to reshape it.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.990
And the tools for
reshaping it lie

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.920
in those founding documents.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.810
And that's something that I
couldn't have known, I think,

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.880
when I was even 75.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:18.320
That's come in with
recently acquired knowledge.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.750
I now see myself as
an evolving person

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:25.570
in an evolving nation
in an evolving universe

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:28.640
that I couldn't have
said when I was 75.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.950
SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.260
BETTY SOSKIN: Thank you
very, very much, everybody.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.310
[APPLAUSE]
