00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:12.780
Jan Zizka (aka Jan Žižka z Trocnova a Kalicha)
is regarded as one of the single finest military

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.360
minds in world history.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.720
He also had his skin turned into a drum.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.400
Before we get to his death, though, we want
to discuss Zizka’s life, because well, frankly

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400
it was remarkable.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.359
For starters, Zizka, born in 1360, is generally
considered to have never lost a battle.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.000
What makes this feat even more impressive
is that, whereas the few other generals in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.350
history who’ve done this had powerful armies
at their command, Zizka was in command of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.250
only peasants and rebels.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.780
Zizka was a general during something known
as the “Hussite Wars” which, in a nutshell,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.980
was an uprising by protestant dissenters against
the Catholic Church.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.220
The Hussites, who were mostly Czechs, followed
the teachings of Jan Hus, a Czech priest who

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.070
was burned at the stake for heresy in 1415.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.110
You can read an eyewitness account of Hus’
death, here, if you’re interested in that

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.110
sort of thing.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.550
But we’re getting a little head of ourselves,
prior to becoming a general for the Hussites,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.480
Zizka was actually a mercenary fighting for
whomever paid him the highest wage.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.180
It was during his time as a mercenary, during
the First Battle of Tannenberg (aka, the Battle

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.409
of Grunwald) in 1410, that Zizka lost one
of his eyes.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.520
After getting his eye stabbed out of his face,
Zizka was still instrumental in helping claim

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.579
victory that day for the Polish.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.009
Around four years after Hus had been executed,
in 1419, the Hussites following his teachings

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.770
took the first few steps towards a full scale
revolt against the Catholic church by storming

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.439
the town hall in Prague.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.069
Led by Zizka and a priest called, Jan Želivský,
a group of Hussite protesters threw 7 (though

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.880
some sources say 11) city councilors from
a window.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.139
Supposedly, the protesters never set out with
the intention of violence; originally they

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.829
were just there to petition for the release
of a group of unfairly imprisoned fellow Hussites.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.499
However, the crowd began baying for blood
when an unknown person from within the town

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.469
hall threw a stone at them.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.659
The protest and subsequent riot is known as
The First Defenestration of Prague.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.579
The First Defenestration of Prague is widely
accepted as the event that kick-started the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.889
Hussite Wars which lasted all the way until
1434.

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:11.430
Luckily for the Hussites, under the leadership
of Zizka, they won victory after victory,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.950
despite generally being vastly outnumbered.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.750
Zizka’s prowess on the battlefield was linked
to a combination of his ability to effectively

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.830
use the terrain of the battlefield to his
advantage and his amazing ability to innovate,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.900
including being among the first to effectively
incorporate small gun powder weapons in battle

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.340
and developing what were essentially tanks.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.810
We’re not using hyperbole here by the way,
Zizka personally oversaw the construction

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.329
of “war wagons”- heavily armoured wagons,
from which his men could safely pepper the

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.970
enemy to death with crossbow bolts and hand
cannon balls.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.810
These war wagons were instrumental in many
of Zizka’s victories and helped him and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.840
his men overcome almost impossible odds.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.940
For example, during the Battle of Sudomer,
Zizka and a force just 400 lightly equipped

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.310
men managed to fight off over 2000 well trained
soldiers.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.310
Though his war wagons were indeed formidable,
Zizka himself didn’t hide behind them, generally

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.730
preferring to fight the enemy head on.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.930
His skill and ferocity on the battlefield
quickly earned him the respect of his men,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.930
and his enemies.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.340
In fact, Zizka was so determined to lead his
soldiers regardless of the odds, that he even

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.049
did so after he lost his other eye during
a battle in 1421.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.670
Zizka even once managed to lead an ambush
against a group of men who’d tried to ambush

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.830
him while he was completely blind in both
eyes.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.599
Zizka continued leading his men until 1424,
when he finally died, not from running into

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.749
battle blind, but from the plague.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:40.840
Before his death though, Zizka requested that
his skin be flayed from his body and used

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.849
to make a drum.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.280
We’re guessing that when you read the title
of this piece you assumed that Zizka’s skin

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.530
was ripped off by an enemy looking to make
an example of him or something like that,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.530
right?

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.280
But no, Zizka’s skin was ripped off at the
personally bequest of Zizka himself.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
Why?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.069
So that his men could beat the drum as they
marched into battle; so that even in death,

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:22.699
he could lead them on!
