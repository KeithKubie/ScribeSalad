RUSSELL ARCHER: My junior
year or my sophomore year,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.140
I couldn't imagine I would have
been traveling to Colombia.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.990
I'm really impressed
by the broadness

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.610
of the entire project.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.080
LU LU: Colombia was great.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.250
I grew up in a developing
country myself,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.240
and I think in the
future definitely

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.160
I would love to return back home
or to another country and work

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.310
on sustainable construction.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.740
RUSSELL ARCHER: My name
is Russell Archer.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.720
I'm a senior studying civil
and environmental engineering.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.720
LU LU: My name's Lu Lu.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.570
I'm also a senior in the civil
and environmental engineering

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.700
department.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.240
SIGRID ADRIAENSSENS:
Rusell and Lu Lu

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.360
came to see me at the beginning
of the academic semester.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.180
Lu Lu wanted to work
with form and design,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.080
and Russell wanted to really
do things with his hands,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.970
do physical testing,
and things like this.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.060 position:56%
LU LU: So we learn about this bamboo
architecture and construction

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.570
nonprofit in Colombia.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.040
TIM MICHIELS: I have a good friend
who is an architect in Colombia,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.610
and she had this set
of bamboo structures.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.200
And she was looking
for an engineer

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.960
to help her doing
the calculations,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.670
so she reached out to me.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.260
I said, well, I'll see if we
can find some senior students.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.400
LU LU: A lot of the structures
they do in this organization

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.390
are actually very innovative,
given they're bamboo.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.550
So really bamboo is considered
the poor people's material.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.130
They don't actually have a lot
of engineering research done

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.430
in the area yet, so
it's a nice place

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.610
where we could come in to
do some more engineering

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.520
analysis on the structures.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.060
SIGRID ADRIAENSSENS: They worked
both from very different aspects.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.030
Lu Lu is very interested in
design and digital modeling.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.700
Russell, he was very
interested in the physical,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.110
so he immediately ordered
bamboo, started cutting it up,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.180
started testing it.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.040
So they were doing
separate work,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.140
but their results were kind
of influencing each other.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.400
TIM MICHIELS: I think one of
the biggest challenges for Lu Lu

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.920
was that she basically got
to work on this material

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.230
that very few people
have worked on before

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.590
and that she was about to make
a computer model on a material

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.780
that she didn't know, and using
a computer program that she

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.090
had never used before.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.580
And for Russell, I think one
of the biggest challenges

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.960
was getting bamboo and
then figuring out himself

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960
how he should make
joints, how to manually,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.870
physically reproduce
significant results that

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.910
have an impact in Colombia.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.660
RUSSELL ARCHER: A specific
type of joint I'm looking at

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
is the fishmouth joint, and I'll
be analyzing its effectiveness

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.510
to resist specific
types of loading.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.610
LU LU: I’m looking at
very specifically

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.820
one canopy they’re building.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.400
It's of a shape of a
hyperbolic paraboloid.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.100
I'm also going to do some
hand calculations in order

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.520
to validate the analysis results
from the computer software.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.090
SIGRID ADRIAENSSENS: As part
of the senior thesis, they

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.430
got the opportunity
to travel to Colombia

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.580
where the structure actually
is being built at the moment.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.910
I think that was
also very informative

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.190
for them to see that it's
not only about engineering,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.180
but it's also about
how the communities

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.810
that these structures are built
for adopt these structures

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.810
and live with them.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.840
LU LU: I really enjoy this project
because engineering is not

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.860
only hardcore science--
you calculate something,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.520
and that's it.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.980
But there is a very
strong social component.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.140
TIM MICHIELS: I was really amazed
how much two senior students got

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.360
done in one entire year,
just dedicating themselves

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.720
to these structures in Colombia.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.700
SIGRID ADRIAENSSENS: So when
they shared their results

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.250
with the architect
and with the engineer,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.260
they were just amazed.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.200
They were blown away.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.790
So they will use
these results, I

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.290
think, to inform the
structure that they made,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.020
but also their future designs.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.060
LU LU: I feel like this project
made me definitely much more

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.220
confident and more informed
about the difficulties

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.410
and sort of just the
methodologies and the approach

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.810
I need in the future to
make myself more useful.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.390
RUSSELL ARCHER: I'm
hopefully going on

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.480
to do a master's in
structural engineering,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.620
and I'm hoping to
maybe do research

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.100
a little more on
sustainable materials.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.230 position:64%
SIGRID ADRIAENSSENS: For a senior thesis,
I think it's really wonderful

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.970
if students can do something
that's actually useful

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.010
that can benefit certain
people in certain places,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.040
and maybe also open their eyes
a little bit as to see what

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.710
engineers can actually do and
how they can improve the world.
