Speaker 1:          00:00          So I think it'd be fair to point out, you know, like youtube criticism too, because in talking about censorship, I think a lot of people immediately assumed I'd come on here and start waving my arms and they're screaming, they're biased against conservatives, which I think 27 I kind of did. But Youtube is, is, is, is a bit different. Youtube does, it has demonetized LGBT content and Youtube has said that these topics are not suitable for all advertisers because it deals with sexuality. They have target many left wing channels, there are a lot of non mainstream left wing, you know, outlets. And when you say target, which means D monetize demonetize the war sometimes outright ban. And I think then for d monetizing, I think they've made a state what was the, uh, the policy there. It's essentially things that are political correct. If they made that statement, I have to run another thing I was gonna say, I was going to interject that they've also been, are not banned, but do monetize people are extensively people that smoke weed on their channel.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Yeah, totally. Actually certain video game channels that have for unknown reasons, just stopped having monetization on their channel. And that is the problem of ultimately them having this incredible power where they, they really, there's no, there's not real open competition in terms of like another, like a parallel competitor. I don't think there will be real but, but here's the thing, I, I think you took out a bunch of really bad things. I'm going to give a a very important shout out to Monkey Jones who was wrongly terminated from youtube for highly dubious reasons. He is a dark, dark, dark comic. He had hundreds of thousands of followers. He made jokes about things like school shootings, very dark stuff, but it was clearly mocking some of these people. He was mocking Elliot Roger, he was making jokes about it and in fact, some of his videos were approved manually for monetization, but for some reason youtube just wiped them out one day gone.

Speaker 1:          01:48          So I set up a new channel and said, okay, you know, we're not gonna do that anyway. It doesn't matter. They got rid of him, he's effectively off of Youtube. And he was like, he's a well known, funny guy. He wasn't breaking the rules, he wasn't, but they still deleted, deleted this channel. So I bring him up because I think it's worrisome that yes, without an alternative, you're career is wiped out in a second with no recourse. And no reason why. And the response they give you is, it's our platform. Yeah. And you'll hear people say, oh, but there are private business. They can do what they want. Sure. But they're a monopoly. We've got to have restrictions on that.
