00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.290
Let Them Eat Cake

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.370
Marie Antoinette never said “let them eat
cake”.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.130
Now, I know what some of you are thinking,
“Of course she didn’t, she spoke French!”

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.240
But, in fact, she didn’t say “Qu’ils
mangent de la brioche” either.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.860
In fact, this saying in France actually pre-dated
her arrival there by anywhere from about thirty

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.570
years to as much as a century.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.720
This myth is often stated that on her way
to the guillotine, forced by a mob of starving

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.580
French peasants, she exasperatedly said “let
them eat cake!”

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.550
Another version says that when she heard the
people were starving from lack of bread, she

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.570
suggested, “let them eat cake.”

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.610
There are numerous problems with both of these
versions of the tail, but we’ll just stick

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.920
with the “let them eat cake” part.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.470
The actual saying “let them eat cake”
was first written by the political philosopher

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.300
Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his autobiography
“Confessions”.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.990
At the time, Marie Antoinette was only 10
years old and living in Austria.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.060
She didn’t come to France until four years
later when she married Louis XVI.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.350
More than that, Rousseau mentioned this same
phrase in a letter written 18 years before

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.760
Marie-Antoinette was even born.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.140
In his autobiography, Rousseau references
a “great princess”, who, when told the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.460
peasants had no bread, said “Well, let them
eat brioche.”

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.470
(brioche being a highly enriched bread).

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.460
It is thought that either Rousseau coined
this phrase himself or he was referring to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.320
Maria-Thérèse, who had lived about 100 years
before and was the wife of Louis XIV.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.560
Historians are divided on which is correct.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.410
There is significant evidence that the French
royal family believed the phrase originated

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.140
from Maria-Thérèse and it was a story passed
down among them.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.160
Indeed, Louis XVIII, in a memoir he penned
in 1791, related the story of Marie-Thérèse

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.990
saying this.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.010
In either case, this statement was used to
illustrate the disconnect between the aristocracy

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.110
in France and the plight of the people.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.409
Further, during a brief bread shortage in
1775, which lead to a series of riots, in

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.840
a letter from Marie-Antoinette to her Austrian
family, she states the following: “It is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.729
quite certain that in seeing the people who
treat us so well despite their own misfortune,

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.090
we are more obliged than ever to work hard
for their happiness.”

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.980
Hardly something written by someone who was
oblivious or unsympathetic to the plight of

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.100
the poor.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.170
So how did this saying get attributed to Marie
Antoinette?

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.159
Primarily, because the people of France loathed
her.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.080
It turns out, most of this loathing was primarily
because she was an easy and very visible target

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.889
to vent their rage against the French aristocracy
on.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.779
Marie Antoinette was Austrian and before her
marriage to Louis XVI, Austria and France

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:30.290
had been bitter enemies (in truth, things
didn’t improve too much after their union,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.430
though at least open war was avoided until
the King was eventually deposed in the revolution).

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.180
Initially, her beauty, eloquence, and personality
endeared the people to her.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.129
But as matters degraded between the general
public and the aristocracy, she became the

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.040
favorite member of the elite class to vilify.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.790
Throughout most of her time in France, she
was frequently accused of such things as:

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.180
incest with her son; having numerous affairs
with just about every man or woman she came

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.659
in contact with; attempting to weaken France
so that Austria could take over; attempting

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.659
to bankrupt France through political intrigues
and lavish spending (she was nicknamed “Madame

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.829
Déficit”); attempting to siphon the funds
in France’s treasury to her brother Joseph

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.530
II of Austria; attempting to defraud jewelers
of the cost of a certain extremely expensive

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.829
diamond necklace; wishing to bathe in the
blood of her political enemies; orchestrating

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.409
orgies; being the “power behind the throne”,
influencing many of the king’s decisions

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.930
that were seen as hurting France (nicknamed
“Madame Veto”); plotting to kill the Duke

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.859
of Orléans; orchestrating the massacre of
Swiss Guards; etc.

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.919
In reality, there is little evidence that
any of these things took place, save her lavish

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:35.919
spending.

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.040
However, her spending habits were nothing
compared to most French royalty at the time,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.069
which is somewhat surprising, considering
the Queen was expected to out-do everyone

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.069
else.

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.010
But it should be noted, that’s relatively
speaking.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.200
By most standards through history, her spending
habits were indeed ridiculous for most of

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.650
her time as queen.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.180
She did, however, include very generous charitable
contributions to the poor of France, among

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.309
her lavish spending, which also makes the
idea of her saying “let them eat cake”

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:06.059
seem out of character, considering it represents
a level of obliviousness that doesn’t align

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.959
with what is known about her.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.010
In addition to this, she had no real political
power for most of her time as queen, as her

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.199
husband tended to rebuff any suggestion she
made due to the fact that she was Austrian

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.009
and he was raised to distrust Austrians as
much as the people of France did.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.610
Indeed, he rarely ever spoke to her about
matters of state, fearing she might attempt

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.670
to use this information to Austria’s advantage.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.330
When the king eventually withdrew from many
of his political responsibilities, due to

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.460
extreme depression, she finally stepped in
to help calm matters between the assembly

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.610
and the king, which had rapidly deteriorated
with the state of France.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.870
Now that she was taking part in politics,
this also was criticized, with the revolutionists

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.560
accusing her of trying to bolster Austria’s
position and weaken France (which there was

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.710
never any real evidence of; indeed, the evidence
is quite to the contrary.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.400
Most of her political dealings went against
the interests of Austria, due to the fact

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.250
that her goal was to secure the future of
her children, who were French royalty, and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.450
that future was becoming in doubt with the
state of France).

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.259
At this time, she also made many enemies among
the French aristocracy for criticizing their

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.479
lavish spending habits, when France was so
near bankruptcy.

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.680
France’s continued financial problems at
this time when she was at the helm, also did

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.740
nothing to bolster her popularity with the
people, who blamed her for these problems,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.430
despite the fact that she had little to do
with it, and lacked the power to fix it.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.520
Outside of the revolutionists, many of her
rivals in court were also actively attempting

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.910
to sway the people against her by giving large
donations of bread and money to them, in an

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.849
effort to undermine some of her political
dealings.

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.060
To make matters worse, she was also dealing
with her dying son, who she insisted on taking

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.760
care of herself, rather than allowing others
to do it.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.110
He eventually died of tuberculosis.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.910
So basically, she was Austrian, a woman in
power, and one of the top members of the French

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.970
aristocracy at a time when being any of these
three wasn’t looked upon highly by the general

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.280
public; so she became target #1 for all their
rage against their negligent rulers.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.169
The expression itself, “let them eat cake”,
was relatively well known amongst many of

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.410
the revolutionists, and they used it to personify
the disconnect between the aristocracy and

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.080
the general public at this time.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.449
Post-revolution French historians also liked
to use the phrase as it summed up the extreme

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.729
selfishness and complete obliviousness of
the French aristocracy during this period.

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.720
So it’s not surprising that they assigned
the phrase as being spoken by her, who was

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.050
their favorite target for such things even
before her death, let alone after.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.539
Her life was actually quite a sad story from
beginning to end and reputable historical

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.550
accounts of herself and her actions are quite
contrary to the general perception of her,

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.419
not just then, but today as well.

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.440
If you’re interested in reading more about
this, Check out Marie Antoinette: The Journey,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.750
which is a very interesting read, assuming
you like biographies and are at all interested

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.199
in French history.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.199
Bonus Facts:

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.979
1) Once imprisoned after the revolution, Antoinette
vowed to no longer take part in French politics

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.430
because whatever happened that was bad would
be blamed on her anyway.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.169
She, instead, devoted her time towards attending
charitable events, when allowed, and taking

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.370
care of her surviving children.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.919
Of course, on September 21, 1792 the monarchy
of France was officially declared finished,

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.060
and a National Convention began its rule.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.199
At which point, the king and queen were tried
separately for treason.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.330
The king was eventually executed on January
21, 1793.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.410
In the months after, Antoinette’s health
rapidly deteriorated due to refusing to eat

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.910
and the onset of tuberculosis, as well as
frequent hemorrhaging, thought to be caused

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.330
by uterine cancer.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.449
Eventually, her son, the heir, was taken from
her and given to a cobbler to be “retrained”

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.419
with the ideals of the revolutionists.

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.400
He later died in prison in 1795.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.060
Antoinette was given one day to prepare a
defense for herself, after being informed

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.360
she would be tried.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.229
Among the charges brought against her, were
those listed previously, including incest

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:48.620
with her son, which she initially refused
to respond to, unlike the other charges leveled

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.620
against her.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.699
When pressed, she lost her composure, which
she had maintained up until that point and

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.129
lamented: “If I have not replied, it is
because Nature itself refuses to respond to

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:00.229
such a charge laid against a mother.”

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:03.930
This endeared her to many present, but the
result of the trial had been already decided

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.520
before hand by the Committee of Public Safety.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.969
She was, thus, convicted on October the 16th
and sentenced to death.

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:14.699
Her hair was cut off and she was driven through
Paris in an open cart to be ridiculed by the

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:15.699
masses.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:19.270
After her execution, her body was buried in
an unmarked grave.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.840
It was later exhumed and given a proper burial
in 1815 when the comte de Provence became

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.020
King Louis XVIII after the capture of Napoleon
in 1814.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.599
Bonus Fact 2: At the time of Antoinette’s
wedding, marriages were consummated publicly

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:35.510
in France, to prove that the union was completed.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.360
Marriages in most cultures at this time were
not official until that consummation took

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360
place.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.960
Thus, witnesses always had to be present at
the consummation.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.820
In France, at the time, servants usually slept
in the same room as their masters, so witnesses

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.820
were usually present anyways.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.740
Marie Antoinette and the King didn’t consummate
their marriage for a full seven years after

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.810
the actual proxy wedding (the king was not
present at the wedding).

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.990
At that time, Antoinette’s brother traveled
to France and intervened, at which point the

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.270
marriage was finally consummated.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.840
Bonus Fact 3: One of the first acts Antoinette
did to displease the masses was to purchase

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.030
Château de Saint-Cloud, which she intended
to leave as an inheritance to her younger

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.850
children who were not heirs.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.810
The idea of a woman owning her own property
outraged many, particularly because she was

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:32.610
the queen and shouldn’t have a residence
that was not also owned by 

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.640
the king.
