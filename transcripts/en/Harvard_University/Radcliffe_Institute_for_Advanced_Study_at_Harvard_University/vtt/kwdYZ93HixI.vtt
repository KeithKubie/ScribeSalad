00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.430
- Thank you very much, Judy.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.010
And I'd just like
to start by thanking

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.260
the people who run the fellows
program and the other fellows.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.990
It's really been an
opportunity of a lifetime

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.080
for me to interact
with the other scholars

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.120
in such diverse
fields this year.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.310
So the subject of my talk
today has to do with the ways

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.390
that genetic information is
processed in living cells.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.300
And as Judy mentioned,
it turns out

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.340
that it's processed by
machines, machines so tiny

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.970
that they are made up
of individual molecules.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.250
And so in my talk today,
I'm going to just remind you

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.630
a little bit about how the
flow of genetic information

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.400
in live cells happens.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.500
And then what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.640
going to pick as an example one
particular molecular machine

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.430
that's responsible for
part of this process

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.420
and tell you a little bit
not only about what we've

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.150
discovered about how
it works, but about how

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.790
we're able to study such tiny
machines in the laboratory.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.410
And at the end of
my talk, I'll just

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.360
spend a few minutes
talking about why

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.000
we think this kind of
research is important

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.770
and what it can be
used for in the future.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.950
So the biological world is
a fascinating and beautiful

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.450
place.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.010
The diversity of plants and
animals that we see around us

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.490
is a major theme in the
biblical story of creation,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.400
and it's something that's
fascinated visual artists

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.340
and authors for centuries.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.510
When the first light microscopes
were discovered and started

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.480
to be used by biologists,
people quickly

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.510
found out that this
incredible diversity

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.620
of different forms of
life is recapitulated

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.370
at the microscopic level.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.560
So the early microscope
users discovered

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.300
this fantastic and
bizarre variety

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.630
of different forms
of microorganisms.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.460
And we see the same
sort of diversity

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.130
when we look at the
cells in the human body.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.630
There are many different
kinds of cells in the body

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.560
with different shapes,
seemingly specialized

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.180
for different
biological functions.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.540
But when we go to even
smaller size scales,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.680
when we go below the
level of individual cells

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.710
and we start to look at the
molecules that make up cells,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.570
we start to see
something different.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.990
We now know that at
the core of cells,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.650
there's a fundamental
system of molecules

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.830
and that that
system is universal.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.570
That is, it is true for every
living cell in every organism

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.610
on this planet.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.620
This is that system.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.890
It's the system by which
genetic information

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.610
is encoded and processed
in individual molecules.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.750
And so I'll just remind you of a
little high school biology now.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.070
So you all know that genetic
information is stored in DNA.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.950
DNA has this long,
string-like molecule,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.680
which I'm just showing you
a little piece of here.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.190
It's made up of four
building blocks,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.120
indicated by the pairs of
colors here, called base pairs.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.790
And the genetic
information is encoded

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.070
in the sequence of those
building blocks, which

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.930
building block is
present at which

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.540
particular position in DNA.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.560
And in human cells, there is
a lot of genetic information.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.600
There are six billion
base pairs of DNA.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.230
And a consequence
of that is that even

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.149
though the DNA in your cells
and the DNA in the person

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.720
who's sitting next to you, the
sequence of building blocks

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.740
is more than 99% identical.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.640
That fraction of
1% that's different

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.070
is enough to ensure that
your genetic information is

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.560
different from the genetic
information of the person

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.280
sitting next to you, unless that
person is your identical twin.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.820
And it is, in fact, different
from every other one of the 7

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.512
1/2 billion people in
the human population.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.350
And of course, the DNA in all
of your cells is identical.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.660
And the reason
that it's identical

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.710
is due to this process indicated
by the circular arrow here.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.440
We all started out as
a single fertilized egg

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.250
cell, which divided and
divided and divided again.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.500
And with every cell division,
a copy of the DNA molecules

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.160
is made, preserving the
genetic information,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.190
and one copy is passed to
each of the progeny cells.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.270
And I'm highlighting this
arrow because the process

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.640
that this arrow represents is an
information processing process.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.040
It's a simple process.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.540
It's just taking the genetic
information in one DNA molecule

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.210
and making an
identical copy of it.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.760
But it's an information
processing process

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.740
nevertheless.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.970
The same thing is true
of the processes that

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.510
use the genetic information,
which are illustrated

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.570
down here on the slide.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.750
The DNA in our
chromosomes is divided up

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.110
into short segments,
which constitute genes.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.350
And for the genetic
information to be used,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.990
the first thing that happens
is that cells take each gene

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.810
and they now make a copy of
the genetic information in that

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.350
gene that is realized in a
new kind of molecule that's

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.960
very similar to DNA, RNA.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.530
Like DNA, RNA, it's a
long, string-like molecule.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.800
It has four building blocks.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.460
And again, there is an
information transfer process

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.430
that allows the cell
to make many RNA

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.340
copies of the same
short segment of DNA

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.870
to amplify the genetic
information in the DNA.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.460
And finally, the genetic
information in some of the RNAs

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.940
is converted into another
long, string-like molecule,

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.880
protein molecules, again, making
many copies from a single RNA.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.640
The information processing
here is a little bit more

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.710
complicated, but only a little.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.340
And that's because proteins have
20 building blocks, not just

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.080
four.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.410
But the sequences of
these building blocks

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.050
is encoded in triples of
the RNA coding blocks.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.960
So this scheme that I'm
showing you on the slide,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.330
it resembles a computer
program, or the flowchart

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.890
of a computer program.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.400
That is, it specifies
that information

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.270
is stored in a
certain physical form

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.330
and that the information
is transferred or copied

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.130
into other physical forms.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.890
So what I'm showing you here
is essentially software.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.250
It illustrates the
sort of program

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.130
of the genetic information flow.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.440
And like the
software that you use

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.190
on your phone or your computer,
just having the software

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.900
is not enough.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.370
To do any kind of real life
information processing task,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.930
you not only need the software.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.680
You need the hardware
that it runs on.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.530
And the hardware that
this program runs on

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.190
is the molecular
machines that carry out

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.350
these processes
that are represented

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.590
by the highlighted arrows.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.820
So I'm going to focus
for most of my talk

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.770
on one of these processes.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.350
And that's the
process that carries

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:37.659
out this step, the steps that
reads the segment of the DNA

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:43.750
molecule that consists
of a single gene

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.610
and builds an RNA
a molecule that

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.970
contains a copy of that
genetic information.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:56.340
And so as I indicated at
the beginning of the talk,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.820
this process is carried out
by a tiny molecular machine.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.315
And this is the
molecular machine here.

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:08.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.480
So up here, I'll put a picture
of it so you can see it better.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.370
There it is.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.590
So this is a molecular
machine called RNA polymerase.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.272
It's called that because
it makes RNA polymers.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.460
And of course, the real
one isn't this big.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.200
This is a 3D-printed
molecular model

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.760
that was made by a Brandeis
undergraduate, Eduardo

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.260
Beltrame.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.260
And this is a scale model.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.200
And so the real RNA
polymerase molecule

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.860
is made out of protein,
not out of plastic.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.460
And it is 15 million times
smaller than this model.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.800
So it's small enough
that it is way,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.910
way smaller than the
smallest bacterial cell.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.970
And of course, it has to be
because a whole bunch of these

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.740
have to fit inside every cell.

00:10:08.405 --> 00:10:12.110
So just to give you a feeling
for the scale of the process,

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.330
this is a model
of a DNA molecule

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.730
printed to the same scale.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:21.320
This DNA molecule model
has 50 of the base

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.450
pair building blocks of DNA.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.280
So this model represents a
DNA that is actually far, far

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.170
shorter than a typical gene.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.390
So a typical human
gene might have

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.820
somewhere between 10 or 15,000
of the DNA building blocks.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.040
So it's 1,000 times the length
of the one in this model.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.320
And some of the
longer human genes

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.080
are 50,000 times the length
of the one in this model.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.630
So if I tried to make a
model on the scale of one

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.230
of those large human
genes, I could lay it down

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.080
on Mass Avenue, and it would
stretch from Harvard Square

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.370
to Central Square.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:11.220
And so you have to think
about the Herculean task

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.150
that this machine
has to accomplish.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.790
In some ways, it is
like the little engine

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.190
that could that Judy mentioned.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.790
You could imagine something of
this size plunking itself down

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.540
on the DNA in Harvard Square
and moving along all the way

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:32.720
to Central Square, assembling
from its building blocks

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.610
a new RNA molecule
that contained

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.550
a copy of the genetic
information that's in the DNA.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.770
And for those long human
genes, that process in the cell

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.200
takes tens of hours
to accomplish.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.830
And just another
thing, just to give you

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:57.470
an idea of the size scale,
if you look at this model

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.210
close up-- and I invite you to
come up afterwards and handle

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:00.710
it.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.470
You can hold it in
your own hands--

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.320
you'll see that it's
actually an agglomeration

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.480
of little spherical shapes.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.220
And each one of
those little spheres

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.010
represents an atom,
one of the carbon,

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:19.040
nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur
atoms that make up the machine.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.200
So this is a machine
that performs

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.650
this complex information
processing process.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.320
And it's a machine that is so
small that when you look at it,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.230
you can see the individual
atoms of which it is composed.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.500
So we want to understand
how this machine works.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:48.350
Can we look at it and
tell how it works?

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.580
The answer is no.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.170
I certainly can't.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.280
And there are
multiple reasons why

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.700
merely looking at the machine
does not tell us how it works.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.630
And one of the most
fundamental ones

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.580
is that if we looked
at an automobile engine

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.470
and took it apart, even
if we didn't know very

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.390
much about cars,
we might very well

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.030
be able to infer what
some of the parts do.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.770
And that's because
an automobile engine

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:25.560
is made by human engineers
with an intended purpose.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.310
And human engineers
tend to design things

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.310
in a rational way, where
different parts perform

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:35.060
different functions, and
they get assembled together.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.120
This machine was not
designed by human engineers.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.780
It was designed by this
chaotic process, the process

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.140
of random mutation and
natural selection, which

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.480
causes biological evolution.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.190
And that process works
in very different ways

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.450
than the rational thought
processes of human engineers.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.300
And so there aren't
independently

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.590
functioning parts
of the machine.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.320
Very often, particular
functions aren't

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.810
localized in particular
parts of the machine,

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.420
but they're
distributed all over.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.420
And so just the
intellectual problem

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.580
of understanding how
it works is somewhat

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.980
subtle and challenging.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.060
There's another reason
why we can't really--

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.810
these structures
are very valuable.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.360
But there's another reason
why the structures alone

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.060
are not sufficient to tell
us how the machine works.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.320
And that's because the
scientific methods that

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.380
produce the information that's
used to build models like this,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.770
which I won't tell
you about today,

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:45.830
those methods produce a static
snapshot of the machine.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:53.240
And what these protein machines
really do it is highly dynamic.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.270
There's a great deal of
movement of the different parts

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.410
of the machine.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.470
And understanding
that movement is

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.480
essential to understanding
the operation.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.620
And we can't get it
from a static picture.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:12.330
So as I say, these
machines are tiny.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.350
When we go into the lab,
it's no problem for me

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.820
to put in a little teeny test
tube, a tiny drop of liquid

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.190
that does not just
contain billions

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.500
of copies of this machine.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.390
It's easy to make
one that contains

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.355
billions of billions of copies.

00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:38.670
And if we also put DNA into
the machine and the building

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.440
blocks of RNA, we
can get the machine

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.710
to make RNA in the test tube.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.720
One of the fundamental
problems that we

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.570
face in studying
a system like that

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.860
is that in this large
population of molecules,

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.570
the different molecules
are doing different things

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.440
at the same time.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.370
Every molecule is in
its own distinct phase

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:07.860
of the cycle through which
the machine makes an RNA.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:13.320
And unfortunately, the tools
that chemists and biochemists

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.570
use to study large systems of
molecules are such that usually

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.940
what they do is they tell
us about some property

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.210
of the sample averaged over all
of the molecules in the system.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.660
And that creates a
great deal of difficulty

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.760
in interpreting
the data in terms

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.830
of the operation of these
biological machines.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:44.020
It's as if you were
confronted with a crowd

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.000
of very excited Red Sox fans.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.110
So here's a group of
excited Red Sox fans.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.440
The Red Sox just won
the World Series.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.310
They're far too excited to
chant anything in unison.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.490
And so if we try to understand
what the crowd is saying

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.510
all together, it's hopeless.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.109
We just hear--

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.484
[CACOPHONY OF VOICES]

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.829
So if we wanted to
really understand

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.530
what they're
cheering, the only way

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.210
we could conceivably do this
is to somehow focus down

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.151
on the individual members
of the crowd one at a time.

00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:28.650
Then--

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.180
- Yay, Red Sox!

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.900
- We can understand
what they're saying.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.420
And we cannot only understand
what they're saying.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.330
Then we could go to a
different member of the crowd,

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.670
and we could ask if they
were saying the same thing.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.960
- Yay, Red Sox!

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.230
- And there might
be somebody else who

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.635
was conveying the same general
idea in a different way.

00:17:50.635 --> 00:17:51.836
- Woo!

00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:53.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.770
- And there could be
somebody who is saying

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.177
something completely different.

00:17:57.177 --> 00:17:58.608
- Ball game over!

00:17:58.608 --> 00:17:59.562
Yankees win!

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.100
- And so it's the same
thing with our molecules.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.760
What we really need to
do is we really need

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.700
a way to look at the
molecules one at a time

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.780
so we can build up a
representative picture

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.820
of the way the
molecules function.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.980
But if we have to look
at them all at once,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.510
we're kind of lost.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.360
And this might seem like
kind of an obvious point.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.790
And the reason that
I'm emphasizing it

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.140
is that up until a little
bit more than 25 years ago,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.200
it was not possible
to do experiments

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.170
where we could actually look
at these individual molecular

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.632
machines one at a time
and study their function.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.330
But at about that
time, I and several

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.430
of the other
investigators in the field

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.670
started to work out ways where
we could actually narrow down

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.987
on the functioning of
individual molecules.

00:18:55.987 --> 00:18:57.570
And I'm going to
tell you a little bit

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.460
about those experiments now.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.020
And I'm going to
start by telling you

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.270
about the very first one
of those experiments,

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.230
just because it sets the
stage, and it's relatively easy

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.120
to understand.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.260
And before I tell you
about the experiment,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.210
there's a physical
phenomenon that you

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.560
need to understand to understand
how the experiment works.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.880
And that's the phenomenon
of Brownian motion.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.900
So if you take any
kind of a collection

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.860
of tiny macroscopic objects that
are floating around in liquid

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.900
and you look at them
in a light microscope,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.950
you see something
that looks like this.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:43.770
So you see this kind of
random, chaotic motion.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.450
Now, I want to emphasize
that there is nothing

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.330
living in the sample that
you're looking at right now.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.680
This is just a video taken
through a light microscope.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.750
And the only thing
that's in the sample

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.230
is water and a collection
of equally sized

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.220
microscopic plastic beads made
out of the same kind of plastic

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.370
that Styrofoam drinking
cups are made out of.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.210
And so there's
nothing alive here.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.630
We're not supplying
any kind of energy.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.955
And yet, all of these
objects are moving.

00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:20.000
And this is called
Brownian motion.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.300
It's named after Robert
Brown, an English botanist who

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.110
observed the same kind
of motion in the movement

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.330
of microscopic
pollen grains that he

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.030
observed under the microscope.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.590
And we know exactly what
is causing this motion.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.190
And the reason why we know
it is because of this guy,

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:47.280
Albert Einstein, who,
for his PhD thesis,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.470
showed that you actually expect
this kind of motion just based

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.540
on physical first principles.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.340
And to understand
what's going on here,

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.290
I'll show you a modern
computer simulation.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.370
So this yellow circle
represents the bead.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.910
And the small black dots
represent water molecules,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.250
which are floating around here.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.625
But of course,
you can't see them

00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:11.100
because they are too small.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.430
And the water molecules
are exhibiting

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.680
this chaotic, random motion.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.980
And that's just
because this sample

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.290
is at a temperature above the
absolute zero of temperature.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.620
So the random motion
of water molecules

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.080
is the thermal kinetic energy
of the water molecules.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.970
And at any given
instant in time,

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.940
water molecules are colliding
with the beads on all sides

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.170
at random.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.720
But there is a
statistical effect here

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.790
where, at any given
instant in time,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.070
slightly more water
molecules might

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.800
collide with the bead
on one side than collide

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.480
with the bead on the other side.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.500
And that gives the bead a little
random push in one direction.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:59.220
And what you're seeing here
is the residual statistical

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.330
variation where the
water molecules colliding

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.780
on all sides don't
quite even out.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.300
OK, so now back to the
molecular machines.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:17.860
So I'm going to show you a movie
of an experiment in which I

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.170
and my collaborators--

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.280
Mike Sheetz, Bob Landick,
and Dorothy Schafer--

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.950
did quite a long time ago.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:32.940
What we did was we took an
RNA polymerase molecule.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.760
We let it move down
a DNA, making an RNA.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.250
And then we made it
stop by taking away

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.160
the building blocks of the
RNA so that it gets stuck

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.020
and it can't move.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.350
And then what we did was we
attached the RNA polymerase

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.570
molecule to a glass
microscope slide

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.370
so it's fixed in position.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.430
And at the other
end of the DNA, we

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.770
put one of these
microscopic plastic beads,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.950
the same kind of bead that I
showed you in the last slide.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.950
And when we look at
a sample like this,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.770
we see the following.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:05.620
OK?

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.860
So each one of
these little dots is

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.870
one of the microscopic beads.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.810
They're exhibiting the
same kind of random motion

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.730
that I showed you in
the previous slide.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.490
But here, the random
motion is subtly different.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.100
They're not just
wandering around randomly.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.260
Instead, they're just
sitting in one place

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.330
and jiggling randomly.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.730
And of course, the
reason for that

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.690
is that these are
beads on a leash.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.900
The DNA molecule is flexible.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.400
And so the beads
can move around,

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.830
but they can never go too far.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.410
So now, what I
showed you before,

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.900
again, the RNA
polymerase is stopped.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.540
It's not doing anything
because we haven't given it

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.550
the building blocks of RNA.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.130
But now, we can throw
those building blocks in.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.850
We throw in these chemicals,
nucleoside triphosphates,

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.455
that are used to construct RNA.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.980
And in the next slide, I'll
show you one of these beads

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.880
and what happens with time.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.250
So at the beginning, you
noticed that bead in the center

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.280
is jiggling rapidly.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.880
But as time goes by,
you'll see the amount

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.840
of jiggling gradually gets
less and less and less

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.930
until in another few seconds,
it will be barely moving at all.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:19.770
OK?

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.030
And of course, what's going
on here is shown here.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.850
The beads started
out on a long leash.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.440
But in this
experiment, now we've

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.360
given it the
ingredients for RNA.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.070
The RNA polymerase is making
RNA and moving along the DNA.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.730
But here, the tail
is wagging the dog.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.600
We've stuck the RNA
polymerase to the surface.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.110
And so now the DNA has
to move through it.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.530
And as the DNA moves through
it, the leash gradually

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.850
gets shorter and shorter.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:51.840
And we see the
effect in the moving.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.880
So this movie is not
going to win any Academy

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.620
Awards for Best Documentary.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:05.460
There's no plot and certainly
no character development.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.290
But when we made this movie,
I and my collaborators

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.900
were incredibly
excited because we

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.120
realized that for
the first time,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.800
we were actually able
to see an individual one

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.110
of these molecular
motors moving along DNA,

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.000
or at least see the effects.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.100
And by measuring the amount
of wiggling of the bead,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.370
we could essentially deduce the
position of the RNA polymerase

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.300
on the bead.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:39.030
And from that, we could
and did learn a great deal

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.170
about the effects of
different sequences

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:50.010
in the DNA on the movement, the
effects of different signals

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.880
in the DNA that control the
movement of the polymerase,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.550
what kinds of forces the
polymerase could exert

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.450
on the DNA, and other things.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.730
But this was a long time ago.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.910
So now, I want to fast
forward to the present

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.820
and tell you about the
kinds of experiments

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.190
that we do nowadays to
learn more about how

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.730
these machines operate.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:21.510
And these experiments,
they're motivated

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.150
by wanting to overcome a
limitation of this kind

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.570
of experiment, which is that
here, we're really only looking

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.070
at one aspect of the system.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.910
We're just studying the position
of the polymerase on the DNA.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.419
And these biological systems
are quite complex for reasons

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:39.710
that I'll tell you a little
bit more about in a minute.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.150
We want to be able to
look at more than one

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.820
of the molecules
that's involved.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.160
And our solution to
that is to use color.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.980
So here's an experiment that
was done relatively recently

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.260
by my colleague, Larry Freidman.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.520
And what Larry did was he did
the same sort of experiment.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.770
He took a glass
microscope slide.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.460
This time, he attached the
end of a DNA molecule to it.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.190
And the DNA molecule
has attached to it

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.070
a single molecule of
a blue colored dye

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.030
so that when we look in a
fluorescence microscope,

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:24.620
we can see a little spot of
blue fluorescence from the DNA.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.480
And the nice thing
about this technique

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.570
is that then we can
use the same approach.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:34.200
We can stick dye molecules
of different colors

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.930
on each of the other
molecules that are involved.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.880
And we can study
the coordination

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.820
of the different
molecules as they operate.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.770
So in this particular
experiment,

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.290
Larry had blue DNA molecules.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.780
And he looks in the
microscope, and he

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.340
sees a bunch of blue spots.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.250
And each one of those blue
spots represents a single DNA

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.930
molecule.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.390
And then in solution,
he could put

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.140
RNA polymerase that's labeled
with a yellow dye molecule.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.820
And then when he looks at the
same area of the microscope

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.670
slide, but now looking at
the wavelengths of light that

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.830
correspond to the
yellow fluorescence,

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.180
he sees a series
of yellow spots.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.120
And sure enough,
those yellow spots

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.820
line up with the
positions of blue spots,

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.810
showing him that the RNA
polymerase molecule has

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.420
come down, and it's
bound to the DNA,

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.110
and it's gotten ready to
make an RNA copy of the DNA.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:33.330
And then, when Larry feeds in
the building blocks of RNA,

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.730
he adds this
red-labeled molecule,

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.790
which binds to and
helps us detect the RNA.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.050
And he sees red spots.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.780
And those overlay
with the yellow spots.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.780
And so here, what
we've done is now

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.600
we're watching the whole
molecular process that's

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.460
involved in
manufacturing the RNA.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.924
We're watching the DNA.

00:28:54.924 --> 00:28:56.340
We're watching the
RNA polymerase.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.290
And we're watching the
production of the RNA.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.960
And this is just a movie
of this experiment.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.050
So here, these
squares mark places--

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.760
so you're seeing two copies
of the exact same area

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.670
of the surface of the slide.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.720
But one is imaged
at the wavelength

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.230
that corresponds to where the
RNA polymerase molecules are.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.480
One is imaged at the
wavelength that corresponds

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.550
to where the RNA molecules are.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.350
And so you can see
that at the beginning,

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:29.850
we start to see RNA
polymerase molecules appear

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.140
at different places.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.730
They appear and disappear.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.600
This turns out to be real, so
not all associations of the RNA

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.850
polymerase make an RNA.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:44.880
But gradually, we see a gradual
accumulation of RNA spots

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.250
at the locations where
an RNA polymerase

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.620
molecule has made an RNA.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.100
And we've learned a
lot from experiments

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:58.020
like this about the
factors that control

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.682
when an RNA is made from a
gene and when it's not made.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.280
So the picture that emerges
from experiments like this

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.410
is illustrated by
this animation,

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.170
where the RNA
polymerase in green

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.480
is moving along the DNA in pink.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:22.440
And it's spewing out the RNA
copy of the genetic information

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.580
in yellow.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.820
And in this movie, these
little yellow spots

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.320
that are flying
around are supposed

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.600
to represent the
building blocks that

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.240
are being assembled
by the RNA polymerase

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.590
into a mature RNA molecule.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:42.360
And so this animation is fun
to watch, but it's wrong.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.230
OK?

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.740
And in several ways.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.540
One of the ways that
you already know.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.680
If this was a realistic
animation, on this scale,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.280
these molecules would be
undergoing absolutely, wildly

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.750
chaotic Brownian motion.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.320
In fact, the smaller the
molecules are, the more chaotic

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.020
the Brownian motion is.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.490
And so the smooth motion
is a complete fiction.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:12.570
And actually, the task that
a machine like this faces

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.870
is not so much how to
move along the DNA,

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.830
because movement at this scale
is absolutely ubiquitous.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.580
What the machine has to do
is to control the movement

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.400
so it moves unidirectionally.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.390
The other thing that's
unrealistic about this movie

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:34.620
is the fact that RNA
polymerase and DNA and RNA

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.720
are the only molecules
that are shown here.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.100
And it is of course true--

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.040
I already told you that
you can take a test tube

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.540
and put RNA polymerase and DNA
and the building blocks of RNA

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.140
and you can make RNA
in that test tube.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.810
But that's not the way
RNA gets made in the cell.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:03.480
So RNA polymerase,
just like your car,

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.210
comes along with a
lot of accessories.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:12.240
And unlike your
car, the accessories

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.370
aren't built in to the machine.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.670
The accessories are just kind
of floating around in the cell,

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:21.780
and they interact with
RNA polymerase at random.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.230
And those accessories are
very important because they

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.620
control all sorts of
processes in the cell.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.220
So this is a simple example.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:32.910
OK?

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:40.050
So this shows the
accessory proteins

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.850
that are present in the
simple intestinal bacterium E.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:49.290
coli that are involved in
controlling the movement of RNA

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.020
polymerase as it
moves along the DNA.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.340
So the RNA polymerase is
floating around in the cell.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.260
These accessory proteins are
floating around in the cell.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.580
We know a lot about what the
individual accessory proteins

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.020
do.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:09.570
But what scientists so far
have been unable to figure out

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:13.290
is how they collectively
function together

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.560
to modulate the behavior
of the RNA polymerase.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.160
And that's simply because
in the systems where you're

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.770
looking at many
molecules at a time,

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:27.930
it's too complicated to
discern what's going on.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:35.170
But now, because we can do these
single molecule experiments

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.590
with individual
proteins each labeled

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.630
with a different
color of dye, we

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.740
can start to learn about
how these proteins work.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.090
And so here's an example
of an experiment like this.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.280
So this is the same
sort of experiment here.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.230
We've got DNA on the surface.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.170
We've got RNA polymerase
labeled with a red dye

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.440
so we can see where
the DNA molecules are

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.010
at the beginning
of the experiment.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.427
Sorry, the RNA is
labeled with the red dye.

00:34:04.427 --> 00:34:06.010
So at the beginning
of the experiment,

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.920
there is no RNA
after a little while.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.030
A few seconds, we
start making RNA.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.699
And what we've
done here is we've

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:18.870
taken one of these
accessory proteins, which

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:22.590
goes by the euphonious
name of GreB,

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.750
and we've labeled it
with the green dye.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:30.090
And we've watched
the GreB protein

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:33.300
coming and sticking on the RNA
polymerase for a little while

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.310
and then leaving.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.188
GreB is an important
protein in this bacterium.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.739
It's a protein
that the cell uses

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:48.750
to solve a particular serious
problem, which is that RNA

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.580
polymerase, every
now and then, it's

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.370
moving along copying the
genetic information in DNA,

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.760
and it makes a mistake.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.600
And it sticks on
the end of the RNA

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.270
the wrong RNA building block.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.250
And when that happens,
it's a big problem

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:06.160
because it jams up the works,
and the polymerase stops.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.870
And if nothing were done
about that stopped polymerase,

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:15.050
it's a potentially fatal
problem for the cell

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.930
because the polymerase
is sitting on a gene

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.110
and it's blocking other
polymerases from moving along

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.730
the gene.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.170
And if nothing is
done about that

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:28.580
and the gene is an essential
gene, the cell will die.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.850
So GreB is the
proofreading protein.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.760
What it does is it comes along--

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.400
and some people had
previously thought

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.340
that it rides along with
the polymerase all the time.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.860
But we couldn't figure out
how that could possibly be,

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.860
because it would interfere with
some of those other proteins

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.570
binding to the polymerase.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.330
Some people thought
that GreB had

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:56.300
a way of sensing from a distance
whether the RNA polymerase had

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.010
made a mistake and only came up
to interact with those proteins

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.350
that needed proofreading.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.680
But what this experiment
shows is that the GreB protein

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.340
is what one of my post-docs
calls the helicopter parent

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.550
of transcription factors.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:17.270
That is, it works by a
just checking mechanism.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.990
You can see, here's
the fluorescence

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:22.610
from GreB molecules.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:26.630
And each of these little blips
represent a GreB molecule

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.750
coming and sticking on the
polymerase for just a second

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.200
and then leaving.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.820
And what Larry Tetone,
my PhD student,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.490
was able to show
in this experiment

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:43.130
is that the GreB comes and
goes exactly the same way

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.340
if the polymerase needs
proofreading as if it

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.870
doesn't need proofreading.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.630
So what it's doing is it's
just coming in and checking

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.240
periodically and
fixing the problem

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.660
if something needs to be fixed.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.330
Then otherwise, it just leaves.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:01.880
And in this way, it
can operate, but not

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.130
interfere with the other
proteins that also have

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.460
to bind to the RNA polymerase.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.870
So

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:14.340
So here, we're just
looking at one protein.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.240
But now, we've started to look
at proteins in twos and threes

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.350
so we can see how
they work together.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:26.400
And as I and Judy
alluded to, this process

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.510
is made possible by
microscopes that we've

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.440
built at Brandeis that have
the unique capability of being

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.400
able to look at multiple colors
of single molecule fluorescence

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.530
at the same time very accurately
so that we can build up

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.750
descriptions of the processes.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:50.460
This is a picture of part
of one of our microscopes.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.440
This microscope has four visible
color lasers, red, green,

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.810
orange, and blue, and
then your infrared laser

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.030
that you can't see.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.610
And so we're doing
experiments where we

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.830
monitor four proteins at once.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:10.140
And we can potentially do more
as we develop the technology.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:16.090
And we really want to
develop the technology

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.330
because what I've told
you about are just

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:25.450
examples of very simple
systems of accessory proteins

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.730
that regulate RNA polymerase.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.427
Here's a more complex example.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.480
Each one of the
circles in this diagram

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.660
represents a gene or a
set of genes in E. coli.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.270
And the red and green
lines that connect them

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.660
show the regulatory
interactions.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.680
They show that this
yellow protein switches

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.890
on or off the protein
that it's connected

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.460
to with either a
green or a red line.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.750
And these processes of
switching on and off proteins

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.050
are central to biology.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.250
They are the processes that
cause different genes to be

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.950
turned on and off in
different cell types

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.990
so that muscle cells are
different from nerve cells.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:18.160
They are essential to the
processes by which cells

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.980
respond to chemical signals
in their environment

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.630
and regulate their metabolism.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:28.900
And these regulatory systems
are the things that sometimes

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.210
fail in diseases like cancer.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.590
And so we're very
interested in studying

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.380
these regulatory interactions.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.330
There aren't enough
colors in the spectrum

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:44.080
for us to be able
to study all or even

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.780
a large number of these
proteins at the same time.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.170
But you notice that if you
look at these individual nodes

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.430
that many of the
genes shown in blue

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.070
are regulated by a
relatively small number

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.020
of these regulatory proteins.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.020
So we can hope to
make some progress

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.140
in understanding the mechanisms
by which these regulation

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.790
systems work.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.360
My lab has mostly worked
on studying transcription

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.790
in bacteria, just
because bacteria

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.030
are a little bit simpler
than animal and plant cells.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.710
And even though they are simpler
than animal and plant cells,

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.170
they are plenty complex,
and they could probably

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:28.150
keep us busy, certainly
for the rest of my career.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:33.940
But kind of inspired by the
opportunity at the Radcliffe

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:38.830
Institute, we were also trying
to take a bold leap forward

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.500
and transplant these
technologies to use

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.450
them to study the cells
of higher organisms.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.260
And so in my project
this year, I'm

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.810
working with Grace Rosen, one
of my students at Brandeis,

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:56.350
and my collaborators at Harvard
Med School, Steve Buratowksi,

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.420
Inwha Baek, and Yoo Jin Joo.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:03.940
And we're making quite a
bit of exciting progress

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.840
transplanting these techniques
from simple bacterial systems

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.520
and using them to
study higher organisms.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:24.180
And so I'm almost out of time,
so I'll finish up the talk

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.030
just by saying a
little bit about why

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.410
we're doing this
kind of research

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.710
and why I think it matters.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:35.370
So I've talked to you today
about these molecular machines

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:39.510
whose operation is essential
to the viability of all living

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.770
organisms.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:47.550
And understanding these
networks of protein interactions

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:51.660
like I showed you on the
slide of the bacteria

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.150
and how these
machines work together

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.820
to allow living
cells to function

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.850
is really one of the major
intellectual challenges

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:02.420
of current day biology.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.490
It's certainly a
part of human nature

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.550
to be curious about
how life works.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.640
And I really hope that
I've conveyed to you

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.640
the tremendous excitement
that I and other scientists

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.770
feel now that we are
making rapid progress

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:23.640
on these challenges through
these new kinds of experiments

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.950
that allow us to
directly observe

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.470
the operation of
individual molecules

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.010
as they go about their business.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:35.160
I want to emphasize, however,
that this kind of research

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.780
does more than just satisfy
our intellectual curiosity.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.730
I'm a fairly old guy.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.470
And during my
lifetime, there have

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:45.810
been enormous advances
in our ability

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.290
to treat disease
and fight infection.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.830
And these advances,
they are things that

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.680
do not come about in isolation.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:01.050
Instead, most major advances
in these areas of medicine

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.990
were built on a foundation
of basic knowledge

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.010
about biology, exactly the
sort of knowledge that's

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.370
produced by research
projects of the type

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.140
that I've been
telling you about.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.910
And there are
particularly good reasons

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:22.140
to think that today's research
on cellular information

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:27.150
processing mechanisms will help
future advances in medicine,

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:30.760
and maybe not even
that far in the future.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:36.000
So even as I speak today, there
are multiple drug companies,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.490
including a couple
right here in Cambridge,

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:43.530
who are starting early clinical
trials on new types of drugs

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:47.880
that are based on RNAs, where
they're actually administering

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.690
to patients--

00:43:52.434 --> 00:43:53.850
yeah, they're are
clinical trials,

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:59.430
so I guess they're giving to
patients already drugs that

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:06.570
are based on modified RNAs
whose goal is to temporarily

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:11.730
reprogram these information
transfer processes to overcome

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.520
infections and other
kinds of diseases.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.300
It's very early days on
these kind of medicines.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:22.320
We don't know yet whether
these approaches will work.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.390
But the early results
are sufficiently

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.990
promising that these
companies are investing

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.570
some serious amounts of
money into testing out

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:32.260
these new therapies.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.445
And in the case of one
of the companies, Sirius,

00:44:35.445 --> 00:44:37.320
it means $2 billion.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.290
So despite the willingness of
these drug and biotechnology

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:51.300
companies to invest money
when a product is in sight,

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.390
they are not in general
able to put money

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.220
into research like
the work that I've

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.150
described, research
that aims to increase

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.070
the basic foundational
knowledge of the field.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:05.160
And the reason for
that is very simple.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.550
It's impossible to predict,
when this kind of research

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.130
is being done, what
its applications will

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.083
be three or five or 10
years down the road.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.870
So if we left the funding
of that kind of research

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.710
to drug companies, as has
been proposed by some,

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.800
we would lose out
on this kind of

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.740
basic foundational knowledge.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.420
This kind of
research would barely

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.340
happen at all were it not for
a collective decision that's

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.850
made by you and me and
our fellow citizens,

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.180
both here in the United States
and in many other countries,

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:49.710
to invest a small fraction
of our tax dollars

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:55.260
into supporting this kind
of basic research, which

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.060
contributes to the common good.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.720
And I feel extraordinarily
fortunate to live in a society

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.390
where that decision
has been made

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.180
and where people take this
kind of enlightened view

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.230
of basic research.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:15.550
And I try to remember that every
day that we go into the lab.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.150
Thank you so much for
coming this afternoon.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.090
And I'd welcome the opportunity
to hear what you have to say.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:25.040
