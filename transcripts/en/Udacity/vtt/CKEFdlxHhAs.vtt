00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.830
Okay, let's try to apply the CSS rules to

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.440
our DOM tree. The first div rule would set the

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.000
text color to red, which is a property that

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.990
cascades down to the Hello text. This next rule makes

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.450
the paragraph contents to be displayed in black and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.090
here's the font part. The rule applies to all paragraph

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.758
nodes regardless of its parent. Hence we change the

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:26.252
color of the text to black for Hello and world.

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:30.919
Finally, we get to our last rule, which tells us that any paragraph node

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.900
that has a div as its parent should be hidden from the render tree. As

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.360
a result, we can prune this branch from our render tree and all we're left with

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.720
is world. So, the final answer is world and the text color is black.
