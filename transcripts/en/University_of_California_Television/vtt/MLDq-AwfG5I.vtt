00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:23.751
(rhythmic, alerting music)

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.180
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.190
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.300
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.870
Our guest today is Dr. Lucy Jones,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.930
who is the fall 2015 Hitchcock Lecturer.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.030
She is a distinguished seismologist
and education advocate.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.690
She has been a seismologist
with the US Geological Survey

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.070
and a visiting research associate

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.050
at the Seismological Laboratory
of Cal Tech since 1983.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.610
Dr. Jones, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.500
- Thanks for having me.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.160
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.020
- I am a native Southern Californian.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.143
I was born in Santa Monica and spent

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:22.270
almost all of my childhood

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.060
somewhere in Southern California.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.090
- Looking back, how do
you think your parents

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.140
influenced your thinking about the world?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.380
- Oh, extremely fundamentally.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.300
My father was a aerospace engineer

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.300
and loved science, loved
math, just all of that

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:42.730
and taught me the joy of math

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.320
at a time when girls were often

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.830
not encouraged to be doing it,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.627
and, he would sometimes, it was like,

00:01:49.627 --> 00:01:51.577
"Yeah, women don't do math,
but you're my daughter.

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:53.380
"Of course you do it."

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.100
And then my mother was
actually a spiritual director,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.070
someone who did counseling
and advice to people.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.070
So I sort of saw both the
value of logical reasoning

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.590
and then the emotional side of
how people respond to things.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.290
- So both sides of the brain
were activated. (laughs)

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.170
- I really see the
influence of both of them

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.961
in the way my career has
ended up playing out.

00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:17.410
- What was it like growing
up in earthquake country?

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.090
Did that affect you at all?

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.510
- Not really, because it was

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.690
a very quite time relatively speaking.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.240
My first memory is an earthquake.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.850
I think I was two years old.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.630
I've actually tried to
reconstruct where it was, and,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.740
my mom, gathering up us children,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.420
getting us in the hall, dropping down.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.560
She covered us with her body.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.713
So I have that distinct memory.

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.210
The biggest earthquake we
had in Southern California

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.720
was the '71 San Fernando
earthquake and I wasn't there.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.470
I was actually living with
my aunt and uncle in Taiwan.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.520
So I got a early lesson
in communication issues

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.750
where the news in Taiwan was

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.523
Los Angeles destroyed by earthquake.

00:03:00.523 --> 00:03:01.356
(Harry laughs)

00:03:01.356 --> 00:03:04.540
So, I try to call my parents,
and I can't get through.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.130
The phone lines are all
jammed and they don't call me.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.760
And I was just terrified

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.800
that something really wrong had happened.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.790
They had no damage at all.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.110
They were waiting for my birthday,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.190
which was four days later,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.420
to call me to wish me happy birthday.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.220
So, found early on, the difference between

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.173
how it's portrayed and
what the reality is.

00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:23.920
- But, before you went to college,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.920
what was it like being a
girl and then a young woman,

00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:31.680
and wanting to do science?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.783
Were you discouraged?

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:37.350
- Well, yeah, the schools
tried to discourage me.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.320
That's why I think my
father was so important.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.260
I had a counselor that, when
I scored a perfect score

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.530
on the science aptitude
test, accused me of cheating

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.100
and made me retake it in front of her.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.820
I had (laughs), I had a math teacher that,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.280
when I got into both Brown and Harvard,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.060
tried to convince me that
I should go to Harvard

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.630
because there was a better
class of men to marry there.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.743
I went to Brown.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.450
So, yeah, the attitude
about women and science,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.070
when I was in high
school, was just assuming

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.630
you couldn't possibly get there.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.620
By the time I got to
college, it was the start,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.940
I started in the fall of '72,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.360
the beginning of the women's movement,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.130
so people were no longer
saying those things,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.980
but the girls had been
discouraged earlier.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.523
So I was always the only girl in my class.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:26.150
Then when I got to MIT,
I was the only woman

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.620
going into geophysics that year.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.700
By two years later, the incoming
class was a third women.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.330
So I was sort of right at the cusp,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.400
just before women stopped hearing

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.190
the sort of things I heard in high school.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.360
- What did you major in at Brown?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.800
- I began as a physics major,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.270
but one of the nice things about Brown is

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.010
there's no distribution requirement,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.750
so you can go in depth at other things.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.950
So I was taking Chinese as my language.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.860
I had lived in Taiwan in high school.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.770
My grandparents had been
missionaries in China.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.210
Half the family spoke Chinese.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.000
So I started studying Chinese.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.830
And you either have to get,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.230
you either drop out or get obsessed.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.970
You can't do it halfway.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.780
And, I got obsessed.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.670
I spent my junior year of college

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.993
back in Taipei studying Chinese.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.850
Took my first geology class
as a senior and fell in love.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.230
Read the 900-page
textbook in the first week

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.955
'cause I couldn't put it down.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.490
- (laughs) And it was
in English, I assume.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.593
- It was in English.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.810
Actually I had tried
to do science in Taiwan

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.600
'cause I knew I was
going to be a scientist.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.170
And I discovered that the lessons were,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.281
all of the technical words
were given in English anyway.

00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:42.670
(speaks in foreign language) equation.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.663
So I gave up doing that.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.300
When I switched from
physics to geophysics,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.159
I actually took the Chinese degree,

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.780
'cause, after my year in Taiwan,
I had all the requirements,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.510
and that left me free to take geophysics

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.520
and structural geology instead
of advanced electromagnetics.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.080
- And why the move from
physics to geophysics,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.560
or any reason in particular?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.393
- Oh, yeah.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:09.140
I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.520
I don't think a lot of college
people, I've, you know,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.140
Maybe I wanted to go
in the Foreign Service.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.540
Maybe I wanted to be a scientist.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.253
Maybe I wanted to be a musician.

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:22.310
So I was still exploring and I
met a couple of geophysicists

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.120
at a breakfast in my dorm.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.390
Talked with them for a few hours

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.990
and they got me interested
enough to take the geology class.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.220
Once I took it, I realized,
this is what I was looking for.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.650
It was a way of using
that scientific analysis

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.310
for things that mattered more.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.660
Instead of building bombs,

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.900
I could be predicting earthquakes.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.080
At least back in the '70s,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.880
we still thought we'd be doing that.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.000
- Then you went to MIT for your PhD

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.100
and what did you do your dissertation on?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.260
- I did my dissertation
on earthquakes in China.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.050
So, when I went to apply
to graduate school,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.723
fluent in Chinese,

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.760
In 1975 there had been
an earthquake in China

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.270
with over 500 foreshocks
and, as far as we could tell,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.350
this was the Cultural Revolution time,

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.270
it had been predicted.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.730
It looked like there were
a lot of lives saved.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.150
So when I applied to
MIT and I spoke Chinese,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.477
they said, "Why don't we
get you studying foreshocks

00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:22.707
"and then, if China ever
opens up, we can send you over

00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:25.480
"and you can try and
understand what happened here."

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.550
It worked with perfect timing.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.930
I had just passed my generals exams

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.700
when the president's science
advisor, Frank Press,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.700
went to China and they
wanted an exchange program.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.690
Here's 60 Chinese ready to go.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.780
So the Americans were scrambling

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.860
to try and do it really quickly,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.090
and I was able to put in this application.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.310
I had just written this
paper on foreshocks.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.930
I'm fluent in Chinese.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.270
The Chinese looked to
be the farthest along

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.530
on earthquake prediction.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.770
Put it all together, and it worked.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.780
And it didn't hurt that the
president's science advisor

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.500
was actually my recommendation

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.340
because he had been the
chair of the department

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.033
when I had started at MIT.

00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:08.880
So, I got to be in that first group.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.430
There were six scientists
and then seven students

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.897
who went to (speaks in foreign language),

00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:16.063
to Peking University.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.020
But I was actually, I went
over with the students.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.710
I was actually the first scientist

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.050
because I was the only
one who wasn't a professor

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.990
and, therefore, could leave
in the middle of the term.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.540
The rest of them had to wait
'til they finished the teaching

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.040
and they came in May and June.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.850
- What was that like?

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.230
You were talking about a time when

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.092
China has not taken off economically yet.

00:08:39.092 --> 00:08:43.000
- And it was still a very,
much more restrictive society.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.620
When I arrived there,
everybody was in Mao suits.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.563
By the end of the first year,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.860
some women might be using colored scarves

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.260
and that was, like, radical.

00:08:55.194 --> 00:08:58.310
I was the 35th American
to arrive in Beijing.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.040
It was a time, they had
just started allowing,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.050
A Chinese woman could be
alone in a room with me,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.400
but a Chinese man couldn't.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.540
When I went to the
Institute of Geophysics,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.860
interestingly, Chinese
didn't have the thing

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.130
about women not doing math,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.630
so there were plenty of women.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.300
One of the women scientists
was assigned to work with me.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.950
It took a while for me to figure out

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.950
that somebody would come in

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.340
and she was off in the
bathroom or something,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.220
and he'd see me there and
turn around and leave,

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.160
come back later when she was there,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.183
and then want to talk to me, not her.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.570
It was a subtle enough thing, I'm like

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.780
trying to finally figure this out.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.552
Then when I went to the
Institute of Geology,

00:09:40.552 --> 00:09:43.470
there were no women, 'cause
women didn't do fieldwork.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.040
That was sort of the prejudice there.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.880
There were two geologists
assigned to work with me

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.100
and, if one of them went to the bathroom,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.520
the other one got up and walked out too.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.810
So it was still a very,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.350
much more politically-restrictive time.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.593
All my mail was read.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.140
But it was also a very egalitarian time.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.340
Nobody was rich, but
nobody was really poor.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.950
In Taiwan you would see beggars.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.513
There were no beggars in China.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.050
My aunt came to visit me

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.550
and she had been born
and brought up in China.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.240
She was so astonished
to see trees because,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.620
when she was in Nantsing in the '30s,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.460
the trees would always get
cut down for wood by somebody

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.573
that would steal the trees
because they were so poor

00:10:27.573 --> 00:10:29.690
they couldn't afford the fuel.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.250
That people were well-enough
off to let the trees grow,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.020
to her, was astonishing.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.350
Of course, now, China's
growing economically.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.260
It's a very different place,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.823
but it's also a much less
egalitarian place than it was.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.433
- You must have gone back
several times as a scientist.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.350
- I actually--
- What are your impressions

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.140
of how it has changed on the human level?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.410
- I haven't gone back since 1983.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.776
- [Harry] Oh, okay.

00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:03.330
- So I went four times and
the last time I was there,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.570
we uncovered a case of scientific fraud.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.890
It wasn't like it was widespread fraud.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.720
It was an individual.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.010
But, it was reflective
of the system at the time

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.740
that it hadn't been caught.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.630
And, partly, the core of
the scientific process,

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.154
is that we attack each other.

00:11:23.154 --> 00:11:24.310
I think it's one of the reasons

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.200
you don't see as many women researchers.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.160
We finally go, hey, I
don't like the environment.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.320
But, a core of being a scientist is

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.820
tearing apart your colleagues.

00:11:34.483 --> 00:11:36.480
That's how we find the truth.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.520
You don't have to be mean.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.323
Sometimes people are, but,
you need to be critical.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.240
As we were discovering
the problem in China

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.840
and trying to explain
it, and we're saying,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.080
you know somebody's gonna review this

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.105
and they're gonna ask
why this looks wrong,

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:52.330
or, looks different from
something in the past,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.260
and they were like, well we
just say this is what we did.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.830
No, they're gonna want to understand why.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.800
He's like, "Why would
they think we're lying?"

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.320
It was sort of this light for me that,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.350
at that time, the culture of China

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.467
where (speaks in foreign language),

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.330
the spirit of the guest, politeness,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.063
is necessary to function in a
society that is that crowded.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.430
So there's a very strong cultural aversion

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.130
to what's necessary in science,

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.930
of sort of the attack on each other.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.770
And, at the time, we saw
it as sort of symptomatic,

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.170
and I thought, I really
need to establish my career

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.190
somewhere other than
China 'cause, at the time,

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.903
I was the woman who went to China.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.670
Of course it's changed radically
now, the whole interchange.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.290
That part is really not
the issue that it was.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.950
But once I got really
established in California

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.533
and then my children were born,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.430
I've ended up never going back.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.990
- I like to ask my guests
about what they see

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.400
as the skills and temperament
to do the work they do.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.970
First let me ask you about
being a seismologist.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.450
You've already identified some just now,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.073
but tell us a little more.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.680
What is the skillset you really need

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.120
and what is the temperament
that is desirable?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.953
- Wow.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.750
A fundamental, I think,
of most scientists,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.610
number one, is being an introvert,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.880
that thinking six months alone

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.120
in front of a computer terminal

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.000
is a good way to spend your life.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.580
And that's a pretty core
difference with a lot of the world.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.360
Because you need to have that ability

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.883
to focus and tune out the other parts.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.886
A scientific advance happens because you,

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:45.780
you've been able to get
down and isolate one factor

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.970
off from everything else.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.970
So you do all your work down in the weeds.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.160
You need to be able to part
out each piece of the weed

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.610
and go, if I change only this one piece,

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.990
this is how the result changes.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.850
And then you've proven what's
the control factor there.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.700
Especially in seismology.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.053
Earthquakes are such a complex process,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.130
it's very difficult to get into the weeds.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.820
There's so many weeds there.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.023
You've gotta have that
ability to dig down.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.183
You need to have that ability to,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.386
God, how do you,

00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:29.443
to part the pieces, to
see where they line up.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.500
I actually think that one
of the really key issues

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.230
is how to ask the right question.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.520
My dad used to like to say this.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.910
There's the set of all of the
questions that we can answer

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.330
and there's the set of the questions

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.460
that people want answers to.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.590
Finding where that intersection is

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.853
is where productive stuff happens.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.520
It isn't necessarily a
general characteristic

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.580
among all scientists, but,

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.668
it's a really important
one to be able to have.

00:14:58.668 --> 00:15:00.090
- What about temperament?

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.050
You've already talked a little about that.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.830
I mean, you've gotta be argumentative

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.100
and stand your ground, obviously.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.113
- Yes, you need to have
enough confidence to do this.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.890
There was a point in my graduate career

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.950
with my thesis advisor,
who was a brilliant man,

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.433
and dedicated, and very critical.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.283
I then was also doing some
lab work with someone else,

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.840
who was more complimentary.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.160
I finally went to my
first adviser and said,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.000
I think it's clear you
don't like what I'm doing.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.180
Professor Brace does.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.520
Why don't I move over?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.607
And he looked at me, he goes,

00:15:37.607 --> 00:15:38.467
"What are you talking about?

00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:41.230
"You're the best student I have," which,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.774
I started crying which was like, oh great,

00:15:42.774 --> 00:15:45.540
just what they need to have from a woman.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.010
We ended up having this long talk

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.140
and he really didn't realize,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.570
because that's part of what you do,

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.530
you direct a person by (mumbles) them,

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.140
and so you have to have that confidence

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.046
to believe that you're right.

00:15:58.046 --> 00:16:03.046
It does require a level of
arrogance to fight for yourself.

00:16:05.156 --> 00:16:07.860
And yet, if you are too arrogant,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.740
you don't hear what the others are doing.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.913
Another core piece of science is that you,

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.900
We are wrong most of the time.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.730
You spend your time
researching things and,

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.410
this is a dead end and this is a dead end,

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.010
and you've proven that this doesn't work.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.797
It's in pursuit of a bigger right, right?

00:16:24.797 --> 00:16:26.070
And we like being right.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.860
Human beings love being right.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.300
But you have to be relatively
comfortable with being wrong

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.580
and that, also recognizing
that every advance

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.700
is disproving something else.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.870
So you have to be
comfortable with uncertainty.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.270
You have to accept, I
believe this is right,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.950
but if some other piece
of information comes along

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.120
that proves it wrong, I need
to be willing to let go of it.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.930
And, at least with scientists,

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.983
we believe that data conquers all.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.810
There was a famous story
from early plate tectonics

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.680
that my professor told me of

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.500
one particular track of
data that's really proved

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.653
the seafloor-spreading ideas.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.500
The famous guy who had
been opposed to the idea,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.750
the data's presented,
everybody's quiet as he exams it.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.620
It was a famous meeting in 1968.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.747
And he finally just looked at
the other authors and went,

00:17:20.747 --> 00:17:23.750
"Congratulations," and
walked outta the room.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.630
It was like so humiliating
he couldn't stay

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.850
and talk with them, but he
could say congratulations.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.590
And that's sort of the ideal of science

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.443
is that you can give it up.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.930
- Throughout your career,

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.713
we talked about the earlier stages,

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.400
how did the glass ceiling
for women come down?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.400
Or was this not a problem as
you did so well in your field?

00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:51.831
- It's a mixed bag.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.470
I'm late enough that it wasn't,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.220
nobody would be explicitly
saying, women can't do it.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.510
10 years earlier, you get told

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.700
you don't get the place in the class.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.100
It goes to a man who's not
gonna get married and leave.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.243
We didn't get that, but, there
is a certain amount that,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.110
I don't have the highest
level of recognition

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.593
in the USGS for my work.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.870
It hasn't really gotten
in the way, though,

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.470
and I think that going to work
for the US Geological Survey

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.393
instead of an academic institution,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.170
relieves some of the problems.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.263
There is a bit more of a structure.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.200
There's a little more objectivity

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.150
to how the promotion process happens.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:42.060
And, I don't need to have
the big academic recognition

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.143
to have the freedom to go and do my work.

00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:51.110
I actually think that in, sort of,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.330
not in the research itself,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.120
I mean the research sort of,

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.100
gender is somewhat less obvious.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.160
I did, at what point, decide I should

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.330
use initials instead of my name on papers,

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.940
so it wasn't obvious that I was a woman.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.069
But my last name is Jones.

00:19:08.069 --> 00:19:09.133
(Harry laughs)

00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:10.050
And then I started getting confused

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.060
with a whole lot of other people,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.093
so I decided I'd better not do that.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.520
But, in the role that I ended up taking on

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.220
of how to communicate about
the science to the public,

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.680
that's where my gender started

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.563
becoming a very positive thing.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.790
There was a rather famous
incident with a big earthquake

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.420
20 years ago, where my husband,
who's also a seismologist,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.260
literally, handed me our baby
in the middle of an interview.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.440
And I ended up doing
interviews carrying a baby.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.810
It caused a huge public
outpouring of support

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.270
because, actually, when
you think about it,

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.150
why do you want to

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.870
talk to a seismologist
after an earthquake anyway?

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:47.900
Knowing what fault it's on

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.460
is not gonna help you rebuild your house.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.630
But knowing what fault
it's on and hear me say,

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.580
give it a number, give it
a name, give it a fault,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.110
I'm saying, somebody
understands what happened to you

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.990
and that makes it less scary.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.233
And then you do it with
the image of motherhood.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.740
You always feel better when
mommy tells you it's okay

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.130
than when daddy does.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.560
So, it actually, I think,
encouraged people's response to me

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.530
and allowed me to be a
more effective communicator

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.950
because of the, sort of,

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.370
emotional connection that people formed.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.260
- What is your most important

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.450
research accomplishment in seismology?

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.860
It's dealing with--

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.410
- [Lucy] I gotta pick one? (laughs)

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.550
- Yeah, yeah. (laughs)

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.410
- Okay. Let me give you two.
- Okay.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.400
- The early stage of my
career came out of China

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.370
and was doing probabilities
of earthquake sequences.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.890
So, there's this earthquake in China.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.250
They did evacuate places

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.100
because there was this big
swarm of earthquakes going on.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.480
What I came to realize
is, they didn't know more

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.363
about those earthquakes than we do.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.540
The fact that they happened,

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.670
increased the probability
of an earthquake,

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.170
but it still wasn't a 50% probability.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.540
And, in fact, they evacuated other times,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.890
oop, no earthquake, go back in.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.370
And in China, you could do that,

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.670
and still get people to
go out the next time.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.650
For us, not because of
scientific differences,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.730
but because of social differences,

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.560
we couldn't respond to the same
information in the same way.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.050
Realizing that wasn't
a scientific question.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.150
So I said, how do I get
that scientific information

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.780
to the policymaker who really
should be making the decision?

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.290
And therefore got into statistics,

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.930
ended up being the one who
created the first assessment of

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.770
what's the chance that one
earthquake will be a foreshock.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.650
It has been the basis of all
of the earthquake advisories

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.330
in the State of California so,

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.920
when we have something
near the San Andreas,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.840
and we make a statement
about the probability

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.370
of the San Andreas earthquake,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.640
that's all based on
research that I was part of.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.090
Or that an earthquake happens,

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.700
what's your chance of aftershocks?

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.290
What pattern are they gonna be taking?

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.250
- And what was the key there?

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.730
What did you determine allows
you to make the prediction?

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.100
- Well, it was actually just
recognizing that we could,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.380
It wasn't that difficult.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.330
It was dividing one number into another.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.410
It was saying, let's
just go use the history.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.340
And when I go and look at the
history, 5% of earthquakes

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.543
were followed by something
bigger within three days.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.620
It didn't seem to be
dependent on the magnitude

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.820
of the first earthquake.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.830
So, that became a relative
quite simple statement

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.290
that we could make and move forward.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.940
Also showing that the temporal decay

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.320
of main shocks after foreshocks,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.160
is the same as aftershocks
after main shocks.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.390
So you could end up saying that

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.470
a foreshock is just a main shock

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.150
that happens to have a
really big aftershock

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.500
and that you can mathematically express

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.530
the full range of earthquake triggering

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.760
with the same set of equations.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.360
So it became a unified approach
to being able to do that

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.330
and then, as we've gone
into computer eras,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.560
you can then do automatic processing

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.163
and immediately say,
these type of numbers.

00:23:01.281 --> 00:23:04.860
So, it was both the scientific analysis

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.850
that allowed us to come
up with those numbers,

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.170
but it pushed me even
more into the social side

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.310
because I'm now working
with emergency managers

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.570
and they're misunderstanding
the information.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.090
We say there's a 5%
chance of an earthquake

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.430
within the next three days and,

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.840
instead of within three days,
it becomes in three days,

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.940
and they're doing things now

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.540
for the earthquake coming in three days

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.800
and I'm going, no, no, no, wait a minute.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.390
Right now is the most dangerous time.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.940
And it sort of gave me
very concrete examples

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.570
of how the communication barrier

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:39.810
was affecting the way in which

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.490
the information could get used.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.580
- You said two of many achievements.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.413
What was the second one?

00:23:44.413 --> 00:23:46.440
- Okay, well then the second one would be

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.220
what's happened in the last decade.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.433
So, with the social
interaction, starting to say,

00:23:53.048 --> 00:23:55.710
we need to do a better job
of getting our science used.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.320
I was given the opportunity to lead

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.240
what was called the Multi-Hazards
Demonstration Project

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.730
to demonstrate how hazard science

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.410
could improve a community's
resilience to natural disasters.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.960
I actually thought, in accepting that,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.910
that I was, basically, walking
away from my academic career.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.083
I said to myself, all right, I'm 50.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.360
Maybe I have another 30 papers to write,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.260
and five of them will be read
and two of them will matter.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.900
But if I don't do it, I
can see the young people

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.000
who are gonna write those two papers,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
whereas if I don't do the
Multi-Hazards Project,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.360
it wouldn't get done, so, okay.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.690
I'll sacrifice my academic
career, go and do this.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.520
We'll see what the
community wants from us.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.070
And, we asked the emergency
managers, land-use planners,

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.510
what do you need from
science you're not getting?

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.300
Got a very strong message
that they wanted scenarios,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.410
and my first thought was, oh damn,

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.710
why did I say I'd do what they wanted?

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.023
That sounds really boring.

00:24:53.032 --> 00:24:53.865
Okay, it's what you want.

00:24:53.865 --> 00:24:55.420
Now how do we do it right?

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.650
And ended up being able
to bring together teams.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.360
Literally, we had over 300 people

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.580
working on our first big scenario,

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.140
which was of a San Andreas earthquake

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.000
in Southern California.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.060
Making sure we did cutting-edge science,

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.980
we did the best we could
in dozens of disciplines.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.970
Instead of saying, okay, I'm an engineer,

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.360
I've got the best possible engineering

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.340
and I'll just grab something
from the seismologist

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.430
and grab something from the economist,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.000
make sure we got the best seismologist,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.920
the best engineer, the best economist.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.110
The result was a much
more concrete picture

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:32.660
of what, the result, what it means

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.060
when we give you a
probability of an earthquake.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.810
We needed the best science
so we had the credibility.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.130
But we needed to do
this integrated approach

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.900
so that people understood it

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.093
and saw how it related to their lives.

00:25:48.761 --> 00:25:51.610
I ended up publishing
40 papers in 10 years.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.050
So I turned out not to be
cutting off my academic career

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.110
and has really led to a lot of

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.330
the recognition I've had recently

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.913
because it's about getting science used.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.950
- It sounds to me like
something in your background

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.210
gave you

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.060
the capacity to have
your ear to the ground

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.830
and not just to listen to earthquakes.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.880
In other words, to be
sensitive, on the one hand,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.890
to the implications of science

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.840
and what you can do with science,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.760
but then, understand the
difficulty of doing that.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.770
Where did that come from, that skillset?

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:32.810
- Well, okay.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.980
I think it's a range of things.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.763
Both my parents played a role.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.270
My mom as being a spiritual director,

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.210
cared about how people were feeling.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.570
That was honored and important
and an awareness around me.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.020
I tended to be more like my father

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.090
and she would be terribly
frustrated with me

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.397
as I was way to analytical for her.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.900
But even my father, he prided
himself on being able to

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.660
find that intersection of
the questions we could answer

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.500
and the questions that
people needed the answer to.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.903
And so, not just the science,
but how it gets used.

00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:12.960
And then, the experience in China

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.010
was a really big piece of doing that.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.320
By seeing that, how the science was used

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.120
was completely different,
not because of the science

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.410
but because of the social settings.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.580
And that, they should
evacuate because they had ton,

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.190
hundreds of thousands of people
dying in their buildings.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.930
We could kill more people on the freeway

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.903
than we save by the prediction.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.340
So that process.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.340
And then, it evolves with the being on TV,

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.893
getting this response to my being on TV.

00:27:50.198 --> 00:27:51.610
And part of that led to me

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.670
being named to the
Seismic Safety Commission,

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.120
which is a state political body.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.823
And I was the only seismologist.

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:04.811
You have emergency managers,
utilities, local government,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.330
all the stakeholders in
the earthquake problem.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.200
And that's where I was
overwhelmed at seeing

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.580
how much really basic
stuff about earthquakes

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.230
that is so basic, the scientists

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.730
don't bother to talk about it, because

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.420
we should be teaching it in 8th grade.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.280
But we don't teach
earthquakes in 8th grade.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.480
Somehow California
doesn't think its citizens

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.610
need to know anything about
earthquakes to live here

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.920
and so we're seeing decision makers

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.660
not using really basic information.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.470
And that was the big lesson

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.000
I took out of the Seismic
Safety Commission.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.860
That we need to step back
and communicate the stuff

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.450
that no longer interests us as scientists,

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.045
but is needed by the population to use it.

00:28:48.045 --> 00:28:51.400
- So, in a way, you're suggesting
that science education,

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.980
if it exists, is really about

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.800
training people to be scientists.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.390
And you're worrying about
the people who need science

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.040
in whatever they're gonna do.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.360
- Right, I mean this is, to me,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.010
I think it's a fundamental flaw in society

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.870
that is being exacerbated
in the internet age.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.226
So, we, generally, treat science education

00:29:11.226 --> 00:29:14.590
as the process of filtering
through all the people

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.370
and finding out who can become scientists.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.940
And even when you hear people

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.550
talking about the need for STEM education,

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.760
it's because we have
all these STEM careers.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.080
It's not because non-scientists
need to think this way.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.870
And yet, we've reached,

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.300
I actually like to compare it

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.000
to what we used to treat reading,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.700
as something that only
the specialists needed.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.980
Then you have the Industrial Age

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.020
and you have the printing press,

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.879
and, instead of getting your information

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:42.490
from the priest talking
to you from the pulpit,

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.950
you're supposed to be reading
yourself in the newspaper.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.460
And you could still support
yourself with that reading,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.360
but you couldn't be part
of the social discourse.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.840
Now we have the switch
into the internet era

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.600
in which we no longer
have the restrictions of

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.460
the cost of publishing restricting
the information you get.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.760
We used to have editors that said

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.910
this is worth publishing and this isn't.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.780
Now, everything's out there

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.580
and you're now supposed to be
making that decision yourself,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.330
whether this is information
worth listening to.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.940
That is science research skill.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.700
The skill of science is how to

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.180
analyze the significance of data

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.780
and determine what part's worth
listening to and what isn't.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.380
How do you know for
yourself something's true?

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.030
A scientist doesn't believe something

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:27.200
because 97% of other
scientists believe it.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.467
We're affected by that.

00:30:28.467 --> 00:30:32.260
We assume that we can do our own analysis

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.500
and figure out whether
or not it's believable.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.410
I believe in climate change
because it's really basic facts.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.840
I can go into a chemistry
lab and watch what happens

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.210
when I have more carbon dioxide in a gas

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.307
and I trap more heat.

00:30:44.307 --> 00:30:47.003
And I can measure the carbon
dioxide and there's more there.

00:30:47.003 --> 00:30:48.250
It's basic.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.160
I do the analysis myself

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:56.010
and, we are not training
non-scientists to think that way.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:00.290
I think that is a huge flaw in our society

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:04.710
that's leading to really
bad decision making because,

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.530
And, we've actually got sort
of a cultural thing right now

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.650
where things don't have to be true.

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.930
We can make them true
because we believe them.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.210
We're just gonna say it's true
until everybody else agrees.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.160
That works for human motivation.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.260
It doesn't work for physical fact.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.900
And we have a really scary
thing going on in society

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.500
that, it's sort of the journalist idea.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.333
There's no truth.

00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:29.370
There's always another side of the story.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.200
Well, to a scientist, there's truth.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.613
You just have a better or
worse representation of it.

00:31:32.613 --> 00:31:36.310
- So what would a curriculum look like

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.163
that taught scientific skills,

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.390
but not just for the scientist?

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.570
Do you mix the students up, that is,

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.960
the ones who wanna be scientists?

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.940
Or, do you have special courses?

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:54.202
- I think that, well, I think
that we need to be doing this

00:31:54.202 --> 00:31:57.120
in elementary and secondary education.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.343
So, this is before you've separated out.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.430
What I've heard of the
next-generation science standards,

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.210
there's a lot of the
right things in there,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:12.060
that, instead of saying the
student needs to understand

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.290
what the parts of the periodic table are,

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.350
the student needs to
understand how to make a model.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.910
The student needs to be able to model

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.660
the nature of chemical interaction.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.900
I've seen some high school chemistry stuff

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.900
where you say, okay, why do
x-rays pass through your body

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.560
but not through the lead apron?

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.880
You come up with a hypothesis and then,

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.240
you do the lecture series
on reaction energies

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.230
and you discover it isn't
'cause it's extra dense,

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.230
it's because it takes,
it absorbs the x-rays

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.290
because the, you can't excite the,

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.900
it takes too much energy to excite the

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.940
electrons up into the upper orbitals.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.723
Almost nobody knows that, and yet,

00:33:01.282 --> 00:33:04.010
so you then modify the hypotheses.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.990
So it's teaching the children

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.560
how to make a model and
assess it against data.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.460
In the process you learn these facts

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.960
that we also think people need to know,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.230
but you do it through
a framework of saying,

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.440
how do I go from a hypothesis

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.443
to an assessment of the hypothesis?

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:28.410
- You've been involved in a
lot of public mass teach-ins

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.810
I guess you would call them, where people

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.100
actually pretend there is
an earthquake or a tsunami.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.510
Talk a little about that,

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.040
because that's another form of education

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.210
when people actually live through an event

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.470
that hasn't happened yet.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.440
- Right, so this was part of

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.130
the Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.870
We said, we're demonstrating how it'll

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.970
actually improve resilience.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.330
Terrifying thing to a scientist,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.120
to define the success by
something we don't control,

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.560
but we are defining it by how
somebody uses our information

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.190
instead of the information we create.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.280
So we were looking at this.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.990
How do we get people to understand

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.740
what we discovered about the earthquake

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.620
in a way that'll change behavior?

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.810
So we turned to the social sciences.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.940
Actually, there's a lot
of information there

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.723
on how people get information.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.710
We created the first, what was called,

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.640
The Great Southern California Shakeout

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.130
as a method of getting
people to understand

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.730
what was in our scenario
of a San Andreas earthquake

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.930
which was also called
the Shakeout Scenario.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.690
One of the big ones we heard is that

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.500
people do what they
see other people doing.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.260
Visual reinforcement really
affects people's behavior.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.930
It's why fashion works.

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:46.750
We see other people wearing things.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:47.920
So we needed to find a way of

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.763
seeing other people
preparing for an earthquake.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.600
So we focused on the Drop,
Cover, Hold On drill.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.083
It's a good thing to do.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.000
Plenty of Californians didn't
got to Californian schools,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.250
so they never learned it.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.393
And it's a very strong visual.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.310
Sitting under a table,
you look sort of idiotic,

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.240
but it's very clearly getting
ready for the earthquake.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.860
So it was that visual reinforcement.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.560
They also tell us people do what,

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.090
They need to talk with
others they care about

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.800
about what happens to make
the decision to do it.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.000
So we had the drill in a way that

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.130
schools and businesses,
we tried to encourage them

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.070
to do the drill on the same day.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.480
So you'd come home from work and,

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.450
mommy, I had a earthquake drill today.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:37.050
Oh, I had one too.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.373
You start talking about it at home.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.170
So we worked with the social scientist

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.550
and tried to create it.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.773
We intended it as a one-time event.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.010
We ended up getting 5 1/2
million people in the first event

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:54.230
which is 1/4 of the population
of Southern California.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:57.760
You get 1/4, five million
people to do the same thing,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.120
elected officials take notice,

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.010
and the State of California
came to us and said,

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:03.773
we wanna make this an annual event.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.450
My first thought was, oh,

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.550
no, I've already given you a year, enough!

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.423
It's been really interesting
watching how it's developed.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.598
We had over 26 million
people last year, in 2014,

00:36:18.598 --> 00:36:22.570
in the Shakeout, somewhere
across the country.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.240
We've seen it spread to a lot of regions.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.030
We've seen it a bit
disconnected from the science,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.710
and that part, to me, I'd like to try and

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.940
get people to reconnect.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.834
So we did it, first time, off of

00:36:32.834 --> 00:36:35.980
the particular science scenario.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.720
And in Southern California, it's still

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.740
very much tied to that scenario.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.150
As it spread elsewhere, they
don't have their own local ones

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.140
and I'd like to see more people, really,

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.750
try to develop those
comprehensive scenarios

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.900
so when people are doing
the drill, it's connected to

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.555
what the science tells them
is really gonna happen.

00:36:52.555 --> 00:36:57.555
- You feel that there is
a communication problem

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:02.403
between what scientists know
and, beyond these drills,

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:10.670
getting people to
understand the implications

00:37:10.732 --> 00:37:14.090
of what might be a
catastrophe or a disaster.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:18.060
Talk a little about that
because I think you're saying

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.950
that we need better narratives,
better storytelling,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.480
to get people to have a
handle on what's happening.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.010
- Well
- or what might happen.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.960
- What will happen.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.560
And I think that that's it.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.107
We actually understand a lot
about what was happening.

00:37:34.107 --> 00:37:36.700
And many people, especially
with earthquakes,

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.250
it's true to a,

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.240
In a lot of the disasters,
they think it's capricious.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.400
This building was
damaged, this one wasn't.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.170
Who knows what's gonna happen?

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.100
Well, in fact, this one's on softer soil.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.033
This one had retrofitted its foundation.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.610
It's a very complex pattern.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.000
But we, in fact, really
understand very well,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.380
which buildings and where
the damage is gonna be.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.283
So it was, how do we get
people to believe this?

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.700
One of the things that's been in the way

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.340
is the siloing of science.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.497
You have the seismologist that tells you

00:38:15.497 --> 00:38:17.370
where the shaking's gonna be.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.940
You have an engineer that tells you

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.850
how your building responds.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.470
We have an economist looking
at social interactions.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.251
We have an infrastructure.

00:38:25.251 --> 00:38:28.330
And the pieces are hard to connect up,

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:29.610
and especially on an earthquake

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:31.720
that doesn't happen that often.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:36.720
What we did in creating our
scenarios was to create a story.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.220
And, even more, a
scientifically defensible story.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:44.010
So, when you look at how
people make decisions,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.100
they do it because of stories

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.853
and because of their
emotional connection to it.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.330
Scientists hate stories.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.640
We are trained in graduate
school to believe,

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.940
and it's true, stories are misleading.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.340
Stories tell you as an anecdote.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.240
The whole point of science
is to not be mislead

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.400
by anecdotes and make sure
that it happens every time.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.450
So, we're trained, early on,

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.190
to reject stories and never use them.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:15.780
And yet, that is how most
of the rest of the world

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.520
communicates and makes decisions.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.610
So what we did in the scenario process was

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.080
try to bridge that gap.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.160
It's only as I look back that I realize

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.330
that that, what was
important about the process,

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.440
so that, when you have the,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.410
And the hardest part was actually

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:36.550
getting the scientists
to agree to the story.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:39.840
Because, in doing a
scenario of an earthquake,

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.530
I have to make a lot of assumptions.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:42.908
I assume exactly and,

00:39:42.908 --> 00:39:44.870
I've made so many assumptions,

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.880
the next earthquake will not be that one.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.880
Some of the details will be different.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.202
And that's where we live, is
in the details, as scientists.

00:39:52.202 --> 00:39:55.580
We had a really difficult time
with the scientists going,

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.067
you can't be sure that's what it is.

00:39:57.067 --> 00:39:58.720
And we're going, we don't need to be sure.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.220
We need to say it's plausible.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.570
That became the most
important word we could use.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.910
Plausible became the bridge

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.220
between the scientists
living in our uncertainty

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.440
and knowing all those possibilities,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.820
to the people who needed
a concrete narrative

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.390
to be able to act on it.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.840
And plausible became our bridge.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.730
- So let's develop this
a little further, so,

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.010
if you were working up a scenario

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.640
and you said, well, an earthquake will hit

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.660
this block or this area
of houses in Oakland

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.330
sometime in the future.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.060
Then, is the point to say,

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.160
well, if there is
structural damage to houses,

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.040
then the following happens?

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.213
People aren't gonna have a place to live.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.470
People may abandon their property.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.846
Are those the kind of--
- That's the kind of things

00:40:54.846 --> 00:40:56.681
but it's actually a pretty
long narrative going,

00:40:56.681 --> 00:40:58.553
okay, here's the fault.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.750
The Hayward Fault is very capable of it.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.440
What would the pattern of damage,

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.780
What is the pattern of shaking gonna be?

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.600
Because that's what seismology does.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.130
Many people think that an
earthquake happens at a point.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.150
It's at the epicenter, right?

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.870
No, it's over a surface.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.740
So, what is that distribution of shaking,

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.160
and how we're gonna,

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.230
We know bad soils give you worse shaking.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.720
But, we have to model
exactly what the slip is

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.170
and it's gonna be some different pattern.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.210
All right, so but we pick
one of those patterns.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.790
This is plausible.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.640
Now we've got these neighborhoods
that have this impact

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.410
and this damage to this buildings

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:39.860
and this damage to this infrastructure,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.160
and that means we've now got,

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.160
a population of renters
who've lost their housing

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.640
and they've also lost their
job because there's no water

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.670
and, therefore, that
restaurant had to shut down.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.330
Okay, I'm gonna give up
and go stay with my family

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.690
down in Southern California.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:41:59.940
I'm going out to Pacoima.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.660
We start losing population.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.710
And how to make the connections

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:07.530
between all of those
things in a plausible way.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.740
The reality is, it's
a very complex system.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.320
The final one will be different.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.580
But this is the type of information.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.909
And then we go back and go and say,

00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:19.810
we'll lookit, that really key issue

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.210
became the loss of water.

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:23.900
If we could get our water pipes fixed

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.700
so that we kept those jobs,

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.350
people would be willing to do it.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:29.730
We end up saying, usually

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.660
there's three or four or five things

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.490
that seem to be the biggest problems.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:38.840
And then we can take it to
elected officials to let,

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.750
urban planners and go,
if you don't fix this,

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:45.460
you have the potential
of losing your society.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.800
And then we go and look at places

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.960
like New Orleans after Katrina.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.960
Show them what happened
to the GDP of New Orleans.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.560
It's a very compelling argument.

00:42:55.539 --> 00:43:00.160
- You were an advisor to
the mayor of Los Angeles

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:05.150
and the goal, what you decided was

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.700
to identify certain vulnerabilities

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.380
and show them in scenarios
like you just did.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.490
- Well, yes, it was an
interesting process.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.730
So we had already done
the Shakeout Scenario.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.160
We had some really clear things

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.430
that were really big problems.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:26.430
We had a new mayor, very
energetic, intelligent man

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.923
who wanted to address
some of the big issues.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.330
I actually negotiated this
out with the deputy mayor.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.783
It's a very interesting process.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.930
We couldn't go in and say,

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.130
we're gonna solve the earthquake problem.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.820
That's defining the problem to fail

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.570
because the problem is so big,

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.970
there's no way we can deal
with it all in a year.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:52.730
So let's define areas that
are really critical needs

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:56.640
and that we know we have
a path to a successful,

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.120
We have something we could do
that would make a difference.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.460
So we only chose areas that we knew we had

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:07.040
something to do that would be
able to look like a success.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.893
That was the political necessity.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.810
But then we had the freedom to

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.090
explore the range of problems.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:20.990
So what we ended up
recommending out of the process

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:24.230
had some of those easy
fixes that, well not easy,

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.630
but easily-defined fixes,
that we knew would be needed,

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.260
but then, in many cases,
we were able to go

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.970
quite a bit beyond it.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:36.190
But we didn't try to go out
and solve other problems

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.370
because you concentrate your effort

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.210
where it's gonna make
the biggest difference.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.590
That's a hard thing for a scientist to,

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:48.793
sort of, political necessity
and the pragmatism of it.

00:44:50.177 --> 00:44:52.130
We're much more inclined to say,

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.893
here's the range of problems,

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.280
and narrowing down and
doing concrete actions.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.160
- You've worked at various
levels of government.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.160
And, in all state and the city,

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.093
and one thing that strikes me

00:45:08.093 --> 00:45:10.227
that is common to all these levels

00:45:10.227 --> 00:45:13.540
is they don't have a long-term perspective

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.170
because of the next election.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:17.980
And so that's a problem
you have to deal with

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.960
'cause you're talking
about fixing the pipes

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.700
that bring the water
and the pipes are wooden

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.350
and they cross the San Andreas Fault.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:31.638
So sometime in the future,

00:45:31.638 --> 00:45:32.800
- Right.
- and it's not gonna work.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.200
- Well, it's an interesting thing.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.480
There was a really
interesting editorial in a

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.780
downtown LA newspaper after
Mayor Garcetti announced

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.010
the Resilience by Design Program.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:50.640
And they were saying, politicians always

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.280
walk away from the earthquake problem

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.940
because, if you go and decide
you wanna spend money on it,

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.530
either there won't be an earthquake

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:58.700
before you're out of office,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.520
and then why did you waste our money?

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.620
Or, there will be an earthquake
before you're out of office

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.860
and your changes won't have
had time to take effect,

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.253
so, you look ineffective.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.140
So, mostly it gets ignored.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.120
And then they proceeded to
go and give Mayor Garcetti

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.372
huge political credit for
having worked on something

00:46:17.372 --> 00:46:19.880
for which he didn't get political credit.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.528
So it's been sort of
an interesting dynamic.

00:46:22.528 --> 00:46:25.980
I think that I was accepted in,

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.720
really because of an individual's insight.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.520
I credit Mayor Garcetti a lot

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.847
for the courage to take this on

00:46:32.847 --> 00:46:35.770
and to just say, I care about Los Angeles,

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:40.050
and I don't care if it's not
gonna happen before I'm done.

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.930
I'm gonna work on this.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.840
So, it took political courage

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.133
and it took the vision to
see what the issues were.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.080
What's very very encouraging,

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.960
is watching how much status and credit

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.910
he's getting for having done it.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:57.710
So we're now seeing
other political leaders

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:01.880
wanting to start tackling
with the issues as well.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.900
There are numerous cities in Southern,

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.840
in Los Angeles County, that
are looking now to adopt

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.563
the same regulations that Los
Angeles has just put in place.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.640
So, yes, it tends to be a problem.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.650
The political world forces you

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.360
to look at a pretty short timeframe.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.810
But, the best elected officials

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:24.300
realize that the future of
their city is bigger than that

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.990
and to do the planning that
carries the city forward.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.600
You need to have that to get this to work.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.600
- It'd be interesting to identify
some of the elements here

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.210
that you have learned in this process

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:43.080
of awakening people to the
long-term problems of earthquakes

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.360
because, obviously, the
insights you've gathered

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.520
apply to things like climate change.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.440
The first thing that comes to mind

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.020
in the case of climate change,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.530
less so in the case of earthquakes,

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.780
is the politicization of the process,

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.780
which is to say, the science
is bad or, it's inaccurate

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.180
and this group or that group
will fund disinformation.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:14.970
So it's not just that people don't know,

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.840
but there is disinformation
being produced.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.230
- I see a couple of issues tied into this.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:25.830
One is that, people don't feel empowered

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.210
to make the decision for themselves.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:29.050
They believe in something because

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.850
they believe the person who's saying it

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:34.980
rather than their own
ability to analyze it.

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.500
But I also see a lot of
science communication issues

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.580
that feed into this.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.010
One is the way scientists
talk about things.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:45.780
We talk about our uncertainty.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.840
When we go to give a
result to a colleague,

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.260
we never start by saying, I think this.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.610
We start by saying, I
set out the experiment

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:56.570
and I considered these variables,

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:59.420
and I recognize this level of uncertainty

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.650
and, given all this, it
suggests that the answer is X.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:06.250
When a scientist says,
the data suggests this,

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.330
that's actually an
extremely strong statement

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.220
from a scientist.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.730
But that's not the way
it's heard by other people.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.480
When we talk that way, we start by saying,

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.820
here's all the uncertainty.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.630
Here's all the things that aren't known.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.200
The non-scientist hears
this message and goes,

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.570
they don't know what
they're talking about.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.230
They're hearing the uncertainty?

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.842
So that's a chunk in how it's done.

00:49:26.842 --> 00:49:30.300
And, what I did with the city,

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.080
and that's the whole process
of doing the scenario

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.150
as opposed to probabilities
of earthquake occurrence,

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.290
I'm focusing on what we know,

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.240
which are the consequences
of the disaster,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.080
rather than on what we don't know,

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.410
which is when it's going to occur.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.654
So, as scientists, we're more interested

00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:50.660
in what we don't know, 'cause
that's where the research is.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.880
So, exactly what percentage
of climate change

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.640
comes from human activity?

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.560
That's an interesting scientific question.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.560
But when you talk about it that way,

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.550
you aren't emphasizing that, in fact,

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:05.570
a big chunk, we know
comes from human activity.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:06.403
We know.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.520
But we don't say it that way

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.160
because, as scientists, we communicate.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.930
The other issue is that we need to,

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:15.240
The sociologists tell us that

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.790
when you give a problem without a solution

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:23.600
you increase anxiety and
reduce the ability to act.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.590
If you want people to take action,

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:27.140
you need to combine the pro,

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.830
you give the problem,
here's what you do about it.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:32.670
And, that's what happened
with me in Los Angeles.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.100
I said, here's the problem
and here's what we can do.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.200
Fix these buildings, get this water.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.323
On climate change, we need to say,

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.590
The scientists are uncomfortable saying

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.460
it's somebody else's
job how to deal with it.

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.020
We know we gotta reduce carbon,

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.660
but that's somebody else's job.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.870
Whereas, I think if we say,
lookit, here's the problem,

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.260
and what we can do about it is

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.940
develop better renewable energy resources,

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.530
so that we don't have
to keep on doing this.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.210
And, besides, we're
running out of oil anyway.

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.080
Eventually, we're gonna burn it all up.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.770
We're gonna have to move there

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.780
and the only question is
how much social disruption

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.850
we go through before we get there.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.990
Now you've got, oh,
there's something I can do.

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:13.750
I just make sure my elected officials

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:16.810
promote development of
renewable energy and, besides,

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:18.725
that means we'll be in the driver's seat

00:51:18.725 --> 00:51:20.370
in the brave new world when

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.100
oil is no longer in control of things.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.510
- What you're describing is the need for,

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:27.600
I'll call it, a mediating class of people

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.700
who know the science and

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.900
who have worked in the political process

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.810
and part of their task would be

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.114
to create the narratives

00:51:37.114 --> 00:51:40.420
that make sense for the political leaders.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.110
Is that fair?
- It's only part

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.380
of the problem because, there
are a certain number of these.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.650
There are people who get
their science degrees,

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:49.250
go become congressional fellows,

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:53.430
are staffed to different
types of elected officials,

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.960
and have been in that
sort of interpretive role.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.880
So we've sort of already
got that function.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.180
What we don't have is the scientist

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.113
willing to reach out to meet them.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.480
So it's more than saying,

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.350
we need someone to interpret it.

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:12.000
Often we're trying to
create scientific products

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.550
that better address the answers.

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.060
So, what I've done here,

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.620
we have our scientists
saying what the risks are.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.700
We have people in the political sphere

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.570
that can accept science.

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:28.260
But we needed to make
this product that said,

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.682
here's what the implications

00:52:30.682 --> 00:52:33.023
of these scientific hazards are.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:37.710
We sometimes call it risk translation,

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:40.600
how to go from the hazards to the risk,

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.950
which is an interdisciplinary

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.713
scientific development process.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.260
It's because it's so interdisciplinary,

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.070
it's very hard to get it moving,

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:54.610
or who has the mission for it?

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:56.960
The US Geological Survey
has supported me doing this,

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.570
but, fundamentally, our
mission is the hazards.

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:03.830
I push the comfort zone by
going in in this direction

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.630
and we're making a decision now.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:08.620
Society needs it too much.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.250
We have to keep on going.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:12.540
But it's an uncomfortable process.

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.080
- You have talked about communication.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.920
You've talked about
the failings of science

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.170
with regard to this dimension (mumbles).

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:24.020
What about leadership,
political leadership?

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.230
You've worked with the mayor.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.640
That experience was very successful.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.120
Can you identify some
of the characteristics

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.040
that you think political leaders

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.920
will have to have in the
future to manage this?

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.890
They're gonna have to
have a science education

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:43.500
it sounds like, but also, be sensitive to

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:47.420
the kinds of solutions
and the political costs

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.250
in navigating that terrain.

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:51.290
- I think that what we need is

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.540
intelligence to be able to
make all of these connections.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.700
And, a commitment to a future vision.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.603
To be able to move beyond
just the election cycle.

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.910
I'd say, in general, we're seeing

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:10.623
a certain amount of
this at the city level.

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:14.150
Mayor Garcetti loved to tout a book called

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.440
If Mayors Ruled the World,

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.373
which is just a recent analysis of,

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.710
sort of where the progressive, innovative

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:25.290
stuff is happening is
often in these, the mayors

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.170
especially in the larger cities.

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:30.633
Because once you get up to
higher levels of government,

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.360
I think there's sort of more

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.370
tensions pulling in different directions.

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:38.370
You get to the federal
level, we're a money,

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.810
feds tend to be a money source,

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.980
but it's very hard to do a solution

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.940
because it's just too big a problem.

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.590
And, especially, when you look at

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.343
issues around natural disasters.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.710
The rate of earthquakes is not increasing,

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:55.560
but the number of people
living in earthquake areas is.

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.270
And the rate of meteorologic
disasters is going up.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:01.363
This is going to be a
major issue in our future.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.270
The emergency managers like to
say, all disasters are local.

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.900
In the end, it's what
happens in your community.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.122
It's individuals and neighborhoods.

00:55:12.122 --> 00:55:15.423
If all disasters are local,
all resilience is local too.

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:18.220
If we really wanna get this through,

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:22.083
it's about my pipes, my buildings,

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.570
and my neighborhood and my community,

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:29.610
and, will life be so
awful that my community

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.820
is no longer worth staying with?

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.800
So it's both dealing with the
very practical physical things

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.597
but also, making it a community
that people wanna stay in

00:55:38.597 --> 00:55:41.510
that's worth fighting for
and is worth helping recover,

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:43.580
'cause it's not gonna be easy.

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.120
- Well, on that note, Dr.
Jones, I wanna thank you.

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.640
And, by the way, I wanna congratulate you

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.760
because, for all of your
work, you were just awarded

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.420
the Samuel J. Heyman
Service to America Medal

00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:01.670
in Citizen Services last
week for your work in LA.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:03.559
- It was really amazing.

00:56:03.559 --> 00:56:04.880
As I said, I thought that I was

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.630
walking away from recognition

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.880
'cause I just saw it
as too important to do,

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.330
and it's been very satisfying,

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:15.330
as some of these accolades
have come through

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:18.150
and recognizing people want,

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:20.360
People want science.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.860
We can make a difference and

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.550
we just have to figure out how to

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:25.700
bridge the gap in communication.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.220
- Well, on that very positive note,

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.440
thank you very much for
being on our program.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.667
And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:32.667 --> 00:56:35.358
for this Conversation with History.
