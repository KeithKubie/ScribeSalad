just curiosity and one of the great

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130
just curiosity and one of the great
 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.680
just curiosity and one of the great
challenges to us is how do we resist the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690
challenges to us is how do we resist the
 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.240
challenges to us is how do we resist the
temptation to use genetic technologies

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250
temptation to use genetic technologies
 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.300
temptation to use genetic technologies
and that we master in human beings for

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310
and that we master in human beings for
 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:59.440
and that we master in human beings for
reasons that are less than life-saving
