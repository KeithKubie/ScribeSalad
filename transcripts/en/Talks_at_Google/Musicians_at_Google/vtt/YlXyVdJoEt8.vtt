00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.190
BEN JAFFE: Yeah, last year
we celebrated our 50th

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.270
anniversary, and we actually
celebrated

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.830
here at Carnegie Hall.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.300
And we're back again
this year.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.740
It's a different celebration
for us.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.420
It's not just a celebration of
our incredible history, but

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.480
it's a celebration
of our future.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.030
This is the first time in 50
years that we've made a

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.700
recording entirely of our
own compositions.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.060
And actually, most of them we
played for you today, and it

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.340
looked like you liked them.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.612
So they like them.

Johnson from New

Orleans, Louisiana.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.690
From a great musical family.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.330
His great uncle--

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.020
RONDELL JOHNSON: My
great uncle, yeah.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.930
BEN JAFFE: Great uncle, Kid
Joseph, was a bass player at

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.900
Preservation Hall.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.080
This is Freddie Lonzo, he played
with my father many

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.340
years ago in the Olympia
Brass Band.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.460
Joe comes from one of the great
musical families in our

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.320
city, the Lastie family, just
about everybody in his family

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.910
is one of our city's
great musicians.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.380
Mark and I have known each
other since high school.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.940
We went to the New Orleans
Center for Creative Arts in

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.990
New Orleans together.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.370
And both of his uncles, Wendell
Brunious and the late

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.840
great John Brunious, have
both been leaders of the

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.290
Preservation Hall Band.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.510
And now it's a fourth
generation?

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.730
Fourth generation New Orleans
musician, Mark Braud, is up

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.940
there in that chair.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.980
And sitting next to him,
the scoundrel.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:30.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:30.812 --> 00:21:32.550
BEN JAFFE: He keeps
telling us that

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.130
this is his 81st birthday.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.090
We don't believe him because
none of us have actually ever

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.610
seen his birth date.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.850
But we'll believe
you, Charlie.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.460
Because last year we
celebrated his

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.260
80th birthday here.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.110
That's right, last year we
celebrated his 80th birthday

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.650
in New York and we're
back this year.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.855
Today is actually Charlie's
81st birthday.

00:21:52.855 --> 00:21:54.570
CHARLIE GABRIEL: 18
years old, man.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.617
BEN JAFFE: 18.

00:21:56.617 --> 00:21:57.086
18!

00:21:57.555 --> 00:21:58.805
CHARLIE GABRIEL:
Don't do this.

00:22:02.245 --> 00:22:06.900
BEN JAFFE: And Charlie comes
from, again, one of our great

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.140
musical families
in New Orleans.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.070
He's also a fourth generation
New Orleans musician and he

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.770
has three generations of
musicians that are continuing

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.750
to play in New Orleans.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.560
Down there at the end,
on the piano.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.110
Known this gentleman for
many, many years.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.470
He's been a member of the
Preservation Hall on and off

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.190
since 1982.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.870
And he knew my father real
well back in the day.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.850
And that's the professor,
one of the most

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.390
talented musicians I know.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.670

down there on the end, the

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.280
saxophone and vocals.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.480
This is one of our
dear friends.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.290
That's Mr. Clint Maedgen
down there.

00:22:57.491 --> 00:23:02.150
BEN JAFFE: And yeah,
we became friends.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.820
I don't know if you all are
familiar with this gentleman

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.910
Jim James and this band
My Morning Jacket.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.800
If you're not, they're
incredible and they've become

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.590
part of our life.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.540
They're from Louisville,
Kentucky, and we met them down

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.390
in New Orleans.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.820
Jim came and did a recording
with us for a benefit project

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.970
post-Katrina.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.010
And out of that first recording,
I mean, the moment

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.320
we met we immediately struck
up a friendship.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.890
And he invited us to go out on
tour with My Morning Jacket.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.580
So a New Orleans jazz
band touring with a

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.220
rock and roll band.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.120
And it was amazing.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.440
It was awesome.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.180
It was a great experience for
us and it opened up a whole

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.090
new world to our music.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.120
And it has led us to here,
today, to me and Jim producing

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.860
our newest project, "That's
It!", which I think they have

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.610
some copies back there
for y'all too.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.970
Yeah, it's unbelievable that
after 50 years of playing

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.070
repertoire from the greats, from
Jelly Roll Morton, from

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:10.020
Louis Armstrong, from King
Oliver and all the greats,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.960
we're now having an opportunity
to create a new

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.300
book of standards.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.060
And that's something that
we're real proud of.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.430
We all cherish our history
and our traditions.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.520
And for those of you that have
been to New Orleans, you know

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.640
how important that is to us.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.220
It's almost--

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.620
without music there
wouldn't be a New

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.865
Orleans, really, you know.

00:24:33.865 --> 00:24:36.090
And it's because of these
gentlemen's family that we're

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.430
all up here on stage today.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.100
So if you don't mind, with
that being said, Charlie,

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.640
would you mind if we all sang
you a happy birthday song

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.890

00:24:53.613 --> 00:24:55.569
