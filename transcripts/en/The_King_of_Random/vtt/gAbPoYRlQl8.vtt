00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.820
In this video, we'll show you how to
take your extension cord to the next level.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.940
Preventing it from breaking,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.380
preventing it from tangling,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.100
and adding an on-off switch.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.720
[Music]

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.640
Extension cords are one of
the greatest inventions ever.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.770
They make it so you don't have
to use your tools right next to the outlet,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.110
but there are still
some improvements

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.830
that I think can be
made to extension cords,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.900
and today we're going to show
you what some of those are.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.980
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.440
We're going to test a method
for wrapping an extension cord,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.460
so it doesn't get tangled
when you stretch it back out.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.300
Next, we'll stretch
out a steel spring,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.880
and add it to the plug to give
the cable more durability.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.760
Then we'll splice a switch
onto the other end

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.440
so we can turn the power
on or off whenever we want.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.660
I think most people
who have used extension cords a lot

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.880
can agree that the number one
problem is how often they get tangled.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.040
That gets really annoying.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.080
You spend a lot of time trying to get
knots out of your cord before you use it.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.720
What I want to show you first
is the very best way to wrap

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.120
an extension cord to
prevent it from getting tangled.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.519
You can see I can just pull the cord.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.900
it's not getting stuck,
wrapped up in itself.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
The method I use
to wrap the cord

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.980
is something that I learned
was called the Roadie wrap.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.560
Roadies are the ones who
set up band equipment on tour,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.920
and they have to manage all
sorts of cables every single day.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.820
This is the method they use
to keep their cables tangled-free.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.400
Starting by holding on
to one end of the extension cord,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.100
the cord is coming out the
back of my hand toward my body.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.390
The basic idea is
that as we wrap the cord,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.020
we'll be alternating which
direction the loop goes.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.219
We alternate the direction
of the cord loops by alternating

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.500
the direction we grab
the cord with our hand.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.080
For the first loop,
my thumb is pointing to the left,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.220
and we simply make a loop in the cord.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.230
For the second loop,
my thumb points to the right,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.250
and instead of just
making another loop,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.020
we twist the cord around.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.800
We now have our extension cord
passing in a loop,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.380
and then going behind itself,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.220
while it's being wrapped.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.100
Moved back to the thumb pointing left,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.080
add another loop.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.420
Back to the thumb pointing right,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.520
add another loop where
the cord passes behind.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.280
Normally when you wrap an extension
cord in a loop or around your arm

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.760
like a lot of people do,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.220
the cord is getting twisted as it wraps.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.820
Alternating with this method,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.700
it twists one direction and then it
twists back the other direction.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.600
So the net result is that the cord
isn't being twisted at all.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.340
Another nice thing about this method
of wrapping is how well you can throw

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.780
the entire chord to have
it extend out without it tangling.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.940
[Music]

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.440
Not a single tangle!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.020
It's beautiful!

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.060
Now even the very best cord
wrapping job in the entire world

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.240
can become tangled

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.460
if the chords just hang loose,
and then fall on the floor,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.540
and wrap around each other additionally.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.280
The next tip is very simple.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.880
There are Velcro tabs specifically
designed for attaching to things like

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.580
extension cords and hoses.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.220
They're cheap and they work really well.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.380
This Velcro strap attaches
onto the cord in one spot,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.680
and then wraps around the whole
cord to keep it nice and organized.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.060
To use, just past the narrow end through 
the slot while wrapped around the cord,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.860
and tighten it down all the way.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.800
The strap will now hold itself in place.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.880
You can wrap it around
your extension cord,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.740
and it sticks right onto itself.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.680
Cord will stay bundled up.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.820
You can hang it up on the wall,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.300
you can drop it down on the floor.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.940
Either way, it's gonna stay
just the way you wrapped it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.640
Sometimes after extended use,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.780
extension cords can start to break
and fray where the cord meets the plug.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.680
This is usually a result of the cord
being pulled sideways too hard

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.440
while it's plugged into an outlet.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.440
We want to reinforce the point
where the cord meets the plug,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.060
and to do that, we'll use
a small compression spring,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.660
some pliers and some electrical tape.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.280
The basic idea is that
we will wrap this spring

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.220
around the head of
the plug and part of the chord.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.400
This will give the cord
a flexible reinforcement

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.660
that will make it bend over a larger area,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.480
preventing it from breaking down the line.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.040
Now this spring is a good size
for fitting around our chord,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.300
but it's round too tightly
to be able to get on easily.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.120
So the first step is to take a couple
pairs of pliers and stretch it out

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.080
until the gaps in between
each loop can fit over our chord.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.580
Our spring is now stretched out to
a point where we should be able to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.000
wrap it around our chord.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.060
Let's trim off one end of the spring.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.980
On the other end of the spring,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.790
we'll widen the loop until it's large enough

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.780
to fit all the way around
this bottom portion of the plug.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.060
If cutting the end of your
spring leaves a sharp edge,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.240
you may want to smooth it out with a file.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.900
[Music]

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.220
With one end of our
spring cut and trimmed,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.580
and the other stretched out so it
should fit over the bottom of the plug,

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.900
we can now begin wrapping
the spring down along the cord.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.340
[Music]

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.220
With the spring wrapped around the
bottom of the plug and the first few

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.780
inches of our extension cord,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.780
now let's use a little bit of
electrical tape to secure it in place

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.340
so it doesn't unwind.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.740
[Music]

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.620
We  know how to wrap
our extension cord,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.500
we know how to keep it nicely wrapped,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.860
and we know how to prevent the end
that goes into the wall from breaking.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.940
But there's still more
we can do to really improve

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.800
the usefulness of the extension cord.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.280
Take this lamp for example.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.140
It's a good little lamp.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.860
Puts off a lot of light,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.480
but it's cord is about 1 foot long,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.040
so any time you use it,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.900
you are going to need an extension cord.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.700
The other downside of this lamp, however,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.740
is that there's no on/off switch.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.840
If it's plugged in, it's turned on.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.640
There's no way to turn it off
other than to unplug it.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.500
If what you've got plugged
into your extension cord

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.440
will need to need to
turn on and off often,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.300
you may not want to always
unplug it just to turn it off.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.980
What we're going to do is install a switch
into the middle of our extension cord

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.860
so we can turn it on or off without
having to unplug it on one end or the other.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.960
With this 3 Amp 125 Volt inline switch,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.120
all we need is a Phillips head
screwdriver and a razor blade

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.540
to install it into our cord.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.080
To start, remove the two screws
using the Phillips head screwdriver.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.700
[Music]

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.240
The switch then opens and you can see 
everything that's going on on the inside.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.000
We want to carefully remove the outer
covering of this extension cord about

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.320
as wide as our switch is long.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.900
Very carefully with the razor blade,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.800
I'm cutting through just the outside layer
of the plastic.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.640
[Music]

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.560
With the outside casing cut on both ends,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.540
we now want to slice down the middle,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.680
and carefully remove
this entire portion of the cord.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.000
[Music]

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.800
Let's now take the black wire,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.900
cut it in the middle,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.420
and then strip off the black plastic casing

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.160
back to just behind where
the screws are in our switch.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.000
We now want to fit the red and green
wires down along the inside of the switch,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.420
and wrap both ends of the
black wire around these screws.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.270
With the copper wires
wrapped around the screws,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.960
we need to tighten the screws down.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.820
[Music]

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.780
With our wires attached to the screws,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.340
we can now put the cover back on,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.940
and screw that down in place.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.800
[Music]

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.100
With our switch installed,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.040
we now have the power to turn things
on and off without unplugging them.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.860
[Music]

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.420
A properly wrapped, secured,
and reinforced extension cord

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.180
with an on/off switch installed
right where you need it.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.000
In my opinion,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.660
this is now the ultimate extension cord.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.500
Guys, there's still more for you to see.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.940

transport you directly to our last video,

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.169
and you should go check it out.

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.790
The box at the bottom will show you what 
YouTube thinks you should be watching next.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.040
This lovely bomb here in the
middle will subscribe to our channel

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.540
so you never miss a video.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.540
