00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.890
Factor 4y squared
plus 4y minus 15.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.039
So we don't have a leading
coefficient of 1 here.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.640
And it also doesn't look
like we can factor out a 4,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.099
since 15 is not divisible by 4.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.640
So what we're going to try to
do, is factor this by grouping.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.120
In the factor by
grouping, we want

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.770
to look for two numbers
whose product is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.490
equal to the product
of 4 and negative 15.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.130
We explained it in other
videos why this will work.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.360
But let's just look
for those two numbers.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.510
So the product is going to be
equal to 4 times negative 15,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.240
which is negative 60.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.720
And their sum needs to be equal
to this 4 right over here.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.150
So a plus b has got
to be equal to 4.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.670
And if we can figure out an
a and b that satisfy this,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.550
so we can break up this
4y into an ay plus a by.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.370
And then we can
factor by grouping.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.800
Now the first clue here is
that the product of the numbers

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.650
is negative.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.900
So that means that a and b
must have different signs.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.376
And since a plus
b is equal to 4,

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:10.750
we know that the--
and I want you

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.820
to think about
this a little bit.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210
We know that the difference
of their absolute values

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.660
must be equal to 4.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.160
Let me just make that concrete,
that little statement I just

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.960
told you.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.810
If I were to say, well,
let's just say that I have,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.160
let's ignore this for a second.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.659
Let me just take
two simple numbers.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.190
If I have negative 2 times 3.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.480
Those two, the product is going
to be equal to negative 6,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.014
and then their sum, negative
2 plus 3 is equal to one.

00:01:37.014 --> 00:01:39.120
Notice, their
product is negative,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.210
so they had to have
different signs.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.740
And their sum is 1 and
they have different signs.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.060
And one is also the difference
of their absolute values.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.090
The difference between
the absolute value of 3

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.620
and the absolute
value of 2 is one.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.870
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.453
So this gives us a
clue of essentially

00:01:55.453 --> 00:01:58.830
how far apart are the
absolute values of the number.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.470
So let's think about all
of the factors of 60.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.090
And then remind
ourselves that we're

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.720
looking for numbers
that are 4 apart,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.400
numbers whose absolute
values are 4 apart.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.540
One has to be positive,
and one has to be negative.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.420
So the factors of 60,
you could do 1 and 60,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.070
you could do 2 and 30.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.070
I'm going to run out of
space doing it this way,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.236
let me write it as a column.

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:29.450
So you have 1 and 60, you have
2 and 30, you have 3 and 20,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.360
you have 4 and 15, you have
5 and 12, you have 6 and 10.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.850
This looks pretty tantalizing
since these are 4 apart.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.890
And then that looks
like we are about done.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.740
7 doesn't go into it, 8 doesn't
go into it, 9 doesn't go do it.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.620
We're done.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.830
Now already, we already
talked about the difference

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.020
of the numbers, the absolute
value of the difference

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.530
has to be 4, so 6 and 10
looks pretty tempting.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.340
But let's just go through all
of these numbers over here.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.510
So the possible sums here,
if we make 1 positive and 60

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.769
negative, then it's going
to be a negative 59.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.060
Remember, I'm making sure
that we have different signs.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.400
If this is positive, this
could be positive or negative.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.911
And this is negative
or positive.

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:12.410
I wrote it upside
down here, to show

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.820
that their signs are different.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.970
So it's either going to be
negative 59 if this is positive

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.060
and this is negative, or it's
going to be positive 69 if this

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.590
is positive and
this is negative.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.080
So it's negative or
positive 59, I should say.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.870
This right over here is going
to be negative or positive 28.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.530
You see that the absolute
value of, the difference

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.115
of the absolute values of
these numbers keeps showing up.

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:43.990
Now we know that we want
to go to 4, so let's

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.340
just cut to the chase
and go to 6 and 10.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.400
If we take positive--
and we want

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.010
them to add up to a positive 4.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.490
So the larger number
should be positive.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.590
So if we take positive
10 and negative 6,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.820
their sum is definitely
going to be equal to 4,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.680
and positive 10 times
negative 6 is negative 60.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.900
So let's break it up like that.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.200
So what we could do is
break up the 4 as a sum,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.490
break up the 4y as a sum
of a negative 6y and a 10y.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.490
So let's do that.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.870
So 4y, I'm going to write
as negative 6y plus 10y.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.280
If you add these two
together, clearly you get 4y,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.490
and then we have the
rest of the problem here.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.390
We have the 4y squared minus 15.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.054
Now we're ready to
factor by grouping.

00:04:34.054 --> 00:04:35.470
Let's group these
first two terms,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.710
and we can because they
have common factors here.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.224
They're both
divisible by 2 and y.

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:41.640
And then we're going to group
these two guys, both of them

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.680
are divisible by 5.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.970
So if we factor this
first one over here,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.730
let's factor out a 2y over here.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.580
4y squared divided by
2y just gives us a 2y.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.870
And then negative 6y divided
by 2y is negative 3, right?

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.540
y divided by y is 1, negative
6 divided by 2 is negative 3.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.030
Then let's factor
this guy over here.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.560
We can factor out a 5, so this
is plus 5 times 2y minus 3.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.660
And now lucky for us, we
can factor out a 2y minus 3.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.805
So we have 2y minus
3, times 2y, plus 5.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.605
And we are done.
