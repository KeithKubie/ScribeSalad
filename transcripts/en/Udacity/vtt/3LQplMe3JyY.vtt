00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.469
We want you to understand that you may
have to outsource your development

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:04.560
to a developer.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.200
As part of that,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.000
you should have a solid understanding
of what it takes to build an app.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800
Having a good foundation will
allow you to make sound business

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.630
decisions over time.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.870
You may also have big ideas for
what you want your app to accomplish, so

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.780
we want you to understand what
comes standard in a platform

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.150
versus what would need
to be custom built.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.970
The latter will take a lot
more work to implement.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.870
We should probably go
over some vocabulary.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.890
Our next two text nodes will
cover some basic vocabulary

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.189
you should be familiar with
before you talk with an engineer.
