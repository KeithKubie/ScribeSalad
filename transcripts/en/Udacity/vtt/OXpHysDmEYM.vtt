00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.520
Today, network file systems are an

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.490
important component of any computing environment, be

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.130
it a corporate setting or university setting.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.610
There are companies that have sprung up

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.070
such as NetApp solely to pedal scalable NFS products. In this lesson, going

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.480
beyond NFS we learned a lot of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.870
concepts pertaining to the design and implementation

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.850
of distributed file systems, in particular

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.830
how to make the implementation scalable

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.770
by removing centralization and utilizing memory

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.090
that's available in the nodes of a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.530
local area network intelligently. Such techniques

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.070
for identifying and removing bottlenecks are the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.390
reusable nuggets that we can take and apply to the design and implementation

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.330
of other distributed subsystems in additions to file systems themselves.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.190
Overall, in the set of papers that we studied in

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.710
this lesson module spanning, GSM, DSM and DFS,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.480
we discussed the design and implementation of subsystems that found creative

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.390
ways to fully utilize memory that's available in the nodes

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.520
of a local area network.
