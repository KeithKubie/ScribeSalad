00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.520
Files are stored in something called the Hadoop Distributed

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.960
File System. Which everyone just refers to as HDFS.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.550
As a developer, this looks very much like a

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.900
regular file system. The kind you're used to working

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.290
with on a standard machine. But it's helpful to

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.930
understand what's going on behind the scenes. So that's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.120
what we're going to talk about here. Imagine we're

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.130
going to store a file called mydata.txt. In HDFS.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.210
This file is 150 megabytes. When a file

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.140
is loaded into HDFS, it's split into chunks which

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.940
we call blocks. Each block is pretty big. The

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.830
default is 64 megabytes. Each block is given a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.550
unique name, which is BLK, an underscore, and

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.910
a large number. We'll call ours block one, two,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.460
and three. And in our case the first block

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.720
is 64 megabytes. The second block is 64 megabytes.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.810
The third block is the remaining 22 megabytes, to make

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.960
up our 150 megabyte file. As the file is uploaded

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.950
to HDFS, each block will get stored on one node

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.990
in the cluster. There's a Damon, or piece of software,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.070
running on each of the machines in the cluster, called

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.150
the DataNode. Now clearly we need to know which blocks

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.760
make up the original file. And that's handled by a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.060
separate machine, running the Damon called the NameNode. The information

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.770
stored on the NameNode is known as the Metadata. That's fine

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890
as far as it goes, but there are some problems with

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.960
this. Take a look at the diagram and see if you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.590
can spot where we might run into trouble. For example, let's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.870
say there was network failure between the nodes, or a disk

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.670
failure on a DataNode. Do you think it's an issue that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.250
not all of the DataNodes are used to store data? Or

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.850
could it be a problem that that the block sizes differ?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.690
Two of them are 64 megabytes, but one was only 22 megabytes. Finally, do

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.490
you think it'd be a problem if we had a disk failure on the NameNode?
