MALE SPEAKER: Hi,
I'm Alex [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.460
from the Google
Developer Relations team.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.990
I'm happy to announce a new
feature in the Google Maps

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.590
JavaScript API.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.340
It's called the Google
Maps Data layer.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.810
Now the Data layer
lets you display

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.980
arbitrary geospatial data.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.160
It's a container for any
kind of geospatial data

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.850
you can get can in JSON format.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.300
Now what's really
cool about this

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.870
is that you can make amazingly
amazing data visualizations.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.390
So one of the
things is, it really

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.345
makes it simple to import
GeoJSON data to display

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:30.650
on your map.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.400
You can also style that GeoJSON
data using custom attributes.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.870
So it gives you
a declarative way

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.390
of displaying a different
visual experience

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.630
for your user, which
is really nice.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.460
Also you can dynamically
change the display client side.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.830
So you can do things like,
use touch input or mouse input

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.634
to change the way
your map looks.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.550
And the other thing
that's really, really cool

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.520
is you can import GeoJSON data
from multiple data providers

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.202
and display the mix
together on a map.

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:58.660
Why don't we have
a look at how you

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.180
do that taking a
couple of different

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.340
feeds, and we'll show it on
this really cool map of the US

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.470
census.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.690
OK, so here we have
a beautiful example

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.180
where I've used US
census data to give me

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.500
a nice layer on top of my map.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.210
So what we have here is we
have a visual representation

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.910
of the people over 25 that
graduated high school.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.630
So I've pulled that data in, and
I've added a mouse [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.255
so that when I move my mouse,
say I move it over California

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:26.370
here, you see it pops up this
little card that tells me

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.635
81% of people in California
graduated high school.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:31.510
And of course, there's
a color grade in here.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.400
So the colors
represent the number

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.230
of people that is
coming from that data.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.370
Now what's interesting
about this particular visual

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.580
representation is,
these are actually

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.890
two GeoJSON feeds
that we've combined.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.977
So the first feed gives
me the state outline.

00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:47.810
So the actual shapes
that make up the states

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.050
are from one feed, and the
coloring of the populations

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.390
comes from the second feed.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.500
So this is an example of mixing
a bunch of different feeds

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.920
together on a single map.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.350
OK so now let's take a look
at some of the different ways

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.480
that you can import
GeoJSON data from how

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.440
you might have done
it in the past.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.630
So maps [? dot ?] data
differs from previous data

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.490
feeds like KML layer.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.500
It allows you to
dynamically create things.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.940
You can even use drag and drop.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.630
So let's just have a look
at a little example here.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.480
I've got a file here
containing GeoJSON data,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.980
and I can just drag
it onto the map

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.970
and dynamically
create new objects.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.600
So I've created all these
markers in the browser client

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.100
site.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.340
It's all rendered there
from a simple GeoJSON file.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.030
Since rendering
happens in the browser,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.530
you can change the
styling dynamically.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.176
So let's take a
look at an example

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:34.800
where we are going
to Chicago and we're

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.270
going to change the
styling based on zip code.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.910
OK, so here we've taken
a small GeoJSON file

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.810
containing the zip
code boundaries.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.849
And we've used it
to style our map.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.390
You'll note that
each of the polygons

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.929
has a different fill and
a different strike color.

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.470
We've also added a
mouse [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.380
So if I click on one
of the zip codes,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.050
it changes from red to blue.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.660
Now this is a really
simple example of things

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.850
that you can do
fully client side.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.640
The beauty of this
new data layer

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.270
is that you can style,
place, and modify

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.430
your content or client
side without having

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.080
to go back to the server.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.240
So from simple data
visualizations,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.470
to really complicated
visualizations of complex data,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.090
you can all do it client side
with this new data layer.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.500
The thing about this is, as
a JavaScript Maps developer,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.060
this is an awesome
new feature and I

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.020
think you'll find
it super useful.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.220
As always, we'll really
happy to get your feedback

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.280
on the maps
[? dot ?] data layer.
