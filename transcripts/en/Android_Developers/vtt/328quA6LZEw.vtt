[ethereal music]

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.000
Menon: WeVideo was founded
with the vision

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.600
of making digital storytelling

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.866
and video creation accessible
to anyone, anywhere.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.200
When we first started on
the Android, we clearly saw

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.100
that there wasn't a compelling
application

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.800
for a video creation.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
Combine that with the fast
growth of Android platforms--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.766
we decided to go Android first.

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.933
Since then, the majority
of our investment

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.533
in smartphone development

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.666
has been on Android.

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.366
What separates us from other
applications on Android

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.666
is that we give you the full
capability of the device

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.366
in our application.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.400
You're able to take
different clips, trim them,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.733
and we were able to do that
because the Android platform

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.666
gave us access
to the OpenGL air,

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.533
which allowed us to do
real-time rendering

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.833
and previewing.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.733
Since the launch
of our new application,

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.100
mobile monetization has done
very well for us.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.533
The revenue on Android has
doubled every two months.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.700
Almost 85% of our users
are on Android.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.000
When we launched
the material design,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.933
we decided to redo
the application

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.200
and redo the user experience

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.833
and take it up
to the next level.

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.800
Tsaregorodtsev: Many of
the material design concepts

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.566
really resonated with us.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.000
We were really able to create
a delightful experience

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for our users.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.466
And as a result,

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:13.633
we saw 100% increase
in user engagement.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:15.166
Being able to reply to reviews

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.666
is a great feature.

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.766
Every day, we go through
every single review

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.400
and analyze the data
that's coming in.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.933
And most importantly,

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.800
if there is somebody
who's having a problem,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.500
we can help right away.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100
And it's such a great feeling
when you can see someone

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.600
who gave you one-star reviews

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.633
converting them
to four or five stars.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:35.266
We love running experiments
on the Play Store.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.800
For example,
just recently,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.100
we updated our screenshots

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.566
with the colors, the text,

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.800
and we saw increase
in conversion

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.233
up to 50%.

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.300
Making the app available
in different languages

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.400
is critical to you to succeed
in global marketing.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.333
We saw increase in our installs
up to 200% in regions

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:54.733
have utilized our app

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.433
and the Play Store
subscriptions.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.800
Recently, we revisit
our purchasing flow in the app.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.066
We wanted to see
if we can convert more people

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.633
to buy our premium products.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.133
We decided to change colors
of the background,

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.400
font size
of all of the elements.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.800
We were able to deploy quickly

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500
and the trade just
was in a few days.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.633
And we saw the increase
up to 60%

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.066
in conversion rate.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.566
Menon: The Android platform has
been a great platform

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.866
for us to get
a regular application.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.866
With a fast app publishing
process,

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.533
Play Store listing experiments,

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:25.833
feedback from users,

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.800
and monetization
using Google Wallet,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.733
this has led to a tremendous
increase in success

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.366
with installs and revenue.
