00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.350
PRAMODA: I'm Pramoda.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.400
GILLIAN: I'm Gillian.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.310
PRAMODA: Gillian.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.280
And our game is--

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.140
You know how on the iPhone you
have those games like Jetpack

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.290
Joyride or something.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.120
It's like one of
those games that

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.010
has a player moving
infinitely, and you

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.580
have to click to make it
jump or go left or right.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.280
It's kind of based off of that.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.300
That was our inspiration,
except it's in 3-D. Well,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.980
I guess you should just play it.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.400
GILLIAN: We'll demo it.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.970
PRAMODA: She'll just demo it.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.782
GILLIAN: There's music.

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.634
We don't know how loud
it's going to be just

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:46.550
from my computer but--

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.962
PRAMODA: Hopefully it'll play.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:49.878
AUDIENCE: Make sure you
maximize [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.160
PRAMODA: So the cube is moving
infinitely in the plain.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.730
You can collect coins, and
that'll make your score go up.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.120
If you touch a cactus,
those are like enemies.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.150
That'll destroy your lives.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.589
You start off with five lives.

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:09.130
What she just picked
up is a capsule.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.840
So you see the little
bar at the bottom,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.940
that's how much fuel you have.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.990
You can only fly with
just hitting space bar.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.889
Fly for-- OK.

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:19.180
GILLIAN: You can go underwater.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.930
PRAMODA: Yeah, you can
also go underwater.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.080
So there's coins
under the water.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.110
So you go under there, and
you can collect secret coins.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.830
And then you fly by
pressing space bar,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.320
but if you see the bar down
there, if you run out of fuel

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.536
you can't fly in
the field anymore.

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:37.660
And so you just keep going.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.566
I think we touched a few
cactuses along the way.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.232
GILLIAN: Did we?

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.310
You can lose a life.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.154
PRAMODA: You lose a life
by touching the enemies.

00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:46.570
GILLIAN: I'll get
another capsule.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.090
PRAMODA: Now she can fly.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.040
We have three worlds.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.880
So this is the desert
world, and then she

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.310
is going into the snow
world which also has coins.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.800
GILLIAN: It's pretty simple.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.470
PRAMODA: Then obviously
the coins spin around.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.600
This world isn't as long
as the desert world.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.090
You can see the forest
world showing up already.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.667
There's also coins in
the air, but you can only

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:19.750
get them if you have fuel.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.790
You have to know
exactly where they are.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.680
There you go.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.650
I think our high score is 20,
so if anyone can beat that--

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.510
GILLIAN: I'm about to
run out of fuel, as you

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.677
can see on the bottom left.

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:38.885
And you have this thing at
the top where you click it

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:42.240
and it mutes the music.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.080
These are conifer trees.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.625
PRAMODA: So you
can run into them.

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.300
GILLIAN: You can hit them.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.970
The grass is actually
compiled, so you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.520
can see how you're kind
of submerged in the grass.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.630
PRAMODA: So it's like
going through a meadow.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.950
And it's funny because
the grass is actually

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.310
a bunch of little trees.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.780
You can't see it now, but
if you zoom in infinitely

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.790
you'll see the tiny
little trees swaying.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.135
It's really funny.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.260
GILLIAN: You basically get
to the end of the world.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.940
PRAMODA: And then that
is the end of the game.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.690
And then I think you
will fall infinitely.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.990
GILLIAN: You will [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.865
PRAMODA: You just fall
infinitely into space.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.180
That's our game.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.940
GILLIAN: So we can talk about
some challenges that we had.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.077
Basically we split up the
work into two separate groups.

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:28.660
I mostly worked on
building the world,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.140
because I found the terraforming
tool of Unity fascinating.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.510
I spent hours doing that.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.370
It's so cool.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.980
So a lot of the more
complicated things--

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.550
you can see the
canyons and the cactus

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.779
and the trees-- were
imported from Unity Assets.

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.320
All of them were
free, although there

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.630
are some that are up to $40.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.180
And basically the ground,
the terrain I hand-created,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.340
but the canyons and cacti
were created and imported.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.220
But I did hand-place all of
them, and I hand-designed it.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.880
The river-- Let's
see if I can zoom in.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.860
The river was interesting
to create because--

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.880
It's not that hard.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.650
Unity makes it
relatively easy for you,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.050
but to get it to have--

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.420
To apply the
physics to the river

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.450
properly is kind of complicated.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.330
You can't really tell because
of the way we have it,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.970
but there's actually water
everywhere in this world.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.420
And if you dig deep enough,
you will get a pool.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.170
So I can show you that.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.010
AUDIENCE: It's like
real life, or something.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.310
You just keep digging
and there's water.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.672
GILLIAN: So, let's see.

00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:40.380
Inspect-- this is how
you do the terrain.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.948
Here, can you hold that?

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:46.471
You can actually do
this, and then you

00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:49.596
can see water coming up.

00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:52.070
You can make it go
up like that, but I

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.552
don't want to make it ugly.

00:04:55.552 --> 00:04:58.360
So I had a lot of
fun doing that.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.370
And then she worked
on the coding parts,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.560
as far as the game track.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.880
PRAMODA: I did mostly the code.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.289
There's not really that
many different codes.

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.330
I don't know if you can--

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.855
Where are the scripts?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.930
Right.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.040
So there's really only a few
simple codes over there, but--

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.390
So the coins, they have
their own little code

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.690
so that they spin
around, which--

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.130
That's the code for the player.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.920
Just the player.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.760
So the weirdest part
was to get the cube

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.330
to always move infinitely.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.440
So originally you could move
it forward and backwards,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.140
but we just had to
figure out how to make it

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.760
so it never moves backwards.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.870
That's not an option.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.900
So that was just
something different

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.520
that I had to figure
out how to do.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.370
And then this is just a
bunch of different codes.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.810
Actually, the
hardest part I think

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.060
was doing the health
bar, to make it go down.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.410
So obviously you can
make integers go down,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.490
but to make that visually
happen was really weird.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.860
But you just have to use a local
scale or something like that.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.700
So that was pretty simple
after I figured it out,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.540
I guess, but in the
process it was hard.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.640
GILLIAN: Overall, the game
was really fun to make.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.580
We actually worked on it a lot,
on our own time after class.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.830
She was here until 11 last night
at my dorm room working on it.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.865
PRAMODA: Because we were like--

00:06:23.865 --> 00:06:27.395
GILLIAN: It was maybe 30%
done until last night.

00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:29.870
PRAMODA: And it really
came together last night.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.590
And we were like, what
could we add more?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.131
I think we just kept on going,
and at a certain point in time

00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.640
we were like, we
should stop now.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.164
This is enough.

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:38.830
That's about it.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.955
GILLIAN: That was our game.

00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:41.620
AUDIENCE: What
were the controls?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.495
GILLIAN: Just arrows.

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:44.572
The left and right arrow,
and then space bar.

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:46.030
PRAMODA: Yeah,
that's all you have.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.570
Space bar to jump, until
you run out of fuel,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.125
at which point it locks
the space bar so you can't.

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.250
GILLIAN: You can't go up
anymore, until you get a--

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.920
AUDIENCE: Do repeated space
bars make you go higher?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.220
PRAMODA: Yeah, you continue to--

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.050
GILLIAN: It's like a force every
time you hit the space bar,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.133
so you can go pretty high.

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:00.836
PRAMODA: So you continue to fly.

00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:01.788
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.850
AUDIENCE: Any other questions?

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.500
GILLIAN: Yay.
