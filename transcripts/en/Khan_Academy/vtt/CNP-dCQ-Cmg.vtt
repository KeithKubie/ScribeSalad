00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:01.893
- In the first video where we introduced

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:05.112
the idea of diffusion and concentration gradients,

00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:07.268
we had a container with only one type of particle in it,

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:08.696
we had these purple particles.

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:11.456
And in our starting scenario we had a higher concentration

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:13.842
of the purple particles on the left-hand side

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:16.359
than we had on the right-hand side.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.187
And so if we looked at its concentration gradient,

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.315
so the concentration gradient went from

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.848
high concentration on the left

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:26.494
to low concentration on the right.

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:28.234
And we saw what happened.

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:30.723
Since you have more of these particles here

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:31.795
and they're all bouncing around

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.735
in different directions randomly,

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.095
you have a higher probability of things moving

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:38.230
from the left to the right than from the right to the left.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.181
You will have things move from the right to the left,

00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:42.724
but you're going to have more things, so you'll have

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:45.236
a higher probability of things, moving from left to right.

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:47.714
And so if you let some time pass, then they become

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.117
more uniformly spread across a container.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.950
They have moved down their concentration gradient

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.959
to make things more uniform.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.731
Now, what's interesting about this diagram

00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:00.693
is I've introduced a second particle,

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.179
these big yellow particles.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.199
And we see that their concentration gradient

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.370
is going in the other direction.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.276
So we have a low concentration,

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.016
in fact we have no, on the left-hand,

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.872
we have none of the yellow particles

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.415
on the left-hand side, and we have

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:17.016
a high concentration on the right-hand side.

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:20.584
So their concentration gradient goes from right to left.

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:22.450
And the whole point of this video

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.537
is to show that each particle moves down

00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:27.606
its unique concentration gradient,

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:29.577
assuming that it's not blocked in some way,

00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:32.270
it's going to move down its unique concentration gradient

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.394
irrespective of what the other particles

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.252
are going to do, for the most part.

00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:38.314
And so we see the yellow particles are going to move

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:40.988
from high concentration, to low concentration.

00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:42.312
They're going to move,

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:45.116
they're going to diffuse from right to left.

00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:47.746
And once again, there's no magic here.

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:48.845
It's not like this molecule is saying,

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:52.133
oh, I've got seven other of my friends here,

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.710
it's getting too crowded, I see them, I'm claustrophobic,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.487
let me move over to the left-hand side.

00:01:56.487 --> 00:01:57.729
That's not what's going on.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.142
They're just all randomly bouncing around

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:01.854
and when you're in the starting position,

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.986
when you're exactly like this, there's no probability

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:07.485
because of a yellow particle moving from left to right,

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:09.357
because there aren't any yellow particles here.

00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:13.229
While there's a probability that some of these particles,

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.269
in a certain amount of time, some of these yellow particles

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.339
could move from right to left.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.743
And so they'll keep doing that

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.830
until you get to a stable configuration

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.383
where now you have an equal probability

00:02:24.383 --> 00:02:27.042
of things moving from left to right, and right to left.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.306
And that's going to be true for each of these particles.

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:32.857
So the real takeaway, you'll hear in a biology

00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:35.444
or a chemistry class, of things moving down

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:38.047
their concentration gradient, and you might say,

00:02:38.047 --> 00:02:39.986
and their unique concentration gradient.

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:42.553
As you see, the yellow particles' concentration gradient

00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:44.909
goes in the other direction as the purple particles,

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.848
but there's no magic to this.

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:48.870
You just have to imagine a bunch of things

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.193
just bouncing around in a bunch of different directions,

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:53.393
and then what would just naturally happen?

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:55.380
You would naturally have a higher probability of moving

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.829
from high concentration to low concentration,

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.492
than from low concentration to high concentration.
