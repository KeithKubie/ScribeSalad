00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hello everyone.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.310
Welcome to another edition of Authors at Google.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.360
We're very excited to have Renee Montagne
with us today, co-host of "Morning Edition."

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.640
I don't know how many of you are actually
up at that time of day.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.640
[laughter]

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.640
So, maybe?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.640
I don't know.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.640
I usually am.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.920
So, as I'm driving to work, I usually listen
to the show.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.420
So I'm very excited.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.520
The book is "This is NPR, The First Forty
Years."

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.800
It's great for me to be able to put some faces
to the voices that I hear on NPR every day.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.390
And it's great to hear some of the stories--all
the exciting people they meet, all the great

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.389
events they cover.

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:42.059
So, no further introduction.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.389
Renee Montagne.

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:44.389
[applause]

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:46.479
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Thank you very much.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.479
Thank you, Mike, for the introduction.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.230
I hope you, I'm imagining those in this room
probably do listen to "Morning Edition," or

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.999
you certainly listen to NPR shows, which is
what this book is about.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.729
And in order, in fact, to talk about the book
is to talk about NPR.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.060
But I just have to say one thing, which I
will say to anybody, I love Google.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.060
[laughter]

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.990
And I actually, it's almost hard to imagine
living without it and doing what we do without

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
it.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.050
And one of the interesting things about doing
this book, which, of course, now it's the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.050
forty-first, this now it's the 41 years of
NPR.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.030
When we were doing this book, like not last
year, but the year before, and each of--.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.680
There are four decade chapters and they were
given to four different authors to do the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.310
chapters.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.260
It was such an amazing walk down like, remembering
what life was like without Google basically,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.270
and everything else that's come onto the scene
in the last, sometimes five years.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.060
The last ten, the last decade anyway.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.330
And things like we now have--I'm jumping ahead
here, but I just wanna say--we now have, we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.830
now have people we interview, we ask them
to record themselves on their iPhones.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.340
And it's like something out of like, the future,
to be able to say there's a microphone and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.099
the quality, unless you really screw up, will
be really good.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.080
And do you mind just recording yourself?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.049
I mean, that, I couldn't have made that one
up even years ago.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.810
So, anyway, I'm delighted to talk about the
book because I think for those of you, and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.469
there is, I was thinking maybe it would be
a group where nobody would've been born by

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.469
the beginning of NPR.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.239
But the fact, some of you look like you were
born back then.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.719
So, some of you might recognize some of what
I'm going to talk about.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:43.219
As I say, there were four, lots of contributors
and introductions--Susan Stamberg, Cokie Roberts.

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:49.900
Susan talks about--I wasn't there--but in
1971, in May 3rd, when the show went on the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.390
air, in the weeks leading up to that, they
had meetings.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.779
This is how NPR began.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:56.779
They had meetings.

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:01.510
They all sat on the floor, figured out what
the mission was and many things that they

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.230
were, as they were trying to literally bring
into being this entity, National Public Radio.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.400
And they sat on the floor.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.629
And Susan had told me that story once or twice
and I never realized that until she wrote

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.249
her introduction, that the reason that they
sat on the floor wasn't because they all were

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.279
a bunch of hippies, but because there were
no chairs.

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.279
[laughter]

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:28.829
NPR had, was that, they hadn't literally bought
the chairs yet when "All Things Considered"

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.959
first went on the air.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.219
And so, there were these contributions by
all kinds of people.

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.510
And as I say, the four chapters, and for those
of you who have books, I'll tell you literally--if

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.999
you wanna know--what's say, my writing or
Ari Shapiro's writing.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.999
It's the white pages.

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:53.669
[laughs] And then all the rest are maybe really
the best part, are these inserts, the side

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.639
bars, which are personal stories from a whole
range of people--how they got to NPR, what

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.819
they did.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.379
There's also transcripts, which are nice.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.029
And they picked ones that did work on the
page, but it's interesting to see some of

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:18.570
this stuff written down when the whole essence
of what we do is for the ear and is in storytelling

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.710
mode.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:26.370
So, I'm just gonna begin with my own chapter,
which is the 90s, which is an era of NPR that

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.920
was a great turning point for NPR.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.570
I mean, I think it's safe to say that up until
the end of the 80s, NPR was a well-kept secret.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.880
I mean, it was, what's that expression for
when like, a few people know about something

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.510
and they're really dedicated, but the world
at large isn't that familiar?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.870
I traveled through Texas to do a story on
a tornado where you could travel for seven,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.100
eight hours and never pick up an NPR station.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.920
And also through Nebraska in 1988, the whole
western side of Nebraska, you could not pick

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.290
up an NPR station.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.290
And that all changed in about two or three
years.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.420
There's no place you can go now and theoretically,
if you're not right in the mountains, pick

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.340
up an NPR station.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.390
And one of the things that changed it, actually,
was our foreign coverage.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.030
We were very, to the degree that NPR was known,
people knew Cokie Roberts.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.020
I mean, she made her name on NPR before she
went over to ABC.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.790
They knew Linda Wertheimer.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.680
They knew the people who covered Washington.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.750
And to the degree that it was known and very
respected by the time, I was freelancing at

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.210
that time, it was because of that sort of
coverage.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.630
That and a certain amount of reaching out
to the small towns of the country in innovative

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:57.190
ways, because whereas we now have stations
like KPCC that have full service news departments,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.910
in those days, pretty much we didn't even
have that.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:07.290
I mean, we had a Washington contingent and
we had, in the 80s, I can't give you an exact

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.240
count, but there were maybe ten staff reporters
in the country, maybe.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.580
I mean, I can remember there was America Rodriguez
here in Los Angeles.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.580
That was her name.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.760
She went on to other things, but America Rodriguez.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.970
There was Scott Simon in Chicago.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.280
There was, I mean, you could name them practically.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.360
In fact, I might be wrong.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.590
There might have only been five national correspondents.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.350
And there was no foreign, there was one foreign
correspondent and that was, it was Robert

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:42.380
Siegel in a chunk of the 80s because we had
a location and still do, although it's not

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.010
Bush House anymore.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:51.610
We had studios in Bush House as of, I think,
1979 or '80.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.390
Sylvia Poggioli, for instance, I used to chatter
with her.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.710
You had the fun of talking with people that
I know very well, but I really see 'cause

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.500
NPR, all our friends are people in other places.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.040
You become friends with somebody that you
have never lived in the same town or city.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.540
And Sylvia's one of the long time friends
who I don't ever hardly get to sit and have

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.620
an in-depth conversation with, but I did for
the book, which was fun.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.200
And I said, "Sylvia, when did you actually
go on staff?"

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.730
And Sylvie said, "Let's put it this way.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.620
They'd already named the restaurant after
me."

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.280
And what she meant was that she was so famous.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.460
I mean, Sylvia Poggioli.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:34.740
She was so part of the fabric of NPR, of the
sound of NPR, that you couldn't believe that

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.110
she was still on a contract.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.230
I mean, not on a contract, 'till 1993.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.690
And she'd been ten years working with NPR.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.560
And the restaurant was this restaurant in
Salem, Oregon called Poggioli's.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.080
There were actually two at one point.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.460
And she was like already surfing, what's the
New York Times, more recently, was talking

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.050
about something that happened in the Vatican
and said, "Holy Poggioli.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.050
It's blah-dy, blah-dy, blah."

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.470
It was a jokey thing about the Vatican.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:10.500
So, it's almost impossible to imagine how
well NPR covered the country when we didn't

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.670
have reporters out in the country.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.071
And we had some freelance, a lot of freelance
people.

00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:16.071
I was freelance.

00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:17.389
I mean, there was no hope of getting--.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:21.440
I was in New York, no hope of getting a job
in the '80s because they were, like I said,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.889
there was Margot Adler, the same people who--.

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:25.970
We're like, "They're gonna have to die."

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.970
Thank God.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.060
I mean, they didn't.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.060
[laughter]

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.510
They didn't and there's three people still
there who are were there back in the '80s.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.169
But when they asked me to do the '90s, it
was a great thing because I had just come

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.100
on staff officially in '88.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.500
And I, as the host, the co-host with Robert
Siegel of "All Things Considered," when Susan

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.650
Stamberg and Noah Adams left.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:52.700
And I did that for a couple of years and then,
starting in '90, I started going to South

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
Africa.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:00.180
And so, I had a taste of what are the new
level that NPR was gonna reach when foreign

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:06.250
coverage became one of our best projects.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:13.180
And it also, the foreign coverage that NPR
provides for some parts of the country is

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.210
all the foreign coverage that anybody's gonna
get there.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.470
I went to South Africa to cover the release
of Nelson Mandela.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.870
One of the biggest stories of the decade.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:28.590
Actually, one of the biggest stories, the
Mandela story, of the century.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.279
And I got there the day, literally the day
he was released.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:37.170
And I remember it was raining and I started
the chapter with that it was raining in Soweto,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:42.060
which in Africa, I was soon to learn, a positive.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.630
Rain is considered a gift.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:49.340
And it was considered very, very propitious--a
very, very good sign.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.840
And I got there the day that he was released.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.720
And the idea was NPR was turning more and
more to trying to be there for these big events.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.930
We had been there for the fall of the Berlin
Wall.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.640
They sent Robert Siegel just the year before.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.910
We had been there, we had people in Poland
when solidarity prevailed and they elected

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.210
Walesa as President.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:18.670
We, all this stuff was stunningly over about
a two-year period, the world literally was

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.670
changing.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.230
And at that moment in time, what was happening
was the Cold War was ending and walls were

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.230
coming down.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:32.100
So, it was really a moment that's actually
almost impossible to imagine now of such hope.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:39.231
A little like the Arab Spring, only with much
more, how can I say, much more of a potential

00:10:39.231 --> 00:10:42.580
for positive outcomes, like in Poland, in
Russia.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.360
And it was Russia before the oligarchs, Russia
before Putin.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.640
This was like a new Russia emerging it seemed.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:11:00.630
And to give you a feel for how it worked then,
I showed up, got myself in a car, got on the

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:06.810
left side of the road, started driving where
the big networks were in a four-star hotel

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.810
downtown.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.470
A downtown, by the way, that was soon to disappear
and become very African.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.040
But at that exact moment in time, it was very
white.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.430
And it was called the Golden Mile.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.460
So, all the fancy restaurants, because apartheid,
right?

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.520
Obviously, the wealth was downtown, like it
would be in a normal city.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.110
Well, NPR had us out in the suburbs and we
were in this little hotel that was really

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.430
a salesmen hotel.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.430
And I don't know if you know Afrikaners, but
they're like the--I don't know what you would

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.430
say.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.980
Well, they're the white people of South Africa,
but Afrikaners in particular, they would be

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.590
out in the countryside and in small towns.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.760
So, it was like Afrikaner’s salesmen who
were living at, were staying there.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.770
And here we flow in and there were five of
us and we set up shop.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.930
And the only way we could get out was through
the hotel phone system, which meant that if

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.630
somebody called you, like, say you were trying
to set up an interview.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:05.101
You would call out and, of course, most people
in South Africa did not have landlines, not

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:06.101
just the black people.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.450
A lot of white people didn't either 'cause
they just didn't have a good phone system.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.190
There was no such thing as cell phones.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.310
The political people were pretty sophisticated.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.210
They had--what do you call it?

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.250
Pagers.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:23.170
And all you could do is put your number down
and cross your fingers that they would page

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.970
you back or call you back.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:31.760
But in our case, it went through a hotel system
where, if you were out you wouldn't get the

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.760
call.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.870
If you were upstairs and they knocked on your
door and you were in the bathroom you wouldn't

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.870
get the call.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.290
I mean, it was like, really hard to set up
an interview.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:44.070
So basically, you had to go to the place,
set the interview up, and hope that they were

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.660
there when you came back for the appointed
time, or if they were there, hope they were

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.620
willing to talk to you.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:57.970
It didn't hurt me too much because I was there
to cover people, not the Mandela people, not

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.620
the ANC--the African National Congress.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.570
But when we wanted to file, I had to file.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.820
And I'm gonna actually have to look this up.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.220
It's called, something called the--.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:12.420
What you filed on was something called a Comrex
and Vince Mews, our engineer, set it all up.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:19.730
And it was one of these things that you would
do your, you would talk into it and then it

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:26.050
would slow--not a time thing--but they stretched
it out and then they closed it back up at

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.930
the other end, which meant that it didn't
always sound right.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.820
I mean, it sometimes sounded slightly off
in this funny way, but that was the best you

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.060
could do.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.770
And as for the rest, you were on your own.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.440
Like, you got in your car and went out and
found people.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440
And I used to this.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.880
I had a technique and I was in and out of
the country for the next four years through

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:53.140
Mandela's inauguration and lived there at
times for as much as a year.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.430
And at all times, I just would go into the
townships, even, there are these township

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.410
wars that grew up and there was two years
and it was pretty serious business.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.500
It doesn't sound like anything now, but they
were fighting each other and killing each

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.170
other in the townships.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.340
And it was a strange war.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.810
It was between the Zulu and Khartoum Freedom
Party, which was ethnic and the ANC, which

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.020
wasn't ethnic.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.620
But this was a power struggle.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.720
And so, these young guys, comrades, they called
themselves on the ANC side.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.670
And you'll probably remember them from the
'80s.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.690
Kids would be out there protesting.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.730
And they were young kids.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.550
It was almost like a children's revolution
in that sense.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.390
They were young teenagers and whatnot.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.260
They would, I would just get, I would find
somebody and get them in my car.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.160
And Soweto had two million people.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.430
It was the township of Soweto.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.540
It had two million people.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.350
It did not have a single street sign.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.760
It did not have--.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.360
If you wanted to go somewhere, there were
a couple of things like Baragwanath Hospital.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.190
And there are a couple of things, but it was
this sprawling township.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:56.600
And you would go in and there was like nothing
else you could do but have some local person

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.240
take you where you wanted to go and everyone
needed a ride.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.200
I mean, I'd be the only car driving along.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.610
And I'd look out at somebody likely and often
it would be these young guys, kids, that wanted

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.980
to get in your car.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.980
And so they came.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.650
But when it came time to filing, this is how
we filed.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.010
There were two ways to file, and this one
on the whole time I was there, through '94,

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.270
right through the inauguration.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.440
When it came time to filing, you had two choices.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.240
If you had a really, really nice feature story
and you wanted to put it on a nice tape, I

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:32.660
would, I had rigged up in my bedroom a quilt
over a chair for sound purposes.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.750
And I would sit under it.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.440
And I swear to God, I never got it right,
ever in all that time.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.890
And it would fall on my head all the time.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:45.220
But you would put this quilt up and get down
and do my tracks, put them on a cassette,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.220
send the cassette--.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.220
[laughter]

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:52.029
Sometimes, I actually had a machine that I
could edit it on, so I'm not saying I'd always

00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:53.029
send it this way.

00:15:53.029 --> 00:15:58.200
I would often edit it to my satisfaction and
then put it on reel-to-reel.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.810
But it all started with a cassette.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.050
That was how I recorded it.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.149
And then the cassettes of my tapes--.

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:04.480
So, I'd put it not together.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.800
I couldn't produce it, but I would put the
reels together.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.480
And then, we had an arrangement with the BBC
where there would be a pick-up every day at

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.600
five o'clock in the afternoon, so you had
to be there.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.550
I would knock on your door, take your tape,
take it down to the airport.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.779
They would put it on a plane along with the
BBC stuff.

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:26.720
The BBC would collect it and get it through
customs in London.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.650
They would get it over to the Bush House.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.380
And then, at Bush House, they would send it
by satellite to NPR.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:38.600
So, if you wanted to sound good, two days
from finish to delivery--after you've done

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600
everything.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.390
If you couldn't afford to do that and you
wanted to send a piece or talk to them, be

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.930
interviewed by NPR--and I didn't do a lot
of what you hear now.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.120
In fact, I probably did one.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:54.950
You hear now talks with people, Lourdes Garcia-Navarro,
right in the middle of, not Tienanmen Square,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.510
right in the middle of--back in the '90s here.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.750
Back in the middle of--.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.750
What?

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.750
Well, I'm thinking of--.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.320
Well, she was also in Egypt, but--.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.020
[audience calls out answers]

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.290
Yes, thank you.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.560
Tahrir Square, right?

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.120
But Lourdes Garcia-Navarro in the middle of
Libya.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.220
"Hey, Lulu.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.120
How are you doing?"

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.250
And often, by the way, we do say, "Take care
of yourself," and things you don't hear on

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.830
the air at the end.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.140
Believe me, I'm highly aware, people are standing
with bullets going by and talking to you.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:27.020
Well, then the only way you could talk to
someone, which is why I rarely did any of

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:34.870
those kinds of conversation--in fact, I never
did--was you, on your tape recorder, you put--.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.240
I did something.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.240
You won't even know what this is.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.270
You took, you unscrewed the telephone and
there are two little prongs, right?

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.210
And then you had alligator clips.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.390
Have you ever heard of alligator clips?

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.910
They're little electrical things.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.799
They're, call them alligator clips 'cause
they look like that.

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:50.850
They're really small.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.799
You would put it on one, how did it work?

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.000
I know, yes.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.170
I can't even remember anymore.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.890
You would alligator clip it into the telephone
and attach that to the microphone.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.250
No, to the, geez, recorder.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.590
But there were, yeah, two clips and it went
into the recorder.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.590
That's right.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.799
Then, you would set the recorder on record
and pause.

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:16.990
Thank you.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.990
You've got the idea, right?

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.990
Record and pause.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:24.179
And then, you would read, which meant you
couldn't talk to somebody because the headset

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:25.340
is all--.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.570
You could, technically.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.490
You could hold it up with these alligator
clips, but you're talking through your microphone,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.770
so the sound was much, much better going through
the telephone.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.250
And, or you would record it and just send
everything.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.920
Just record on cassette and just send everything.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.080
But it never sounded that good.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.500
It sounded like telephone tape.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.570
You would send your tape that way, too, if
you had to.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:51.340
And I mean, I'm trying to think of all the
other insane sounding ways in which we communicated.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.059
Once I was in Congo, in what was then Zaire
and Kinshasa, and it was the very beginning

00:18:56.059 --> 00:19:00.460
of the end of the Mobutu, hung in there for
about eight more years and five million more

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.990
people dead.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:07.040
But at that moment in time, he had been a
dictator for like 30 years and there were

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.040
riots.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.720
And so, you don't--.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.340
Madhulika Sikka, by the way, who I should
introduce our executive producer of "Morning

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.470
Edition," she just flew in with her daughters
for a vacation and came here on the way from

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.470
the airport.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.470
But you would like this.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.350
We had a foreign editor.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.620
Her name was Cadi Simon.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.860
At the time, she ran the foreign desk and
was really building the foreign desk.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:34.170
She called up once and she said to me, "You
know about the riots?"

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.940
I didn't have wire services 'cause it was
too expensive.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.640
And also, the phone lines were so bad that
the wire services oftentimes didn't print

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.980
very well in South Africa.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.660
So Pearce said, "We're not gonna spend hundreds
of dollars.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.520
You just call us and we'll read it to you."

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.840
And so, I used to call the newscast and they
would read me what was of importance in South

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.750
Africa 'cause I was covering the whole country.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:01.960
So, clearly, I covered it with features for
the most part and not a daily, daily thing.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.000
But she called me.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.100
She said there's riots.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.679
And she said, "and they're talking about--"
and there's the fewest Europeans in Zaire

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:14.180
that have been there since the beginning of
colonialism.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.560
And the reason for that was they'd all fled.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.490
There were like three generations of Greeks
and various people from Eastern Europe and

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.770
people who had really been there for a hundred
years, but they didn't have citizenship and

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:30.130
people were leaving their factories and getting
the hell out of there.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.340
So she said, "We hear there's gonna be a blood
bath.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.179
How soon can you get there?"

00:20:35.179 --> 00:20:36.179
[laughter]

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:39.710
I'm like, "Oh, let's see.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:45.549
I gotta get my yellow fever shot, but I think
I can make it by sundown."

00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:47.640
But in fact what the problem was no planes
were going in.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.549
They had stopped all the international traffic.

00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:55.600
So, I ended up going into Brazzaville, which
is in the other Congo across the river and

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.900
got what was truly the last, at that moment
in time, the last ferry over.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.690
And this was, and I had to, these two Greek
guys who had fled a month before came on the

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.690
plane with me.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.990
I say Greek, but they were, like I said, third
generation.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.429
They were going back to see their factory.

00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:15.490
So, it was so lucky for me because they spoke
English and I spoke French, but not--.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.710
They speak French there, too, in the Congo,
but not so great.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.130
And so, they were like, "OK, OK.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.130
We're gonna get this ferry."

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:27.370
And they helped me get the ferry and they
said, "You better stuff all that equipment."

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.520
So, I get on the ferry like I'm like nine
months pregnant.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.520
And they had heard.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.730
They had some kind of walkie-talkie and they'd
heard that people were stealing everything

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.750
off of everybody as soon as the ferry landed
on the other end because it was quite chaotic.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.830
And, but somehow, I don't know.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:46.150
I they were around me and we plunged through
and we got there.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.720
And we went straight to their factory and
they took me before the hotel.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.640
And that factory--they opened the door and
the factory is empty, stripped of everything,

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.029
electrical, everything.

00:21:56.029 --> 00:22:05.040
And just that deep in slippers, in flip-flops,
because people had run so fast out of there

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.210
that they ran out of their shoes.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:13.690
It was a stunning sight and I wish I'd had
an iPhone with a camera.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.600
I mean, I go to the hotel and it's pretty
much water for an hour a day.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.790
All the reporters were put on the fifth floor--pretty
empty.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:23.970
I mean, but still.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.380
This fancy intercontinental hotel and there
were these guys walking around with what looked

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.299
like bowling balls on their ears.

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:35.350
They were walking around with these big black
things that they were doing this.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.600
And I'm like, "Who are they?

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600
And what is that?"

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.830
And they were like early adopters of phones,
these kind of things that I think people did

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.240
have in their cars in 1991.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.560
But they were carrying them around.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.290
And I said, "Well, who are they?"

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:55.400
And they were diamond smugglers, very fancily,
beautifully dressed with these.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.240
And you're like, "Yeah, that's who has all
the equipment, right?"

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240
[laughter]

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240
The diamond smugglers.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240
They figured it out.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.240
They needed it.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240
They're working it.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240
But for the rest of us, it was the same thing.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.060
You had to go to people's houses and set it
up.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.370
But one time, I tried and I had to make a
phone, I got ill and I was supposed to be

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.260
there three weeks, but I had to get out.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.900
And there really wasn't a way to get out.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.450
It wasn't easy.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.250
I didn't know how to get a flight out of Brazzaville,
so I tried to call NPR.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:25.510
I did call NPR and say I needed a flight just
a little earlier, just a simple change.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.620
It would be simple today.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.100
But then, it took three days for the phone
call to come back to me.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.320
There was a business room and you went in
and you put in a call.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.559
"I'd like to put in a call to this number."

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:43.160
Three days later, they knocked on my door
and said, which was OK.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.900
I didn't need to get out that fast.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.960
Three days later, they knocked on my room
and said, "Your call is waiting for you downstairs."

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.440
So, I go down and I talk fast 'cause I knew
it was expensive.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.179
But I never knew how expensive it was until
I turned, I got billed at the end of the--.

00:23:57.179 --> 00:24:01.680
It was like a nine-minute call and it was
300 and change dollars.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.059
That, that, and the way I got out was it was
a little Christian flight, like a one-seater

00:24:08.059 --> 00:24:09.059
or two-seater.

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:10.500
Only room for one more.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.059
And they didn't organize it.

00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:15.520
The hotel organized because there was no way
to get out.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.190
There was no ferry running across the river.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.900
So, I mean, the way that they do it now--you
hear all these stories as you're going along--these

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:29.490
were things that happened without anybody
knowing what you're going through because

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.620
there was no communication.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.730
I wanted to open it up for questions.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.010
I wanted to, but I do wanna do one thing.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.010
I wanna play.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.400
God, it might take six minutes, right?

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.299
You all know Rwanda, right?

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:44.950
You know what happened in 1994 in Rwanda.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.110
Half a million people killed.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:54.140
A terrible slaughter of the mostly ethnic
Hutus, Tutsis killed by Hutus.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.299
So, I'm gonna play a four-minute story and
open it up for questions.

00:24:58.299 --> 00:25:03.549
And the reason I wanna play it is it's a radio
story by one of our reporters, Michael Skoler,

00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:12.010
who was with us, up with me or down rather,
in Johannesburg covering the Mandela inauguration--the

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.670
vote and the inauguration.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.450
And the vote took a really long time to count
so that it delayed like three weeks what we

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.080
thought would be done in a day or two.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.510
It was delayed right up to the day of the
inauguration.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.740
And so Michael--.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.750
Here's the thing with foreign correspondents.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.400
They run into where everyone else is running
out of.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.360
And he was desperate to get back to Rwanda
'cause he was out of Nairobi.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.080
And I was desperate to stay and cover the
inauguration 'cause I love South Africa and

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080
was there.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.210
So, we made a deal where I stayed for the
inauguration, which was nice.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.770
Anyway, he, Michael is the second one.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.730
He's the second one.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.880
He sent this story, very much in the way I
just described--1994--you could not have heard

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.750
this story 'till a week after it happened,
maybe three days.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.750
Maybe.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.750
Three and a half days.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.260
And it's a very long, it's a 21-minute long
story.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.000
I'm not gonna play 21 minutes.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.049
But there is one part of the idea of trying
to explain, in a book, what we did and what

00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:14.299
you heard on the radio and this was, I wanted
to use this because it was one of these really

00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:15.299
stunning stories.

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:17.830
He got some big awards for it, too.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.750
He was there ahead of a lot of people.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:26.720
The difference between what you hear and what
you'll see if you see any quotes on the page

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.590
because it's all in the sound in a way, profound
as his story was.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.790
And what's happened is, and I'll just do the
set up.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.059
It's probably gonna take me two minutes to
do the set up, but let me quickly just do

00:26:37.059 --> 00:26:38.059
the set up.

00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:42.140
And that was that he had gone in and all this
killing had happened, but it was really hard

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.140
to cover.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.070
It was really hard for people to understand
it was happening.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.450
If you wonder sometimes why people didn't
intervene earlier, like the United States,

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.500
it honestly went fast.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.510
And it was weird because it retail killing.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.880
People were not killed by bombs or rockets
or IEDs.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.770
They were killed one on one with machetes
and versions of machetes.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:11.060
So this six-week period, these Hutu groups
managed to rampage across the country and

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.460
kill, by hand, somewhere in the neighborhood
of half a million people.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.970
So, that wasn't really getting out very well
and at the point at which people didn't know

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.780
much about it, this story came on the air.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.780
[plays sound clip]

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.780
&gt;&gt;Michael Skoler: I drove in from the north
and entered the part of Rwanda held by the

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.559
Tutsi land rebel army, the Rwandan Patriotic
Front, or RPF.

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:36.620
The RPF insisted I travel with two soldiers
"for my own protection," they said, though

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.630
that hardly seemed necessary.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.419
The countryside was empty.

00:27:40.419 --> 00:27:45.880
We passed miles of deserted villages, fields
of sorghum, beans and bananas with no one

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.130
to harvest them.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.720
Eerie, since Rwanda is one of the most densely
populated countries in the world.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.370
Sometimes, the car would fill with the smell
of rotting flesh and we would notice corpses

00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:00.210
lying in a field or by the side of an abandoned
house.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.200
Those who had been killed here were almost
all from the Tutsi ethnic group, like the

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.929
rebel soldiers with me.

00:28:05.929 --> 00:28:11.419
Other Rwandans, those of the majority Hutu
group, had fled, afraid the RPF would kill

00:28:11.419 --> 00:28:14.800
them in revenge for the slaughter of Tutsis.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.290
But occasionally, I found places crowded with
people, people too fearful to go back to their

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.070
villages and homes.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.230
[crowd chatter]

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:29.309
In a town called Gahini, 30 miles east of
the capital Kigali, the crowd around me contained

00:28:29.309 --> 00:28:34.070
old women and some younger women, small children,
but very few men.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:39.200
And as I asked why they were here, they started
to lift their clothes.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.760
[woman speaking]

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.400
This woman is showing us her legs and arms.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.900
They have raised long wounds on them.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.250
They look like maybe they're burns.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.620
Those are burns.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.080
[women speaking]

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.450
And in her nose, there's kind of a crease
now that's healed over the scar and she said

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:05.590
that was a spear that went in through her
nose.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:11.840
And here's a little girl in a pretty flower
dress lifting up her skirt to show burn marks

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.000
on her knees and legs, and a bandage.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.020
And here's a little boy who has lifted his
shirt to show a wound from a spear, right

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.840
in the middle of his back between his shoulders.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.320
[woman speaking]

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.179
Mainly the boys.

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:34.590
Even the babies.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.799
Why?

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:38.220
Por qua?

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.650
[woman speaking]

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.200
In order to get rid of the Tutsi race.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.760
&gt;&gt;Woman #1: Yes.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:49.159
&gt;&gt;Michael Skoler: The planned killing of a
race--genocide.

00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:53.539
Foreign nations have been hesitant to label
the Rwanda massacre as genocide because that

00:29:53.539 --> 00:29:55.429
would force them to act.

00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:59.540
But the evidence that genocide has been occurring
here is hard to ignore.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.340
Those in Gahini told me to go to Kerubanda
a few miles away to see for myself what had

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:09.049
happened to their mostly Tutsi families and
friends who, like them, had sought refuge

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:13.960
in a church there, but who never made it out
again.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.919
As I drove up to a set of orange brick church
buildings, I had to clamp a bandana tightly

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:20.580
over my nose and mouth.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.770
The stench was unbearable.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.000
[pause]

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.270
I'm outside the church and there are maybe
two or three dozen bodies.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:37.140
In the heat here in Rwanda, many of the bodies
are already almost fully decomposed.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.250
You can see some skulls, some backbones.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:47.330
There are what seem to be women in brightly
colored clothing as well as children lying

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.840
about.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:56.919
This is amidst what is a very beautiful area
of eucalyptus trees and pine trees.

00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:59.610
[footsteps]

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.190
There are bodies scattered all over the church.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:12.270
The blood on the floor is so thick it's dried
to kind of a muddy brown dust that may be,

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.970
in some places, a quarter of an inch thick.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.790
Most of the bodies are black and then decomposing.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:22.289
They, some lie on mattresses, some on the
floor.

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:24.400
Some are covered with blankets.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:31.390
By the altar, there are probably about 30
bodies clustered around.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:36.690
One is the body of an infant with the parents,
it seems, on either side.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:42.360
There's a suitcase that is open and torn apart
in front of the altar.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:51.179
On the floor of the church, you can see baskets,
plastic water cans, pails, combs, brushes,

00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:58.669
sandals, sneakers, tins of food, a bottle
of talcum powder.

00:31:58.669 --> 00:32:04.000
The windows, stained glass windows on either
side, are broken.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.090
There are wooden pews that have been thrown
against them.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:15.440
Above the whole scene, above the altar, is
a small wooden statue of Christ with one hand

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.440
raised.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.440
[end clip]

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.430
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Gee.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.620
I mean, I'm even like woo.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:29.740
What happened there, and happens I think on
NPR regularly and many times in a much happier

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:35.490
fashion, is that there are things you can't
even imagine.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.070
In this case, too hellish to imagine.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:44.789
But when you hear something like this, it
becomes really impossible to not think about

00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:46.670
it or to ignore it.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.429
And that's a particular slice of what we do.

00:32:50.429 --> 00:32:58.240
That is, bringing it to you, but as long as
it took him to get this on the radio, it had

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240
to of.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.840
I mean, I wasn't there talking to Mike about
it, but Michael about it, but three, four

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840
days.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840
I just know that's five days maybe.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840
He had to get out of that place.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.169
He had to, there was just no, there were no
satellite phones or anything remotely like

00:33:10.169 --> 00:33:11.169
that.

00:33:11.169 --> 00:33:12.400
Computer, he probably had no computer with
him.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.610
Probably did it all by hand on a paper.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.320
It still was very, very immediate.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:27.730
You were still unfortunately walking with
him through this space, this little bit of

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.830
hell.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:32.250
This is only another minute and then I'll
just turn it to questions.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.110
This is what happens today.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:39.559
And this is from the last time I was in Afghanistan
and it's only, like I say, it's a minute and

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:40.559
20 seconds.

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:43.160
But it's actually about five, six minutes
on the air.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.160
Seven or eight minutes on the air.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.160
[plays audio clip]

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.160
&gt;&gt;David Green: This is "Morning Edition" from
NPR news.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160
I'm David Green.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160
&gt;&gt;Steve Inskeep: And I'm Steve Inskeep.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160
Good morning.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.270
An attack on Kabul, Afghanistan is over.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:56.360
Attackers took control of a building that
had a clear line of fire down to the US Embassy

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.610
and NATO headquarters in the heart of the
city.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:04.970
And it's taken 20 hours for Afghan forces
to finally clear that building.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:09.879
It is inside that building that we have found
NPR's Renee Montagne and Quil Lawrence.

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:10.879
Hello to you both.

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:11.879
&gt;&gt;Quil Lawrence: Good morning, Steve.

00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:12.879
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Good morning, Steve.

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:13.879
&gt;&gt;Steve Inskeep: What do you see there?

00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:19.270
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Quil and I are both standing
on the tenth floor of this 12 story high rise,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.820
here in the middle of Kabul.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.359
And not too far from us are the bodies of
four of the attackers.

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:29.980
There's two more bodies in the staircase as
it goes down.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.610
We're looking around and this was clearly
the site of a huge fight.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:38.240
We're told this was where the fight was the
fiercest, right here in this room.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:44.839
The walls are pock-marked with all kinds of
holes from the incoming fire from Afghan and

00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:46.919
international community forces.

00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:50.330
As you said, the target was the American Embassy.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.639
And looking out of one of these big, open
windows, there's a clear line of sight to

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.639
the Embassy.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:01.580
It's a perfect target from this distance for
something like a rocket-propelled grenade.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.580
[end clip]

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.040
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: I mean, it went on and on.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.040
But that was like, not live actually, although
it could've been.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.191
But an hour, 45 minutes before we went on
the air.

00:35:12.191 --> 00:35:13.940
Maybe even 15 minutes before it went on the
air.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.030
So, that, like that's 20 years right there.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.090
No, 18.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.980
As you can see, I could go on, but I won't.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.980
I won't.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.790
There must be things you wanna know at NPR
that I haven't got to.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.820
So, let me just stop for a moment and ask
for questions.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.330
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Is there really an NPR voice?

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.830
Do you all take elocution lessons?

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.790
[Renee Montagne laughs]

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:44.330
And, because there's a very distinctive accent
on NPR, a [ ] pronunciation of sorts.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:48.450
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Well, it seems to my ear
just the opposite.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.490
It sounds like some people ought to take elocution
lessons.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.490
[laughter]

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:58.930
I mean, we do not discriminate against people
who have adenoidal voices and high voices

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.570
and who talk with a sing-song.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:10.570
And I think the difference between us and,
as I think in commercial radio, even to this

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:15.960
day is, I think we don't, we actually do employ
voice coaches once in a while.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:22.300
But really, people get hired in and whoever
they really are is how they sound on the radio.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.390
And I think while maybe in a weird way it
sounds the same is because I think what's

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:28.691
the same about is everybody has, speaks in
their natural voices.

00:36:28.691 --> 00:36:34.690
They're voices are, I mean, I'm obviously
talking a lot faster and I know.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.890
I don't make an effort.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:36.980
It just happens.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.839
I put on headsets, I'm talking in front of
a mic and I can hear myself, you know?

00:36:40.839 --> 00:36:42.690
And I don't, didn't use to like that.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:47.369
But if I hear myself, I slow down, but I don't
like sit there thinking "slow down."

00:36:47.369 --> 00:36:49.089
I just slow down.

00:36:49.089 --> 00:36:51.060
But for the most part, my voice is my voice.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.060
Steve Inskeep voice is--.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:58.170
Sometimes, you get Noah Adams, who of course
was with us from the beginning practically.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.230
Bob Edwards.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:07.609
Robert Siegel, to some extent, with these
low, deep, maybe traditional-sounding voices.

00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:11.850
But I sort of think the office, I think what's
the same is we all sound like ourselves.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:14.640
So, that's so different that it's an NPR sound.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.960
Does that make sense?

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:22.510
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Well, I know that in contrast with
BBC, it used to sound like NPR and has taken

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.510
a deliberate attempt to emphasize regional
accents.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.510
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: I know.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.510
Yes, I know.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.510
I hear it, too.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.510
I hear it when I get up at eleven.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.400
They play a PM at night.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.830
They play "The Morning Show" on KPCC, so it's
like my "Morning Edition."

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:35.830
Yeah.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.170
And they're going with Scottish accents.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:41.730
They have some even clearly like, African--I'm
not sure what countries--but some slightly

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.020
African accents.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.020
And yeah.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.020
They're presenters.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.020
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yeah.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.290
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: They're allowing, yeah.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.410
And they didn't used to, right?

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.380
It was, what is it, received accent?

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.839
Look, Madhulika is from London.

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:53.740
She's from London.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.150
When did that switch happen?

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.150
Do you even remember?

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.150
You don't follow.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.300
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: Well after I was looking
for a job.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.300
[laughter]

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.860
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Yeah, because they wouldn't
have hired you.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.450
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: They saw my name and they
wouldn't have hired me.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.050
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Madhulika Sikka would not
have been on the air 20 years ago.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.680
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: It happened way after that.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.589
And I think it also happened because the BBC
started going into more regional coverage

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:12.910
around the country.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.930
So, Scotland and North England and those kinds
of places.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:20.630
So, you had a shot at making it to the national
coverage of the BBC.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.720
But certainly my people were never on the
air.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720
[chuckles]

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.720
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: But they are now.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: But they are now.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:31.859
And just one thing about NPR, I mean, I think
that Renee's right that a lot of our reporters

00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:35.240
sound exactly the way they are when you meet
them.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:41.470
So, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton jumps out of the
radio at you and that is exactly how she sounds

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.220
when you meet her.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.349
Sylvia's the same, Louisa.

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:49.070
We do have a fair amount of Brit-type voices
on the air.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.640
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Yeah.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.590
British like Ofeibea's Ghana by birth.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.800
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: Like Louisa--.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.420
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: But raised or educated in
Britain.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.420
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: Yeah.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.300
So, I think that, yeah, you.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:07.080
I think that when you, if you met our radio
voices in person, you would know exactly who

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.520
they are because their voice would be so recognizable
to you.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:15.109
Whereas, I think a lot of commercial television
or commercial radio, there's a voice you have

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:17.890
portray.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:24.450
And they do try and get the accents right
when we're saying foreign words.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.720
We agonize over that.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.540
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: We try.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.890
We also fix the show.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.790
I mean, there's a first run show here in California.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.590
It's at two AM.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.820
Really hardly anyone hears it.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.320
It starts at five on the East Coast.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.850
And so, we're on that schedule.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:45.500
And luckily, in a way from my area, my region.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.570
If you really get something wrong, like even
if you mispronounce someone's name or you

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:53.770
get it really wrong, you have a shot at like
doing it another time--re-doing it.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.360
But I'll tell you one thing real quickly.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.510
People also often look.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.990
People say that they don't look like, people
always say it to me honestly every time I

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.990
meet someone.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.990
"Oh, I thought you'd be taller."

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.990
This happened four days ago.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.990
[laughter]

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.990
OK.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:10.090
But, or blonder, even though this is darkened
hair, so I am a little blonder than this.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.859
But many times, people do look that way.

00:40:13.859 --> 00:40:17.670
There was a slight mistake in the book where
they took something out and then collapsed

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.460
something and fine, you know?

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.460
It was too late to fix it.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.740
It was actually me saying this where it was
attributed to a listener once said about Sylvia

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.740
Poggioli.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.200
And they what the listener really said and
left me saying it.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200
Whatever.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.040
But Sylvia Poggioli always sounded to me before,
I met her.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.170
Because I met her after I had heard her.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:42.010
Like, that she would have like a 1940's jacket
on and a Fedora with, and long, dark hair

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:47.250
swept back with a press stuck in the ribbon.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.130
And she doesn't wear that hat or the press.

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.130
[laughter]

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:55.230
But she really does look like, or did used
to, when I first met her, look like a '40s,

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:59.240
like "Hello, I'm here reporting," like Edward
R. Murrow only female, reporting from--.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.160
Ruth of London during the--.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.240
And she did look like that.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.480
She smokes.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.650
She's really like that.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:09.560
And it kinda just fit it exactly.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.050
So, does anybody?

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.050
Oh, gosh.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:13.050
Yes.

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.820
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I was wondering, actually.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.619
So, at Google, a lot of us are engineers and
so we become tech support for our family and

00:41:18.619 --> 00:41:19.619
friends, right?

00:41:19.619 --> 00:41:24.430
So, I was kind of wondering with you guys,
do you become like a family or a friend's

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:29.160
news reporter source and you go to a party
and everyone expects you to do the thing you

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.510
do on the radio in person?

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.800
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Yeah, they do.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.800
[laughter]

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800
They really do.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800
I hadn't thought of that.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800
I've never even asked that.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800
Yeah.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.800
[laughter]

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.800
Fill us on Libya or something.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.800
Or, yeah.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800
And usually I can.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.010
I mean, what I do?

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:49.839
I mean, I'm second-hand, but I'm so focused
on the latest that it's good to ask me.

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:50.839
It is good to ask me those questions.

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:51.839
[laughter]

00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:57.940
I can fill you in.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.720
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: My husband always says,
"Did you hear about [ ]?" Yeah, we did it

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.950
on the show.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:04.950
[laughter]

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.011
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Yeah, did you hear.

00:42:06.011 --> 00:42:07.011
&gt;&gt;Madhulika Sikka: Thanks to me you know it.

00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:08.011
[laughter]

00:42:08.011 --> 00:42:09.619
&gt;&gt;Male #3: You spoke about the '90s as being
a critical decade of transformation.

00:42:09.619 --> 00:42:15.950
How did the intensifying congressional attacks
on NPR and public broadcasting figure into

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:16.950
the changes there?

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.980
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Back then, the original
Newt stuff?

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.980
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yes.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.040
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Seriously, Newt Gingrich
was after us.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.040
Yes.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040
I had to do a little segment on it.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:29.119
Who, by the way, he might not fess up to it
now, but I use it 'cause I fact-checked it.

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:33.420
I saw the speech that he said this in, who
said in the early 2000s.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.599
I don't know.

00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:41.000
Either NPR's gotten less liberal or I've gotten
more relaxed, whatever the quote was.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Oh, here it is.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.609
I turned to it by accident.

00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:50.990
Newt Gingrich, they tried what they called
"zero out public," well, public broadcasting.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:54.099
They were, but they really had disliked NPR.

00:42:54.099 --> 00:42:55.700
It's not all public broadcasting.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:03.640
They're fine with most of what goes on PBS
'cause PBS has no, they have no strong news.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.570
They have the one news show, basically.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:07.880
And the wonderful, oh, my God.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.880
I'm blocking on it.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.010
The wonderful documentary--"Frontline."

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.990
But really half an hour a day kind of thing.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.360
We're all day news.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.820
So, they've never liked NPR.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.340
And they used to be called in this '80s, kind
of stupidly really, 'cause it really wasn't

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.340
that--.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.670
What did they call it?

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:30.420
NPR, Nicaraguan Public Radio at a certain
point to be mean, to say it like--.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.170
And there was a little truth to that in the
early days 'cause people were really much

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:38.070
younger and much more underdog-oriented and
much more rah, rah, and maybe a little less--to

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:43.090
be honest--maybe a little less the news people
that they are today or that we have on staff

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.630
today.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.290
But that's long since been over.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.290
But yeah.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.290
Newt Gingrich.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.290
What happened was it gave us a lot of publicity.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:53.859
The show version gave us a lot of publicity
and did us a lot of good because they didn't

00:43:53.859 --> 00:43:56.050
zero it out in the end.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.050
They didn't.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:01.490
And Newt, if I may say--'cause we've met several
times--went on to say, he was on our air just

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.980
yesterday, was Newt, right?

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.980
Yeah.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.980
I'm sorry I didn't hear it, but--.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.220
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yesterday we were the elite media

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.460
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Oh, I'm sorry I did not
hear.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.460
[laughter]

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.089
I was sleeping in.

00:44:13.089 --> 00:44:15.970
I was gonna go back and listen, though, 'cause
he gave us an interview.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:20.440
We kinda feel like we know how bad off he
is now because he wouldn't, has not been willing

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.850
to consider interviews.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:23.270
But suddenly--

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.620
[laughter]

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.420
he's on NPR, that's like you can just kiss
his campaign goodbye.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.420
[laughter]

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.430
No, but he said, "Listen.

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.910
On my way to work, I listen to NPR and appreciate
it."

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.530
This was in speech in 2003.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:39.470
"NPR is a lot less to the left, or I've mellowed,"
said Newt.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.099
"Or some combination of the two."

00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:43.550
And he was a subscriber.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:49.369
But it has some kind of charm to attack NPR.

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:53.839
It has some, it does work to some small degree,
it appears 'cause they keep coming back and

00:44:53.839 --> 00:44:54.839
doing it.

00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:59.109
I mean, they really, it's like a ten-year
thing or every eight years you can count on

00:44:59.109 --> 00:45:00.109
it.

00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:01.109
And then they don't do it.

00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:02.140
They didn't zero us out this year either.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.670
I mean, we were not cut at all.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:06.500
In fact, we should be cut out a little bit
compared to everything out there.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:11.310
I don't mean "should be," but we can expect
to be because everything is gonna be shrunk

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.310
down a bit.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:18.470
But the big cut was in 1983 when Ronald Reagan,
in the early--.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:19.470
Ronald Reagan became President.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:23.550
He said we should not be paying for public
radio or TV.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:28.410
And so, he wanted to zero out the corporation
for public broadcasting, which is the umbrella

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.410
group.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.220
And, in fact, he succeeded.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.680
The whole system changed.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.360
There was actually CPB funding.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.950
I don't know the exact amount.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:42.030
But it was most of the funding for NPR was
coming from the federal government in the

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.290
'70s.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:48.210
And there was corporate and then, and when
Reagan came in, he made good on "we're not

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.210
gonna fund you directly."

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:53.430
And, but what happened was the system changed,
so they--.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.980
The CPB money now goes to the stations.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:01.400
And stations get about 15 percent on average
of what they need to run their stations from

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.400
the CPB.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.079
And then, some percentage of money comes to
us.

00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:06.850
So, one of the, comes to NPR.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:15.050
Well, they have to buy NPR shows because if
they didn't run NPR shows, they'd make less

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:18.310
money from listeners because listeners tune
in to hear NPR shows.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:19.940
I mean, it's a simple dynamic.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.520
So, it's a good deal all around.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.270
But when they talk about defunding NPR, they're
never really defunding NPR per se because

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:36.829
it was long ago, 30 years ago, that direct
cash went away, really.

00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:42.160
And now, it's just that it could hurt stations
a lot, especially small stations and struggling

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160
stations.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.740
So, but it still seems to be a thing to like,
hang over.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:48.740
It's sort of a [ ] thing.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.310
&gt;&gt;Male #4: What was your take on SNL's "Schweddy
Balls" episode?

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:53.310
[laughter]

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.310
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne; Oh, I--.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:59.650
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Basically they're ridiculing the
extreme effete-ism of NPR.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.000
&gt;&gt;Renee Montagne: Yeah.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.530
You know, how can you not love being on Saturday
Night Live and being made fun of?

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.530
I don't know.

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.570
The funniest one is the, was the food show.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:09.751
And that wasn't even NPR.

00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:13.329
That was KCRW, originally.

00:47:13.329 --> 00:47:14.329
What was it, "Good Eats?"

00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:15.329
What's it been called?

00:47:15.329 --> 00:47:16.329
"Good Food."

00:47:16.329 --> 00:47:17.329
It wasn't us at all.

00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:21.210
It was the station, but people, media--.

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.849
What do you call the--?

00:47:23.849 --> 00:47:29.690
The SNL people who live out here, who would've
heard KCRW, picked it up at some point.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:34.170
And then I guess they were on PBS, too, which
I certainly missed it, the TV part.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.780
Well, you know?

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.859
Schweddy Balls.

00:47:36.859 --> 00:47:37.859
[laughter]

00:47:37.859 --> 00:47:39.670
It's not a very accurate--.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:45.140
[laughter]

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.770
But it, you know.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:51.119
So, we have some funny, there's some funny
ads they've done for us.

00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:52.119
Ads, not ads.

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:55.730
There's some funny funders that they've done,
done for the system that you hear sometimes.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.730
So you can only thank them.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:58.810
Let's just put it that way.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.609
So, thank you all very much for having me.

00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:02.609
[applause]

00:48:02.609 --> 00:48:05.390
It's really a pleasure.

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:09.550
And if I may, can I just quickly introduce
two of the--.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:14.280
Shannon Rhodes, who's our editor here in Los
Angeles, and Nina Gregory, who's our other

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.430
editor here in Los Angeles.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:19.650
Nina and I, like I said, we get to work at
midnight every night and we're there for the

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:20.650
long haul.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.880
And so, especially--.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.359
And, of course, I introduced Madhulika.

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:33.570
It's really a pleasure for us 
to be here.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:33.650
