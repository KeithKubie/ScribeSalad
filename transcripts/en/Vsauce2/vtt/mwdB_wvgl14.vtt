00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:03.629
Fold up your Grillo portable BBQ.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.160
And safely pack your post apocalyptic food
in a Tactical Lunch Box.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.950
Because it's episode 41 of LÃœT.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.220
Improve your skills on the court with the
94 fifty smart basketball. It measures everything

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.189
from ball handling and shot accuracy to shot
speed and spin acceleration and the information

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.990
is updated from ball to app in 100 milliseconds.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.320
Get ready for summer from the inside out with
an Anatomical bathing suit.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.430
And while you're at the beach watch for a
whale..... bottle opener.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.550
To crack open a drink and pour into a cup
that is floating in a palm tree drink raft.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.700
Kept cold with your ground cooler. The e-cool
is a year round drink cooler that doesn't

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.740
use electricity because it uses THE EARTH.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.120
Trust your gut and make an executive decision
with your morning coffee.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.440
Like the decision to eat chocolate sausage
that might come with its own chopping board

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.790
and knife but doesn't come with a nose spoon.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.570
Continue to play with your senses using aroma
forks. There are 21 aromas to choose from

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.520
so you can mix and match to trick your palette
into believing you're eating almost anything.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.140
If you can't make it taste like bacon, just
wear it on this charm bracelet.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.689
Then get your fortune and a sugar high with
fortune-telling cupcake liners and match your

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.929
mood with these roll on perfumes.

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.729
For those who chose play make sure to get
a slide rider. That turns your stairs into

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.299
slide and and I mean what else can I say it
turn your stairs into a slide!

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.090
Use Otto to capture your happy slide face
and turn it into an animated GIF (or gif).

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.819
It's a hackable customizable digital camera
that automatically shares the photos with

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.399
your smart phone.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.049
Next show off your Google glass.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.189
Because you're so rich you can make it rain
confetti.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.189
Make just about anything with the M3D. The
first consumer 3D printer can be used by beginners.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.529
It's now available for pre-order and will
fit nicely next to your butt station desk

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:05.409
accessory.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.180
Get off your butt and fly a paper airplane
with a smartphone. The Power Up 3.0 has a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.040
180 foot range and flies for ten minutes per
charge. Once you fold and attach just connect

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.280
to your phone and fly away from a...

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.750
TERRIFYING MASK OF YOUR OWN FACE!

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.930
Calm down and listen to something slow in
these custom slug headphones all while you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.849
snuggle up with a classic book pillow.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.840
Play with a new spin on a classic using smart
mass thinking putty. Which comes in styles

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.370
ranging from unicorn tears to magnetic giant
lizard green.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.909
Then thumbs down your friends in the Thumb
Wrestling Arena.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.730
And take your pet fish for a walk with the
help of fish on wheels, that let's the fish

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.769
do the steering by detecting the direction
that it's swimming.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.939
Finally, after all that I must say that "I'm
glad you're as weird as me".... greeting cards

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:04.939
And as always...thanks for watching.
