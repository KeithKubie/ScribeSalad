00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I finally want to teach you about the concept of a standard score.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The basic idea is that for any Gaussian no matter what the mean and the covariance is,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you can state how far inner out a point axis, so let me give you an example.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Suppose this is a point x and now I will give you a different Gaussian that's much wider

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with a different mean and the different center of deviation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If I ask you about the right Gaussian with the corresponding point x in the right Gaussian,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
tell me is it here, here, or here?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And the answer you probably picked is this one over here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Even though in total distance this guy is about as far as this guy over here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because its Gaussian is wider.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This seems to be the more logic of point in relative to the mean and the variance of this Gaussian.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This point corresponds pretty much to this point over here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now that's interesting. That's called the standard score.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So given the point x, you subtract the mean and you divide it by the variance

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and it gets me this standard score.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Got it. Let's see. Here's a data set 3, 4, 5, 7, and 6. The mean is 5, the standard deviation is âˆš2.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If I now ask you for the number 2 for this specific x, what do you think is the standard score

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
relative to the Gaussian that fits those data points over here.
