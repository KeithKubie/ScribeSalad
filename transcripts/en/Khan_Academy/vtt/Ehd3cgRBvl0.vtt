00:00:01.453 --> 00:00:05.145
- [Voiceover] What is 7 100s times 10?

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:06.306
Well, let's focus first

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:10.296
on this times 10 part of our expression.

00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:13.567
Because multiplying by 10
has some patterns in math

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:16.660
that we can use to help us solve.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.641
One pattern we can think
of when we multiply by 10

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:23.423
is if we take a whole number
and multiply it by 10,

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.340
we'll simply add a zero

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.832
to the end of our whole number.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.350
So, for example, if we have
a whole number like nine,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.567
and we multiply by 10,

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:40.470
our solution will be a nine
with one zero at the end.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.876
Or 90.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:45.847
Because nine times 10
is the same as nine 10s,

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:47.764
and nine 10s is ninety.

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:53.058
So let's use that pattern
first to try to solve.

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:54.899
Here we have seven 100s.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.077
So, seven times we have 100,

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:57.910
or 700,

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:03.388
and we're multiplying again times 10.

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.390
Use this pattern over here.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.687
Our solution will add a zero at the end.

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:11.437
So if we had 700, 10 times,

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:14.854
we would have 700 with a zero on the end.

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:16.807
Or 7,000.

00:01:18.618 --> 00:01:22.201
So seven 100s times
ten, is equal to 7,000.

00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:28.268
But there's another
pattern we could use, here.

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:32.177
Another pattern to think
about when we multiply by 10.

00:01:32.177 --> 00:01:34.703
And that is that when we multiply by 10,

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:37.703
we move every digit one place value,

00:01:40.587 --> 00:01:41.920
one place value,

00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.167
left.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.417
Or one place value greater.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.701
So let's look at that one
on a place value chart.

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:53.142
Here we have a place value chart.

00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:58.062
To use that earlier example
when we had nine ones,

00:01:58.062 --> 00:02:01.064
and we multiplied it by 10,

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:03.894
our nine moved one
place value to the left.

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:05.078
It moved up to the 10s.

00:02:05.078 --> 00:02:07.436
Now, we had nine 10s.

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:09.060
And we filled in a zero here,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.328
because there were no ones
left; there were zero ones left.

00:02:12.328 --> 00:02:15.078
And so, we saw that nine times 10

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:18.027
was equal to 90.

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:24.141
So again, it's the same as
adding a zero at the end,

00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:25.639
but we're looking at it another way.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.018
We're looking at it in
terms of place value

00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:30.477
and multiplying by 10 moved every digit

00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:32.810
one place value to the left.

00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:37.580
So, if we do that with this same question,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.280
seven 100s,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.007
seven 100s, if we move 100s
one place value to the left,

00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:45.821
we'll end up with 1,000s.

00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:47.904
So, 700 times 10 is seven

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.133
1,000s.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.091
Or, as we saw earlier,

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:55.924
7,000.

00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:01.528
So either one of these
is a correct answer.

00:03:01.528 --> 00:03:03.361
700 times 10 is 7,000.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.588
And here's an example with division.

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:11.838
Now we have dividing by 10.

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:14.339
And as you might predict,

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:18.055
dividing by 10 is the
opposite of multiplying by 10,

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:21.886
so our patterns are also the opposite.

00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:25.008
Instead of adding a zero to
the end of a whole number,

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:27.675
we would drop a zero at the end.

00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:31.514
We would drop a zero at the end.

00:03:31.514 --> 00:03:34.264
So, for an example, if we had 40,

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:37.319
divided by 10,

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.808
we would drop that zero
and end up with four.

00:03:40.808 --> 00:03:44.089
If you divide 40 into groups of 10,

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.839
you have four groups.

00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:49.190
Let's use that over here.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.972
212 10s.

00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:53.139
So we have 212

00:03:54.314 --> 00:03:55.941
10s.

00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:58.144
So 212, 10 times.

00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:00.887
That's how we got the zero, there.

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:03.224
And we divide that by 10,

00:04:03.224 --> 00:04:05.438
we can use this first
pattern we thought of

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:07.784
and just drop the zero on the end.

00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:09.331
Let's drop that zero,

00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:11.581
and our answer will be 212.

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:15.619
But we could also,

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.392
we could use the place value pattern.

00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:19.749
We could think in terms of place value.

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:23.916
And instead of moving one
place value to the left,

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:26.953
one place value larger,

00:04:26.953 --> 00:04:30.154
we're gonna move one place value smaller.

00:04:30.154 --> 00:04:31.667
Or to the right.

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:34.526
One place value to the right.

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:39.126
So what's one place value
smaller than 212 10s?

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:41.959
If we have 212 10s, divided by 10,

00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:46.631
we wanna move this 10s one
place value to the right,

00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.038
or smaller, which is ones.

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:50.559
So our solution

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.059
would be 212 ones.

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:58.019
Which is equal to what we already saw,

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:58.936
simply 212.

00:04:59.973 --> 00:05:02.140
So 212 10s, divided by 10.

00:05:03.318 --> 00:05:06.399
We could write the number
out and drop a zero,

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:08.428
or we could think about place value

00:05:08.428 --> 00:05:10.381
and move one place value to the right.

00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:13.298
Either way, our answer is 212 ones.
