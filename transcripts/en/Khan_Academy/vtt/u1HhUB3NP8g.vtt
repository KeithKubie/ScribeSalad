00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.590
All right, so where we left
off, we had simplified our

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.850
algebraic expression for the
squared error to the line from

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.040
the n data points.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.090
We kind of visualized it.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.410
This expression right here would
be a surface, I guess

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.520
you could view it as a surface
in three dimensions, where for

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.340
any m and b is going to be a
point on that surface that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.780
represents the squared
error for that line.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.860
Our goal is to find the m and
the b, which would define an

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.760
actual line, that minimize
the squared error.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.570
The way that we do that, is we
find a point where the partial

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.190
derivative of the squared error
with respect to m is 0,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.820
and the partial derivative
with respect to b is also

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.590
equal to 0.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.600
So it's flat with
respect to m.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.540
So that means that the slope
in this direction

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.660
is going to be flat.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.430
Let me do it in the
same color.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.110
So the slope in this direction,
that's the partial

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.720
derivative with respect to
m, is going to be flat.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.640
It's not going to change
in that direction.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.420
The partial derivative
with respect to b

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.400
is going to be flat.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.870
So it will be a flat point
right over there.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.680
The slope at that point in that
direction will also be 0,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.580
and that is our minimum point.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.960
So let's figure out the m and
b's that give us this.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.090
So if I were to take the partial
derivative of this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.220
expression with respect to m.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.700
Well this first term has
no m terms in it.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.330
So it's a constant from the
point of view of m.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.030
Just as a reminder, partial
derivatives, it's just like

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.630
taking a regular derivative.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.690
You're just assuming that
everything but the variable

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.290
that you're doing the partial
derivative with respect to,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.350
you're assuming everything
else is a constant.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.860
So in this expression, all the
x's, the y's, the b's, the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.490
n's, those are all constant.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.820
The only variable, when we take
the partial derivative

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.500
with respect to m, that
matters is the m.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.190
So this is a constant.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.510
There's no m here.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.920
This term right over
here, we're taking

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.700
with respect to m.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.690
So the derivative of this with
respect to m, it's kind of the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.880
coefficients on the m.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.560
So negative 2 times n times the
mean of the xy's, that's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.830
the partial of this
with respect to m.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.430
Then this term or right
here has no m's in it.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.700
So it's constant with
respect to m.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.450
So its partial derivative
with respect to m is 0.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.610
Then this term here, you have
n times the mean of the x

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.080
squared times m squared.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.100
So this is going to be-- we're
talking about a partial

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.740
derivative with respect to m--
so it's going to be 2 times n

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.690
times the mean of the
x [? squareds ?]

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.960
times m.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.060
The derivative of m squared is
2m, and then you just have

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.990
this coefficient
there as well.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.400
Now this term, you also
have an m over there.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.950
So let's see, everything
else is just kind of a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.250
coefficient on this m.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.940
So the derivative with respect
to m is 2bn times

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.120
the mean of the x's.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.500
If I took the derivative of 3m,
the derivative is just 3.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.340
It's just the coefficient
on it.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.530
Then finally, this is a constant
with respect to m.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.910
So we don't see it.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.510
So this is the partial
derivative with respect to m.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.670
That's that right over there.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.800
We want to set this
equal to 0.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.020
Now let's do the same thing
with respect to b.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.930
This term, once again, is
a constant from the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.520
perspective of b.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.940
There's no b here.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.380
There's no b over here.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.050
So the partial derivatives
of either of these with

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.440
respect to b is 0.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.390
Then over here you have a
negative 2n times the mean of

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.450
y's as a coefficient on a b.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.990
So the partial derivative with
respect to b is going to be

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.500
minus 2n, or negative 2n, times
the mean of the y's.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.230
Then there's no b over here.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.550
Then we do have a b over here.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.480
So it's plus 2mn times
the mean of the x's.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.490
This is essentially
the coefficient

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.480
on the b over here.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.520
It was written in a mixed order,
but all of these are

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.850
constants from the point
of view of b.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.860
They are the coefficient
in front of the b.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.670
The partial derivative of that
with respect to b is just

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.330
going to be the coefficient.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.860
Then finally, the partial
derivative of this with

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.820
respect to b is going to be 2nb,
Or 2nb to the first you

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.070
could even say.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.820
We want to set this
equal to 0.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.650
So it looks very complicated.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.840
But remember, we're just trying
to solve for the m's

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.530
and the b 's.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.290
We have two equations with
two unknowns here.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.820
We have the m's and then
we have the b's.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.080
To simplify this, both of these
equations, actually the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.900
top one and the bottom
one, both sides are

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.220
divisible by 2n.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.630
I mean 0 is divisible
by anything.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.530
It'll be just 0.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.440
So let's divide the top equation
and by 2n and see

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.020
what we get.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.940
If we divide the top equation by
2n, this'll become just 1.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.950
That goes away, and then
those go away.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.220
You would just be left with
negative times the mean, the

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.630
negative mean of the xy's plus
m times the mean of the x

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:22.260
squareds, plus b times the mean
of the x's is equal to 0.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.550
That's this first expression
when you divide both sides by

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.060
negative 2n.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.820
The second expression will
be, this will go away.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.440
This is when you divide
it by 2n.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.500
I don't want to say
negative 2n.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.240
When you divide this by 2n,
that'll go away, that will go

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.330
away, and then those
will go away.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.120
You're just left with the
negative mean of the y's plus

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:55.630
m times the mean of the x's
plus b is equal to 0.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.030
So if we find the m and the b
values that satisfy the system

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.620
of equations, we have minimized
the squared error.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.100
We could just solve it
in a traditional way.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.860
But I want to rewrite this,
because I think it's kind of

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.760
interesting to see what these
really represents.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.680
So let's add this mean
of the xy's to both

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.930
sides of this top equation.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.260
What do we get?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.930
We get m times the mean of
the x [? squareds ?]

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:36.110
plus b times the mean of the
x's is equal to, these are

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.700
going to cancel out, is equal
to the mean of the xy's.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.390
That's that top equation.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.070
This bottom equation, right
here, let's add the mean of y

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.880
to both sides of
this equation.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.040
I do that so that that
cancels out.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.730
And then we're left with m--
I'll do that in the blue color

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.940
to show you the same equation--
we have m times the

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:13.990
mean of the x's plus b is equal
to the mean of the y's.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.630
Now, I actually want to
get both of these

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.960
into mx plus b form.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.100
This is actually
already there.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:24.260
Actually you can see, that if
our best-fitting line is going

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.550
to be y is equal to mx plus b--
we still have to find the

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.350
m and the b-- but we see on
that best-fitting line,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.710
because the m and the b that
satisfy both of these

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.740
equations are going to be
the m and the b on that

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.830
best-fitting line.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.950
So that best-fitting line
actually contains the point,

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.780
and we get this from the second
equation right here.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.150
It contains the point.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.120
I should write it this way.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:04.080
The coordinate mean of x mean
of y lies on the line.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.640
And you could see it
right over here.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.800
If you put the mean of x in this
for the optimal m and b,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.720
you are going to get
the mean of the y.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.710
So that's interesting.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.690
This optimal line.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.160
Let's never forget what we're
even trying to do.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.370
This optimal line is going to
contain some point on it-- let

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.315
me do that in a new color--
it's going to contain some

00:08:28.315 --> 00:08:31.627
point on it right here that is
the mean of all of the x

00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:36.260
values and the mean of
all the y values.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.140
That's just interesting.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.340
It kind of makes sense.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.270
It kind of makes intuitive
sense.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.330
Now this other thing, just to
kind of get it in the same

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:43.970
point of view.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.590
Then it will actually become a
kind of an easier way to solve

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.000
the system.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.880
You could solve this a million
different ways.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.210
But just to give us an intuition
of what even is

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.690
going on here, what's another
point that's on the line?

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.840
Because if you have two points
on the line, you know what the

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.940
equation of the line
is going to be.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.630
Well the other point, we want
this to be in mx plus b form.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.180
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by this term

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.250
right here, by the
mean of the x 's.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:12.710
If we do that, we get m times
the mean of the x

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.080
[? squareds ?]

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.450
divided by the mean of the x's
plus b is equal to the mean of

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.350
the xy's divided by the
mean of the x's.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.560
So when you write it in this
form, this is the exact same

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.890
equation as that, I just divided
both sides by the mean

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.860
of the x's, you get another
interesting point that will

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.130
lie on this optimal fitting
line, at least from the point

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.970
of view of the squared
distances.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:49.060
So another point that will lie
on it, on this optimal line,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.720
the x value is going to be
this, the mean of the x

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.380
[? squareds ?]

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.630
divided by the mean
of the x's.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.020
Then the y value is going to
be the mean of the xy's

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.380
divided by the mean
of the x's.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.370
I'll let you think about
that a little bit more.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.560
But already, this is actually
the two points that lie on the

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:22.125
line, so both of these on the
best-fitting line based on how

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:24.860
we're measuring a good fit,
which is the squared distance.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.930
These are on the line
that minimize

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:27.930
that squared distance.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.850
What I'm going to do in next
video, and this is turning

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.180
into like a six or seven video
saga on trying to prove the

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.260
best-fitting line or finding
the formula for the

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.770
best-fitting line.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.750
But it's interesting.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.810
There's all sorts of kind of
neat little mathematical

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.390
things to ponder over here.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.930
But in the next video, we can
actually use this information.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.020
We could have just solved
the system straight up.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.550
But we can actually use this
information right here to

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.710
solve for our m and b's.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.140
Maybe we'll do it both ways
depending on my mood.
