JAMES MCGILL: Hi, I'm James
McGill, one of the software

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.170
engineers on the
Google Maps API,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.050
based out of beautiful
Sydney, Australia.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.702
I'm here in Logan, Utah, at
the headquarters of iFit,

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:16.730
for the world's first
digital 5-kilometer run.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.307
CHASE WATTERSON: Last week, we
took a runner with us to France

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:29.890
to run the beautiful
streets of Paris.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.910
And her iFit watch tracked
all the information on her run

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.200
and stored it in the iFit cloud.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.480
So when she landed back
at iFit headquarters,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.540
she was able to share that exact
run she experienced in Paris

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.320
with all of the runners here.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.790
On the treadmill
console, they were

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.470
able to see the
exact same streets

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.270
that she saw and even
feel the same incline

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.772
and decline of those streets.

00:00:49.772 --> 00:00:51.480
JARED MECHAM: While
we were going uphill,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.180
the treadmill went up.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.911
Going downhill, the
treadmill went down.

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:54.660
It was incredible.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.800
AMY PETERSON: It was
doing it for you,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.480
and you're getting
this amazing workout.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.490
It was so fun.

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:05.600
JAMES MCGILL: You're no
longer just staring at a wall.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.200
You get to visit
everywhere in the world,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.740
and you get to get fit
while you're doing it.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.740
ERIKA PETERSON: It's not
a boring treadmill run.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.470
You can literally run anywhere
in the world any time you want.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.600
SADIE JANE: Phenomenal-- unlike
any other treadmill experience

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.885
I've had.

00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:17.926
JAMES MCGILL: This Is one
of the most incredible,

00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:19.960
out-of-the-box integrations
that I've ever seen.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.230
And the best thing
about it is that it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.760
making everybody's life better.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.426
CHASE WATTERSON: IFit and Google
have completely changed the way

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:27.220
that you view fitness.
