00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.416
You may or may not be surprised to learn

00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:05.664
that there's really been no real financial compensation at all,

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:09.028
for Henrietta Lacks's family; however, the Moorehouse School of

00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:12.508
Medicine has donated money for Henrietta's and her daughter's grave

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:15.630
stone. And two members of the family now sit

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.210
on a committee at the NIH, who decides who gets

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.210
access to the genome information and there's a promise to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.430
acknowledge the family in scientific papers published, using the information.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.160
This is a great example of a story

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.930
that changed how we think about medical ethics.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.180
It's a fascinating story that you can read

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.640
far more about online, but I highly recommend

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.770
the book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.120
by Rebecca Skloot. Go to the forums and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030
chat with your classmates about what you think,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.500
the most moral outcome of this scenario should be.
