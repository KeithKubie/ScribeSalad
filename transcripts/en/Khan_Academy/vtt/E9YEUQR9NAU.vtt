00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.830
Given g of x is equal to
8x plus 2, find g of zero,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.840
g of negative 5,
and g 2x plus 3.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.280
So all this is, when they say
g of x is equal to 8x plus 2,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.600
this is a function definition.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.970
They're saying
you give me any x,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.510
and you input it
into my function g,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.800
and my function g will output,
will associate with that number

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.820
x, another number that
happens to be 8x plus 2.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820
This is one way to
create an association.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.070
It's going to associate
if you were to put 1 here.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.070
If this x is 1, you're going
to do 8 times 1 plus 2.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.210
So you would
associate 1 through g.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.300
You'd associate 1 with 8
times 1 plus 2, which is 10.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.410
So it's just another way
of creating association

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.310
that you could do with
sets of ordered pairs

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.810
or you could do it graphically.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.680
But this is one of
the most typical ways

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.960
you'll see a function defined.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.840
It says, look,
input an x over here

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.584
and I'm going to
output 8x plus 2.

00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:02.250
So with that out of
the way, let's think

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.550
about what the g of 0 is.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.540
g of 0 literally
just means we're

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990
inputting 0 into this function.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.040
And this function says,
whatever your inputting,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.950
I'm going to output
8 times that plus 2.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.940
So g of 0 is going to be--
let me write it this way

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.770
so it becomes clear
what I'm doing. g of 0

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.190
is going to be 8
times is 0 plus 2.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420
So wherever we saw the
x, we replaced it what it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.860
with whatever we're inputting.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.020
That is our x in this
situation right over here.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.850
And so this is equal
to 8 times the 0 plus 2

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.420
is just equal to 2.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.970
So g of 0 is equal to 2.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.700
Let me just write that
here. g of 0 is equal to 2.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.140
Now let's try g of negative 5.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.260
So let me write it this way.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.949
I'll write it, g of
negative 5 is equal

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.990
to-- I'll try to do the
color-coding a little bit

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.090
better this time.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
It's going to be equal
to 8 times our x, which

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.630
in this case, is negative 5.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.190
8 times negative 5 plus 2.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.110
We're inputting x-- We're
inputting a negative 5.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.900
And we're going to output
8 times negative 5 plus 2.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.110
Wherever we saw the x, we just
replace it with a negative 5.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.950
And this is just
equal to 8 times

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.430
negative 5 is negative 40 plus
2 is equal to negative 38.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.770
So I'll write this
over here on the right.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.920
We have g of negative 5
is equal to negative 38.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.440
Now, this last one is a
little bit interesting.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440
So we just did this one.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.467
Now, let's do g of 2x plus 3.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.050
So now they're not
inputting a number.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.870
They're inputting an expression.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.400
Now, what we have to do is
everywhere where we see x here,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.960
we're going to replace
it with that expression.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.870
If I did g of a circle--
let me write this down.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.600
If I did g of an orange
circle right over here.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.220
By this function
definition, if I'm

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.970
in putting an orange
circle, I should

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.794
output an orange circle 8
times the orange circle,

00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:19.210
which doesn't make
a lot of sense.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.170
But hopefully you get the idea
that whatever you're inputting,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.690
you're just going to multiply
it times 8 and add two.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.710
So if we input 2x plus 3, we're
going to output this times 8

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.300
plus 2.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.710
Wherever we see an x, we replace
it with this right over here.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.050
So let's try that out.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:46.560
So now we have g of 2x plus 3
is going to be equal to 8 times

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.590
whatever we're
inputting, eight times

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.052
whatever inputting plus 2.

00:03:51.052 --> 00:03:53.010
If this was an orange,
we'd put an orange here.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.093
If this is a negative 5,
we put a negative 5 here.

00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:56.860
If this is a 0, we
put a zero here.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.320
In this case, we're inputting
2x plus 3 into our function.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.660
So we put 2x plus 3 where
x is right over there.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.370
So 2x plus 3.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.740
Whatever we input, this function
says multiply by 8 and add 2.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.420
We're inputting 2x plus
3, multiply it by 8,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.690
and then add 2.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.950
And so this is going to be equal
to-- we just distribute the 8.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.740
And you get 16x plus 24.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.540
And then you still have
this plus 2 out over here

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.140
So this is going to be
equal to 16x plus these two.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.182
You add them up, you get 26.

00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:36.640
So we can write
over here, and I'll

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.580
do that same color so
it can be consistent.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.195
We have g of 2x plus 3
is equal to 16x plus 26.

00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:46.820
And we're done.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.270
I know it's going
to be confusing

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.130
because you're inputting--
you're replacing

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.661
x with something
that has x in it,

00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:54.160
but you really
should just view this

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.390
as if this was an orange ball
or a star or even if this had

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.890
y's is it.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.960
Wherever you see an
x, you replace it

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.590
with whatever you
are inputting it.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.500
In every instance, we
replace the x with 2x plus 3.
