cooperation a second reason which is
 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.230
cooperation a second reason which is
actually I think the most important one

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240
actually I think the most important one
 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.020
actually I think the most important one
it's because we're it simply China

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.519
China Sea and in this regard the march
west story fits well because that gives

it inland supply and I think Russia here

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920
it inland supply and I think Russia here
 

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.740
it inland supply and I think Russia here
is a big player as well and then um so

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:48.750
is a big player as well and then um so
 

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.170
is a big player as well and then um so
this is just a slide showing how this

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180
this is just a slide showing how this

this is just a slide showing how this
gas gas consumption is in China is

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.230
gas gas consumption is in China is
 

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.230
gas gas consumption is in China is
really a projected to take off due to

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240
really a projected to take off due to
 

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.990
really a projected to take off due to
environmental consideration in China and

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000
environmental consideration in China and
 

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.090

problem um so this is um just showing

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:08.550
problem um so this is um just showing
 

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.930
problem um so this is um just showing
how the new route the eastern route is

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:10.940
how the new route the eastern route is
 

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.180
how the new route the eastern route is
avoiding the wigger region and seems

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:14.190
avoiding the wigger region and seems
 

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.160
avoiding the wigger region and seems

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.070
to finalize the more desperate to
finalize this deal so I don't think

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080
finalize this deal so I don't think
 

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.650
finalize this deal so I don't think
Russia has any incentive to play the

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:13.660
Russia has any incentive to play the
 

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.470
Russia has any incentive to play the
Japanese card um I think Ukraine is

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480
Japanese card um I think Ukraine is
 

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.830
Japanese card um I think Ukraine is
somewhat of a wild card in this

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840
somewhat of a wild card in this
 

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.480
somewhat of a wild card in this
relationship although the natural

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:21.490
relationship although the natural
 

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.400
relationship although the natural
explanation would be that Russia is

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:23.410
explanation would be that Russia is
 

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.560
explanation would be that Russia is
going to turn even more eastwards

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:25.570
going to turn even more eastwards
 

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.930
going to turn even more eastwards
towards China obviously but even even

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:27.940
towards China obviously but even even
 

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.360
towards China obviously but even even
without Ukraine given the reasons I

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:30.370
without Ukraine given the reasons I
 

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.820
without Ukraine given the reasons I
already kind of advanced here I think

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:32.830
already kind of advanced here I think
 

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:38.160
already kind of advanced here I think
that will happen and I think it's also

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.170
that will happen and I think it's also
 

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.980
that will happen and I think it's also
interesting to consider the alternative

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:40.990
interesting to consider the alternative
 

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.890
interesting to consider the alternative
scenario if that doesn't happen so if

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:43.900
scenario if that doesn't happen so if
 

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.030
scenario if that doesn't happen so if
kind of like Russia doesn't take the

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.040
kind of like Russia doesn't take the
 

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.340
kind of like Russia doesn't take the
after 2020 window because China now is

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:50.350
after 2020 window because China now is
 

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.700
after 2020 window because China now is
supplied until 2020 so the question is

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:53.710
supplied until 2020 so the question is
 

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.950
supplied until 2020 so the question is
how much of a window does Russia have so

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960
how much of a window does Russia have so
 

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.960
how much of a window does Russia have so
if Russia doesn't really take advantage

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:57.970
if Russia doesn't really take advantage
 

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.500
if Russia doesn't really take advantage
of soon of a window after 2020 I think

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:01.510
of soon of a window after 2020 I think
 

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.070
of soon of a window after 2020 I think
we're going to see a very long straddle

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080
we're going to see a very long straddle
 

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.930
we're going to see a very long straddle
squaw where China is going to feel its

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:06.940
squaw where China is going to feel its
 

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.090
squaw where China is going to feel its

additional call because LNG is going to

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:11.380
additional call because LNG is going to
 

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.930
additional call because LNG is going to
get very expensive so I don't think it's

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:12.940
get very expensive so I don't think it's
 

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.180
get very expensive so I don't think it's
going to be able to rely only on energy

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:15.190
going to be able to rely only on energy
 

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.640
going to be able to rely only on energy

think an important one is
