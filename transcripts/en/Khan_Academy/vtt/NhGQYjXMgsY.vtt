00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:02.247
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:03.369
Today, I wanna talk about

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.472
ending sentences with prepositions,

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:08.649
and I wanna tell you, straight
up, it is totally okay.

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.174
Like, it is perfectly
grammatically correct and sensible

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:16.341
and fine to end sentences
with prepositions in English.

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.559
And if you don't know
what I mean, that's fine.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.837
Let me throw out some examples.

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:26.287
"It's a crazy world we
live in," for example,

00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:29.437
is a sentence that ends in
"in," which is a preposition.

00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:32.520
And for years, for hundreds of years,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.713
there have been people,
language authorities

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:38.116
that have been telling you it's not okay

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:39.958
to end a sentence with a preposition.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.828
Let me tell you, by
the power vested in me,

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:43.109
it is totally okay.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.613
This is one of those
language superstitions

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:47.113
that will not die.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.779
Taking away the terminal preposition

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:51.274
takes away sentences like,

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:53.597
"That's not behavior I'll put up with."

00:00:53.597 --> 00:00:55.760
And, in fact, some of you have maybe heard

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.685
the statement that is
supposedly attributed

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.602
to Winston Churchill where he says,

00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:06.014
"That is something with
which up I will not put,"

00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:10.680
which kinda emphasizes how
clunky that is, you know?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.217
If that's supposed to
be formal high language,

00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:15.587
it sounds really inarticulate.

00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:16.869
Not a fan.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.036
This is ultimately a question
not of grammar but of style

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:24.072
because there's nothing about

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:27.623
"It's a crazy world we live
in," that doesn't make sense

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:30.507
that doesn't function as a sentence.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.964
Indeed, there's nothing
grammatically incorrect

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:36.435
with, "This is behavior with
which up I will not put,"

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:41.268
it's just needlessly verbose
and twisting back on itself

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.164
for the sake of avoiding something

00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:46.021
that doesn't need to be avoided.

00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.365
And we can trace all of
this back to Robert Lowth,

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:50.661
a man who was the Bishop of London

00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:52.824
during part of the 18th century,

00:01:52.824 --> 00:01:56.429
and he wrote about terminal prepositions

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.775
in his 1762 "Short Introduction
to English Grammar,"

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:03.846
which reads in part, "This is an idiom

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:06.569
"which our language is
strongly inclined to;

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.439
"it prevails in common conversation

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.242
"and suits very well with the
familiar style in writing;

00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:12.871
"but the placing of the preposition

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:15.114
"before the relative is more graceful,

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:18.586
"and agrees much better with
the solemn and elevated style."

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:21.490
But, Bishop Lowth, may
I direct your attention

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.494
to this part of your statement?

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:25.962
"This is an idiom which our language

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:28.199
"is strongly inclined to."

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.637
Even when Bishop Lowth
is using what he calls

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:33.666
this solemn and elevated style,

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:36.897
he himself can not avoid ending a clause,

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:38.413
boom, with a preposition.

00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:40.246
Game, set, match, sir.

00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:45.222
The question is, why did Lowth
have such a bee in his bonnet

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:47.518
about prepositions at
the end of sentences?

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:50.162
And the answer can be found in Latin.

00:02:50.162 --> 00:02:52.752
Follow me over to the next screen.

00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:54.134
Here is the deal with Latin.

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:57.338
In Latin, prepositions have
a very particular function,

00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:00.910
similar to how they work in English.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.077
But let's break apart what
the word preposition is.

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:10.230
In Latin, the word "preposition"
comes from "prae positio,"

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:16.525
which means "placed before,"
right here, placed before,

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.783
because here's something cool about Latin:

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:22.663
Latin's word order rules are different

00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:24.601
than English's word order rules.

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:25.963
I'll explain.

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:28.707
You know, in English,
we have this expression,

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:30.416
"To put the cart before the horse,"

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:32.686
which means to embark on a project

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:34.728
before you're really ready.

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:38.253
And this is a very ancient
expression, in fact,

00:03:38.253 --> 00:03:41.753
one that can be attested in Latin like so.

00:03:43.293 --> 00:03:46.711
"Ante equum carrum ponere," right?

00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:50.878
Okay, so this is, "Before
the horse, the cart to put."

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.722
Here's the thing about
prepositions in Latin

00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:58.033
is that in Latin, this, "ante," before,

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:00.283
always has to be positioned

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:05.505
before the word it's attached
to, so before the horse.

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:10.203
But in Latin, you can rearrange

00:04:10.203 --> 00:04:11.832
this sentence any way you like.

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:15.665
So, you could say, "Carrum
ponere ante equum."

00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:24.369
And just because of the way Latin works,

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:25.677
because of its case endings

00:04:25.677 --> 00:04:29.309
and because of this
prepositional relationship,

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.807
we can always tell, no matter
what order the words are in,

00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:36.272
how the sentence parts
relate to one another.

00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:38.808
Or we could also switch it around:

00:04:38.808 --> 00:04:40.905
"Ponere carrum ante equum," right?

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:45.072
It could in any order, as
long as ante was before equum.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.030
Now, admittedly, in English,
if you wanted to end this

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.567
with a preposition, it would
still sound pretty awkward,

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:56.619
like, "The cart is the thing
that the horse is before,"

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:58.622
but it is still grammatical.

00:04:58.622 --> 00:05:02.861
If you move this thing, if
you move "ante" out of order,

00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.279
there's no way to tell what's
going on in this sentence.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.403
Latin, during the time that
Lowth was Bishop of London,

00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:12.340
was the language of scholarship, right?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.503
It was this language that enabled people

00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:16.132
all over the European continent

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:17.387
to communicate with each other

00:05:17.387 --> 00:05:19.530
in a common language of knowledge.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.447
It was the language of
religion and philosophy.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.957
And all of that added up
to make Latin really cool,

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:32.074
and also very powerful.

00:05:32.074 --> 00:05:35.191
And because of the history
of the English language,

00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:37.835
which basically entails people in boats

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:39.250
coming over the North Sea

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.000
to beat the tar out of
Celts and Anglo-Saxons

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.564
and leave Latin- or Norse-

00:05:44.564 --> 00:05:48.429
or French-shaped dents in their language,

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:50.699
English has this kind of

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.090
uncomfortable relationship with Latin.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.257
English scholars kinda had
an inferiority complex.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.701
And so, during the 17th and 18th century,

00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.706
you really see this move
towards Latinizing English,

00:06:05.706 --> 00:06:08.403
trying to make English grammar

00:06:08.403 --> 00:06:11.474
behave more like Latin grammar.

00:06:11.474 --> 00:06:14.892
But English comes from a
different language heritage;

00:06:14.892 --> 00:06:16.547
it's a Germanic language.

00:06:16.547 --> 00:06:18.550
And that doesn't mean it's
better or worse than Latin,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.354
it just means it's different,
and it behaves differently.

00:06:21.354 --> 00:06:24.291
We shouldn't try to treat English

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:28.430
as though it were anything
other than English.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.032
So, if anyone ever tells you

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:33.130
that you can't end a
sentence with a preposition,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.919
send them this page.

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.544
Or if you prefer, you know
where to send them to,

00:06:38.544 --> 00:06:42.416
which is here on Khan Academy,
where you can learn anything.

00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:43.249
David out.
