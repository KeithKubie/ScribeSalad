00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.070
JAMES HANSEN: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.040
And I love the
informality of the event.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.980
I was a university
professor for 32 years.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.030
I taught classes sometimes
during the noon hour.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.330
And they weren't supposed
to bring food or drink in,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.040
but they, of course,
did it anyway.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.050
So I'm used to just
about anything happening

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.870
in an audience.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.270
And so it'll be very relaxed.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.310
And I'm very happy to be
here at Google to meet you,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.470
to see your facility.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.130
Just as an aside before I
get started, Mark and Rick

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.440
Armstrong, Neil
Armstrong's two sons,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.530
I've gotten to know quite well.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.870
And one thing that
Rick told me was

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.030
that their nickname for
their dad in later years

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.440
was Mr. Google, because
Neil had this sort

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.590
of all embracing knowledge
about so many different fields.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.210
And so I guess maybe
they were teasing him

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.519
a bit that whenever something
would be brought up,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.420
he felt he would contribute
some additional knowledge

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.080
on the subject.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.520
So he was-- I
suppose there's lots

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.510
of Mr Googles in the world, but
Neil Armstrong was one of them.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.070
Biography, I'm
trained as a historian

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.030
of science and technology.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.450
And I didn't really
write my first biography

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.030
until this book, which I started
writing in the early 2000s.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.480
And it was originally
published in 2005.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.830
Biography is not easy to write.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.600
I suppose that's why I like
trying to do it so much.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.340
Writing biography is
always challenging.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.390
Just how difficult it
is to write a biography

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.900
can be reckoned by
anybody who sits down

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.230
and considers just
how many people,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.450
how few people really know
the truth, the real truth,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.820
about the secrets
that you hold closest

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.759
to your heart and
deepest in your minds.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.300
So I think there's always
something almost inherently

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.420
unfathomable about
us as individuals.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.120
And a biographer
does his or her best

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.990
to try to find
out those secrets.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.240
But there's always some
part of the person, I think,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.070
that we just can't achieve
a complete understanding.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.800
And maybe that's for the best.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.560
Biography is even
more challenging

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.690
when it's not just biography,
but it's also iconography,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.860
when it's a study
of an iconic person

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.950
onto whom various levels of
myth and symbol and poetry

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.600
and fiction have been projected
by society and culture.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.080
And I think in the
case of Armstrong

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.340
that certainly is part of it.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.630
So it's a biography
and an iconography.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.480
And for that reason, I think it
makes it especially fascinating

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.755
to study.

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:18.260
I'll tell you a story that I
think is very illuminating.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.780
Neil grew up in a series
of small towns in Ohio.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.730
He was born in 1930.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.400
And his father was--

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.480
both his father and
mother grew up on a farm.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.150
And they had eighth
grade educations.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.610
But the father had
studied accounting.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.860
And he got a job in the early
'30s during the Depression

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.135
as an auditor for
the state of Ohio.

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:44.510
And as a result
of this, he would

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.380
be assigned a certain county
to go in and do the books

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.740
and do an audit for that county.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.570
And he was an expert.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.030
Having grown up on a
farm, he was an expert

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.160
on accounting as it related to
farm land and farm businesses.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.910
And so Ohio was
mostly farm counties,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.910
with the exception
of the major towns.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.040
And so the family went to
places where they were really

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.670
out in the countryside.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.529
And so Neil, by the time he
was-- again, born in 1930--

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.040
by the time he was
9 or 10, he'd lived

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.650
in six or seven different
towns, small towns in Ohio.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.150
Now, they were all
the county seats,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.330
usually, or near
the county seats,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.710
but they were still rural areas.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.210
And when dad was
done with the job--

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.600
it took about a year.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.450
And then they would move on,
and sometimes across the state.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.700
And so the family
would get up and move.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.000
And so Neil was on the
move with his family

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.040
as a boy in various towns.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.500
Now, he ends up in a
town called Wapakoneta,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.190
which is in northwestern
Ohio, very agricultural.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.310
It's about 50 miles
north of Dayton

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.290
if you need your
geographical situation.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.760
So he arrives in Wapakoneta just
in time to begin high school.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.230
Ninth grade, which
was high school

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.770
for the kids in Wapakoneta.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.480
And it was a town back
then around the late 1930s,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.710
1940 that probably had
about 20,000 people.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.640
But it was the county
seat of Auglaize County.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.270
Well, in Wapakoneta where
Neil starts high school,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.980
there is a man in
Wapakoneta named Jacob Zint.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.690
Jacob was an engineer.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.880
He worked at Westinghouse up the
road from Wapakoneta in a town

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.580
called Lima, Ohio.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.520
And he was a bachelor.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.750
He was kind of the
town's Mr. Wizard.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.050
You're all too young to
remember the Mr. Wizard show.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.890
But Mr. Wizard just could
explain all things science

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.810
and invented things.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.840
And that was true of Jake Zint.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.670
And you're seeing
Jacob Zint's house,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.410
which was about a
block and a half

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.430
away from the Armstrong
home in Wapakoneta.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.820
And one thing that
Mr. Zint had done.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.950
I think I can do my laser.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.440
Up here, where the arrow
is pointing, he had--

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.230
the top floor up in
the attic of his house,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.810
he had built an
astronomical observatory

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.210
that included a telescope.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.200
And in early 1969 when
NASA announced the crew

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.070
for Apollo 11; Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, Mike Collins--

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.710
this was still before
Apollo 9 and Apollo 10

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.910
had completed their mission.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.490
But if they were going to
be completed successfully

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.710
as they were, then Apollo 11
would be the first landing

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.730
attempt.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.950
So the announcement
of this first crew,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.790
and especially after 9 and
after 10 were completed,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.720
and it was clear that 11 was
going to attempt the landing,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.600
all of a sudden there was a lot
of attention on the Apollo 11

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.860
crew, who these guys were.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.680
The media wanted to
know more about--

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.270
they wanted to write
feature stories

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.340
about these first
men that were going

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.960
to be landing on the moon.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.480
And Neil as the
commander-- and once

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.980
it was clear that the commander
was going to be stepping out

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.442
first to become the first
man on another planet,

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:22.650
there was a lot of attention.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.750
I mean, reporters from
all around the world

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.600
came to this little Ohio
town to learn what they

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.930
could about Neil Armstrong.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.230
They talked to
anybody and everybody

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.900
that had stories about
Armstrong growing up.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.302
Of course, he'd only been
there since his freshman year.

00:07:37.302 --> 00:07:39.010
But he spent his whole
high school there.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.500
And he'd played in the
band and different things.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.800
And so they come to Wapakoneta.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.760
And one person that talked
to the reporters a lot

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.780
was Jacob Zint.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.630
Jacob Zint told them this story.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.915
He told them that when--

00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:54.540
Neil was very active
in the Boy Scouts.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.510
He becomes an Eagle Scout,
as you can see Neil here

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.865
in his scout uniform.

00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:04.140
He always looked young, a very
young, handsome little boy.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.020
He looked always
younger than he was.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.835
In fact, he skipped a grade.

00:08:08.835 --> 00:08:13.560
In one of the towns that he went
to, when they sort of tested

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.310
him, they realized his
reading abilities were really

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.230
a grade higher than his age.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.880
So I think he skipped
the second grade.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.740
He went from first to third.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.940
So he was always
younger than his peers.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.410
But Zint told the reporters
the story that Neil's Boy Scout

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.450
troop came to the Zint home,
was invited by Zint to the home.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.590
And Zint took them up
to the observatory.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.740
And he told them about
how he built the telescope

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.590
and how a telescope operates.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.790
And then he let every boy come
and look through the telescope.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.310
And when the program
was over, there

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:58.070
was this little blond boy that
was sort of hanging around.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.990
And he was kind of shy.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.700
And Mr. Zint said he came--

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.270
this young boy came
up to him and asked

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.350
if he could come back.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.500
And of course, this
was Neil Armstrong.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.295
And according to Mr. Zint, Neil
came back many, many times.

00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:15.770
He looked through the telescope.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.080
They had long conversations
about how the moon was formed

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.050
and the universe.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.260
I mean, it was just
broad discussions.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.300
And Mr. Zint said even in a
later story that was reported--

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.700
and these stories were
reported by the AP Press

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.840
and went national and
I think international.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.340
Zint said that on the eve
of the Apollo 11 launch,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.580
that Neil had gotten a
message to him saying that he

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.350
was going to check out--

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.030
when he got to the
moon, he was going

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.360
to test some of the theories
that they had discussed years

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.870
before.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:53.150
Well, the Zint story,
here you see a selection

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.572
of children's books about
Neil that have been published.

00:09:57.572 --> 00:09:59.030
And all of these
had been published

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.120
by the time I started
my research on Neil

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.290
in the early 2000s.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.650
There are now a few more
that have been done.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.510
But the Jacob Zint story
was in all of these books,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.010
because it really sort of--

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.790
it makes so much sense that the
person who becomes an astronaut

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.800
and becomes the
first man on the moon

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.510
would have this
kind of background

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.078
and this sort of interest
in astronomy and cosmology

00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:24.620
and whatever.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.340
Back to this slide.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.160
So when I'm
interviewing Neil, and I

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.390
had a total of 55 hours
of tape recorded interview

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.270
with him, which was
exceptional, because Neil

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.920
didn't give many interviews.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.950
And if you were lucky enough
to get an interview with him,

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.420
you might have 30 minutes.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.700
And you didn't-- you needed to
go right to the moon landing,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.200
right?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.900
I mean, you couldn't waste time
with a lot of other discussion.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.380
But I had 55 hours with
him over several months.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.010
And I didn't talk to
him about the moon

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.220
probably until my
30th hour or more.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.150
But so I was going through
sort of sequentially,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.020
talking first about his family
background, his boyhood.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.330
And given the prominence
of the Jacob Zint story,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.190
I thought I wanted to
hear more about this.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.200
It was fascinating.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.470
It seemed to define so
much about his life,

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.830
the arc of his life story.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.920
So I said, tell me more about
your time with Jacob Zint.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.260
And Neil looked
down at the ground.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.880
We were sitting in his study.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.730
And he looked back up.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.050
And he said to
me, it's not true.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.900
I said, it's not true.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.320
What's not true?

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.800
He said, well, it is true that
we were invited to his home.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.980
He took us up to
the observatory.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.220
He told us-- he lectured
to us about the telescope.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.690
He would not let any of us
look through the telescope.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.990
And when the evening ended,
I never saw Mr. Zint again.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.030
He wouldn't have
known me passing

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.980
by the street on my bicycle.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.930
He wouldn't have
known who I was.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.050
And I said to him, really?

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.390
I said-- and at that point,
I pull out of my folders--

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.290
I had a bunch of
clippings, not only

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.750
these stories that
we're published

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.170
all over the place about Zint
and his relationship with Neil

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.710
Armstrong.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:24.140
But about a month after Apollo
11 came back from the moon,

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.720
there was a big
parade in Wapakoneta.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.787
The Purdue Marching Band.

00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:32.120
Neil had gone to Purdue and
played in the marching band.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.920
The Purdue Marching Band and
the Golden Girls from Purdue

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.960
were in the parade.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.110
Bob Hope, the entertainer
who's from Ohio, he was there.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.980
The governor of Ohio,
Jim Rhodes, was there.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.540
Neil and his family were
riding in open convertibles.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.720
And guess who else was riding
in an open convertible.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.710
Jacob Zint had his
own open convertible,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.110
because he had
become a local hero

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.430
for this role he played in
helping the formation of Neil

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.740
Armstrong's interest in space.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.050
So I said, Neil, he's
got his own convertible.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.740
I said, didn't you correct this?

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.480
And Neil said, ah, I--

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.100
literally he said this, I didn't
want to rain on his parade.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.720
So he never-- and in fact, as
I look back on it in the months

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.450
later and certainly now, if I
had not asked him specifically

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:29.760
about Jacob Zint, Neil would
never have told me about it.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.830
He only answered the
questions that I asked him.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.420
So if I had not asked
him about Jacob Zint,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.180
we wouldn't have
gotten that corrected.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.600
The story would
have perpetuated.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.860
Another couple of twists,
sort of ending footnotes

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.280
to this, the telescope
and kind of the structure

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.220
that Mr. Zint had built around
it for his observatory was

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.540
eventually, I think,
sold by the Zint family

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.480
to the Auglaize County Museum.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.330
And it in fact became
the centerpiece

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.450
of the whole museum
because of its role

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:13.070
in the formation of
young Neil Armstrong.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:17.810
I'm giving a talk after the book
comes out in Dayton, just down

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.482
the road.

00:14:19.482 --> 00:14:21.440
And my wife is sitting
in the back of the room.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.030
It's about this size of a crowd.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.620
A little bit larger, maybe.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.930
And at the end I'm signing some
books and talking to people.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.590
And I see my wife is talking
to somebody in the back.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.080
And when the room
sort of clears,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.880
she comes up front with a man.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.290
And she says, this gentleman
wants to talk to you.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.470
It was the nephew of Jacob Zint.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.020
The family was quite
disturbed by what

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.690
they had read in my
book about Jacob Zint,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:55.310
because they believed Uncle Jake
had really done these things.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.240
And they questioned
whether I was really--

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.220
whether I was right
about this or not.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.360
And all I could tell them
was I have recordings where

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.950
I talk about this with Neil.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.750
Neil was very plain about it.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.760
Write him if you choose.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.430
And I think they later did.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.410
But this was a very
significant story for me.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.800
Actually, in the new
edition of the book,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.820
we wanted to shorten the
book in some respects.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.240
And my editor wanted to cut
the Jacob Zint story out

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.380
of the book.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.540
And I said, no, no,
no, you can't do that.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.980
It's such an important story.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:38.710
Because what it
informed me about was

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.220
I couldn't trust anything
that was out there.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.440
I was going to have to
question and interrogate

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.540
the evidence so carefully,
because if Zint told a story,

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.980
who knows?

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.400
The moon landing was such
a big thing, especially

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.510
in Ohio and in the
town of Wapakoneta.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.010
People wanted to be
part of the story.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:09.340
So I did-- as a result of my
awareness of this possibility,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.330
I did test a lot of
the oral history,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.130
a lot of the
testimony, and found

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.740
that there were lots of
exaggerations and fabrications.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:27.370
And I didn't want
to debunk them just

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.430
for the purposes of
getting the facts straight.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:35.140
I wanted to understand
why people were doing it.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.840
What it tells us not
about Neil so much,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.950
but about us, about
society and culture.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:47.470
And as I did find out, I
was writing an iconography,

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.520
because he became
such a global icon.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.710
And so much was
projected onto him.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.810
This is the trajectory that you
get in a very simplified form

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:07.970
if you accept the Jacob Zint
story, that Neil as a boy

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.220
became very interested
in astronomy.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.740
He was a dreamer.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.130
Eyes to the heavens,
looking through telescopes.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.930
Very interested in the moon.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.690
Read a lot of science fiction.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.420
And thus it makes
total sense that this

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.700
is the guy that would from that
boy would become the astronaut,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.380
would make the moon landing.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.070
It's so logical, but
completely false.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.510
It's a false narrative.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.700
As much as it makes
sense, it doesn't.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.560
It's not true.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.620
And so my job as the
biographer was not

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.190
only to make that
clear, but to show

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.810
the real, the reality of it.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.890
And the reality of it was
Neil was all about airplanes.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.360
As a boy, a little boy,
he saved every penny.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.100
He begged his mother
every time they

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.010
went to the hardware store.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:03.330
He wanted stuff to
build model airplanes.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.470
I show this slide.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.860
You see his brother and
sister over in the right side.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.180
And he was a proto-engineer.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.050
And one example from his early--

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.220
from his childhood.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.800
By the time he was maybe--
this was when he was 10 or 11.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.860
He would have models
that he wasn't really

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.360
all that happy with.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.390
He would decide, well, let's
do something special with them.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.390
So he would take his
brother and sister

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.560
to the upstairs window
of one of the bedrooms.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.140
And he would show them how
he wanted them to throw

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.380
the models out of the window.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.420
And then after he'd
show them, there

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.420
would be maybe a dozen of
them on the bed for them to--

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.940
sort of the staging area.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.140
He would run down.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.510
And there was one of
these old driveways

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.540
that had concrete strips
with grass in between.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.730
And he had a bunch
of popsicle sticks.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.270
And as the airplanes would
be shot out of the window

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.120
and would land, he would
mark where they'd landed

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.650
with his popsicle sticks.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.850
And he would write with the
pencil which airplane it was.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.010
And he had a notebook.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.710
And he'd write down the
results of the flight tests,

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.330
gather them up,
bring them back up,

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.660
have them shot out
the window again.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.160
Take down the notes.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.170
He was doing flight research.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.330
He becomes a test pilot.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.230
He's a proto-engineer as a boy.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.937
He had his pilot's license
before his driver's license.

00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:35.020
He started going out to
this little grass airfield

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.450
on the edge of Wapakoneta when
he was maybe 13, 14 years old.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.450
He'd help the mechanics.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.367
He'd do whatever they
would let him to do just

00:19:42.367 --> 00:19:44.110
to be around the airplanes.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.460
And then he saved up
money for flying lessons.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.020
And he got his license on his
birthday, his 16th birthday.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.690
He hadn't even been
interested in driving.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.310
So that's the story that
really needed to be told.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.510
He enters Purdue in 1947 to
become an aircraft designer.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.880
That's what he wants to be.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.510
He wants to design airplanes.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.350
17 years old.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.400
He goes there on a
Navy scholarship.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.100
And after two years
of his education,

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.930
the Korean War breaks out.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:21.090
And he is called to Pensacola
to do naval aviator training.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.930
And this is my very favorite
picture of Armstrong.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.490
It's right after
his first carrier

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.450
landing in the Gulf of
Mexico, March of 1950.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.830
He was 19.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.470
He looks like he's maybe 12.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.950
And just by far my
favorite picture.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.300
I got all of his Navy records.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.960
It was really interesting
to follow all of the reports

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.060
by the pilots who
were instructing him

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.180
and what they were saying about
his flying, which wasn't always

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.460
perfect.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.930
It wasn't perfect at all.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.300
So he goes from there.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.700
He gets assigned eventually to a
fighter squadron that is really

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.940
one of the first all jet fighter
plane squadrons in the US Navy.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.850
He's flying the Panther jet.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.760
He's part of VF-51
and goes to Korea.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.420
He flies 78 combat
missions over North Korea.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.800
Very exciting.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.950
Very formative part of his life.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.490
He would go to reunions
of the fighter squadron

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.200
almost every time they had them.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.150
Whereas astronaut
reunions, he was very

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.580
selective about going to those.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.510
Then when he comes back, he
finishes his degree at Purdue.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.420
He's still interested
in aircraft design,

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.730
but he loves the flying.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.820
And so he realizes
that there is this job.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.100
There is this kind of engineer.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.900
It's the engineering
research pilot, the guys

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.340
with the real right stuff.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.840
Engineers in the airplanes.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.540
So he gets a job with what
was then the National Advisory

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.500
Committee for Aeronautics, or
NACA, which was the agency that

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.700
preceded NASA, and which really
provided the nucleus for NASA

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.620
when NASA was established
in 1958 following Sputnik.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.000
So he gets a job.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.940
He first gets assigned
to Cleveland, actually.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:17.060
But Scotty Crossfield, who was
the first pilot to fly Mach 2,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.040
Crossfield left the
NACA in '56 in order

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.220
to become the chief test pilot
for North American Aviation,

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.610
which was building the X-15.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.620
So Crossfield
moved over and left

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.070
a spot open at Edwards, on
the civilian side of Edwards.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.070
Neil took that.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.220
So that's how he
gets to Edwards.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.060
He stays there.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.210
He flies 50 different
types of airplanes.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.760
Lots and lots of times in jets.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.120
And very significantly for
his astronaut selection,

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.920
he's the only one
of the astronauts

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.090
in either of the first or second
class of astronauts that had

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.000
any experience flying a rocket.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.350
And that's the X-15.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:01.330
Of course, the very first scene
of the movie is an X-15 flight.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.590
So that's Neil.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.030
And he then chooses--

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.350
he entered astronaut
selection at that point.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.780
So this is the real trajectory.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.420
Not the trajectory that we
build from Jacob Zint's story,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:18.540
but the boy that has this
passion for airplanes, that

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.430
wants to be an aircraft
designer, that's

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.750
a proto-engineer doing flight
research as a 10-year-old out

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:31.560
of his bedroom window, goes to
Purdue, becomes a test pilot.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.120
And it's really a trajectory
that's not completely

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.250
a trajectory of his
own, because if you're

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.130
looking at what's happening
to the history of flight,

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.900
over the course of
the '40s and '50s,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.350
you're having the move
from subsonic to transonic

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.750
to supersonic to
hypersonic flight.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.620
That's happening.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.690
And since Neil's
in a position where

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.200
he's employed to be testing
these vehicles as they're

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.750
coming online to be tested,
Neil goes with that trajectory.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.060
The technology is
taking him there.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.310
It's not like he ever intended
to be flying into space.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.560
He never thought
about that as a boy.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.140
But that's where the
technology, that's where

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.630
the progress was taking flight.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.870
And he went with it, and
was in a great position

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:23.790
in terms of timing, in terms
of his age and his experience.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.940
He was perfectly situated
to take advantage of it

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.350
if he chose to go that route.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.710
This is a very, I think,
illuminating quotation

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.780
from Neil, something
that he said to me

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.410
in one of my interviews.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.650
Neil, I think it's right
to call him an explorer,

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.140
but I think to really
understand him,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.810
this quotation gets much
closer to the truth.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.500
"What I attended to was
the progressive development

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.030
of flight machinery.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.990
My exploration came totally
as a byproduct of that.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.780
I flew to the Moon not
so much to go there,

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.600
but as part of developing
the system that

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.210
would allow it to happen."

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:10.540
And I think that's a really
critical understanding of how

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.450
he saw himself and what
he was actually doing.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.220
So that's myth one.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.370
Neil as a young stargazer,
the Jacob Zint story.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.810
That's a myth, I think, really,
biographical you have to bust,

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:27.220
or you're really never going
to fathom who the guy was.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.380
Actually, I could give
you-- if you invite me

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.460
back about 10 times, I could
go through all the myths

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.810
that there are about Armstrong.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.840
I'm only going to concentrate
on two of them really today.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.110
But there are an incredible
number of myths about him

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.200
if you really want
to understand him.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.210
The book tries to lay them out.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.780
Myth two.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.150
I guess there are three of
them I'm going to talk about.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.880
I kind of already
hinted at this.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.960
"The Right Stuff."

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.000
I loved the book.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.930
Tom Wolfe's book from 1979.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.465
Whenever I taught my graduate
seminar in aerospace history

00:26:05.465 --> 00:26:07.340
at Auburn, I always had
the students read it.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.780
It's a fabulous read.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.470
It's great for conversation.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.380
And what is the right stuff?

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.810
I looked through the book again.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.180
I looked through my notes
on when I taught the book.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.070
And this is the
closest thing I could

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.620
get to a singular definition.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.140
"The ability of a pilot to
go up in a hurtling piece

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.360
of machinery and put
his hide on the line

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.480
and then have the moxie, the
reflexes, the experience,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.880
the coolness to pull it
back at the last yawning

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.880
moment, and then go up
again, even if the series

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.660
should prove infinite."

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.630
That's the closest thing to the
right stuff, based on Wolfe's

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.340
book, that I could get.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.680
Of course, the image
of the right stuff

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.100
is you've got these proud,
unwilling to admit weakness,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.590
not given to small
talk or introspection,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.340
very courageous, very
charismatic, somewhat arrogant,

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.770
occasionally kind of
coarse, very competitive.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.860
That's the image
of the right stuff

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.470
that Wolfe is really
telling us about.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:09.480
And of course, in the book
and in the movie from 1984

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.490
that resulted from
the book, who's

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.010
the one with the
real right stuff?

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.490
Is it an astronaut?

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:16.680
No, it's Chuck Yeager.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.100
And that's a myth as
far as I'm concerned.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.510
I think as far as a lot
of historians of flight

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.620
are concerned.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.100
Neil, I think, and
pilots like Neil,

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.310
had what I call the real
right stuff, that were not

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.290
trying to break records.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.750
They were trying to learn.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.792
They were trying
to build knowledge.

00:27:41.792 --> 00:27:43.500
They were engineers
in the cockpit trying

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.040
to learn about the machine, the
environment the machine was in,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.370
the relationship of the
pilot to the machine.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.240
Data.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.030
You need to get data
from your flights.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.880
You'll never hear Chuck Yeager
in his whole life talking

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.260
about knowledge or data.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.690
It's about other things.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.370
The real right
stuff, in my view,

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.820
is what has really contributed
to the progress of flight.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.420
I gave talks at what was
then NASA Dryden-- it's now

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:14.280
NASA Armstrong-- where
I've gone on at length

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.320
about the real right stuff.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.150
And my book talks
about it as well.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.080
And I'll tell you a little
story which was crucial to,

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.890
I think, my getting
Armstrong to agree

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.850
to letting me do the book.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.850
You're seeing a picture
of an NACA/NASA test pilot

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.370
by the name of Jack
Reeder, who was

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.700
a test pilot from 1943 to 1982.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.990
Not a famous name that
you would recognize,

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.470
but I got to know Jack
pretty well, quite

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.810
well, because my first
job out of grad school

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:52.210
was to write a book about NASA
Langley, the oldest of the NASA

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.700
facilities, because it was
the first NACA facility.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.830
Reeder I got to know quite
well, and learned a lot

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:05.060
about the real right
stuff from him.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:10.340
He actually had been an
engineer from Michigan Tech who

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.570
wasn't originally a pilot.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:16.550
He was an engineer in the full
scale wind tunnel at Langley.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.550
But during the war, Second
World War, they needed more--

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:23.030
I mean, pilots were going out
to the Pacific and to Europe

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:23.720
to fight.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.940
And NACA was short on pilots.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.440
So they took some
of their engineers

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.910
who were willing to do it.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.142
And they sent them through.

00:29:30.142 --> 00:29:32.600
Jack went down to Pensacola
and went through naval aviation

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.930
training, and then came
back to be a test pilot,

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.420
and became a superb test pilot.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.150
I'm going to skip over
this one, because I

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.840
am kind of talking about this.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.280
I mean, there is this cult of
the astronaut that is still

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.400
kind of tied to the
real right stuff

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:58.320
that I think is important
to demystify, demythologize.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.650
I think there's a lot about
our social and cultural

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:09.800
apprehension of the astronaut,
which is not the best

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.070
understanding, I think, of
what the astronauts truly

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.880
contributed.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.080
I guess I got rid of one, but
I need to go back to this then.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.785
But here's the key that I wanted
to mention with Jack Reeder.

00:30:23.785 --> 00:30:25.160
It took me about
two years to get

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.630
Neil to agree to do the
book, to give me the access.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.840
And the critical moment
came when I went to his home

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.240
in suburban Cincinnati
and sat with him

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.305
for the afternoon,
talked to him,

00:30:37.305 --> 00:30:38.730
a brief, flowing conversation.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:39.688
It wasn't an interview.

00:30:39.688 --> 00:30:41.288
It wasn't recorded.

00:30:41.288 --> 00:30:42.830
And his wife, Carol,
his second wife,

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.450
came in and out of the
room from time to time.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.920
And at one point I
mentioned to him something

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.750
about Jack Reeder.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.920
And I wasn't fishing
for anything.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.390
I had no reason to--

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.030
I had no reason to
think he actually

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.710
even knew who Jack Reeder was.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.410
The minute I
mentioned Jack Reeder,

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.830
Neil turns to his
wife, Carol, and says,

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.090
Jack Reeder was the best
test pilot I ever knew.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.880
And then he turns back
to me and he says,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.700
and Chuck Yeager was the worst.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.250
That's the only
time I ever heard

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.802
Neil say anything
bad about anybody,

00:31:15.802 --> 00:31:18.260
which meant he really had some
intense feelings about Chuck

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.350
Yeager.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:23.520
Read Yeager's autobiography
from years ago.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.720
And you'll see what Yeager
has to say about Neil.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.540
It's worse than what Neil
has to say about Yeager.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.430
They were not on
the same wavelength.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.630
But you might remember
that phrase the most.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.540
But what you really-- what
I really wanted to emphasize

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.970
was the first part
of what Niel said.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:46.080
Jack Reeder was the best
test pilot I ever knew.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.610
Because Jack was an engineer.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.240
He was an engineering research
pilot, about knowledge,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.790
about data, the engineer in the
cockpit, the real right stuff.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.040
And I just--

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.030
I was pretty happy that he
knew who Jack Reeder was.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:06.330
And leaving the home that
day, I kind of thought, gosh,

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:10.230
what are the odds that I'm
going to mention to Neil someone

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:15.120
who he thinks is the best
test pilot he ever knew?

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.300
It took another year after that
to get the final green light

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.140
from him.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:23.430
But I think Neil appreciated
the fact that I understood.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.290
I mean, if I had
said to him that day,

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.140
boy, I really love Chuck Yeager.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.642
What do you think about Yeager?

00:32:29.642 --> 00:32:31.350
I probably wouldn't
have gotten the book.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.475
Really, I don't think I
would have gotten the book.

00:32:33.475 --> 00:32:35.610
But instead, I knew why Chuck--

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.980
I not only knew who Jack Reeder
was and was a friend of Jack

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.480
Reeder's.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.220
I knew why he was
important, and why

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.380
his flying was the kind
of flying that really

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.610
meant a lot to progress.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.960
I think I might have cinched
the book deal with Neil

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.310
right then and there.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.660
Do I have time for
one more story?

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.335
Do I?

00:32:54.335 --> 00:32:56.850
I don't know when you guys
have to be back to work.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.510
This is work.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.760
This should be
considered work, right?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.920
This is the last myth that
I'm going to talk about.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.990
And it's also about
his childhood.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.650
And I'm a strong believer
as a human being, let alone

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:12.520
a biographer, that the child
is the father to the man.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.850
If you don't understand the
development of the child--

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.160
in this case, Neil growing
up, personality development,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.780
understanding his parents, his
family situation, his siblings,

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.070
his community--

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.070
then you really can't
understand what he becomes

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.420
and who he becomes.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.950
And of course,
that's the problem

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.470
when you have a movie like
"First Man" where you pick up

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.800
the story in 1961
when he's a test pilot

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.710
and you don't have any of
the background material.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:39.827
You really kind of--

00:33:39.827 --> 00:33:41.410
from my point of
view as a biographer,

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.120
it's really kind of
hard to really know

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.320
who this guy was if
you don't know really

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.140
the formation of who he was.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.690
This is Neil's mother, Viola.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.580
She was a really important
person from my book.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.090
Unfortunately, she
died in the early '90s.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.010
So I didn't get
to interview her.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.775
But I did interview, besides
Neil, his two siblings,

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:06.490
his sister June and
his brother Dean.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.290
And his sister
June was absolutely

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.460
crucial to what I
could then-- what

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.440
I would learn about Neil and
the family and the mother.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.350
And June actually
made available to me--

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.219
after the Apollo 11 mission
and Neil becoming this world

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:25.449
famous person,
Viola wrote a series

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:29.800
of really kind of
family memoirs.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.380
Most of them focusing
on Neil, but also

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.300
talking about her upbringing
and the deep family background,

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.889
but a lot about Neil.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.300
So Viola was a really
important character.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.300
The relationship between
Neil and his mother

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.770
is especially
important, I think,

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.190
to understand who Neil became.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.630
So here's the story.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:57.970
In February 1970 a few
months after Apollo 11,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.660
there's a story published in
"Guideposts" magazine, which

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.600
is a Christian magazine.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.920
Viola Armstrong was a very
devout evangelical Christian.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.900
And the story was Neil
Armstrong's boyhood crisis.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.660
And the story that Viola
told that got published

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.780
in this magazine was
that Neil, just soon

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:26.140
after he started flying
out of a grass airfield--

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.270
actually, he was with
his father, his brother,

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.220
and a friend coming back.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.870
His father was driving the car.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.640
They were coming
back from a Boy Scout

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.840
Jamboree in northeastern--
northwestern Ohio.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.130
And they were
coming back to town.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.440
And as they got to
the outskirts of town,

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.240
they saw one of the
Aeronca airplanes

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.950
that the student pilots were in.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.120
And it was coming down.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:51.580
And it hit the telephone
wires and crashed.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.540
And Mr. Armstrong drove
as close to the airfield

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.710
as he could get.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.810
And they all rushed
out of the car.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.540
And Neil got there first.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.720
And it was an older
boy, but someone Neil

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.660
knew that was also
taking flying lessons.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.790
And according to the
story that was published,

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:14.130
the boy dies in Neil's arms.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.660
And as Viola told
the story, the crisis

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.810
then became Neil was
very disturbed by this,

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:27.720
and for the next several days
didn't come out of his room.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.160
And Viola said he was reading
his Bible and praying to Jesus.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.950
He wasn't sure he
should ever fly again.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.020
And then one day he
came out of his room.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.170
I mean, she was
bringing him his food.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.990
He was crying and depressed.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.060
And one day he came
out of the room,

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.240
and he told her-- went
right to her and said,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.580
god has told me that
I need to keep flying.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.650
I should keep flying.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.130
And so I'm going to keep flying.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.620
And so that was the crisis, that
Neil could have stopped flying.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.310
Well, I wanted to hear
more about that story.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.440
I did have the clippings from
the local paper about the crash

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.300
and what was said at
the time and so forth.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.820
And Neil was involved.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.040
There's no question
that the crash happened.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.950
Neil and the parents, his dad,
and his brother were there.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.470
I wanted to hear more about it.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:21.550
And I had this story
from the "Guideposts."

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:25.780
And I think I actually talked
to his sister about this first

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.750
before I talked
to Neil about it.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.520
So I asked June about it.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.380
And she said, yeah, we
remember that story very well.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.380
It's a bunch of baloney.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.080
We remember the crash.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.670
Neil had no crisis.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:48.220
He never questioned whether
he was going to fly again.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.140
I don't remember him being
up in his room like this.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.730
You just have to understand mom.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.060
Mom had this really
fervent religious belief.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.220
She talked about
religion with us a lot.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.590
She wanted us to talk about
different Bible passages

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.120
at dinner time.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.200
And Neil never bought into that.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.300
Neil never really didn't
embrace her beliefs.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.520
And in fact, what
June told me was

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.360
Neil really is not--
he believes in god,

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.460
but he doesn't believe in
any particular doctrine.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.920
So I'm not even sure
he's really a Christian.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.980
And I said to her,
I said, well, when

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.265
your mother talked about
religion, what did Neil do?

00:38:32.265 --> 00:38:33.870
She said, well, he would listen.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.480
He never-- he was not
the argumentative type.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.750
In fact, I've never seen him
in an argument his whole life.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.760
What he would do is he
would listen politely,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.060
not say anything,
then walk away.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.460
He didn't want to argue.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.050
Whatever his beliefs were,
he kept them to himself.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:56.210
So when I interviewed him,
I asked him the questions.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.520
And the story was--

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.160
I mean, he was a little less
wordy about what was going on.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.550
But it's clear from what
he said that his mother--

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:06.520
again, it was like mom just--

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.690
there were things mom wanted
to believe that we just

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.670
let her keep believing.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.750
But I did-- when I
interviewed other people--

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.670
and this includes astronauts
and flight controllers and other

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.880
people who worked with him--

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.140
I always asked, did you ever
seen Neil in an argument?

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.355
No, he didn't argue.

00:39:24.355 --> 00:39:27.540
It didn't mean he
agreed with us.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:33.300
But he had other ways of
getting what he wanted done.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.800
He didn't argue.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.210
And I think that it was a
conflict avoidance strategy

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:43.680
that he had learned pretty
young as a boy in relationship

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.600
to his mother.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.140
So another myth
that's out there has

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.410
to do with his
religious beliefs.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:56.170
And again, as a
biographer, I'm not

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.880
trying to prove any point one
way or another about religion.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.200
I'm just trying to tell a story
and be as faithful and accurate

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.770
about Armstrong as possible.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.560
There is a story that
circulates even today.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.980
Neil visited Jerusalem at
some point later in life.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.450
And the story goes that when
he was on the stairs climbing

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.280
to the Temple Mount in
Jerusalem, that he professed

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.180
his Christian religious beliefs.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.262
In fact, this is a story from
"Tablet" magazine that comes--

00:40:25.262 --> 00:40:27.220
and it's a story that
actually appeared earlier

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.070
in other places,
but it was repeated.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:35.680
This was actually two days after
Neil died in August of 2012.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.790
And the story goes--

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.040
it says, when American
astronaut Neil Armstrong,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.610
a devout Christian, visited
Israel after his trip

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.490
to the moon, he was taken
on a tour of the Old City.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.350
When they got to the
stairs of the steps

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.270
leading to the Temple
Mount, Armstrong

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.700
asked the guy who was escorting
them whether Jesus had

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.207
stopped anywhere around there.

00:40:53.207 --> 00:40:55.790
And the man said, these are the
steps that lead to the temple.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.600
So he must have walked
here many times.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.250
And Neil said, so Jesus
stepped right here.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.492
That's right.

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.950
Well, I have to
tell you, I am more

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:04.600
excited stepping on
these stones than I

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.405
was stepping on the moon.

00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:08.280
I had already talked to
Neil about this story

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.447
because it appeared earlier.

00:41:09.447 --> 00:41:12.940
And I talked to Carol, his wife,
who was with him in Jerusalem

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.140
for this visit.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.730
It's a totally fabricated story.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.410
I mean, not that
he wasn't there,

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.782
but it's not-- he never said it.

00:41:20.782 --> 00:41:22.990
There are people that want
to believe this about him.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.820
It's just not-- it's
simply not true.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.110
This is the truth.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.780
I mean, actually,
there were stories

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.380
about Neil's religious beliefs
that came up in the press

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.450
prior to Apollo 11.

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:38.620
There was a woman who was
very famous American atheist,

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.450
Madalyn Murray O'Hair.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.820
Some people called her--

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.280
I mean, the press dubbed her
the most hated woman in America,

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.780
because she was
suing the government

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.630
over reading from the book
of Genesis on Apollo 8.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:54.700
And she picked up something in
a German magazine, an interview

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.740
with Neil, and it
suggested to her

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.440
that Neil was an atheist,
which he was not.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.720
He was a deist.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:07.510
But that became enough news
that when Neil and the crew

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:12.610
were on "Face the Nation" on CBS
in the weeks after Apollo 11,

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.690
Walter Cronkite asked Neil,
when you were on the moon,

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.340
did you feel closer to god?

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.030
That's a question that came
up to a lot of the astronauts.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.200
Well, what did Neil answer?

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.570
Walter, sometimes a man
just wants a good cigar.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.190
Total non-sequitur.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:42.230
And watching Cronkite's
facial expression

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:48.580
is priceless, because he's
not sure he's heard it right.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.500
But he does realize,
well, clearly I'm

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.530
not supposed to
pursue that topic.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.820
And he did not.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.830
There's Madalyn Murray
O'Hair and her claim

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.140
that he was an atheist,
which is not true either.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.740
As I said, he was a deist.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.680
Now, here's a story that
persists to this day.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.590
If you get on your
computer and Google--

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.490
Google, yeah.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:18.360
I don't think I've ever
had such fun saying that.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.020
Google Neil
Armstrong plus Islam.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.440
You will get hundreds
of thousands of hits.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.590
The story circulated not
long after Apollo 11,

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.760
that while on the lunar surface,
Neil heard this strange singing

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.440
or whatever.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.890
He didn't know what it was.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.730
He heard it again once
he was back on Earth.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.170
He learned that it was
the Muslim call to prayer.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.100
And he converts to Islam.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:51.110
In fact, as the story went, he
moved to Lebanon, which he did.

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.800
Lebanon, Ohio, which is a
little town north of Cincinnati.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.720
He lived on a farm there.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.500
But this is a story that would
not go away, and to the point

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.290
where in the mid '80s Neil
was getting invitations

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.170
to go speak at mosques and
talk about his conversion.

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.710
And he goes to the State
Department and says,

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.180
can you help with this?

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.800
I'm getting all these requests.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.730
And so they helped.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.620
They put out a
circular to send around

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.670
embassies in Islamic countries.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.475
And Neil also did
a teleconference

00:44:19.475 --> 00:44:21.350
with journalists in
Cairo, Egypt and answered

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:23.660
all their questions,
and made it clear.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.630
No, he wasn't.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.670
Go back here again.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.910
And in fact, one story Neil told
me was when he was at Purdue,

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.410
he was back at his
fraternity house.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.450
And there was a little
reception for him.

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:40.380
And a young student came up
to him who was from Turkey.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.700
And the student said,
he got him at a time

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.600
when he was just by himself.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.730
And he said, could you tell me
about your conversion to Islam?

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.840
And Neil tried to tell
him, it's not true.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.060
I've had to explain
this many times.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.100
And the young man listened.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.500
And he said then to
Neil, well, my dad

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.810
told me that you were going
to have to lie about it,

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:06.890
because, I mean, the story, the
conspiracy is that he converts.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.720
And the reason
he's such a recluse

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.440
is the United States government
doesn't want this story known.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.160
And so they've sort of
hidden him away from people.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.320
So they don't really
discover the truth

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.290
about his religious beliefs.

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:22.040
And again, I write
about this in the book.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.750
I have lectured about it.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:28.420
But the number of hits on
Google just keep going up.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.830
So it's still out
there as if it's true.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.120
Like I said, he was a deist.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.560
And if you need a
lot of famous deists,

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:40.010
deism sort of grows out of the
18th century enlightenment.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.550
And I know he's a deist, because
I talked to him about it.

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.720
And on one of the--

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.430
when he was a test
pilot at Edwards,

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.357
he got involved with
a Boy Scout troop.

00:45:48.357 --> 00:45:49.940
And he had to fill
out an application.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.740
This troop was run
through this local church.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:53.990
He filled out the application.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.720
And on religious
affiliation, he wrote deist.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.910
The minister didn't
know what that was.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.920
So he called a fellow
test pilot at Edwards

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.725
that the minister knew and
was one of their parishioners.

00:46:04.725 --> 00:46:06.350
And he said, this
Neil Armstrong sounds

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:11.430
like a great-- seems like a
great guy, but what's deist?

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:15.110
And his friend, Stan Butchart
said to the minister, well,

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.790
I don't really know
what that is either,

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:18.050
but he's a really great man.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.380
And I wouldn't worry about it.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.100
So anyway.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.240
Well, I'm going to stop there.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.370
As I said, I've got lots
and lots of myths to cover.

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.210
I will just conclude
that the myth that he did

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.180
become a recluse
is not really true.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:38.280
He did a lot of things.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.110
And I think more and more in
the later decades of his life,

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.440
he had to be pretty
choosy about what he did.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.680
And he didn't grant
interviews unless he thought

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.550
it was a newsworthy item
that he had some expertise

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.690
to comment on.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.700
But he wasn't
interested in people

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.290
doing feature stories on him.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:47:00.410
So he turned down lots and
lots of interview requests.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:03.380
And I think the idea that he
became a recluse was really

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.340
created by media that had failed
to get him to do an interview.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.780
So it's easier just to say
instead of we were rejected,

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:12.620
he's a recluse.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.520
He wasn't a recluse.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.710
He did tons and tons of stuff.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.717
So anyway, is there time?

00:47:17.717 --> 00:47:18.300
Is there time?

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.425
SPEAKER: We have a couple
of minutes for questions,

00:47:20.425 --> 00:47:22.892
but I'm going to like
hog the mic for a second

00:47:22.892 --> 00:47:24.350
and say, well,
thank you very much.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.200
That was amazing and
really informative.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.200
JAMES HANSEN: Thank you.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.010
SPEAKER: And delightful.

00:47:32.352 --> 00:47:34.060
I'm going to throw
the mic to Scott next,

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.950
but I'm going to ask
a question first.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.110
Did you get an opportunity
to talk to Neil

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.450
about the conspiracy
theorists that say

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:41.920
that the moon landing was fake?

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.210
Because that's hilarious to me.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.090
And I'm just wondering
what he said about it.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.250
JAMES HANSEN: It's
hilarious on one level.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:51.310
And it's really depressing
on another level,

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.320
because it doesn't go away.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:58.540
It continues to this day,
maybe even at a greater volume

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.680
than ever before.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.640
No, I did talk to him about it.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:05.580
And I'm doing two books.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:11.710
Purdue Press, we're doing
two volumes of Neil's papers;

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.650
letters to Neil, and
then letters from Neil.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:18.160
And he received a lot of letters
from the conspiracy theory

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.000
people.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.010
And he answered most of those.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.490
I mean, a lot of the answers
back to letters that he got--

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:24.657
I mean, he got so much mail.

00:48:24.657 --> 00:48:26.762
He had to have assistants
and secretaries.

00:48:26.762 --> 00:48:28.220
And a lot of letters
that went back

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.990
were kind of by the
secretaries, not by Neil.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.260
But the conspiracy theorists,
he kind of took personally.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.790
And he had a variety
of answers for them.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.160
I think he grew-- it
was clear in the answers

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.930
that he was frustrated.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.820
That he couldn't-- no
matter what he said,

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:49.030
he knew he wasn't going to
convince certain people.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.750
One thing that he
commonly said was, look,

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.100
this was the Cold War.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.130
This was a race to the
moon with the Soviets.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.830
If the Soviets had
had any suspicion

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.700
that this was not really true--

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.270
and there were ways of seeing
what the American space

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:07.420
program was doing and
tracking spacecraft--

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.910
the Soviets would
have been all over it.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:11.935
But no, they weren't.

00:49:11.935 --> 00:49:15.040
It wasn't like they embraced
it and were blowing trumpets

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.850
about the Apollo moon landing
all through the Soviet society,

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:22.060
but Neil was invited
to the Soviet Union

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.980
about a year after
and made a trip.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.050
And he got great--

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.590
he was treated with great honor
and given medals and things

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:30.530
like that.

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.380
So that was one thing
that he answered

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.892
that if there had been.

00:49:33.892 --> 00:49:35.350
And then another
thing he would say

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.890
is that it would have
been harder to fake it

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:40.720
than to actually do it.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.000
Of course, you have to have
some basic understanding

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.250
of physics or Newtonian
physics at least

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.782
to really understand that.

00:49:46.782 --> 00:49:47.740
A lot of people didn't.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.590
I mean, my mother, again, she
had an eighth grade education,

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:51.710
and she didn't believe it.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:56.350
But for her, she couldn't--
her brain couldn't grasp

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:59.980
the principles that would be
involved in rocket flights

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.790
and different things.

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:05.020
So I will publish
some of the letters

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.660
from the conspiracy theorists.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.100
I mean, it really got nasty.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.345
There was this one guy who
made a bunch of videos.

00:50:11.345 --> 00:50:12.970
I'm not going to even
mention his name.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:17.200
He's the guy that Buzz Aldrin
here in Beverly Hills smacked.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.000
But this guy followed
everybody around

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.890
and wanted them to
swear on a Bible.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:24.970
And there's videos you can
watch that are just so terrible.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:29.070
But this guy rented driveway
space in Neil's neighborhood

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:32.500
to capture video of him and
stalked him from airport

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.800
to airport, and went to one of
his corporate board meetings.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:41.360
And some of this was really
intrusive and disturbing.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.720
And I'm sort of in
the same position

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.900
that Neil was in, in the
sense that I don't think

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:50.165
there's anything-- for people
that don't believe it happened,

00:50:50.165 --> 00:50:52.540
I don't think there's anything
you can say to them that's

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.400
going to change their mind.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:51:00.480
So I'm not even sure it's
worth the effort at this point.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.460
Yes.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.960
AUDIENCE: So first, thank you
for writing a biography of one

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.877
of my favorite humans.

00:51:04.877 --> 00:51:08.360
I'm very much looking
forward to reading this.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.460
My question was,
in recent years,

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.250
there has been a lot of
very welcome attention

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.840
on the role of women in
the early space program.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.790
"Hidden Figures," like Katherine
Johnson, and the Mercury 13,

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:23.250
this group of remarkable
female astronaut candidates

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:26.688
in the '60s, who of course
were not selected for flight.

00:51:26.688 --> 00:51:28.230
When you were
interviewing Neil, this

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.030
would have been before
a lot of that attention.

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.510
I'm not sure if you ever
talked to him about it.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:34.052
But I was just curious if you
had ever talked to him about it

00:51:34.052 --> 00:51:36.810
and if you knew what he
thought about these women who

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:39.060
were making these great
contributions at the time that

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.080
were at the time largely unsung.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.510
JAMES HANSEN: Yeah.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:44.920
I did talk to him about it.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.690
And I don't think that the first
couple of classes of astronauts

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:54.220
were terribly aware
of what was going on,

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:59.980
because the program,
the Lovelace clinic,

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.860
it wasn't really an official
NASA program, honestly.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.930
It was something
that NASA knew about,

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.460
but there was never
a program that

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:10.730
was started to train or
select women astronauts.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:11.980
And then they went against it.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.760
It was never-- and they
had this qualification

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.550
that you had to be a
military test pilot.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:20.253
And that disqualified them.

00:52:20.253 --> 00:52:20.920
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.250
JAMES HANSEN: So I think
Neil thought it was--

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.900
in retrospect, it was unfair.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.000
But it was a
reflection of the time.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.727
He was very happy that
NASA has changed its tune

00:52:32.727 --> 00:52:34.060
and the women are very involved.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.460
And he has even
suggested that he

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.070
thinks when there's
a mission to Mars,

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:43.120
it maybe should be an all female
crew, that physiologically,

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.780
there's advantages
that women have.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:52.720
And so I think,
again, I don't think--

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.150
at the time, he was so focused
on what he needed to do.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.260
I don't think he was--

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.760
he didn't feel like
it was his place

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.380
to take up the cause of women.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.480
He just was needed
to do his job, which

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.490
was complicated enough.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:11.290
And was historically aware,
as Mr. Google would be,

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.920
historically aware that there
were certain social constraints

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:19.360
that still had not
been conquered,

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.540
and fortunately we've
moved past those

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.203
in some significant degree.

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.460
JAMES HANSEN: I will say that
in terms of "Hidden Figures,"

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.880
I'm proud to say that my
very first book for NASA

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.150
in the early 1980s, which was
the history of Langley, NASA

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:40.330
Langley in the NACA period--

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:42.160
and you can find
this on YouTube--

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.470
I interviewed a number of the
women, the computers, the women

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:50.860
computers, including
Katherine Johnson.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:56.710
And I write about them in
a book published in 1983.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:00.250
They are hidden figures,
but I recognized

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.760
the importance of these women
and interviewed them at length.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.580
And when-- and there are
certain-- as with our movie,

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.800
"First Man," there are
certain liberties that

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.780
are taken in the storyline.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.670
And I had reporters
from the Hampton area

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.707
contact me to point
out what I thought

00:54:16.707 --> 00:54:18.790
were some of the inaccuracies
in "Hidden Figures."

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:22.150
I refused to do it, because
I enjoyed the movie so much.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.540
I thought to nit pick--

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.760
and maybe it goes
beyond nit picking--

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.920
but I just didn't want
to be part of criticizing

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.660
the movie in any way.

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:34.540
But I did refer them to the
fact that I did talk about them.

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.300
You can go on YouTube and
get my interviews with them.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.940
So anyway, thank you.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.710
AUDIENCE: Sure thing.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:42.650
JAMES HANSEN: OK.

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:44.450
Well, again, thank you so much.

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:47.450
Clearly, I like to talk
about this guy a lot.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:51.860
And I'll probably be doing
it for a while to come yet.

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.370
So if you haven't
seen the movie,

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:55.610
I hope you will go see it.

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:57.770
It's just a slice of his life.

00:54:57.770 --> 00:55:01.490
And it doesn't-- it is based
on some nuggets that are

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:05.060
in my book, especially in
relation to the personal story.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.260
But it doesn't have that child
is the father to the man aspect

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:14.910
that I think you really need to
have to understand who he is.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:17.060
And I also-- the cover
of the book, it's

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.230
nice to see the cover.

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:19.780
It's Ryan Gosling.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.620
But I would prefer if
you had the cover that

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.690
had Neil on the front.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:24.770
There's another edition.

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:28.070
So you can go get that one, too.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:29.300
Thank you very much.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.300
SPEAKER: Thanks so much.
