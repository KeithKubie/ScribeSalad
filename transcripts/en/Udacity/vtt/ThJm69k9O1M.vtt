Let's talk a little bit more
about making these T-charts.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.340
Specifically, let's talk about
the choices you get to make.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.341
When I'm making a T-chart, I always
want to make sure I have three values,

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:10.380
three x,y pairs.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.088
And I get to choose
whatever values I want.

00:00:13.088 --> 00:00:16.297
Let's say the equation I'm
looking at is 2x + y = 10.

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:20.450
And I want to make it table of values
and then I want to graph that table.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.506
Well, let me write down some proposed
tables of values that I might

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:24.058
want to use.

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:29.228
Maybe I'd want to use x values of 0,
2, and 4.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:33.385
Or maybe I'd want to use 1,000,
2,000, and 3,000.

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:37.278
Or maybe I want to use negative 10,
100, and 101.

00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:41.705
I want to know which of these proposed
T-charts will be easiest to make

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:43.160
a graph from.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.050
Select whichever one you think is best.
