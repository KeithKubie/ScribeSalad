00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.640
&gt;&gt; What happens if we follow Tit for Tat?

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.310
&gt;&gt; That's a great question. So, let's make it a

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.570
little more concrete. So, here's a set of strategies that an

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.330
opponent might adopt. And now the question is, what does it

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.220
look like Tit for Tat is doing in response to each

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.120
of these? And I was hoping that you'd, you know, check

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.560
the corresponding boxes. So basically, for each row, say okay, if

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.200
you're playing against, if Tit for Tat is playing against always

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.400
cooperate, what does Tit for Tat do? Does it always defect,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.820
does it always cooperate, does it cooperate and then

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.530
defect, defect, defect, defect, does it alternate between cooperate and

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.814
defect? And this should, just to give you some

00:00:32.814 --> 00:00:35.180
practice in, in interpreting the behavior of Tit for Tat.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, that works for me. I think I could do this.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.170
&gt;&gt; Go.
