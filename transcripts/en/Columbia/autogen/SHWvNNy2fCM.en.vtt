the book the book does deal with both of

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180
the book the book does deal with both of
 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.970
the book the book does deal with both of
those issues in various ways but I

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980
those issues in various ways but I
 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.030
those issues in various ways but I
thought clearly I could do a lot more

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040
thought clearly I could do a lot more
 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.430

with that so the book Ibini i'll be

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440
with that so the book Ibini i'll be
 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.110
with that so the book Ibini i'll be

shortly but it deals not only with
 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.920
shortly but it deals not only with
nuclear terrorism but also with the

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.180
to look at that in context those kinds
 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.629
to look at that in context those kinds
of statistics and what you get basically

00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639
of statistics and what you get basically
 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.740
of statistics and what you get basically
is the idea of acceptable risk beginning

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750
is the idea of acceptable risk beginning
 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.240
is the idea of acceptable risk beginning
at the opposite end however this is

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.250
at the opposite end however this is
 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.640
at the opposite end however this is
unacceptable risk i hope it's readable

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:06.650
unacceptable risk i hope it's readable
 

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.939
unacceptable risk i hope it's readable
in this light but essentially your

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:09.949
in this light but essentially your
 

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.550
in this light but essentially your
chance of dying from cancer in the

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560
chance of dying from cancer in the
 

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.020
chance of dying from cancer in the
united states i think the numbers are

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.030
united states i think the numbers are
 

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.500
united states i think the numbers are
for you is about one in 500 per year

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.510
for you is about one in 500 per year
 

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.550
for you is about one in 500 per year
another's one out of every five hundred

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560
another's one out of every five hundred
 

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.770
another's one out of every five hundred
Americans dies from cancer per year well

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:20.780
Americans dies from cancer per year well
 

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.390
Americans dies from cancer per year well
everybody can say that that's you know

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400
everybody can say that that's you know
 

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.550
everybody can say that that's you know
that's not acceptable we really want

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560
that's not acceptable we really want
 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.839
that's not acceptable we really want
that to be lower and so it's a huge

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:25.849
that to be lower and so it's a huge
 

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:27.279
that to be lower and so it's a huge
amounts of money of course is spent on

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:27.289
amounts of money of course is spent on
 

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:30.460
amounts of money of course is spent on
cancer research and trying to deal with

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:30.470
cancer research and trying to deal with
 

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.409
cancer research and trying to deal with
that particular problem another thing

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:32.419
that particular problem another thing
 

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.940
that particular problem another thing
would be traffic accidents which is the

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:33.950
would be traffic accidents which is the
 

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.000
would be traffic accidents which is the
fifth one down there I guess and your

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010
fifth one down there I guess and your
 

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.019
fifth one down there I guess and your
chance of being killed in an automobile

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:38.029
chance of being killed in an automobile
 

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:40.149
chance of being killed in an automobile
accident is by one and a teeth out one

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159
accident is by one and a teeth out one
 

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.850

in eight thousand per year that also is

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:42.860
in eight thousand per year that also is
 

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.600
in eight thousand per year that also is
unacceptable and so therefore efforts a

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:46.610
unacceptable and so therefore efforts a
 

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.770
unacceptable and so therefore efforts a
huge amounts of money are being yet

these kinds of risks are bad enough so

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:57.890
these kinds of risks are bad enough so
 

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.440
these kinds of risks are bad enough so
that it's worth worrying about doing

00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.450
that it's worth worrying about doing
 

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.330
that it's worth worrying about doing
something about things which are at the

that's considered to be unacceptable

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:17.570
that's considered to be unacceptable
 

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.060
that's considered to be unacceptable
risk we ought to do something about

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.070
risk we ought to do something about
 

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.590

trying to make that lower spend money on
 

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.840
trying to make that lower spend money on
it the next level is what might be

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:22.850
it the next level is what might be
 

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.290
it the next level is what might be
called accept that acceptable risk but

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:26.300
called accept that acceptable risk but
 

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.810
called accept that acceptable risk but
tolerable risk perhaps somewhere between

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:28.820
tolerable risk perhaps somewhere between
 

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.210
tolerable risk perhaps somewhere between
this is all sort of just again going

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:31.220
this is all sort of just again going
 

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.840
this is all sort of just again going
with what practices actually happen is

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:33.850
with what practices actually happen is
 

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.320
with what practices actually happen is
that if if the risk is between one and a

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.330
that if if the risk is between one and a
 

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.180
that if if the risk is between one and a
hundred thousand and one in a million

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.190
hundred thousand and one in a million
 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.480
hundred thousand and one in a million
then that's not as dangerous obviously

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:43.490
then that's not as dangerous obviously
 

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.070
then that's not as dangerous obviously
but you probably want to spend some time

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:45.080
but you probably want to spend some time
 

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.170
but you probably want to spend some time
thinking about that for example drowning

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:47.180
thinking about that for example drowning
 

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.060
thinking about that for example drowning
in a bathtub is that their de chance

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.070
in a bathtub is that their de chance
 

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.400
in a bathtub is that their de chance
about one in a million dying per year

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:51.410
about one in a million dying per year
 

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.140
about one in a million dying per year
and at that point you're beginning to

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:53.150
and at that point you're beginning to
 

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.820
and at that point you're beginning to
get people who really don't want to

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:54.830
get people who really don't want to
 

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.560
get people who really don't want to
really think we should do much about it

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.570
really think we should do much about it
 

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.510
really think we should do much about it
I mean one possibility obviously is to

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:58.520
I mean one possibility obviously is to
 

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.910
I mean one possibility obviously is to
ban all bathtubs this has not been a

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920
ban all bathtubs this has not been a
 

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.790
ban all bathtubs this has not been a
common popular proposal so when you

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800
common popular proposal so when you
 

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.040
common popular proposal so when you
start getting to one in a million toward

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.050
start getting to one in a million toward
 

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.900
start getting to one in a million toward
it then people say well you know it's

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:07.910
it then people say well you know it's
 

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.840
it then people say well you know it's
not you know that's pretty good and then

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:10.850
not you know that's pretty good and then
 

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.450
not you know that's pretty good and then
beyond that is those risks which are

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:13.460
beyond that is those risks which are
 

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.100
beyond that is those risks which are
often basically considered to be

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.110
often basically considered to be
 

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.050
often basically considered to be
acceptable namely your chance of being

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:17.060
acceptable namely your chance of being
 

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.660
acceptable namely your chance of being
killed is less than one in a million and

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:19.670
killed is less than one in a million and
 

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.550
killed is less than one in a million and
again that's basically regulators have

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560
again that's basically regulators have
 

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.050
again that's basically regulators have
have seen it over although there's

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.060
have seen it over although there's
 

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.910
have seen it over although there's
exceptions and not everything is

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920
exceptions and not everything is
 

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.700
exceptions and not everything is
perfectly smooth and terrorism generally

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:27.710
perfectly smooth and terrorism generally
 

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.590
perfectly smooth and terrorism generally
falls in that area unless you live like

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600
falls in that area unless you live like
 

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.580
falls in that area unless you live like
in Northern Ireland or enter in Israel

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:33.590
in Northern Ireland or enter in Israel
 

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.100
in Northern Ireland or enter in Israel
during the intifada for example but for

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.110
during the intifada for example but for
 

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.690
during the intifada for example but for
the United States or Canada for Britain

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:37.700
the United States or Canada for Britain
 

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.550
the United States or Canada for Britain
including Britain which obviously has a

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560
including Britain which obviously has a
 

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.110
including Britain which obviously has a
terrorism problem with some magnitude

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120
terrorism problem with some magnitude
 

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.450
terrorism problem with some magnitude
the chance of being killed per year are

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:43.460
the chance of being killed per year are
 

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.520
the chance of being killed per year are
one in several million and the so they

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:48.530
one in several million and the so they
 

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.010
one in several million and the so they
vary so it's down there Bo more or less

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:51.020
vary so it's down there Bo more or less
 

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.710
vary so it's down there Bo more or less
with lightning so in many respects then

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720
with lightning so in many respects then
 

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.760
with lightning so in many respects then
what happens is that for terrorism to be

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:56.770
what happens is that for terrorism to be
 

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.470
what happens is that for terrorism to be
unacceptable in other words to reach the

00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480
unacceptable in other words to reach the
 

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.250
unacceptable in other words to reach the
one in a hundred thousand category or

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260
one in a hundred thousand category or
 

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.860
one in a hundred thousand category or
so you'd have to have one 911 every year

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:03.870
so you'd have to have one 911 every year
 

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.730
so you'd have to have one 911 every year
in the United States for example it so

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740
in the United States for example it so
 

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.070
in the United States for example it so
consequently from from the standpoint of

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:10.080
consequently from from the standpoint of
 

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.920
consequently from from the standpoint of
most research of the terrorism is an

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:12.930
most research of the terrorism is an
 

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.040
most research of the terrorism is an
acceptable risk that is to say it's not

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.050
acceptable risk that is to say it's not
 

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.660
acceptable risk that is to say it's not
worth spending a lot of money to lower

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:17.670
worth spending a lot of money to lower
 

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.960
worth spending a lot of money to lower
the risk or to put it another way if

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:20.970
the risk or to put it another way if
 

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.730
the risk or to put it another way if
you're spending money on reducing the

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740
you're spending money on reducing the
 

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.160

they can completely control because one

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:55.790
they can completely control because one
 

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.220
they can completely control because one
of the possibilities is that the bomb

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:57.230
of the possibilities is that the bomb
 

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.410
of the possibilities is that the bomb
will actually go off in the country that

00:44:59.410 --> 00:44:59.420
will actually go off in the country that
 

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.980
will actually go off in the country that
gave the bomb away so there's various

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:02.990
gave the bomb away so there's various
 

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.890
gave the bomb away so there's various
reasons by that there's also the problem

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:05.900
reasons by that there's also the problem
 

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.290
reasons by that there's also the problem
of stings that people are constantly

coming around trying to buy bombs and
and so therefore they do start to make

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000
and so therefore they do start to make

to do that not very many people know how
to set them off the people who design

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680
to set them off the people who design
 

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.829

doll locks and the people have

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:38.550
doll locks and the people have
 

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.620
doll locks and the people have
maintained them don't have the foggiest

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:39.630
maintained them don't have the foggiest
 

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.810
maintained them don't have the foggiest
idea how to set them off so you have to

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:41.820
idea how to set them off so you have to
 

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.520
idea how to set them off so you have to
steal exactly the right people along

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:43.530
steal exactly the right people along
 

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.770
steal exactly the right people along
with the bomb so a possibility obviously

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780
with the bomb so a possibility obviously
 

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.780
with the bomb so a possibility obviously
the bottoms do exist but it's very

it thinks is extremely unlikely which

00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079
it thinks is extremely unlikely which

would be make a bomb from from scratch

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:57.810
would be make a bomb from from scratch
 

00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:59.569
would be make a bomb from from scratch
to make a bomb there's two things you

00:46:59.569 --> 00:46:59.579
to make a bomb there's two things you
 

00:46:59.579 --> 00:47:02.480
to make a bomb there's two things you
have to do essentially one is to get the

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:02.490
have to do essentially one is to get the
 

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.220
have to do essentially one is to get the
fissile material which is the highly

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:04.230
fissile material which is the highly
 

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.220
fissile material which is the highly

enriched uranium or the plutonium the
main makings of the bomb then you have

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:09.930
main makings of the bomb then you have
 

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.260
main makings of the bomb then you have
to make manufacture seconds to

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:12.270
to make manufacture seconds to
 

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.609
to make manufacture seconds to
manufacture the bomb itself with a

00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619
manufacture the bomb itself with a
 

00:47:13.619 --> 00:47:17.150
manufacture the bomb itself with a
fissile material most people argue that

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160
fissile material most people argue that
 

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.910
fissile material most people argue that
that including people are most alarmed

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920
that including people are most alarmed
 

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.859
that including people are most alarmed
about nuclear terrorism that'd be very

00:47:21.859 --> 00:47:21.869
about nuclear terrorism that'd be very
 

00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:24.140
about nuclear terrorism that'd be very
very very difficult for a sub state

industrial capacity so therefore they

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680
industrial capacity so therefore they
 

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.099
industrial capacity so therefore they
don't think a terrorist could do that

00:47:34.099 --> 00:47:34.109
don't think a terrorist could do that
 

00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:37.940
don't think a terrorist could do that
the most likely path is the one that

most people talk about which is making a
bomb with purloined fissile material you

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:42.540
bomb with purloined fissile material you
 

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.980

Pakistan whoever then you take the

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760
Pakistan whoever then you take the
 

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.540
Pakistan whoever then you take the
fissile material to a machine shop and

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:53.550
fissile material to a machine shop and
 

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.880
fissile material to a machine shop and
you make it into a bomb and so that's

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:55.890
you make it into a bomb and so that's
 

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:57.920
you make it into a bomb and so that's
that that's the scenario i'd like to

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:57.930
that that's the scenario i'd like to
 

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:01.190
that that's the scenario i'd like to
deal with we can certainly deal with the

atomic accession I basically took the

00:48:52.009 --> 00:48:52.019
atomic accession I basically took the
 

00:48:52.019 --> 00:48:54.170
atomic accession I basically took the
review and expanded it from 400 words to

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180
review and expanded it from 400 words to
 

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.440
review and expanded it from 400 words to
know 20,000 or something like that using

languages stuff plus a lot of other
 

00:48:59.099 --> 00:49:01.339
languages stuff plus a lot of other
stuff as well of course and so what I've

00:49:01.339 --> 00:49:01.349
stuff as well of course and so what I've
 

00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:02.960
stuff as well of course and so what I've
done is try to put together a narrative

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:02.970
done is try to put together a narrative
 

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:04.460
done is try to put together a narrative
which I'd like to give you now and very

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:04.470
which I'd like to give you now and very
 

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.829
which I'd like to give you now and very
quick outline about what you have to do

00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839
quick outline about what you have to do
 

00:49:06.839 --> 00:49:08.359
quick outline about what you have to do
if you're a terrorist you want to make a

00:49:08.359 --> 00:49:08.369
if you're a terrorist you want to make a
 

00:49:08.369 --> 00:49:11.259
if you're a terrorist you want to make a
bomb with stolen pasado material and

00:49:11.259 --> 00:49:11.269
bomb with stolen pasado material and
 

00:49:11.269 --> 00:49:13.609
bomb with stolen pasado material and
what I've done is sort of bulleted the

00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619
what I've done is sort of bulleted the
 

00:49:13.619 --> 00:49:15.319
what I've done is sort of bulleted the
steps so they're about 20 of them I'm

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:15.329
steps so they're about 20 of them I'm
 

00:49:15.329 --> 00:49:17.359
steps so they're about 20 of them I'm
not about their exactly 20 of them I

00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:17.369
not about their exactly 20 of them I
 

00:49:17.369 --> 00:49:19.700
not about their exactly 20 of them I
could actually have had more and split

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:19.710
could actually have had more and split
 

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:21.829
could actually have had more and split
them apart but you know 20 seemed to be

00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839
them apart but you know 20 seemed to be
 

00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:23.509
them apart but you know 20 seemed to be
a nice number so I fell in love with it

00:49:23.509 --> 00:49:23.519
a nice number so I fell in love with it
 

00:49:23.519 --> 00:49:28.779
a nice number so I fell in love with it
and that's what we got the desert if

00:49:28.779 --> 00:49:28.789
and that's what we got the desert if
 

00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:31.940
and that's what we got the desert if
three aspects one is getting the fissile

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:31.950
three aspects one is getting the fissile
 

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.559
three aspects one is getting the fissile
material and getting into where you can

00:49:33.559 --> 00:49:33.569
material and getting into where you can
 

00:49:33.569 --> 00:49:35.450
material and getting into where you can
use it the second is actually making the

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460
use it the second is actually making the
 

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.549
use it the second is actually making the
bomb and the third is delivering the

00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:37.559
bomb and the third is delivering the
 

00:49:37.559 --> 00:49:39.349
bomb and the third is delivering the
bomb and setting it off so those are the

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359
bomb and setting it off so those are the
 

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:43.819
bomb and setting it off so those are the
three sequences and I not going to talk

00:49:43.819 --> 00:49:43.829
three sequences and I not going to talk
 

00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:45.349
three sequences and I not going to talk
about these in complete detail because

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359
about these in complete detail because
 

00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:47.120
about these in complete detail because
there's much time but do I certainly be

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.130
there's much time but do I certainly be
 

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:50.660
there's much time but do I certainly be
glad to deal with it more later but what

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:50.670
glad to deal with it more later but what
 

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:52.309
glad to deal with it more later but what
you have to do if your terrorist is go

00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319
you have to do if your terrorist is go
 

00:49:52.319 --> 00:49:53.900
you have to do if your terrorist is go
to some place that has in adequately

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:53.910
to some place that has in adequately
 

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:58.039
to some place that has in adequately
secured source of uranium I think

00:49:58.039 --> 00:49:58.049
secured source of uranium I think
 

00:49:58.049 --> 00:50:00.559
secured source of uranium I think
enriched uranium is heu highly enriched

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:00.569
enriched uranium is heu highly enriched
 

00:50:00.569 --> 00:50:02.960
enriched uranium is heu highly enriched
uranium is presumably the preferred

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:02.970
uranium is presumably the preferred
 

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:05.269
uranium is presumably the preferred
technique because it's much easier to

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:05.279
technique because it's much easier to
 

00:50:05.279 --> 00:50:07.249
technique because it's much easier to
work with than plutonium and we're

00:50:07.249 --> 00:50:07.259
work with than plutonium and we're
 

00:50:07.259 --> 00:50:08.660
work with than plutonium and we're
assuming in all this the terrorists are

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:08.670
assuming in all this the terrorists are
 

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:12.190
assuming in all this the terrorists are
willing to cut corners take risks and

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200
willing to cut corners take risks and
 

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.380
willing to cut corners take risks and
even lose lives in order to get their

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:15.390
even lose lives in order to get their
 

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.849

on as cheap as possible okay you have to

00:50:19.279 --> 00:50:19.289
on as cheap as possible okay you have to
 

00:50:19.289 --> 00:50:20.749
on as cheap as possible okay you have to
go to some place which has it for

00:50:20.749 --> 00:50:20.759
go to some place which has it for
 

00:50:20.759 --> 00:50:23.950
go to some place which has it for
example a little village some place in

someplace and formally could have been

00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619
someplace and formally could have been
 

00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:32.150
someplace and formally could have been
Kazakhstan but and so you walk in there

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160
Kazakhstan but and so you walk in there
 

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.980
Kazakhstan but and so you walk in there
you go down to the corner bar and say

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:33.990
you go down to the corner bar and say
 

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:35.450
you go down to the corner bar and say
anybody here have any ID enriched

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:35.460
anybody here have any ID enriched

uranium to sell what you have to do is

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220
uranium to sell what you have to do is
 

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.069
uranium to sell what you have to do is
find someone who can lead you to the

00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079
find someone who can lead you to the
 

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:43.069
find someone who can lead you to the
material and so the one of the major

00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079
material and so the one of the major
 

00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:45.980
material and so the one of the major
problems in all this is the process of

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:45.990
problems in all this is the process of
 

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:49.070
problems in all this is the process of
getting insiders corrupting them

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:49.080
getting insiders corrupting them

throughout now let me just raise two

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700
throughout now let me just raise two
 

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.150
throughout now let me just raise two
problems with this and there's sort of

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160
problems with this and there's sort of
 

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.480
problems with this and there's sort of
summarizing some of these points here

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:49.490
summarizing some of these points here
 

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.890
summarizing some of these points here
one is that the god is disgruntled

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900
one is that the god is disgruntled
 

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.530

respect so what the hell he's going to

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:04.230
respect so what the hell he's going to
 

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.290
respect so what the hell he's going to
go for it and so he's willing to be

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300
go for it and so he's willing to be
 

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.880
go for it and so he's willing to be
bought he's willing to be corrupted and

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:07.890
bought he's willing to be corrupted and
 

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:11.330
bought he's willing to be corrupted and
he knows where the uranium is ok well

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:11.340
he knows where the uranium is ok well
 

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:12.650
he knows where the uranium is ok well
there's a couple of thought thought

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660
there's a couple of thought thought
 

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.690
there's a couple of thought thought
patterns it might go through his mind

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700
patterns it might go through his mind
 

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.550
patterns it might go through his mind
over the period of time which he's

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:16.560
over the period of time which he's
 

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.120
over the period of time which he's
thinking about this one is as follows if

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:20.130
thinking about this one is as follows if
 

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:24.410
thinking about this one is as follows if
I if I steal this uranium and give it to

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420
I if I steal this uranium and give it to
 

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:26.150
I if I steal this uranium and give it to
these guys and by the way is probably

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160
these guys and by the way is probably
 

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.890
these guys and by the way is probably
take more than one person to do this but

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900
take more than one person to do this but
 

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.920
take more than one person to do this but
anyway if I do this eventually they're

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:30.930
anyway if I do this eventually they're
 

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:32.570
anyway if I do this eventually they're
going to see maybe very soon they're

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:32.580
going to see maybe very soon they're
 

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.180
going to see maybe very soon they're
going to see that the uranium is missing

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.190
going to see that the uranium is missing
 

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:37.700
going to see that the uranium is missing
now how many people know have access to

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:37.710
now how many people know have access to
 

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:41.000
now how many people know have access to
that uranium not many who's one of them

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:41.010
that uranium not many who's one of them
 

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:44.600
that uranium not many who's one of them
me so if I'm driving around in a new you

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:44.610
me so if I'm driving around in a new you
 

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:48.290
me so if I'm driving around in a new you
know BMW on my salary I'm going to raise

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:48.300
know BMW on my salary I'm going to raise
 

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.450
know BMW on my salary I'm going to raise
a certain amount of suspicion eventually

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460
a certain amount of suspicion eventually
 

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:51.410
a certain amount of suspicion eventually
in other words they're going to figure

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420
in other words they're going to figure
 

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.060
in other words they're going to figure
it out Evite's you know try to flee the

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:53.070
it out Evite's you know try to flee the
 

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:54.260
it out Evite's you know try to flee the
country that will make it even more so

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:54.270
country that will make it even more so
 

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.600
country that will make it even more so
you know it is suspicious and so so what

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:56.610
you know it is suspicious and so so what
 

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:57.950
you know it is suspicious and so so what
he's going to say is this is not a

00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960
he's going to say is this is not a
 

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.170
he's going to say is this is not a
really good idea maybe I should go to

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.180
really good idea maybe I should go to
 

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.470
really good idea maybe I should go to
the authorities

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480
the authorities
 

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.570
the authorities
and say well of course I was just

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:03.580
and say well of course I was just
 

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.310
and say well of course I was just
stringing them along I never had any

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:05.320
stringing them along I never had any
 

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.080
stringing them along I never had any
idea of doing this I'm a loyal rush on

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:07.090
idea of doing this I'm a loyal rush on
 

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:10.170
idea of doing this I'm a loyal rush on
etc etc but in the back of his mind he

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:10.180
etc etc but in the back of his mind he
 

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.280
etc etc but in the back of his mind he
realized there's something worse than

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:11.290
realized there's something worse than
 

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.750
realized there's something worse than
being a disgruntled Russian physicist

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760
being a disgruntled Russian physicist
 

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.030
being a disgruntled Russian physicist
that's being a dead disgruntled Russian

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040
that's being a dead disgruntled Russian
 

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.700
that's being a dead disgruntled Russian
physicist and so consequently it becomes

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:17.710
physicist and so consequently it becomes
 

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:20.820
physicist and so consequently it becomes
a sting effectively or another

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:20.830
a sting effectively or another
 

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.410
a sting effectively or another
possibility is that he does it and he's

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:22.420
possibility is that he does it and he's
 

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.200
possibility is that he does it and he's
just incompetent or or it becomes it's a

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:25.210
just incompetent or or it becomes it's a
 

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.880
just incompetent or or it becomes it's a
scam he does it he takes the money and

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:26.890
scam he does it he takes the money and
 

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:28.710
scam he does it he takes the money and
gives you the stuff that's useless lots

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720
gives you the stuff that's useless lots
 

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.780

about and there you probably also have
 

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.670
about and there you probably also have
to trust smugglers now after the HEU is

about a hundred pounds but uranium is

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:00.430
about a hundred pounds but uranium is
 

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.880
about a hundred pounds but uranium is
extremely heavy heavier than lead so the

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:02.890
extremely heavy heavier than lead so the
 

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:04.200
extremely heavy heavier than lead so the
package would not be very big but you

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:04.210
package would not be very big but you
 

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:05.880
package would not be very big but you
have to smuggle it out it's not if it's

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:05.890
have to smuggle it out it's not if it's

either so the wood hard to detect but
 

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.740
either so the wood hard to detect but
anyway you have to get it out you

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:10.750
anyway you have to get it out you
 

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:11.910
anyway you have to get it out you
probably want to you there's a lot of

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920
probably want to you there's a lot of

and you wanna use smugglers probably

00:55:15.499 --> 00:55:15.509
and you wanna use smugglers probably

a reward for information that can lead

00:55:26.839 --> 00:55:26.849
a reward for information that can lead
 

00:55:26.849 --> 00:55:28.099
a reward for information that can lead
to the apprehension of the people who

to the apprehension of the people who
stole the uranium I mean you as a

00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839
stole the uranium I mean you as a
 

00:55:30.839 --> 00:55:32.380

countries in the world they have really
 

00:55:36.569 --> 00:55:38.959
countries in the world they have really
deep pockets so therefore the smuggler

00:55:38.959 --> 00:55:38.969
deep pockets so therefore the smuggler
 

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:40.609
deep pockets so therefore the smuggler
who says these guys are to look kind of

00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619
who says these guys are to look kind of
 

00:55:40.619 --> 00:55:42.499
who says these guys are to look kind of
strange they got this one rather small

00:55:42.499 --> 00:55:42.509
strange they got this one rather small
 

00:55:42.509 --> 00:55:45.199
strange they got this one rather small
but extremely heavy package and they

00:55:45.199 --> 00:55:45.209
but extremely heavy package and they
 

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:47.359
but extremely heavy package and they
start putting things together and they

00:55:47.359 --> 00:55:47.369
start putting things together and they
 

00:55:47.369 --> 00:55:49.009
start putting things together and they
may not want to be part of a plot it

00:55:49.009 --> 00:55:49.019
may not want to be part of a plot it
 

00:55:49.019 --> 00:55:50.809
may not want to be part of a plot it
kills 10,000 or 50,000 people either

00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819
kills 10,000 or 50,000 people either
 

00:55:50.819 --> 00:55:53.299
kills 10,000 or 50,000 people either
maybe they're just smuggling drugs or

00:55:53.299 --> 00:55:53.309
maybe they're just smuggling drugs or
 

00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:54.499
maybe they're just smuggling drugs or
whatever they're not you know how to

00:55:54.499 --> 00:55:54.509
whatever they're not you know how to
 

00:55:54.509 --> 00:55:57.170
whatever they're not you know how to
kill people necessarily in mass and so

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180
kill people necessarily in mass and so
 

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.670
kill people necessarily in mass and so
consequently you can have that kind of

00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680
consequently you can have that kind of
 

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.459
consequently you can have that kind of
thing happening and so these people also

00:56:01.459 --> 00:56:01.469
thing happening and so these people also
 

00:56:01.469 --> 00:56:02.719
thing happening and so these people also
have to be trusted they must not get

00:56:02.719 --> 00:56:02.729
have to be trusted they must not get
 

00:56:02.729 --> 00:56:06.709
have to be trusted they must not get

there and these are you know dealing
with it in various ways but what you

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:16.349
with it in various ways but what you
 

00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:18.349
with it in various ways but what you
have to do then is set up a machine shop

00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359
have to do then is set up a machine shop
 

00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:20.870

but he's been at the forefront of

locking up nukes and locking up fissile

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:57.490
locking up nukes and locking up fissile
 

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.130
locking up nukes and locking up fissile
material around the country and I think

material around the country and I think
 

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.410

that's generally a good thing even

alarmed about the situation is him but

alarmed about the situation is him but
it goes back to stuff I talked out at

01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:06.849
it goes back to stuff I talked out at
 

01:06:06.849 --> 01:06:09.900
it goes back to stuff I talked out at
the beginning in my opinion when you got

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:09.910
the beginning in my opinion when you got
 

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:11.810
the beginning in my opinion when you got
something which is an acceptable risk

01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:11.820
something which is an acceptable risk
 

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.040
something which is an acceptable risk
you don't really want to spend a lot of

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:14.050
you don't really want to spend a lot of
 

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:16.620
you don't really want to spend a lot of
money on it unless it's cheap in other

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:16.630
money on it unless it's cheap in other
 

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.240
money on it unless it's cheap in other
words it's something bitches and so with

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:18.250
words it's something bitches and so with
 

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:19.470
words it's something bitches and so with
the nuclear weapons which you got it

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480
the nuclear weapons which you got it
 

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.910
the nuclear weapons which you got it
seems to me is something that could be

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:20.920
seems to me is something that could be
 

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.339
seems to me is something that could be
really bad but in my opinion when you

01:06:23.339 --> 01:06:23.349
really bad but in my opinion when you
 

01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:24.930
really bad but in my opinion when you
multiply by the probability it's not

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:24.940
multiply by the probability it's not
 

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.880
multiply by the probability it's not
that big a deal and so therefore

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:26.890
that big a deal and so therefore
 

01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:29.070
that big a deal and so therefore
spending lots of money to make that risk

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:29.080
spending lots of money to make that risk
 

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.900
spending lots of money to make that risk
even lower doesn't make sense you should

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:30.910
even lower doesn't make sense you should
 

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:32.880
even lower doesn't make sense you should
spend it on cancer or something but

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:32.890
spend it on cancer or something but
 

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.339
spend it on cancer or something but
small amounts of money to make it even

01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:35.349
small amounts of money to make it even
 

01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:38.010
small amounts of money to make it even
lower that's fine so that I mean like

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:38.020
lower that's fine so that I mean like
 

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.420
lower that's fine so that I mean like
bathtubs you know if there's some cheap

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:39.430
bathtubs you know if there's some cheap
 

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.859
bathtubs you know if there's some cheap
way you could you could reduce the

01:06:40.859 --> 01:06:40.869
way you could you could reduce the
 

01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:42.390
way you could you could reduce the
number of people drowning in bathtubs

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400
number of people drowning in bathtubs
 

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.870
number of people drowning in bathtubs
from 300 to 150 per year I mean that's

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880
from 300 to 150 per year I mean that's
 

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.579
from 300 to 150 per year I mean that's
you know they're on it's not a very big

01:06:47.579 --> 01:06:47.589
you know they're on it's not a very big
 

01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:49.079
you know they're on it's not a very big
risk not very many people died rounding

01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:49.089
risk not very many people died rounding
 

01:06:49.089 --> 01:06:50.400
risk not very many people died rounding
a bathtub so if you could reduce that

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:50.410
a bathtub so if you could reduce that
 

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.470
a bathtub so if you could reduce that
with very inexpensive things like

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480
with very inexpensive things like
 

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.690
with very inexpensive things like

you know because even though the risk is

01:06:59.370 --> 01:06:59.380
you know because even though the risk is
 

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.800
you know because even though the risk is
very small the amount you're spending to

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:01.810
very small the amount you're spending to
 

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.690
very small the amount you're spending to
make the reduce the risk even lower is

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:03.700
make the reduce the risk even lower is
 

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.120
make the reduce the risk even lower is
also small so small expenditures are

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.130
also small so small expenditures are
 

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.740
also small so small expenditures are
there but spending huge amounts of money

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:07.750
there but spending huge amounts of money
 

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:10.020
there but spending huge amounts of money
like getting rid of all bathtubs for

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:10.030

expensive and all kinds of other

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440

I think obviously the likelihood of a

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:22.330
I think obviously the likelihood of a
 

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:23.370
I think obviously the likelihood of a
terrorist getting nuclear weapons is

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:23.380
terrorist getting nuclear weapons is
 

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.770
terrorist getting nuclear weapons is
extremely small on the other hand the

extremely small on the other hand the
efforts to make this even lower are not

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:27.940
efforts to make this even lower are not
 

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.990
efforts to make this even lower are not
very expensive they are for example

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000
very expensive they are for example
 

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.640

that's great and and I think you want to
 

01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:40.070
that's great and and I think you want to
do that anyway because of other problems

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:40.080
do that anyway because of other problems
 

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.900

between that in which people were
 

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.250
between that in which people were
evaluating the evidence and according to

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260
evaluating the evidence and according to
 

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.800

these two generals they figured out that
it was just a false alarm in tens of

01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540
it was just a false alarm in tens of
 

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.920
it was just a false alarm in tens of
seconds almost immediately they figured

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:03.930
seconds almost immediately they figured
 

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:06.770
seconds almost immediately they figured
out but that phrase front line did not

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780
out but that phrase front line did not
 

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:09.140
out but that phrase front line did not
put in that program they have these two

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:09.150
put in that program they have these two
 

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:10.370

journals both is that there wasn't any

01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380
journals both is that there wasn't any
 

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.130
journals both is that there wasn't any
danger and so this from you know really

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140
danger and so this from you know really
 

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.979
danger and so this from you know really
good program that basically obviously

01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:15.989
good program that basically obviously
 

01:13:15.989 --> 01:13:18.050
good program that basically obviously

two-part question okay um my first
 

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.020
two-part question okay um my first
question is do you think an attack on

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:52.030
question is do you think an attack on
 

01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:54.479
question is do you think an attack on
nuclear facilities is more likely than

01:15:54.479 --> 01:15:54.489
nuclear facilities is more likely than
 

01:15:54.489 --> 01:15:57.479
nuclear facilities is more likely than
an attack with with nuclear weapons and

01:15:57.479 --> 01:15:57.489
an attack with with nuclear weapons and
 

01:15:57.489 --> 01:15:59.879
an attack with with nuclear weapons and

01:16:06.509 --> 01:16:06.519
bomb do you uh you know a lot of news
 

01:16:06.519 --> 01:16:09.810
bomb do you uh you know a lot of news
outlets and new sources gave a lot of

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:09.820
outlets and new sources gave a lot of
 

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.330

information on television over the radio

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:12.340

01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:15.789
bomb right after Jose Padilla was
 

01:16:15.789 --> 01:16:18.000
bomb right after Jose Padilla was
arrested and so my question to you is

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:18.010
arrested and so my question to you is
 

01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:19.410
arrested and so my question to you is
what effect do you think that this

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:19.420
what effect do you think that this
 

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.299
what effect do you think that this
intense media coverage and this

01:16:21.299 --> 01:16:21.309
intense media coverage and this
 

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:24.149
intense media coverage and this
distribution of information has on the

01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159
distribution of information has on the
 

01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:26.819
distribution of information has on the
risk of a successful nuclear attack yeah

01:16:26.819 --> 01:16:26.829
risk of a successful nuclear attack yeah
 

01:16:26.829 --> 01:16:28.620
risk of a successful nuclear attack yeah
of those hurts okay late in the case of

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:28.630
of those hurts okay late in the case of
 

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:30.689
of those hurts okay late in the case of
nuclear reactors it's not clear that i

01:16:30.689 --> 01:16:30.699
nuclear reactors it's not clear that i
 

01:16:30.699 --> 01:16:33.120
nuclear reactors it's not clear that i
mean he i can imagine somebody trying to

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:33.130
mean he i can imagine somebody trying to
 

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.069
mean he i can imagine somebody trying to
attack a nuclear reactor and apparently

01:16:35.069 --> 01:16:35.079
attack a nuclear reactor and apparently
 

01:16:35.079 --> 01:16:38.310
attack a nuclear reactor and apparently
one of the women 911 planners work on

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320
one of the women 911 planners work on
 

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.930
one of the women 911 planners work on
things they thought about slamming one

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:39.940
things they thought about slamming one
 

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.419
things they thought about slamming one
and two as which should be the targets

01:16:42.419 --> 01:16:42.429
and two as which should be the targets
 

01:16:42.429 --> 01:16:43.649
and two as which should be the targets
and one possibility was a nuclear

01:16:43.649 --> 01:16:43.659
and one possibility was a nuclear
 

01:16:43.659 --> 01:16:46.830
and one possibility was a nuclear
reactor it's basically it i think pretty

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840
reactor it's basically it i think pretty
 

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.890
reactor it's basically it i think pretty
clear I've got got evidence and the book

01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:49.900
clear I've got got evidence and the book
 

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.290
clear I've got got evidence and the book
that's coming up next April that even a

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:52.300
that's coming up next April that even a
 

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.729
that's coming up next April that even a
very large airliner couldn't do much

01:16:53.729 --> 01:16:53.739
very large airliner couldn't do much
 

01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:55.229
very large airliner couldn't do much
damage I mean he's this big concrete

01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239
damage I mean he's this big concrete
 

01:16:55.239 --> 01:16:58.350
damage I mean he's this big concrete
containment structure so that and the

01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360
containment structure so that and the
 

01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.910
containment structure so that and the
most it would do would potentially

01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920
most it would do would potentially
 

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.220
most it would do would potentially
release a relatively small amount of

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:02.230
release a relatively small amount of
 

01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:04.319
release a relatively small amount of
radiation into the atmosphere which

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:04.329
radiation into the atmosphere which
 

01:17:04.329 --> 01:17:05.819
radiation into the atmosphere which
probably wouldn't do much damage anyway

01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:05.829
probably wouldn't do much damage anyway
 

01:17:05.829 --> 01:17:09.990
probably wouldn't do much damage anyway
so it's not a very good target except

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000
so it's not a very good target except
 

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.060
so it's not a very good target except
possibly symbolically from terrorist

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:12.070
possibly symbolically from terrorist

what was a Padilla was talking thinking

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:16.030
what was a Padilla was talking thinking
 

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.640
what was a Padilla was talking thinking
about those charges of course about the

01:17:19.379 --> 01:17:19.389
dirty bomb had been dropped that doesn't
 

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:22.259
dirty bomb had been dropped that doesn't
mean they were based on something but

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:22.269
mean they were based on something but
 

01:17:22.269 --> 01:17:24.870
mean they were based on something but
dirty bombs are very different from

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880
dirty bombs are very different from
 

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.569
dirty bombs are very different from
nuclear explosions nuclear explosions

01:17:27.569 --> 01:17:27.579
nuclear explosions nuclear explosions
 

01:17:27.579 --> 01:17:29.819

would kill people dirty bombs wouldn't

01:17:29.819 --> 01:17:29.829
would kill people dirty bombs wouldn't
 

01:17:29.829 --> 01:17:31.919
would kill people dirty bombs wouldn't
now I think that's a fairly important

01:17:31.919 --> 01:17:31.929
now I think that's a fairly important
 

01:17:31.929 --> 01:17:35.549
now I think that's a fairly important

time you get very tired of hot dogs you
 

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.430
time you get very tired of hot dogs you
would increase your chance of getting

would increase your chance of getting
 

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.700
would increase your chance of getting
cancer by maybe one tenth of one percent

lost in statistical noise so the point
 

01:18:42.329 --> 01:18:43.790
lost in statistical noise so the point
is it would be an area that would be

is it would be an area that would be

have to spend cleaning it up and so

have to spend cleaning it up and so
 

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.620
have to spend cleaning it up and so
forth but it wouldn't kill anybody and

people don't know that and so what they

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:55.590
people don't know that and so what they
 

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:57.259
people don't know that and so what they
do is trample each other getting out of

01:18:57.259 --> 01:18:57.269
do is trample each other getting out of
 

01:18:57.269 --> 01:18:59.899

stadium you've got 40 years take your
 

01:19:02.729 --> 01:19:05.540
stadium you've got 40 years take your
time and but no one said that and the

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:05.550
time and but no one said that and the
 

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:07.279
time and but no one said that and the
media didn't you could even though this

01:19:07.279 --> 01:19:07.289
media didn't you could even though this
 

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:09.259
media didn't you could even though this
is the bogus thing about the NFL

01:19:09.259 --> 01:19:09.269
is the bogus thing about the NFL
 

01:19:09.269 --> 01:19:11.089
is the bogus thing about the NFL
stadiums they're covering it but no one

01:19:11.089 --> 01:19:11.099
stadiums they're covering it but no one
 

01:19:11.099 --> 01:19:12.770
stadiums they're covering it but no one
said what would happen if one went off

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780
said what would happen if one went off
 

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:15.020
said what would happen if one went off
and the answer is get up and walk calm

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:15.030
and the answer is get up and walk calm
 

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:17.509
and the answer is get up and walk calm
link to the exit and maybe something you

01:19:17.509 --> 01:19:17.519
link to the exit and maybe something you
 

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.009
link to the exit and maybe something you
know maybe you want to take a shower and

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:19.019
know maybe you want to take a shower and
 

01:19:19.019 --> 01:19:20.209
know maybe you want to take a shower and
burn your clothes or something you know

01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219
burn your clothes or something you know
 

01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:21.859
burn your clothes or something you know
they probably don't you need to do that

01:19:21.859 --> 01:19:21.869
they probably don't you need to do that
 

01:19:21.869 --> 01:19:25.370
they probably don't you need to do that
but that's possibility and and so I

01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:25.380
but that's possibility and and so I
 

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.589
but that's possibility and and so I
think that the possibility of dirty bomb

01:19:27.589 --> 01:19:27.599
think that the possibility of dirty bomb
 

01:19:27.599 --> 01:19:30.200
think that the possibility of dirty bomb
is far higher they're much easier than

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:30.210
is far higher they're much easier than
 

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:34.069
is far higher they're much easier than
nuclear weapon but the results are much

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:34.079
nuclear weapon but the results are much
 

01:19:34.079 --> 01:19:35.629
nuclear weapon but the results are much
more limited in fact people when they

01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639
more limited in fact people when they
 

01:19:35.639 --> 01:19:37.009
more limited in fact people when they
talk about it mostly say they're not

01:19:37.009 --> 01:19:37.019
talk about it mostly say they're not
 

01:19:37.019 --> 01:19:38.989
talk about it mostly say they're not
weapons of mass destruction their

01:19:38.989 --> 01:19:38.999
weapons of mass destruction their
 

01:19:38.999 --> 01:19:41.390
weapons of mass destruction their
weapons of mass disruption and that

01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400
weapons of mass disruption and that
 

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.549
weapons of mass disruption and that
seems to be pretty good way of looking

01:19:43.549 --> 01:19:43.559
seems to be pretty good way of looking
 

01:19:43.559 --> 01:19:47.830
seems to be pretty good way of looking
at it

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840
 
 

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.870

the sky is not falling and I kind of
 

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.669
the sky is not falling and I kind of
appreciate your very pragmatic you know

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679
appreciate your very pragmatic you know
 

01:19:54.679 --> 01:19:56.560
appreciate your very pragmatic you know
deflating of these you know overblown

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:56.570
deflating of these you know overblown
 

01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:59.050
deflating of these you know overblown
kind of mass hysteria reactions to the

01:19:59.050 --> 01:19:59.060
kind of mass hysteria reactions to the
 

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.959
kind of mass hysteria reactions to the
potential of nuclear threats but I do

01:20:01.959 --> 01:20:01.969
potential of nuclear threats but I do
 

01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:05.950
potential of nuclear threats but I do
think that there will be likely another

01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960
think that there will be likely another
 

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.870
think that there will be likely another
terrorist attack on American soil I mean

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880
terrorist attack on American soil I mean
 

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.280
terrorist attack on American soil I mean
someone highly competent and highly

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:09.290
someone highly competent and highly
 

01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:11.020
someone highly competent and highly
motivated will eventually succeed and

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:11.030
motivated will eventually succeed and
 

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:13.240
motivated will eventually succeed and
kill you know thousands of people I I

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:13.250
kill you know thousands of people I I
 

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.490
kill you know thousands of people I I
don't want that to happen but I just see

01:20:15.490 --> 01:20:15.500
don't want that to happen but I just see
 

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.470
don't want that to happen but I just see
that it being likely which which kind of

01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480
that it being likely which which kind of
 

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.760
that it being likely which which kind of
terrorist threats to you as more

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:18.770
terrorist threats to you as more
 

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:20.919
terrorist threats to you as more
legitimate say than nuclear or chemical

01:20:20.919 --> 01:20:20.929
legitimate say than nuclear or chemical
 

01:20:20.929 --> 01:20:22.990
legitimate say than nuclear or chemical
biological dirty bombs things of that

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000
biological dirty bombs things of that
 

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.910
biological dirty bombs things of that
nature yeah i'm certainly not saying

01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920
nature yeah i'm certainly not saying
 

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.169
nature yeah i'm certainly not saying
that the terrorists van won't happen of

01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:26.179
that the terrorists van won't happen of
 

01:20:26.179 --> 01:20:29.680
that the terrorists van won't happen of
course and because it terrorism so easy

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:29.690
course and because it terrorism so easy
 

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:31.990
course and because it terrorism so easy
by mean one guy i mean remember the guy

01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000
by mean one guy i mean remember the guy
 

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.939
by mean one guy i mean remember the guy
who killed 31 people at virginia tech a

01:20:36.939 --> 01:20:36.949
who killed 31 people at virginia tech a
 

01:20:36.949 --> 01:20:39.250
who killed 31 people at virginia tech a
few years ago with two pistols I mean it

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:39.260
few years ago with two pistols I mean it
 

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.629
few years ago with two pistols I mean it
wasn't terrorist he just sort of a crazy

01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639
wasn't terrorist he just sort of a crazy
 

01:20:40.639 --> 01:20:44.260
wasn't terrorist he just sort of a crazy
kid but it's obviously very easy to do

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:44.270
kid but it's obviously very easy to do
 

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:49.270
kid but it's obviously very easy to do
that in this kind of situation so they

01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280
that in this kind of situation so they
 

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.459
that in this kind of situation so they
the one person can do it or a small

01:20:51.459 --> 01:20:51.469
the one person can do it or a small
 

01:20:51.469 --> 01:20:52.689
the one person can do it or a small
group can do it so I'd expect something

01:20:52.689 --> 01:20:52.699
group can do it so I'd expect something
 

01:20:52.699 --> 01:20:54.250
group can do it so I'd expect something
to happen something certainly could

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:54.260
to happen something certainly could
 

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.129
to happen something certainly could
happen it's just that if you look 911

01:20:57.129 --> 01:20:57.139
happen it's just that if you look 911
 

01:20:57.139 --> 01:20:59.649
