00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.143
MALE SPEAKER: There are
basically seven billion people.

00:00:04.143 --> 00:00:05.910
And if you made a big
pyramid about who's

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.010
been undersea the
most, in submarines

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.515
the most, gone the deepest,
gone to the most places,

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.230
has the most unusual stories,
at the very top there's one

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.040
person.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.560
And that's Don.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.975
So it's pretty rare
that literally one

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.470
in seven billion people
come to talk to you.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.325
And something I've noticed
about people like that is they

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:27.840
tend to be very modest in how
they explain their background.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.637
So they say things like,
we once saw that so-and-so,

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:33.470
but they don't mention
that's when they were

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.830
at the bottom of
the Marianas Trench,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.000
or that's when they
were at The Bismarck,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.030
or that's when they were picked
by two different presidents

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.780
to advise on science policy.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.440
Or why the State Department
goes to them for advice,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.495
or why they're the dean of
a school of ocean science,

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:50.796
things like that.

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:52.420
They also don't tend
to tell you things

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.070
about their accomplishments
that have been rewarded

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.710
because they're too modest.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.620
DON WALSH: My wife tells me I've
got a lot to be modest about.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.215
MALE SPEAKER:
Well, there you go.

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:04.340
But I'll tell you two of
them, just because they're

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.339
really impressive to me.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.427
One is the United States
Navy only likes Navy people.

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.510
It's very rare for them
to say that somebody who's

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.792
not in the Navy, like in
the Marines, or the Army,

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:16.570
or like a civilian,
did something useful.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.320
But Don has won the highest
possible award from the Navy

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.660
for civilian service and
military service to the Navy.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.410
Also even more impressive
to me personally,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.260
he won the Hubbard award
from the National Geographic

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.340
Society, which is
what you get when

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.795
you climb Mount Everest
for the first time.

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:35.625
Or go to the moon, or
something like that.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.870
In his case, it was going
the other direction,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.610
climbing down Mount
Everest, so to speak,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.130
to the bottom of
Marianas Trench.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.690
Because I hope when
you listen to him

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.305
you'll realize that
everything he says

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.475
represents the integration
of all the world's knowledge

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.689
on these topics better than
anyone else on the planet.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:53.314
Thank you, Don.

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:01.780
DON WALSH: Are
there any questions?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.640
Thank you.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.690
That was most generous.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.150
I'm glad to be here,
of course I think

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.970
it's every kid's dream, even
before Google was invented,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.890
to visit a place like
this because there's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.720
so much cerebral popcorn
here just walking around.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.060
And what a grand place to work.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.390
I'm not a very good
institutional person,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.810
so I can appreciate
non-institutional frameworks.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.790
And so it's really
grand to be here.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.300
Today I just want to
give you a little talk.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.070
Now some of you will say,
well, it's just history.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.170
Telling a nice sea story
about where I've been

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.670
or what we've done, the early
exploration of the oceans.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.530
But I think you folks could
really appreciate the notion

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.200
that the whole march of
technology and engineering--

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.180
that's my basic
background, engineering--

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.690
is to move the decimal point.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.530
Things that are
laboratory curiosities

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.900
30 years ago or 10 years ago,
we have to keep revisiting them.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.390
Because some of them might
be possible to transition

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.560
into operations or
marketplace, depending

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.140
on where you're moving.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.600
So when I subtitle this
and print it out for you,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.520
Looking Backwards at
the Future, that's

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.160
the notion I had in mind.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.090
We're going to go back and
look at the very beginning

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.750
of manned exploration
inside the sea.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.710
Basically taking
the trained mind

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.180
and the trained eye
into the environment.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.400
And I say personal odyssey.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.050
That's a bit precious, I know.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.790
But our first hydronaut, if
you will, first man of sea,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.650
was professor William
Beebe, 1930-1934.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.370
And I came into this about '57.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.320
So I've sort of been in this
field for 2/3 of its lifetime.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.570
Personal odyssey.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.740
I didn't do all this stuff, but
it was a pretty small field.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.420
In fact when I had
command of the Trieste,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.020
the French Navy had an
equivalent Bathyscaph.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.040
And If we wanted to talk about
engineering, and technology,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.340
and operational skills
to explore the deep ocean

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.383
with these manned platforms,
we could book a table

00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:16.180
in a restaurant for about 10
people and they'd all be there.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.519
It's kind of bigger now, but
that was in the very beginning.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.670
We had to write the book.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.777
If you want something you had
to design it and either build it

00:04:23.777 --> 00:04:24.860
or have somebody build it.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.830
There were no catalogues, or
vendors, or any of this stuff.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.326
So we can see today
all of our fingerprints

00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:32.200
on almost everything.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.630
Underwater manipulators.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.220
First ROV ever built
was for the Trieste.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.100
The first underwater manipulator
we bought from General Mills,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.100
believe it or not.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.070
And OK, yes, all of the
O-rings were Cheerios.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.730
But all of that stuff.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.760
Not because we were
smarter or anything else,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.660
but if you wanted it
you had to build it.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.660
So that's where I started out.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.390
And I worked with Jacques
Cousteau, made some programs

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.260
with him on Calypso.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.090
Hans Hass, a very famous
underwater diver of the '50s

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.470
and '60s, I knew
him and all that.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.440
So this was my crew
as I grew up in this

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.790
as a lieutenant in the US
Navy coming out of submarines.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.170
There's this whole world of
these really interesting people

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.180
down at Scripps and
throughout the world.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.960
And we had what the lawyers
call an attractive nuisance.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.140
That's when you don't put a
fence around your swimming pool

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.950
and a neighbor kid falls
in and you get sued.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.530
And the legal
principle is you've

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.230
created an attractive nuisance.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.110
So the Trieste in some way
was an attractive nuisance.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.390
We had, I think the
three years I was there,

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.967
four Nobel laureates come
in and have a look at it

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.550
for no other reason
they were curious.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.980
It was a very yeasty
world that we came from.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.410
And I'm delighted
that for 53, 54 years

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.710
I've been able to work
in it continuously.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.150
So that's a personal Odyssey.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.380
I probably leaned on
that button too long.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.810
Here's the essential problem.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.600
What's down there?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.500
How do we see it?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.916
And you can see
it all right here.

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:06.310
That is the nature
of the question.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.970
Because the surface of
the ocean is opaque,

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.280
we can't look into it.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.600
I remember-- and I can't
find the damn thing.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.350
I want to put in my program.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.580
It's a Dennis the Menace
cartoon by Hank Ketcham,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.130
and shows Dennis and Little
Joey standing there looking out

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.720
at the ocean.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.120
The view is from behind them.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.620
And they're holding
hands like this,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.510
and Dennis is saying, yeah,
there's a lot more under there.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.040
And that's the idea.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.500
From the beginning
of oceanography

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.882
as a multidisciplinary
science about 1870,

00:06:35.882 --> 00:06:37.340
that was the
Challenger expedition.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.840
The Royal Society sent HMS
Challenger around the world

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.080
with scientists.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.930
I think it was a
three-year expedition.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.920
Two plus.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.500
And they did a heroic
amount of collecting.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.340
In fact, a lot of the
specimens are still

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.380
being looked at in the 50 volume
report from the expedition.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.890
But they were at the interface.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.820
They lowered artificial
hands in the ocean,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.530
scooped up stuff and tried
to describe the ocean

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.770
from crushed bits of
sediment or organisms.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.630
Then didn't even
have artificial eyes,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.490
which we had later in
the form of cameras.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.110
But why not take
the trained mind

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.660
the trained eye into
the environment?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.950
Because that's how
we do field sciences.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.810
Biology and geology, you go
into the field and you observe.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.790
As a biologist you observe the
critter that interests you,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.960
but also how it interacts
with this environment.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.310
That's very important.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.630
And a geologist has to sort
of look at the land form

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.000
before you take a
selected sample out.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.500
And the same thing
with a biologist.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.083
We've never done
that in oceanography.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.360
We've done it like this.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.880
It's like flying over New Mexico
in a balloon on a dark night

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.300
and lowering down a grappling
hook and pull stuff out,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.785
and then defining what is
down there in that land mass.

00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:47.400
It's Gila monsters and firemen
and maybe in an odd VW Bug.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.980
And then you get a
learned paper in Monaco

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.782
about the nature
of this new land.

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:52.490
Terra New Mexico.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.280
I'm exaggerating.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.740
I think you probably
gathered that.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.470
But the notion of being able
to take the trained mind,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.887
trained eye into the
ocean, very important.

00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:06.220
Now if you're a chemist or
physical oceanographer, which

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.010
is my field, not so important.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.340
A chemist can't look at
water and decide what it is.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.870
You've got to do certain
analytical things.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.296
But for the observational
sciences, very important.

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.070
Now that's my parish notices.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.510
Let's go with the program here.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.880
OK, I've introduced you
to doctor William Beebe.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.100
1930-34 he made the first
voyages into the abyss.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.880
1934 he made a dive
to a half mile down.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.350
And for those of you who
are really keen on history

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.450
of science and
exploration, you can still

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.090
get a copy of "Half Mile Down"
at an antiquarian bookstores.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.650
They're not very
expensive because he

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.700
was a prolific writer.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.950
He was kind of the
Carl Sagan of his time.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.870
A talented scientist, but so he
also knew how to tell a story.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.370
In fact, what he
was was something

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.660
that's very rare today,
and that's a naturalist.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.980
If you look back in the
history of science, especially

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.992
in the late 19th
century, the naturalists

00:08:56.992 --> 00:08:58.450
were the people
that knew something

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.900
about the plants, the
animals, the geology.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.650
And they could draw
because of course they

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.920
didn't have cameras then.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.020
And so they were kind
of all-purpose people.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.410
Very useful on expeditions.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.390
They could run, pass, and punt.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.430
And Beebe was of that world.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.940
As a trained naturalist
he started out with birds,

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.570
and he did this work
in the deep ocean,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.120
and at the end of his life he
was working on butterflies.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.180
And so he was the ever curious
guy and he could write.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.930
And his books were very popular.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.980
He was very popular on
the speaking circuit.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.730
He made quite a
bit of money and he

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.730
bought Nonsuch Island
in the Bahamas.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.185
And that's where
they did this dive,

00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:39.780
at his island that
he bought, he owned.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.810
And it was a remarkable
thing, "Half Mile Down",

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:48.020
in 1934, when commercial diving,
hard hat diving and such,

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.940
maybe they're getting
down to 600 feet by then.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.302
But it was very experimental,
"Half Mile Down".

00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:55.510
So if you're interested in
such things, get the book.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.110
You've got his
illustrations in there.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.610
Don't wait for the
movie to come out

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.780
because that's not
going to happen.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.710
John Wayne's gone.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:09.180
So that was William Beebe,
a giant in our field.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.540
The one thing I'll
mention here, and that

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.150
is the viewports he
used were made out

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.340
of fused quartz, something
that General Electric had just

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.180
developed.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.620
It's a crystal, and
made out of that.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.670
And we have a gentleman in
this room-- where's Chris?

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.480
There he is.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.010
His Virgin Oceanic submersible
uses a fused quartz dome.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.230
The only man to do it
in nearly a century.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.760
Well done.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.680
I'm sure that you know
something the rest of us

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.280
don't know about acrylic.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.342
Well, there it is.

00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:41.190
If you have questions
about his subject,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.530
you'll meet it in my program.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.300
You can ask the guy
over there in the corner

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.470
Auguste Piccard was a physicist.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.610
He was of the crew, if
you will, of Einstein

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.810
or even Madame Curie
was still alive

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.500
when he started
out as a physicist.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.000
And there's a
wonderful picture that

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.960
was in Jacques Piccard's
office of a physicist meeting.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.670
In Lausanne, I think, about
1920, and they're all there.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.050
So he was one the classic
family of physicists

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.320
of around that time.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.820
But when he was a student at
Zurich Polytechnic in 1904,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.180
he was ill for a while abed.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.239
And he was a balloon pilot
in the Swiss army reserve.

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:24.780
As you know, all
males in Switzerland

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.610
have to belong in
the Army Reserve.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.109
And he was a balloon pilot, and
he was reading these reports

00:11:29.109 --> 00:11:31.290
in the Meteor expedition
of the late 1800s,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.660
the German expedition.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.840
All the stuff they were
getting by remote sensing,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.000
again sitting on that
interface grabbing stuff up

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.010
from the depths.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.468
And he said, I
wonder why you can't

00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:41.380
use the idea of a
balloon to go underwater.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.010
The most fluid media.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.405
You just have to have
something that has payload

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:47.530
and you can make it
descend and come back up.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.321
So that's what you've
been looking at here.

00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:50.990
The one on the left
is his Bathyscaph.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.340
Bathy meaning deep,
scaphos, boat.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.010
Deep boat.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.790
And on the right is the balloon
that he was more used to

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.870
in flying through the air.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.595
And so he came up
with that concept.

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.070
He didn't do much with it.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.580
And it was until 1948,
just after World War II,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.770
that he developed
his Bathyscaph.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.050
FNRS is the French is
the National Research

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.200
Foundation of Belgium,
which had sponsored.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.410
FNRS 2, by the way, was
a high-altitude balloon

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.700
that Piccard set
a world's record.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.500
1931, 70,000 feet.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.430
The conventional wisdom with
medical doctors associated

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.750
with aviation in
1931 is if you went

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.670
above 24,000 feet
you'd surely die.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.910
So nobody would build
it, the capsule,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.380
the cabin for his balloon.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.470
So he found a brewery
in Belgium that

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.540
would make beer vessels,
vats, containers.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.744
A huge-- like a barrel, OK?

00:12:46.744 --> 00:12:48.660
It had a few openings
in it, things like that.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.050
They built it for professor
Piccard, sent it to him.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.800
That became the cabin
for his first balloon.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.710
So he knew balloons and
he set a world's record.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.620
Incidentally, he was
studying cosmic radiation.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.280
So the quintessential scientist.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.140
It was not to set
a record, it was

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.870
to get above the masking effect
of the Earth's atmosphere

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.050
so you get good numbers.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.550
He tried the Alps, that didn't
work, so he used his balloon.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.540
OK, 1948 he builds
his first Bathyscaph.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.400
Now here we run
into the old problem

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.980
between theory and practice.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.940
The theory was pretty good.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.502
I'm sorry.

00:13:24.502 --> 00:13:26.940
I'm mastering this thing now.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.950
All right, folks.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.044
I push something.

00:13:30.044 --> 00:13:30.710
Push that again.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.780
OK there it is.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.200
He set up with a pressure
switch because, well I'll

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.080
make the first
deeper dive with it.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.665
I'll have it drop weight
and come back automatically.

00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:44.180
There won't be anybody in it.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.684
So it down to 4,800
feet, came right back up.

00:13:46.684 --> 00:13:47.600
So there's the theory.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.100
It works.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.590
Bathyscaph, good stuff.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.230
Here's the cabin,
there's the balloon.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.537
However, it was unseaworthy.

00:13:52.537 --> 00:13:54.120
And once it got back
on the surface to

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.530
started to come apart.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.380
So practice, not so good.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.010
And those of you in
the front row, you

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.980
can see this person right here.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.670
So the French Navy ship that
was set by the National Science

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.130
Foundation to kind
of help Piccard,

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.260
and that's Lieutenant
Jacques-Yves Cousteau before he

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.510
went on to other things.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.780
OK, so that was the
first Bathyscaph.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.020
The foundation said, look
your theory's really great,

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.494
Professor Piccard,
but we want you

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:22.660
to get with the French Navy.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.770
Go to the French naval
shipyard in Toulon.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.680
They make submarines,
things like that.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.230
Keep the bits that
are important,

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.340
that are robust, the cabin,
and make a new Bathyscaph

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.409
that is more seaworthy.

00:14:33.409 --> 00:14:34.450
And that's what they did.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.870
Piccard didn't get along
with the French very well.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.150
They got offers from Italy
to build another Bathyscaph,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.330
and so here comes the Trieste.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.560
1953.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.890
Why is a called Trieste?

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.290
It was built in the Adriatic
shipyard near Trieste, Italy.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.220
And it was built with all
donated goods and services.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.910
Pirelli provided the
rubber tubing and wiring.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.140
Agip, the national
petroleum company,

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.900
provided the buoyancy material,
which I didn't get to.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.870
But this underwater
balloon, of course,

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.230
can't use helium or
hydrogen for buoyancy,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.940
that doesn't work underwater.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.200
So oil floats on water, why
not fill it with petroleum?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.850
Aviation gasoline is readily
available throughout the world

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.010
and it's a light fraction.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.400
So you get a lot of lift
per volume of gasoline.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.730
And that's what we have.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.625
By the way, the
zebra stripes there

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:25.250
are because remember
this is a balloon.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.820
Yes, it's a thin steel
shell, very thin,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.796
but it still has to have
some-- you know, everything

00:15:32.796 --> 00:15:35.170
you add in the way of structure,
it deducts from payload.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.080
Just common in
anything that flies.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.280
So the zebra stripes are
transverse bulkheads.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.821
So if you have to
push it with a boat

00:15:41.821 --> 00:15:44.150
or put some pressure on
that very thin shell,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.435
that's where it's strongest.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.460
I'll give you a little bit
on the theory of operation.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.240
To get to go down
you had ballast tanks

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.110
here on the bow and the
stern filled with air.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.860
When you tow out to the dive
site, you vent off that air,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.160
it's heavier than water,
and you start down.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.820
Now it's very desirable to
slow down and eventually

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.140
stop and come back up.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.390
You have to get rid of weight.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.040
Well, you can't use air like
a regular military submarine

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.060
to blow water out
of ballast tanks

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.740
because we're talking about
back pressures up to 16,000 PSI.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.930
And that's pretty
tricky with air.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.420
So we have to drop mass weight.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.890
So right here and there
are two ballast tubs.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.730
Each of those tubs is
filled with eight tons

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.750
of steel pellets.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.600
Essentially reusable
sandblast, iron or steel.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.850
Very ordinary stuff.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.440
No quality control.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.060
And so we bought that stuff.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.140
And because of no
quality control,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.730
we could have problems because
at the bottom of those tubs

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.610
is an opening right
there and there.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.230
That white cylinder you see at
the bottom is an electromagnet.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.330
So when you energize
that magnet the shot's

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.230
magnetized and can't fall.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.790
Here's where quality
control comes in.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.150
You don't know what kind
of steel you've got.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.320
Some of it will
become magnetized.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.050
That's not a good idea because
you can't get rid of weight.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.380
So every pound of steel shot we
used in this program for the 3

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.089
and 1/2 years I was with
it, we had a rig in the shop

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:16.089
and we'd run every batch of
steel pellets through there,

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.760
magnetize it, turn off the
power and if it flowed then

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.260
it was OK.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.050
If it didn't flow,
out the back door.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.314
OK and just in case you
have a really bad emergency,

00:17:26.314 --> 00:17:27.720
you could drop both tubs.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.620
That'd be 16 tons plus the
weight of these two tubs.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.259
That's the cabin.

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:34.550
This is the water line here
when you're on the surface.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.380
So there's a tube,
if you will, that

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.410
goes down through
the balloon here.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.840
The hatch is right there.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.440
The viewport's there.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.230
The whole thickness
is about seven inches

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.510
and the viewport is about
seven inches made out

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.110
of acrylic plastic.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.160
A truncated cone.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.030
In other words the inner
surface was very small,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.110
almost one eyeball.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.700
The outer surface was
several inches across.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.760
And since plastic does exactly
that under pressure, it flows,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.687
then it's self-seating.

00:18:02.687 --> 00:18:04.770
So it's just a metal seat,
no O-rings or anything.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.890
It would just adjust
itself to the conical seat

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.440
in the sphere itself.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.140
The sphere was built by
the Krupp works in Germany.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.380
Those of you up front can
see the Krupp logo there.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.926
Little problem on our 16,000
foot dive at Guam-- I'm

00:18:19.926 --> 00:18:21.550
getting ahead of my
story a little bit.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.110
When we bought the Trieste
from the Piccards in 1958

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.560
and engaged Jacques Piccard
to be the consultant to us,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.570
show us how to maintain
and operate it,

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.000
it was only a 20,000
foot submersible.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.500
And we wanted to go deeper.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.675
So we had to increase
the size the balloon

00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:44.150
to get more payload because
avgas, aviation gasoline,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.747
compressed by about
13 and 1/2%, it's

00:18:46.747 --> 00:18:48.080
more compressible than seawater.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.380
So on the deep dive we lost
quite a bit of buoyancy

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.650
just on that compression.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.510
Also we needed a new cabin.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.930
No one in the US bid on the job.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.980
Krupp works said,
we can do it but we

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.330
don't have the machines
to forge two hemispheres.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.240
Because normally, in this
kind of construction,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.670
you start with 100% extra.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.820
So if you want an
eight ton sphere

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.920
you start with 16 tons of steel.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.620
And because most of the
bad stuff on a forging

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.290
is on the outer part,
you machine all at off,

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.530
inclusions and so on, until
you get down to the core.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.790
They said, we don't do that.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.860
We know how to do
it, we don't have it.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.936
The Russians came and took away
our machines after the war.

00:19:26.936 --> 00:19:29.310
And I understand they were on
a barge sunk in the Baltic.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.530
So those machines are on the
floor of the Baltic somewhere.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.080
But we'll make it
in three pieces.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.320
We know how to do this.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.050
So what you have is sort of
two semi-hemispherical end

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.850
cap one with a hatch
in it and the opposing

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.320
one with the viewport in it.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.000
And, as you know, a rule of
thumb is where we take out,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.240
say, five pounds of metal by
machining, you sort of putty

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.550
that around the opening.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.240
That's just a real
rule of thumb.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.575
So there's a lot more
mass in those two bits.

00:19:58.575 --> 00:20:02.840
Then there's a central ring,
which had no openings in it.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.140
So it was just a
straight seven inches.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.810
It has less mass than
the two end caps.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:14.480
So we're making this dive off of
Guam, we're doing 16,000 feet.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.260
Where we're diving the seawater
temperature is about 84,

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.490
and then you're going
down to about-- I

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.930
think it was 34 degrees
roughly at the sea floor.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.735
You're soaking in that cold.

00:20:28.735 --> 00:20:31.090
So the hull gets very cold.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.670
You come rocketing
back up to the surface.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.540
These two massive end pieces
are expanding very slowly.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.490
The center one's
expanding very fast.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.930
Because folks, that thing was
glued together with acrylic.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.520
Very finely machined, as
only the Germans might do,

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.880
seat and then with
acrylic smacked together.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.450
That's why you're
seeing in this diagram

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.420
that there's no real bands
on here sort of holding

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.690
all the bits together.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.040
It's just all glued together.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.750
As I had one admiral who came
to see us in San Diego, he said,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.330
well how's this
thing held together?

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.712
I don't see a flange.

00:21:05.712 --> 00:21:07.670
You know, a typical way
two hemispheres flange,

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.110
bolts all the way around,
O-rings, all of that.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.520
He says, I don't
see any of that.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.870
I said, well we don't
have them, admiral.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.495
He said, well how
does it fit together?

00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:16.351
I said, it's glued.

00:21:16.351 --> 00:21:18.100
And he said, lieutenant,
the Navy does not

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.100
glue its ships together.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.240
So I said yes sir.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.870
It's just like when my wife, I
get the last word in, yes dear.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.116
So there it is.

00:21:29.116 --> 00:21:30.830
There's the cabin.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.420
That's how it works.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.560
We will meet some of this later.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.990
As I said, the Office of
Naval Research purchased it.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.710
It was purchased as
a research platform.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.770
So what Jacques and I
did on the deep dive,

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.420
we were the test
pilots to prove out

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.050
the platform to
the maximum test.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.130
Make sure it was safe,
that it was reliable,

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:58.830
and that it was efficient for a
platform for ocean scientists.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.520
And only then would
we put them in it.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.855
So it's like Boeing
builds a new airplane,

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:05.480
they don't roll it
over to the terminal

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.060
and load it with passengers.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.160
You have test flight
protocols you go through,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.100
and once you sign it
off and hand it over

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.360
to the mere mortals.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.860
So our dive was not
a scientific dive.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.395
It was a proof of concept dive.

00:22:17.395 --> 00:22:19.074
And people don't
seem to understand

00:22:19.074 --> 00:22:20.490
that we didn't
take a lot of data,

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.240
or we didn't stay on
the bottom very long.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.140
It's like saying to Wilbur,
well, you only flew a few feet,

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.290
you only took one person.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.380
What use is this?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.710
You've got to start somewhere.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.580
And so the Office
of Naval Research

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.580
placed this at the Naval
Laboratory in San Diego

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.320
so we had deep water nearby.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.060
[INAUDIBLE] knows just
off La Jolla and San Diego

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.430
you get down to 4,000 feet
with a very short trip

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.360
from the harbor.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.360
So that was a good place
to home port this thing.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.370
And I joined the program, as I
said, as a submarine officer,

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:54.500
serving in a submarine in
San Diego in January of '59.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.200
And the first dive in US
Navy was made the month

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.910
before, December.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.010
And of course this
cabin was my office.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.350
I've told you about it.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.270
Arrayed around the window there
are all the hull penetrators

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.260
for the various wires
and controls and things

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.620
that we needed to control
from inside the sub

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.375
to topside sensors and devices.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.010
It was pretty small
as offices go.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.260
This person's leaning up against
the hatch right behind him

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.940
and this one is looking
out through the viewport.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.240
And that's all the stuff.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.281
And we don't have actually
the mission equipment.

00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:38.730
That's just the stuff we
needed to run the vehicle.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.030
The scientist would bring
all of his own kit with him

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.080
and we'd integrate
it and off we'd go.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.150
So I think some of you,
especially in the higher salary

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.340
brackets here, probably
have a 35 cubic foot

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.270
refrigerator at home.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.940
Next time you reach in
for a bottle of beer,

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.980
think of two dudes
working in there.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.780
Piccard was 6'2".

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.870
Cousteau used to call, not
entirely affectionately,

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.940
double metre, two meters.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.472
And the temperature was about
the same, but you were busy

00:24:10.472 --> 00:24:11.680
and you didn't really notice.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.263
And you sort of
dressed for the event.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.220
Shortly after I
got to the project,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:24.170
I was informed that the plans
with ONR and with the Navy Lab

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.170
were to take it out to Guam
and make a dive in the deepest

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.786
place in the world ocean.

00:24:29.786 --> 00:24:31.910
And my response was probably
the same as yours was.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.080
Say what?

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:42.550
Because this is-- let's
call it around March of '59.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.855
I had the previous November
made a dive in the submarine

00:24:46.855 --> 00:24:49.650
that I was serving in San Diego.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.990
A World War II construction
diesel submarine.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.670
We have what we
call a test depth.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.540
That's your maximum
operating depth

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.080
you're permitted to go without
filling out a lot of forms.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.520
And it's 300 feet.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.780
We'd do that a lot.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.670
Even when I had
submarine command

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.120
I'd always take my boat
down quite frequently

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.290
because it's better to
find leaks whether small.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.740
No surprises.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.550
And the crew is
more relaxed going

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.360
the maximum possible
depth if you do it a lot.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.730
And so everybody's
better for it.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.075
So I've been to 300 feet.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.140
January I reported
to the Navy Lab.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.250
The following March, I
made a dive in the Trieste

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.240
to 4,000 feet.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.620
That's pretty good.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.760
Here I am on the bottom
of the ocean, 4,000 feet.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.750
And our chief scientist said,
Don come on into the office.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.030
And I said OK.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.580
He said, this is what
we think we want to do.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.350
And that's when he
got his say what?

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.630
All in capital letters,
exclamation point.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.030
Anyway, we start to tool
up for Challenger Deep

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.040
that I told you earlier.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.290
We bought a new cabin,
expanded the balloon, increased

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.360
the payload, got all our stuff
packed up, went out to Guam.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.000
Because mother nature is
pretty fortunate in terms

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.270
of geography.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:03.080
We were only about 200
miles from the deepest place

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.690
the world ocean, Challenger
Deep in the Marianas Trench.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.640
That had already been proved
by the Brits, the Soviets,

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.570
and Scripps.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.380
Especially Scripps.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.400
Once they put the imprimatur
on it, then that was kosher.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.234
So we knew we were going
to the right place.

00:26:16.234 --> 00:26:17.983
Most of them didn't
think anybody was ever

00:26:17.983 --> 00:26:19.730
going to go there,
but there we were.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.062
We could do it.

00:26:21.062 --> 00:26:22.770
We could only tow it
at about five knots,

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.090
so it's going to be a bit
of a drama to get it out

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.910
to the dive site in
the Pacific Ocean.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.100
A lot of stuff peeling
off, because most

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.340
of the operational
equipment's on the outside.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.790
Lights, and cameras, and
batteries, things of this sort.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.650
But it looked like a go.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.480
We could do it.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.610
Get out there and do that.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.110
So we went out to Guam.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.780
Big Navy base there too,
so we had a lot of support.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.120
And we set up our
shop and started

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.850
making increasingly
deeper test dives.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.560
You start in the
harbor but 200 feet,

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.530
and by November-- I already
told you about that dive,

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.250
16,000 feet.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.290
And we stood down for
Christmas holidays,

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.970
mostly to get caught up
with all of our repair bills

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:04.840
and all of that and get it
ready for the final plunge.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:10.680
January of 1960, early January,
we made a dive to 24,000 feet,

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.180
everything was working
good so we were a go

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.120
and we went out and headed
for the deepest place.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:22.320
This is kind of fluff, but
there's Marianas Trench there.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.230
And if you took Mount Everest
and you dropped it in there,

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.487
you could see you still have
about a mile above Mount

00:27:28.487 --> 00:27:29.820
Everest if you drove over there.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.860
Just idea of how
far below sea level

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.330
you are here compared to
the height of Mount Everest.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.650
That really doesn't mean much.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.990
This is for the bridge club,
so I put that in there.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.560
And they like ooh, aah.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.760
You're engineers, so
unimpressed by such stuff.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.939
23 January, 1960,
nine hour drive.

00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:51.730
it took us about five
hours and some change

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.146
to go down because
we didn't know,

00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:55.840
really, what was under us.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.210
Our mother ship was a
Navy Destroyer Escort

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.860
and we had a tugboat
out from Guam

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.140
that towed the Trieste down.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.532
Those of you that
remember-- oh, there

00:28:05.532 --> 00:28:08.130
are a few gray hairs in here.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.490
Bald pates.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.720
Remember LORAN?

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.000
And if you get on a
baseline of LORAN,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.310
your navigational
information is really bad.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.360
It's kind of like
in Playboy magazine.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.820
The damn page, the staples go
right down through her tummy.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:32.880
And so you're on the
baseline of LORAN,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.450
you don't know where you are.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.867
And this destroyer we were on
didn't have a depth sounder.

00:28:36.867 --> 00:28:38.616
I mean, it had a depth
sounder to keep you

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.200
from running into
something, you know,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.220
the side of an island
or a continent.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.830
Maybe 300 or 400
feet under the keel.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.290
That's all you need
for safe navigation.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:50.810
But we didn't have a
deep sea sounding device.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.560
Seven miles down, we're
not going to find Atlas.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.410
So where are we?

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.590
We can't navigate very well.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.740
We know approximately
from Scripps, the Soviets,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.030
and the Brits where it is,
but seawater magnifies.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.590
You've got to be more close
than just waving your arms.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.040
Oh yeah, we'd get some sun
lines, maybe a star at night,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.000
but it wasn't all that good.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.360
So what we do?

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.450
Well, innovation.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.710
It's the American
gift, innovation.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:20.260
We got several hundred
one-pound blocks of TNT,

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.140
put fuses in them.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.430
Put a fuse in them
and then you light it,

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.590
throw it over the side.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.070
Now the hydrophone on the
fathometer, the depth finder

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:33.390
on the destroyer is just fine.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.300
It can hear a lot of energy.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.290
So bang, it goes off at
the surface of the water.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.550
Start your stopwatch.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.500
When you hear the return
echo then you turn it off.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.700
12 seconds is deeper
than six seconds.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.777
We don't know on an absolute
basis how deep ocean was,

00:29:47.777 --> 00:29:49.360
but we knew we were
in the right place

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.649
as long as they had the
longest time return.

00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:52.440
That's pretty good.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.840
We finally mapped it out about a
mile wide and seven miles long,

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.556
and then put the Trieste in the
middle of that, made the dive

00:29:58.556 --> 00:30:00.930
and it seemed to work.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.690
Because we did get
the deepest place.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.330
Even Jim Cameron
couldn't do that good.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.140
I got him by 85 feet still.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.410
So down we went, five hours
and some change going down.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.290
Because again, sea
mounts, things like that.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.370
We don't know outcrops,
didn't want to crash.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.500
And we got to the bottom and
we were there only 20 minutes.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.630
And what happened
is when we landed

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.500
we stirred up the
bottom sediment.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.450
And that happens on every
dive, but the subtle currents

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.060
of the sea floor move it away.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:34.330
By the time you've tidied up the
cockpit, filled in your logs,

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.070
called topside, tell
them where you're at,

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.930
and get the cameras
out, you're ready to go.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.250
In this case it didn't.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.350
It was like being
in a bowl of milk.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.820
And after 20 minutes that
didn't diminish it all.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.210
We had to get back up.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.945
It's winter time, I only
have so many hours in the day

00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:53.240
to unhook the tow
from the tugboat.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.610
You've got a 1,200
ton seagoing tug here

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.996
and a human hand trying to
hook the Trieste up in a sea

00:30:59.996 --> 00:31:01.490
state six.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.020
And so we want to allow
a lot of time to safely.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.889
No use losing a hand or a
life just to do the dive.

00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:10.680
And same thing in the
other end of the day.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.230
I wanted two good
hours of sunlight

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.590
before we had to go in.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.050
So that kind of described
how long our mission dive

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.030
profile would be.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.039
So we got back up in
little over three hours.

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:21.330
Because we don't worry now
about outcrops and all that,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:22.538
we're just going straight up.

00:31:22.538 --> 00:31:26.260
So we could dump a lot of weight
and rocket back to the surface.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.730
And it was a good day's work.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.360
It was nine hours.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.970
Actually the dive I made on
the World War II battleship

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.650
Bismarck on one of the
Russian Mir submersibles,

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.200
that's 14 hours.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.540
Now that's a drama.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.000
You've really got to plan
your day, if you will,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.305
because they don't have
bathroom facilities.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.400
This is my first
writing triumph.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.170
I wrote that cover
story and it's never

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.672
gotten that good since.

00:31:56.672 --> 00:31:59.950
52 years and I'm
not in New Yorker,

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.710
the magazines that
pay a lot of money.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.860
This one was pretty good.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.590
That's me there.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.314
That's Jacques
trying to figure out

00:32:05.314 --> 00:32:06.605
how to inflate his life jacket.

00:32:10.206 --> 00:32:13.610
Well he was seasick
and he was trying

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.600
to avoid putting
any large objects

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.400
into the inflating pipe.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.960
Anyway, sea state was about
eight when we got back up.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.040
I was pretty
relieved to be back.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.680
And we were sitting here.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.620
You know when you
had a bad dream

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.080
and you wake up and just
for a fraction of a minute

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.770
you don't know if
that's now or then.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.420
Then you realize, oh, I
didn't fall off that building.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.250
And so we got back
up, we climbed

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.432
topside and nobody's there.

00:32:43.432 --> 00:32:47.380
Now we're 200 miles from land
sitting on a sort of a log,

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.710
a sea state eight, and
there's nobody there.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.550
Well of course
immediately I knew better.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.160
Our height of eye was so low
that the ships were there,

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.250
we just couldn't see them.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.470
Furthermore, I'd gone to the
Air Force base the previous week

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:00.760
and told what we were doing.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.720
They gave me an
emergency beacon and they

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.350
had their search and rescue
aircraft orbiting the area.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.800
So it was fine, but it was just
that little twitch, you know?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.330
The end of a perfect day.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.830
And Jacques and I
were sitting there

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.420
waiting to be picked up to
go back to the mother ship

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:19.820
and we were discussing, when
will somebody be here next?

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.080
And we finally
settled on two years.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.160
Well, we were wrong
by half a century.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.010
It was 52 years later
when Jim did it.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.870
That was another good
day at the office.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.240
They took us back to Washington.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.630
Remember the old
saying about success

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:41.920
has a million fathers,
whereas failure is an orphan?

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.090
Well once we did it,
everybody was telling us

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.502
how they've had
every confidence.

00:33:47.502 --> 00:33:48.960
We didn't get any
cards and flowers

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.910
from those dudes for the
nine months we were on Guam.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.120
When the hull broke,
I didn't bother

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.260
to tell my masters at San
Diego, because they would just

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.652
pull the plug on
whole operation.

00:34:01.652 --> 00:34:03.530
You remember Nelson's blind eye?

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:07.350
Ever hear that saying
that he was in a formation

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.780
attacking the French
ships and the lead admiral

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.330
in another part of
formation had signaled

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.000
Nelson to get behind him.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.500
They were all going
to go like this.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.760
And he held up this
telescope and his flag

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:25.000
captain Hardy said,
well Admiral Nelson,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.820
that signal says you've
got to get back here.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.270
And Nelson had one blind
eye from previous combat,

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.510
I think was in Denmark.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.199
So he's holding to
his blind eye and he

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:39.310
says, I don't see
the signal, Hardy.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.010
Proceed as I have ordered.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.600
Well this was not
Nelson's blind eye

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.436
that I decided not
to tell San Diego.

00:34:47.436 --> 00:34:49.580
They thought we were
a bunch of young guys.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.690
They just left us alone.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.520
They didn't understand
what we were doing.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.830
And I didn't pretend to add
to that lack of understanding.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.760
That is, add knowledge to it.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.210
But after we got back
up in Washington,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.370
we were heroic, all the
admirals and the captains

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.120
up on the hill.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.380
I had 150 American flags I
took with me, handing them out

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.910
like trading beads
to the Indians.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.110
Appreciate your vote.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.580
I hope you'll take care of
the Navy's Undersea Research

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.990
Program, blah, blah, blah.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.940
Anyway, that's what that flag
is that the president's holding.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.370
Good day's work.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.780
We had one stowaway.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.070
Rolex had configured
a special deep sea

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:32.370
Rolex which rode on the outside.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:36.140
So the pressure at the sea floor
was eight tons per square inch.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.740
They made five of them.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.850
The first two didn't make it.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:43.060
They tested them to 50,000
foot equivalent depth.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.870
But this one did.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:44.953
They call it the old lady.

00:35:44.953 --> 00:35:47.970
You can see how they got
around the idea of the crystal

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.830
by making this big
acrylic wart on top.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:54.610
They now call it the
old lady because they're

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:55.880
very proud of that.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.230
I didn't know about it.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.780
Piccard-- I went down to the
cabin first, then he came down

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.590
and he tied it off
to one of the rungs

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.204
in the ladder in
the entrance tube.

00:36:06.204 --> 00:36:07.870
And then when we got
back to the surface

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.850
he went up first
and took it off.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.860
And if he had asked about that
I would have never permitted it

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:17.590
because this is a US
government operation.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.770
We don't endorse any
private enterprise.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.770
In fact, National Geographic
was irritated at me

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:23.880
for a half century.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.940
That's why the Hubbard
Medal came 50 years later.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.700
They gave us a lunch when
we got back to Washington

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.480
to see the president and a
couple of warm handshakes

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.930
and a lifetime subscription
to the magazine

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.190
and shoved us out the back door.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:45.170
So it took them a half
century to get over this,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.540
and to award the medal.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.280
Because I think it
was one better things

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.265
that happened that year.

00:36:52.265 --> 00:36:54.980
And so I wouldn't
even take their flag.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.807
That's how, I don't
know, religious I

00:36:57.807 --> 00:36:58.890
was about the whole thing.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.550
I figured I'm a government
employee, a Naval officer.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.470
The whole program belongs to
the people of the United States,

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:08.437
not to Rolex, or National
Geographic, or whoever else.

00:37:08.437 --> 00:37:09.895
Unlike some of the
astronauts, they

00:37:09.895 --> 00:37:12.061
took golf balls and all
kinds of things to the moon,

00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:13.840
but I just didn't
think it was right.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.920
AUDIENCE: They were
in the Air Force.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.503
DON WALSH: They were
in the Air Force.

00:37:17.982 --> 00:37:20.190
Those of you in the Air
Force realize the first thing

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.940
they do is they
build a golf course

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.481
and then they go to
Congress and say,

00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:26.280
well we need money
for the runways.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.480
But anyway, that's
another story.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.140
Anyway, so I didn't know
about this until about two

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.500
years later I saw it in
one of these comic strips.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.540
They used to have,
and maybe they

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.070
still do, comic
strips [INAUDIBLE],

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.620
Science Today or
something like that.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.680
Factual, but it's
all little drawings.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.411
And I saw something about
the deepest diving watch.

00:37:47.411 --> 00:37:48.910
I look at this with
some fascination

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.951
because there was a little
drawing of the Trieste

00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:52.600
and a watch as the next frame.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.210
And I thought, Jesus, I
didn't know about that.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.050
And I should have guessed it.

00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:00.030
I'm pretty naive
because a few months

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.940
after we made the deep
dive a package comes to me

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.950
and it's a Rolex watch.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.657
It came from
Switzerland and it said,

00:38:08.657 --> 00:38:11.115
Mr. Piccard suggested you ought
to have one of our watches.

00:38:11.115 --> 00:38:12.590
Well, that's pretty nice.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.385
So I didn't think
about it any more.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.517
It's a good story that they
built a special watch that

00:38:23.517 --> 00:38:25.739
could stand all that pressure.

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:27.405
It gives some idea
of their engineering,

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.710
their excellence in testing,
and blah, blah, blah.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.610
It's pretty good branding.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.040
And yet, if that's such a
good story, why wasn't it

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.300
in Piccard's book,
"Seven Miles Down".

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.430
He didn't put it in there.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.970
He said nothing about it.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:45.207
And so clearly he knew
he was doing wrong.

00:38:45.207 --> 00:38:47.040
And besides, he was
just a consultant to us.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.160
He had no ownership,
stake in the thing.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.480
He's a dear friend.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.260
He's deceased now.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.550
He died in November '08.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.640
But he made a mistake
there and could

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.620
have got me a lot
of trouble if it

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.220
had become general knowledge.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.650
Because you're the captain of
the ship and you run aground.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.270
Whether you're in your
cabin or whatever,

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.690
you're going to get some on you.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.290
It's just not good.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.360
OK, well that's a long
story, that thing,

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.550
but let's move ahead here.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.280
In 1963 the Trieste was
retired at the age of 10.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.160
It was beat up.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.480
It was a flying machine.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.580
Its days were ended.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.430
It's in the Navy Museum
in Washington, DC.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.630
If you're ever in
Washington, DC go down

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.172
to Washington Navy Yard.

00:39:26.172 --> 00:39:27.255
A cab will take you there.

00:39:27.255 --> 00:39:29.320
The best way to do it,
get through the. gate.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.400
And it's a wonderful museum.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.899
The Trieste is all
put back together

00:39:33.899 --> 00:39:35.940
looking a lot better than
this, but the same kind

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.000
of coloration way in the back.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.780
And there's some nice
descriptive stuff in the back.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.495
Another Trieste was built here
at Mare Island, San Francisco

00:39:43.495 --> 00:39:44.740
Bay Naval Shipyard.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.190
Trieste II.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.400
And that was
operated until 1984.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.590
So for 26 years the only
way you could get scientists

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.480
into the deepest
part of the oceans

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.420
was either with a Trieste
or the French Navy's

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.680
bathyscaph Archimedes,
or Archimede.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.150
They're all replaced then
by 20,000 foot submersibles.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.240
Why is 20,000 feet important?

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.230
Well it's because if you
look at a chart of sea floor

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.170
area versus depth, you
find that at 20,000 feet

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:22.392
you can look at 98% of the
sea floor in the world ocean.

00:40:22.392 --> 00:40:24.850
So that's roughly a little more
than half the maximum depth

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.420
of the ocean.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.780
So cost benefit, huh?

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.060
You build a submersible,
design it for that depth,

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.870
and you can get 98%
of the sea floor.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:39.220
That last 2% is between
20,000 feet and 36,000 feet.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.140
Having said that, last 2%, as
I said last week in Shanghai,

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.080
that's equivalent to
the area of China.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.430
So it's worth exploring.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:47.690
Those are the deep trenches.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.670
If we understand the fundamental
plate tectonics of the ocean

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.850
floor, you've got
spreading centers

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.510
where new sea floor
is being created.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.430
200 million years
later it's disappearing

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.990
into the deep trenches,
the subduction zone.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.140
We don't know much about
the subduction zones.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.720
The spreading center
has been studied a lot

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.290
because there are
mineral resources there,

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.600
the smokers, the
hydrothermal vents.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.030
I dove one of those
off the Azores

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.800
and your water depth's
about 9,000 feet there.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.406
It's not bad.

00:41:17.406 --> 00:41:19.280
Very interesting seeing
this whole life form.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.130
It's like visiting
another planet.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.600
That life form doesn't
even know about the sun.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.784
It's getting all of its energy
from the interior of the earth.

00:41:27.784 --> 00:41:29.700
Thermal energy from the
interior of the earth.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.240
AUDIENCE: Were you diving
with Robert Ballard?

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.198
DON WALSH: No I wasn't.

00:41:32.198 --> 00:41:36.172
I know Bob, but no, this
was actual hauling tourists.

00:41:36.172 --> 00:41:38.630
I was working with a company
called Deep Ocean Expeditions,

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.750
and we could take
into the Titanic.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.150
Took over 80 people there.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.290
About two dozen to the
Bismarck and nearly a hundred

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.745
to hydrothermal
vents in the Atlantic

00:41:47.745 --> 00:41:51.640
and off the East Pacific Rise.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.370
No, Bob wasn't with
us on that one,

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.322
but it's really fascinating.

00:41:55.322 --> 00:41:56.780
Usually halfway
through these dives

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.020
we sit down at some nice
site, get out our Russian box

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.190
lunches, have lunch and
then resume the dive.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.200
The Titanic's a 12-hour dive.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.940
So it's hour six we land on
the bridge of the Titanic,

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.020
Captain Smith was last seen.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.450
Turn on Yellow Submarine on the
player and have our sandwiches.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.180
And same thing with Bismarck.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.010
14-hour dive.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:20.620
Seven hours we land not far
from where Hitler visited.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.690
You've got pictures of Hitler
going aboard in the Baltic.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.670
And in the hydrothermal
vents, sitting right next

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.070
to one of these
smokers, watching

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.560
all of the animal life.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.470
It really is like you've
been on a spaceship

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.770
because you come from
this photosynthetic world

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:39.350
that we know up here down
to this place in the pitch

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.007
blackness.

00:42:40.007 --> 00:42:41.840
And then you come in
there, turn the lights,

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.380
and here's just like visiting
a great big party going on.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.130
There are shrimps, and
there are the crabs

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.520
that are catching the shrimps
that get in the hot water

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.050
and become scampi,
the whole thing.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:52.980
It's great.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.510
Anyway, I diverge.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:58.116
So that's pretty good.

00:42:58.116 --> 00:42:59.490
I think you're
getting the point.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:03.910
That's not an argument not
to have some deep probes.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.380
Now in my view,
the heavy lifting

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.220
is going to be done by manned
and unmanned vehicles, AUVs,

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.160
ROVs.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.010
But there will always be room
for man-- manned submersibles--

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.900
for several reasons.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.997
From the imprecise because--
like you tell your kids.

00:43:18.997 --> 00:43:19.830
Why can't I do this?

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.200
Because.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.510
To the advantage of having the
trained mind and the trained

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.390
eyes in there in certain areas.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:30.270
Yeah, OK, you say, Well ROVs got
the trained mind and eye there.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.220
It's just throwing
them both a TV camera.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.470
Yeah, but this is the view.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:38.470
You've all done scuba
diving or snorkeling.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.470
Your face mask, you don't
have peripheral vision.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:46.770
And there's a lot to be said for
that, in just having the human

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:47.990
there.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.640
But more so, when we put
the first Lunar Lander up

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.830
and it brought back some
samples from the moon,

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:55.670
I didn't go out on my
deck and look up there

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.090
and say, well done.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:03.530
But when Buzz and Neil were
up, I went out and I said,

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:04.810
there's two of me up there.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.670
I can connect with that.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:11.130
And don't ever disallow that
because the money valve is not

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:16.350
in your offices, it's on
Capitol Hill that directs money

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.040
to things we want to do.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.370
And it's the public,
an ocean aware public

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.560
that will insist that we make
national investments there.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.900
Very nice to go to Mars.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.750
I hope I'm not offending
anybody, but it's like Nero.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:29.800
Rome is burning.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.030
Here we are looking at
Mars and the water's

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:33.344
coming up around our ankles.

00:44:33.344 --> 00:44:34.760
There are some
real things we have

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.030
to do on this manned
satellite we all

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.390
live on called planet Earth.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:49.130
So in getting man under the
sea, there's that kind of thing

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:53.140
you can't quantify, but you
can say it's pretty important.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.990
Jim said it's succinctly last
year just after his dive.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.940
He said, what kid wants
to grow up to be a robot?

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.660
Well OK, to get
involved in this stuff,

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.910
designing and building robots.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.560
I'm not offending
anybody, I hope.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.640
But also personal
participation, pretty important.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.880
Not all of us, that's for
sure, but it's still important.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.980
People like us
doing these things.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:20.300
OK then this is just a catalog
of some of the 6,000 meter,

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.000
or 20,000 foot submersibles.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.400
The first was the Navy's Alvin.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.240
That was upgraded from
6,000 foot submersible

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.950
to 20,000 feet.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:29.750
It's retired.

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.040
It's at Woods Hole now.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.520
Next France came along
with the Nautile.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.590
Still operational.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:40.080
Uses a titanium pressure hull.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.730
The Russians, the
Mir 1 the Mir 2.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:46.020
As you probably know Mir is
the Russian word for peace.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.650
Plus their Navy has the
Russe and the Consul.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.850
And I've made quite a
few dives in the Mirs.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:53.970
They're very good subs.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.940
Actually they were
built in Finland

00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:00.890
because the Soviet shipyards
were too busy building warships

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.760
so they jobbed out, as they
did with their research ships

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.430
and so on.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.830
Most were built in
Eastern Europe or Finland.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.970
So the two Mirs were
built in Finland

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.710
by a company no
longer in business.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:15.980
I don't know if there's a
cause and effect or not.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:20.690
Japan came in a bit later with
their Shinkai 6,500 meters.

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:22.910
So that's 21,000 feet.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.870
So now Japan had the deepest
diving manned submersible

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.160
in the whole world.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.330
And a few years before
that I taught the Japanese,

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.400
through my consulting company,
how to drive submersibles.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:38.970
So I have kind of paternal
relationship with this project.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.440
And now of course
we've got China.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.480
That's the money shot.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.230
You probably recall
2007, the Russians

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:49.740
using the Mirs to put a Russian
flag at the real North Pole.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.930
There's a story behind that.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.990
I won't go into it, but
they didn't pay for it,

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:55.820
they didn't plan it,
they just hijacked it.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.310
They took all the credit for it.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.850
So that's what call
the money shot.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.840
That's the bow of the Titanic
is another money shot.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.940
And here's the sub.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.000
7,000 meters.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.900
Now China has the deepest
diving manned submersible

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.410
in the world, Jiaolong.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.710
And I've been
consulting with them.

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.960
[INAUDIBLE], their
ship research center,

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.880
it's like our David Taylor
Center in the United States.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.000
Ship design, ship
machinery, and so on.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.772
Tow tanks.

00:47:18.772 --> 00:47:20.480
But they got the job
and their government

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.855
to design and build and
test and operate this sub.

00:47:23.855 --> 00:47:25.480
And it's very nicely done.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.584
First manned submersible
ever built in China

00:47:27.584 --> 00:47:29.000
and they pretty
much got it right.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.660
But it took them 12 years.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:35.170
They did a nice conservative
job of evolving and developing

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.460
this thing and it's
operating very well now

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.610
in support of their
interests-- their governments

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:44.340
interests in ocean mining

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.561
OK, four programs right now.

00:47:46.561 --> 00:47:48.060
They're doing the
deep diving thing.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.400
Of course you you're all
aware of Jim's program.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.180
I was on his
expedition last year.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.360
He did a smart thing.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.780
Look at the direction that
this submersible's going.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.110
It's vertical, isn't it?

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.312
Not horizontally.

00:48:00.312 --> 00:48:01.770
But all the
submersibles I've shown

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.500
you are oriented horizontally
so when you're going down you've

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.610
got some resistance.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.090
Hydrodynamically
not the best shape.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:10.920
He uses a spar buoy.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.550
That's the direction of travel.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:14.840
It's a very efficient
diving shape.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.660
The water line on this
thing is about right there

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.630
when it's on the surface.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.190
Heaps of batteries in here,
lithium cell batteries.

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:23.240
12 thrusters.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.905
The actual spherical
cabin is right there.

00:48:25.905 --> 00:48:29.050
Then there are arms that poke
out with TV cameras and lights.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.340
As you can imagine, Jim had
the best of cameras on there.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.370
Shooting 3D, by the way.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.120
And then the same thing,
you get to the sea floor

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.670
and they want to come back
up, these are steel weights

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.560
that he can shuck off and
the sub comes back up.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:48.610
When he made his dive
in April of last year,

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.970
he got to the sea floor, I
think it was in 90 minutes

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.140
and he got back
up in 70 minutes.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.240
And he spent two or three
hours on the sea floor.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.990
It's a very efficient
way of doing things.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.250
Here are the two subs in scale.

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:06.470
His on the right, of course,
and mine to the left.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.307
And I had the good opportunity
to be the last person

00:49:09.307 --> 00:49:11.431
to see him before he dove
and the first person when

00:49:11.431 --> 00:49:12.386
he came up.

00:49:12.386 --> 00:49:14.970
That's Suzy, his wife, there.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.450
And all I said was,
good luck and have fun.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.630
And we came back up I
said, welcome to the club.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:23.830
There's just two of us in the
world now, it's myself and Jim.

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.955
But it was nice, you know?

00:49:24.955 --> 00:49:25.740
Half century.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.300
I never thought
I'd see this again.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.910
So it was quite an honor
to be part of his program.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.120
Actually I signed a
non-disclosure agreement

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.705
with him in '93 when he
first started this project,

00:49:36.705 --> 00:49:39.010
but he didn't tell me
much over those years.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:41.280
And it was only the
beginning of last year

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.156
that I got heavily
involved in this program.

00:49:43.156 --> 00:49:44.780
So there you see it
floating vertically

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.180
in its normal
operating position.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.030
Zodiac boat up there, divers.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:51.960
They put in the water
with salvage bags.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.050
These are like inflatable
balloons, if you will,

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.330
that are hooked to the side.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.880
Because it's launched
horizontally, than it

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.870
erects into the
vertical position.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:04.160
There's the viewport
that he's got,

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.510
two cameras and light
booms sticking out.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:12.750
And then they cut these free
and the sub starts down.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.480
Those were not stowaways.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.950
Rolex decided, well
half a century later,

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.780
let's demonstrate consistency,
engineering excellence, design,

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.960
blah, blah, blah.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.180
And look at what they did.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.470
I think this is remarkable.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.990
Flat crystal.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:31.070
The pressure on that thing,
eight tons per square inch.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.820
They tested at 50,000 feet.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.730
They made five of them,
of all five passed.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:36.710
All five went to Guam with Jim.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.900
And there it is on the wrist.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.090
That's his manipulator.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:44.030
There's the watch right there
on the wrist of the manipulator.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.800
National Geographic and
Rolex were the two sponsors.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.550
They may have been in for about
$30 million, I'm not sure.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:55.490
The sub made 16 dives, so
the unit cost per drive

00:50:55.490 --> 00:51:01.020
is-- brings tears to your eyes.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.200
And there we are comparing.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.158
They brought one of the
old ladies out to Guam.

00:51:04.158 --> 00:51:07.580
So I've got the replica of the
old lady here, a model of mine.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.850
There's his in the shipping
position, horizontally.

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:14.520
And there's his new watch.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.960
And there being launched.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.890
You can see the salvage
bags, the pillows here

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.040
that help it float.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.860
And then they cut
these loose and then

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.240
it erects into the
vertical position.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.750
He gave it to Woods
Hole I don't believe

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.477
it's going to operate again.

00:51:28.477 --> 00:51:29.810
They keep claiming that it will.

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.180
He gave them an
endowment of $1 million,

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.520
but Woods Hole risk
management people

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.610
aren't going to let any of their
scientists dive in this thing.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.180
Because in my view, with
all due respect Chris,

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:46.080
I think one person subs are
a dead end line of evolution.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.980
Multitasking, we all know,
doesn't work so good.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.315
There have been
psychiatric studies where

00:51:53.315 --> 00:51:56.080
it shows if you
try and multitask,

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.746
your efficiency goes
down between 20% and 30%

00:51:59.746 --> 00:52:02.630
of both things
you're trying to do.

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.700
And so to fly these
things is a full time job.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:08.357
And to be a scientist,
full time job.

00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:10.440
If you take one of these
things and you kit it out

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.620
with all kinds of
remote instrumentation

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.580
and samplers so the pilot has
to fly, what have you got?

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.020
You've got an AUV
with a man in it.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.410
Where's the game?

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:20.320
I don't see it.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.320
Maybe Chris will be able
to convince me someday.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.610
And here he is, folks.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.440
Hold your applause.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.287
Richard Branson and
Chris got together.

00:52:31.287 --> 00:52:32.870
Chris actually bought
the sub and then

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.810
talked Richard into joining him.

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:38.040
That's before the divorced.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.890
And then this is basically
an underwater flying machine.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.020
Graham Hawkes, the inventor
up in Richmond, California

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.920
came up with this original
concept of deep flight.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.960
My Japanese friends
call it Deep Fright

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.620
and I don't know if that's
just a speech impediment

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.966
or is Freudian.

00:52:57.966 --> 00:52:59.340
I haven't quite
figured that out.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:02.380
But anyway there is
flying underwater.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.230
This is pretty much
what it will look like.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:07.150
Another drawing of it.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:09.190
The pilot lies down.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.360
This is the axis of
the cabin itself.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.440
So it's a cylinder with a
transparent dome on this end

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.145
and a solid dome on the other.

00:53:16.145 --> 00:53:18.270
Batteries and all the other
stuff in the back here.

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:20.780
Propellers, flight
controls, and so on.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:23.300
And you can see Chris
is a very large person,

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.370
and so when he gets
into that thing,

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.960
they have to take a
slight vacuum to pull him

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.900
into the tube and
then pressurize it.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.790
It reminds me of those
things in the circus,

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.250
you know, the cannon where
you fire the guy out.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.260
We strap him down, so
when they pressurize

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:43.952
the inside to get him out,
he doesn't go too far.

00:53:43.952 --> 00:53:45.410
There's another
company in Florida,

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:47.080
Vero Beach, Florida,
called Triton,

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.450
and they're going to go
with a glass pressure hull.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:54.200
And there's a company in the
San Diego area called Rayotek

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:58.280
that has figured out a scheme
that you can use glass and keep

00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.410
it from being scratched.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:01.790
Because as we all know,
any scratch on glass

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:05.000
is a stress concentrator
and that's not a good idea.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.461
Whereas with acrylic, you
can sandpaper it and gouge it

00:54:07.461 --> 00:54:08.835
with a knife and
you're not going

00:54:08.835 --> 00:54:10.001
to compromise its integrity.

00:54:10.001 --> 00:54:11.810
You may not be able
to see too well,

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:13.790
but it's not going
to be weakened.

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:15.365
But you scratch
glass, immediately

00:54:15.365 --> 00:54:18.740
you've got a stress
puncture and a real problem.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.202
Glass, of course, gets
stronger with depth.

00:54:21.202 --> 00:54:22.660
So there's a lot
to be said for it.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.940
Theory and practice, folks.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.980
My first remark
when I started out.

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.590
Laboratory curiosity.

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:29.904
Apparently Rayotek, the
company down in San Diego area,

00:54:29.904 --> 00:54:32.070
figured out a way that you
can do it that will work.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:33.240
So stay tuned.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.200
I was told a month ago
that the Triton Submarine

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.380
company has gotten
initial funding.

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.290
So they're moving
ahead with this.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.370
And finally, the
fourth one is China.

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.170
They call this the
Ocean Challenger.

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:49.550
Could be probably 2020.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:51.900
They're trying to get into
the next five year plan.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.350
And this will be an
11,000 meter submersible.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:56.430
Here are the specs.

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:57.970
Nothing particularly different.

00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:01.810
Two people, except
that's not three but two.

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.300
Weight and so on.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.050
That's really not
worth focusing on.

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:06.720
So there it is.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.610
That's the mantra of the day.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.770
Taking the trained mind
and the trained eyes

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:11.800
into the great depths.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.669
However, there have
been unmanned vehicles

00:55:13.669 --> 00:55:15.960
that have been down to the
Challenger Deep, the deepest

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.170
place in the ocean.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:20.050
The first was Kaiko, the
Japanese word for trench.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:23.800
Went down in 1995 and 1998.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.690
Quite successful.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:28.460
Regrettably, on a shallower
dive on the slopes of the Japan

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:32.220
trench, the umbilical
came up with no vehicle

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.980
on the other end.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.320
It somehow got away.

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.060
Now all of these
vehicles are kitted out

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.550
with strobe lights, acoustic
beacons, radio beacons,

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:42.180
everything you can think
of and bright yellow paint.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.350
No one's ever found it.

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:45.840
My theory is that
there's a fishing

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.200
village on the coast of
China, and the head man

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.239
has this most
interesting coffee table.

00:55:51.239 --> 00:55:52.280
That's why he's head man.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.905
He's got something
nobody else has got.

00:55:53.905 --> 00:55:57.630
And it makes very agreeable
noises and lights,

00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:59.260
discotheque sort of thing.

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.520
Because it would have floated.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.020
And it would have
floated somewhere.

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:03.940
No one's ever seen it.

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:07.020
AUDIENCE: What if
Godzilla ate it?

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.180
DON WALSH: Well Godzilla
may have done that.

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:13.270
Maybe we get one of the
puppies if it mated with it.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:20.410
The thing here is that was a
14 kilometer fiberoptic tether.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.516
Very expensive, very
exotic to build.

00:56:22.516 --> 00:56:24.140
In fact, they had to
build two of them.

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.430
The first one they
didn't quite get it

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:28.070
finished and it was flawed.

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:29.550
And so they just re-terminated.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:35.450
So I think it's maybe a
26,000 foot submersible now.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:37.200
It can't go the full
depth because they

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.729
had to chop off part of it.

00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:39.770
They built a new vehicle.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.920
That was a $17 million problem.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.140
Now the next and the
last one was Woods Hole,

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.945
where the HROV, Hybrid ROV.

00:56:48.945 --> 00:56:53.730
It can be an ROV tethered or
it can be an AUV untethered.

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:56.250
And so at the lower
right hand side

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.452
you see the final
version of the Nereus,

00:56:59.452 --> 00:57:00.660
which is what they called it.

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:04.532
And I think was 2009 when it
dove to the Challenger Deep.

00:57:04.532 --> 00:57:06.240
And it seems to be a
pretty good vehicle.

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.760
Right now working off Eric
Schmidt's ship, Falkor,

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.740
in the Caribbean.

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.224
So it's being kept busy.

00:57:13.224 --> 00:57:14.890
I don't know if they're
going to go back

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.640
to Challenger
Deep-- if and when.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.990
I'm not on their mailing list.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.730
That's it, folks.

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.190
I came out right on an hour
because we started five minutes

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.690
late.

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.200
You may be thinking, jeez, this
guy never comes up for air.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:32.570
I give you back one minute.

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:33.200
Thank you.

00:57:42.074 --> 00:57:44.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I just
wanted to thank you very much,

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:45.640
Don, for coming.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.810
And maybe we can take
a couple of questions

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:50.162
for those who can stay.

00:57:50.162 --> 00:57:53.580
DON WALSH: Yeah, I'm
not put off by people

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.260
getting up and walking out.

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.210
I've been doing this for a long
time and I'm quite used to it.

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:00.340
I did a high school
in Tyler, Texas once

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.540
and I asked the principal
how long, he told me.

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.620
And I thought, OK,
I'll stick right on it.

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.760
It's like salami, you just
slice off as much as they need.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.100
But about halfway
through a lot of bells

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.846
rang and my whole audience
got up and walked out.

00:58:13.846 --> 00:58:15.220
It was the end of
the school day.

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.770
They had their priorities.

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.790
That's why they're in Texas.

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:20.290
Yes, sir.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:21.980
AUDIENCE: Is it an
incremental challenge

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:25.360
to go from 20,000 to 35,000
feet engineering wise,

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.542
or is there something that
comes up at 25,000 feet

00:58:28.542 --> 00:58:30.430
that requires a whole
different approach?

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:32.930
DON WALSH: His question was
is it an incremental challenge

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:36.840
to go, say, from 25,000
to 35,000, 36,000 feet.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.930
In my view, no.

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:41.520
I ask Woods Hole about that
when they're upgrading Alvins.

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.020
You may know Alvin
is being upgraded

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:49.990
from 14,500 feet, something like
that, too about 24,000 feet.

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:54.320
It'll be the second deepest
diving manned submersible.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.480
Thing is, they got
Lockheed Martin involved

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.310
and all the money got spent.

00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:02.440
So what you've got now is
you've got a 24,000 foot

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:07.490
cabin in a 14,000 foot sub
because all their peripherals--

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:10.080
because you have other
pressure vessels in there

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.515
for the batteries
and controllers,

00:59:11.515 --> 00:59:12.390
and things like that.

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:14.310
And they couldn't
upgrade the whole sub.

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.170
And probably syntactic
foam, I don't know.

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:18.810
But anyway, they spent
the whole $25 million

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:22.410
or whatever it was and never
got the thing finished.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:25.034
I suspect some year
they'll do that.

00:59:25.034 --> 00:59:26.200
But I asked them about this.

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.780
Well, why not just
go the full depth?

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.210
You don't have to
do it every day,

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:31.737
but if you want to go
into the deep trenches

00:59:31.737 --> 00:59:32.820
you've got the capability.

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.490
Because most of
the deep trenches,

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:37.770
between 28,000 and
36,000 feet, there's

00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:42.100
not that much difference between
the deep places in the ocean.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.980
And that would be an awfully
nice capability to have.

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.080
And they said, well ho
and hum about technical,

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.880
and we can't-- I listened to
what they said and I still

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.000
can't see the difference.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.950
Your problem is pressure.

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:01.200
You've got to make a
robust hull, you've

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.070
got to have electric
power, whether it's

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:07.950
for 25,000 or 36,000 feet,
you want as much as you get.

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:11.210
And with these new batteries
that are coming out-- again,

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.920
that's the march of material
science-- you can do that.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.450
So that's a constant.

01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:22.080
The only delta I can see is
the thickness of the hull.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.820
Titanium, something like that.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.960
I don't understand
it, so I say no.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.850
There's no real difference.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:30.272
It will be cost difference.

01:00:30.272 --> 01:00:32.730
And of course every one of
these has to have a mother ship.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.670
It's even better if you have
a dedicated mother ship.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:38.820
The two Mirs have a
ship called the Keldysh,

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.290
that's all it does.

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:43.300
Basically Atlantis, they claim
it's an oceanographic ship,

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.260
but it's pretty much
dedicated to Alvin.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.460
By the way, they're
in San Francisco now,

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.200
or maybe San Diego.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.550
Before they did the sea
trial on the new hull,

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:54.360
they just sent it all out here.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.050
And they were in
Astoria, and then they

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:57.652
were supposed to be
in San Francisco,

01:00:57.652 --> 01:00:59.360
and then they're going
down to San Diego.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.450
And sometime along
the west coast here

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:04.250
they'll do their actual
acceptance trials.

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.680
Alvin is owned by
the Navy so they

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.730
have some pretty high standards
about what they have to do.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:10.590
Yes, sir.

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:13.416
AUDIENCE: You talked a bit about
going down to the [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:16.148
and stuff like that
and all the life forms

01:01:16.148 --> 01:01:18.350
and all this activity
happening there.

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:22.384
And the minerals and stuff like
that that make it worthwhile.

01:01:22.384 --> 01:01:23.848
What about going
into the trenches?

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:25.312
What do you see down there?

01:01:25.312 --> 01:01:27.752
And what is it that's so
interesting about going

01:01:27.752 --> 01:01:30.676
to those depths?

01:01:30.676 --> 01:01:33.050
DON WALSH: It's not going to
be a very satisfying answer.

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:37.730
And that is it's what we
don't know is why we go.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:42.100
Jim made a very successful
dive in the Bismarck Trench

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.130
at Papua New Guinea,
about 27,000 feet.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:47.350
That's when he
lifted the embargo

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:48.860
on the design of
his sub and what

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.110
they were going to do with it.

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:52.068
He didn't want a lot of
press piling in on him.

01:01:52.068 --> 01:01:54.440
There were only 30
people in his project.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.560
Also the embarrassment.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.500
When you're a very
high visibility person

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.260
and you fail at something,
everybody says, you see,

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.920
Hollywood guy showboating
and trying to buy his way in,

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.795
and blah, blah, blah.

01:02:03.795 --> 01:02:06.090
That's of course not
true in Jim's case.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:08.720
Nevertheless, at that
dive he brought up

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.170
quite a bit of bottom
sediments from that trench.

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:18.120
And we had a staff of, I
believe, 13 scientists aboard.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.000
Mostly from Scripp, and
another ship with us

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.125
inappropriately
called Barracuda.

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:26.900
It should have been The Gummy
Bear or something like that.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.880
It was pretty bad.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.880
And so we had biologists,
benthic biologists, geologists,

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.910
and so on with us.

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:36.730
And they were really
excited about getting

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:38.530
these sediment
samples of microbes.

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:41.770
They're finding there new stuff
that we didn't know about.

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:45.360
And really keen to go back
to the deepest trenches

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.830
and do more of this work.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:50.650
As far as large
critters are concerned,

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:53.300
probably not because the
further you get from land,

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.360
the more sterile the ocean gets.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.182
It's because of
lack of nutrients.

01:02:57.182 --> 01:02:58.890
Most of the nutrients
are being flushed--

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.110
organic, inorganic
nutrients-- from land.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.290
So the coastal zone,
continental shelf

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:06.060
is where you really
hit pay dirt.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:11.570
And then a little bit over,
say, the continental crest

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:14.750
down in the deep ocean,
slope into the deep ocean.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.740
So 200 miles off
land, not so great.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:19.600
Sort of a desert.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600
There's life everywhere.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.180
You get all the invertebrates.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.870
The shrimps, the jellies, things
like that, and bioluminesence,

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.495
when you've got the
light's turned out,

01:03:29.495 --> 01:03:30.440
things sparkling away.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.320
But compared to what you see
the coastal ocean it's not much.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.250
There is, as you
probably know, they

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.330
did some really
wonderful photography

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:42.690
of the giant squid recently
from a submersible.

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:44.480
Really good stuff.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.320
But just when you think
you've seen it all,

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.530
when you've seen
the movie, they've

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.460
determined that there is a
colossal squid because they've

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.759
seen some of these bits of these
things drift up on beaches.

01:03:56.759 --> 01:03:58.300
They haven't seen
one in [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.410
The wonderful imagery they got
recently of the giant squid

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:02.220
was in [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.803
They put out bait
from the submersible

01:04:03.803 --> 01:04:05.150
and it came in and took.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:06.730
And got comfortable
with the lights,

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:07.855
it was just hanging around.

01:04:07.855 --> 01:04:09.520
It was really something.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.820
So I think probably a
lot of the discoveries

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.810
will be in the microbiology
and microplankton area

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.220
and what's contained
in those sediments.

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.830
Regrettably, on Jim's
dive in the Challenger

01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:29.390
Deep-- and it's Murphy's Law.

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:31.840
He had just started to
pick up samples, sediment.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.210
He had core tubes so he could
push them into the bottom,

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.700
bring them up, and then
he had a little cupboard

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.552
where he could sequester them.

01:04:39.552 --> 01:04:42.010
Because as you come back up,
you've got a lot of turbulence

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:42.740
around the sub.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.031
And you just flush it all
out so you lose your samples.

01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:48.170
So that was all designed into
that to protect this stuff.

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:50.790
And he was just reaching
out for another one and one

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:52.620
the hydraulic hoses broke.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.180
Now arthritis sets in,
the manipulator's here.

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.710
He can't shut the door to
the cupboard, if you will,

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:02.730
and he can't take samples.

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:06.560
And it was is a $50 hose that
screwed up a billion dollar

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.060
project.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.893
We see it all the time
in the space program.

01:05:08.893 --> 01:05:10.450
Standard stuff.

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:14.780
Pressure tested,
qualified by the vendor,

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.240
and tested again by
Jim and his team.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.430
Just a simple hydraulic hose.

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:21.670
And that crippled that mission.

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:23.720
Then due to
programming errors, he

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.680
had 12 thrusters and
11 of them shut down.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.654
So all he could do is circle,
make circles on the sea floor.

01:05:31.654 --> 01:05:32.320
And that was it.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.680
So it was not a very
productive dive.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.290
But the one in Bismarck
trench was very productive.

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:42.060
And what was his name?

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.200
Wake up.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.020
The guy at Scripps.

01:05:48.075 --> 01:05:49.075
AUDIENCE: Doug Bartlett.

01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:49.330
DON WALSH: Doug Bartlett.

01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.387
Thank you.

01:05:50.387 --> 01:05:52.470
Doug's doing some good
work and some of his papers

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.260
will be out soon.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.410
And we do hope to go back.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.020
If not with manned
system, unmanned system.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.909
We the ocean community, not me.

01:06:01.909 --> 01:06:03.450
I don't know if
that's a good answer,

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:06.570
but the top answer
is we go there

01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:09.300
because we don't
know what we'll find.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.690
That's the nature
of exploration.

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:15.030
I define exploration as
curiosity acted upon.

01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:17.362
We're all curious about stuff
we run into all the time.

01:06:17.362 --> 01:06:19.320
Oh that's interesting,
I wonder how that works.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.653
But if you don't follow up
on it, find out how it works,

01:06:21.653 --> 01:06:24.530
why it works, then
you're not an explorer.

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.460
I think little
kids are explorers.

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.645
We're all genetically
programmed that way.

01:06:28.645 --> 01:06:30.770
You see them in their
mother's arms looking around.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:32.240
When they're big
enough to run around.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.198
they're taking the gum
off the bottom the table

01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:36.750
in a restaurant and
they're exploring that way.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:40.660
But somehow that the hormones
and peer pressures in the teens

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.380
beat out of most of us.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:47.880
A lot of us don't persist as
explores until our adult years.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.465
See I don't use
the term explorer

01:06:49.465 --> 01:06:52.250
as climbing the highest
or diving to the deepest.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:56.500
It's curious people learning
how things work on our planet.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.970
And even if you're
not a scientist,

01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:01.891
it's so important to be curious
about the world around you.

01:07:01.891 --> 01:07:02.390
Yes sir.

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:04.238
AUDIENCE: What do you see
as interesting developments

01:07:04.238 --> 01:07:05.624
in the next 10 or 25 years?

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:10.050
DON WALSH: I think
what we're going

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:14.070
to see is the development
of, sort of the subject

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:17.820
I've been talking about, is
a manned submersible system.

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.860
We can't look at these
things as individual units.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:21.780
It's a whole system.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.870
That's the mother ship.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.990
You should have an ROV along
that has the same depth

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:29.280
capability so if the
sub gets in trouble

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.510
you've got on-board assistance.

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:34.810
The model that appeals to me is
the deep sea drilling project

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:38.210
where a specially
configured drilling

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:41.995
ship is doing these very
deep geological cores all

01:07:41.995 --> 01:07:42.870
over the world ocean.

01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:45.980
World Ocean Drilling Program.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:51.280
And that ship was built by
the United States, operated

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.860
by the National
Science Foundation.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.516
But we sell tickets
to any investigator

01:07:55.516 --> 01:07:56.390
that wants to use it.

01:07:56.390 --> 01:08:00.200
So even during the Cold War
we had Soviet geoscientists

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.870
out on the ship because
they could buy certain legs.

01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:08.560
You publish the ship's schedule
a year or two in advance

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.760
and then if that's an area
where you really want to work,

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.370
you apply to get
time on that ship.

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:20.407
I can see that model for a full
ocean depth submersible system.

01:08:20.407 --> 01:08:22.490
Of course you couldn't do
anything less than that,

01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:27.029
but it would be a live-aboard
mother ship, an ROV system,

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:30.859
and other required
scientific instrumentation.

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:33.140
And it would be available
as an international asset.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.931
I don't think you'd
need more than a couple

01:08:34.931 --> 01:08:37.580
of systems of that sort
to do the trenches.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.840
You don't have to have one,
every country has to own it.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.640
Just like the deep
sea drilling ships.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.381
Pretty much that one
system was the only one

01:08:46.381 --> 01:08:49.620
for 90% of the life
of this program.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.470
Now Japan has one called
Chikyu and the Russians

01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:57.310
keep promising to build one,
but it never seems to happen.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:59.961
So there's at least
two in the world now.

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:00.460
Yes, sir.

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.609
AUDIENCE: India has one.

01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:04.193
DON WALSH: India has one?

01:09:04.193 --> 01:09:05.859
Well, it probably ran
aground somewhere.

01:09:05.859 --> 01:09:06.574
AUDIENCE: No.

01:09:06.574 --> 01:09:08.740
Beautiful. [INAUDIBLE] built
it, so there are three.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.170
DON WALSH: Is that right?

01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:09.920
OK, three of them.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.660
India And with respect
to investigating

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.720
the deep trenches, the
thing we're not doing now,

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.260
I still think there's going
to be a lot of heavy lifting

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:23.460
that's going to be done
by unmanned vehicles.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.819
The problem here is that
if we agree that about 90%

01:09:26.819 --> 01:09:29.840
of the world ocean is
unexplored in terms

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.630
of having pretty complete
knowledge of this environment,

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:36.069
that's a big job left to do.

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:38.790
There is not enough money
and all the treasuries

01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:42.380
of the world to bill
fleets of research ships

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.510
that can undertake that
90% of the world ocean.

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:48.640
And even if you could
build that many ships,

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.810
there's not enough
universities in the world

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:55.190
that you could populate them
with trained scientists.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.500
So how do we get around that?

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.400
And I think any AUVs,
autonomous unmanned vehicles,

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.010
machines that can
do dumb science.

01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:06.130
That is, where you don't
require a human presence.

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:08.360
You save the ships
for the kind of work

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.430
requires human presence
at the work site.

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:14.720
So I think that AUVs
that can be programmed

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.140
to do surveys, data taking
over long periods of time

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:19.970
autonomously.

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:22.810
We're talking months,
maybe, on a mission.

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:25.480
Coming up, transmitting,
data, satellite, back down.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.190
You could probably do that.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.400
In fact, one of Eric
Schmidt's companies,

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.970
[INAUDIBLE] Rick Rakowski
there has actually

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:36.120
calculated how many AUVs
he feels could do the world

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.980
ocean, that 90%. 's pretty
exciting stuff, isn't it?

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.460
That these little satellites
all over the world ocean

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:43.800
gathering this data.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.090
Because we can handle the data.

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:48.280
Modern computational
systems can handle it.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.620
It's just actually getting those
numbers and bringing them in.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:56.180
And I think that's pretty
exciting next 10 to 20 years.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.900
Chris, can you
briefly say briefly

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.170
say what you see the
next 10 or 20 years?

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.950
CHRIS WELSH: Hopefully our
project is going to open up.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:07.352
DON WALSH: Oh dear.

01:11:07.352 --> 01:11:09.060
MALE SPEAKER: Say
what he's doing.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.900
DON WALSH: Tell us what
you're doing, Chris.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.660
CHRIS WELSH: You saw this,
Don, but the one thing

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.710
I think we bring to the
table that's unusual

01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:16.994
is 20 kilometers of
range on the sea floor

01:11:16.994 --> 01:11:18.410
once we get down there.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:22.444
So that's a lot more exploration
than we're capable of doing.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.235
Beyond that, though,
I would agree with Don

01:11:24.235 --> 01:11:26.160
that the autonomous
and ROV world

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.520
is what it's going to be
because of the dollars.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.245
You can do so much
more with AUVs.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.280
One thing, we talked
about it, but satellites,

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.850
drones, all that, you have
full satellite communication.

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:46.610
[INAUDIBLE] high bandwidth.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:52.350
Down there, full ocean depth,
you're talking sub-2,000

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.960
bandwidth.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.640
It's nothing.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.170
So you're text messaging
your controls to your AUV.

01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:58.690
And you're not
getting back video.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.689
You're not getting
back pictures.

01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:04.028
It's a much more challenging
AUV problem than a drone

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:07.161
because you can't jump in and
repurpose it immediately and do

01:12:07.161 --> 01:12:10.230
things you'd like to do.

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.230
The physics of that are
not going to get better.

01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:19.220
And the fiberoptic
links are as complicated

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.250
in and of themselves as the AUV.

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:25.484
So do you want to try and have
a fiberoptic length on that--

01:12:25.484 --> 01:12:27.025
IPHONE: I don't know
what that means.

01:12:27.025 --> 01:12:32.680
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.821
CHRIS WELSH: Anyway, so having
an AUV that's really bright

01:12:36.821 --> 01:12:38.870
is the key.
