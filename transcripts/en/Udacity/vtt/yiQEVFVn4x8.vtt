00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.899
Okay so, we've looked at the CSS, we've looked at the HTML files.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:04.520
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.316
&gt;&gt; But there's a lot more going on in here. So how,

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:11.350
I mean, how do you think about approaching a new program like this?

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.520
&gt;&gt; Well, so there's always going to be some

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.640
files, these guys that have a point of

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.090
for, of being there but they aren't really

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.320
essential to understanding the functionality of the program.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; So, I sort of ignore those guys and go straight for the,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.520
you know, the things that really change

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.880
how the program looks and how it operates.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.130
&gt;&gt; So, if we look here in the JavaScript, we'll see a bunch of, a bunch of files

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.480
including some that are, you know, sort of less

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.030
useful when it comes to understanding how the programs works.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.250
&gt;&gt; Okay. So like, here we are in the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.306
JavaScript file we have here. Add in frame, underscore poly-fill.

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:50.730
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this, this guy isn't really going to give

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.880
you a lot of information about how the game functions.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.400
&gt;&gt; How do you know that?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.600
&gt;&gt; You can just sort of look. There's not really a lot happening here that has

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.980
to do with, like, the tiles on the,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.820
on the page moving around or anything like that.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.050
It's just sort of something you have to get a feel for. So this, this guy

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.200
seems to be doing something, it's creating a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770
game manager, which sounds like something to do with

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.710
the game. So that's probably defined in here.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, and looks like it is.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.790
&gt;&gt; And it looks like this guy has a lot of functions that do

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.055
stuff with the game. So this, this is probably a good place to start looking.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:29.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.660
&gt;&gt; At what the overall structure of the program looks like.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.090
&gt;&gt; And then just keep going from

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.640
there until you're satisfied that you understand

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.600
things? Okay, so I know you took some time to make a pretty thing.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.100
I want to pull it up. I'm lying. This is my handwriting. I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.920
did it for you, sorry. [LAUGH] But these are the big, these are

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.450
the big files that you were, the most important in terms of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.190
function of the game. The index, the main file, the whole JavaScript folder.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.210
&gt;&gt; With a couple of exceptions. Yeah.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.550
&gt;&gt; Things that weren't quite as important.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.020
&gt;&gt; The poly fill functions

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.490
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.580
&gt;&gt; Or files especially. And then these seven, these seven files so if, if

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.770
you were going to do, I am sorry these seven JavaScript files, yeah. So if

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.030
we were going to add an Undo button, I mean,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.744
where is the majority of the work going to take place?

00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:14.176
Would it be in the Index, would it be in

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:18.270
the Main, or would it be somewhere in these JavaScript files?
