00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:02.357
Sal: Let's now think about what it means

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:04.528
to add and subtract complex numbers.

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:07.218
Let's say I have a complex number A and

00:00:07.218 --> 00:00:12.608
let's say that it's equal to three plus two I.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.377
And let's say I have complex number B that

00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:22.661
is equal to negative one minus three I.

00:00:23.203 --> 00:00:25.844
Let's think about what it means to add A and B.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:29.016
Let's say I have a third complex number that is C,

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:32.595
that is defined as A plus B.

00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:35.255
I encourage you to pause this video and think about

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:37.642
it on your own what A plus B is going to be.

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:40.709
What we can do is, this is going to be

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:44.642
equal to three plus two I, that's A.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.422
Three plus two I.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:57.422
Plus B, which is plus negative one minus three I.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:58.996
We could write it like that if we want to

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.496
really be clear what B is and what A is.

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:05.991
How would we actually add these two together?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.573
We can't add a real part to a complex part, that's why this is-

00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:12.885
Or we can't add a real part to an imaginary part I should

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.339
say, that's why this is about as simplified as you can get.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.228
But I can add real part to real part and

00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:19.214
imaginary part to imaginary part.

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:23.073
I can add the three to the negative one

00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:25.981
to get three plus negative one is two,

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:27.635
so I get a real part now of two.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.433
Then I can add the two imaginary parts.

00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:37.731
If I have two I minus three I,

00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:41.764
that's going to be negative one I,

00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:44.628
or I could say that's going to be negative I.

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.389
Just like that I added the two real parts,

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:51.710
added the two imaginary parts and I got two minus I.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.080
We could also visualize this on the complex plane.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.383
You could do that using an Argand diagram.

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:01.581
In an Argand diagram we represent each of these

00:02:01.803 --> 00:02:05.221
complex numbers as vectors on the complex plane.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:11.301
That's our imaginary axis and this is our real axis.

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:21.084
A is three plus two I, so one, two, three along the

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:23.916
real axis and then two along the imaginary axis.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:26.287
The imaginary part is two, two I.

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:28.457
Three plus two I gets us right over there.

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:32.878
I'm going to represent that as a vector, as a vector where

00:02:32.878 --> 00:02:37.289
its tail is at the origin and its head is at the coordinates

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.050
three on the real axis, two on the imaginary axis.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.901
That right there on my Argand diagram

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:52.035
is my representation of vector A.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.458
Now let's do the same thing for vector B.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.585
It is negative one along the real axis and

00:02:57.585 --> 00:03:00.817
negative three along the imaginary axis.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.974
One, two, three. This takes us right over there.

00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:07.535
If we represent it as a vector,

00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:11.952
our complex number B can be visualized this way.

00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:16.616
Now when we add A plus B you can add them the

00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:18.948
exact same way that you would add vectors.

00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:21.836
You take the tail of B, or you could,

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:23.288
you essentially shift B over.

00:03:23.288 --> 00:03:25.027
You take the tail of B and you put it at

00:03:25.027 --> 00:03:28.461
the head of A, but it's the same thing.

00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:31.242
You go down three and you go to the left one.

00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:36.701
It's going to put your right over here.

00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:39.221
All I've done is shifted B over to this

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.952
part so that its tail is at the head of A.

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:44.293
It goes right over there.

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:48.387
This is complex number B.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.737
This is B right over here.

00:03:50.977 --> 00:03:53.838
Notice, now if we start at the tail of A and

00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:57.009
go to the head of this shifted B this right over here

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.040
is going to be vector C, this is going to be A plus B.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.920
This vector right over here is C.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.134
Notice C is two minus I.

00:04:05.717 --> 00:04:08.338
Two real part, negative one imaginary part.

00:04:08.338 --> 00:04:12.399
This right over here is C, which is A plus B.

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:14.228
You were able to add these two complex numbers.

00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:16.293
You can visualize adding them the same

00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:19.418
way that you would visualize adding two

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.850
vectors in the traditional coordinate plane.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.790
It makes complete sense because when you're adding these

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.233
complex numbers you're keeping the real part separate and

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:31.614
these are essentially the horizontal components of the vector,

00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:33.915
and you're keeping the imaginary part separate and

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:37.555
that's essentially the vertical parts of these vectors.
