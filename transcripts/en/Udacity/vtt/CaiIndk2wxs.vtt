00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.140
Now that you know how to test your
game it's time to think about

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.020
how you can get your game noticed.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.610
&gt;&gt; App stores house hundreds
of thousands of apps

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.520
with more being added each day.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.420
So how can your game stand out?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.630
&gt;&gt; The first thing that potential
players notice is what your game looks

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.730
like, based on the icon and
screenshots in the app store.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.970
&gt;&gt; And it's also important to
have a descriptive name, so

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.600
people have an idea of what your game
is about as soon as they see it.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.940
&gt;&gt; This section will be all about how
to optimize your app store presence

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.910
by designing everything from your
game icon to its description.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.370
&gt;&gt; Then you'll be ready
to submit your app.
