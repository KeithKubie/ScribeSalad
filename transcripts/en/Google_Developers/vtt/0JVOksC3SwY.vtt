[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.350
TONY KUCHIO: Buymore is an
electronic student discount

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.540
card that uses the near
field communication

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.120
technology to issue discounts
to students in high school

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.300
and university.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.960
Buymore has 6,000
users, currently.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.170
And it's across three different
universities in Kenya.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.776
And we're looking
to expand it further

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.742
towards the end of the year.

00:00:27.742 --> 00:00:29.950
JOHN OPIO: Well, in how we
started in the first three

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.580
months, we actually
gave out 1,000 cards

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.740
for free, just to
let the students get

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.520
a feel of the concept of getting
a discount at a favorite brand.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.560
And so from that moment
is when we were also

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.150
collecting feedback
on what other places

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.770
they might want to go.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.750
With NFC, we feel that it
cuts across-- at least,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930
in terms of
application and usage,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.780
you can be able to do
a number of things.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.180
With us, from
identification, or just,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.390
maybe, tapping to check
your credit or tapping to

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.560
top-up your card.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.010
And so we feel
that it's something

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.290
that we can scale to
other uses as well.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.440
TONY KUCHIO: And
also, moving forward,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.540
we're looking at a future
where you don't necessarily

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.260
need to have a Buymore card.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.250
So say, if you have an NFC
phone, all you'd need to do

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.000
is download an application.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.430
And then, you use your NFC
phone as your Buymore card,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.570
as your discount card.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.800
So those are the options
that NFC gave to us,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.520
and why we decided
to exploit them.
