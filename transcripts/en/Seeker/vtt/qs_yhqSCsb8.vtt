00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.150
I hate winter, it’s cold, it’s grey, it
gets dark so dang early.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.879
Turns out your body hates it too.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.910
Axial tilt maybe be the reason for the season,
but it’s technically changing our genes.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.690
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.930
Winter is rough for those of us who live in
cold climates.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.810
As the wind chill dips below zero degrees,
you ask yourself, why do I live somewhere

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.840
where the air HURTS MY FACE!?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.460
But it’s not just the cold that’s rough
on our bodies, it’s the lack of sunlight

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.460
too.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.409
Almost all living things have a circadian
rhythm that changes with the light.

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.691
From sleep cycles to hibernation, light regulates
most of life on Earth.

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.720
The Earth is tilted at a comfortable 23.5
degrees.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.550
This means that at some parts of the year
the northern hemisphere leans slightly closer

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
to the sun and other parts of the year the
southern hemisphere gets a little cozier with

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.260
the sun.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.989
And with that, it means the amount of light
that reaches your little section of the planet

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.110
changes throughout the year.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.340
Those grey skies and fading evening light
can have profound changes on your body.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.500
The change in light can cause problems like
seasonal affective disorder, a condition which

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.750
brings about a low mood as levels of sunlight
induced Vitamin D drop.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.090
But there’s a few other lesser known effects
of less sunlight.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.200
In a study published in the journal Drug Metabolism
&amp; Disposition researchers found how less sunlight

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.290
changes how your body metabolizes medication.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.000
They focused on two types of immune suppressing
drugs, tacrolimus and sirolimus.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.119
Basically the more Vitamin D, the more an
enzyme CYP3A4 is produced.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.010
The more of this enzyme, the faster the drugs
were metabolized.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.780
While the study focused on just these two
medications, the researchers think these results

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.590
might be true for other types of medications.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.259
So the study suggests that sunlight could
affect your sensitivity to certain drugs.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.380
One study from the American College of Cardiology,
found that cholesterol levels vary from season

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.380
to season.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.560
In a large study of over 2.8 million adults,
researchers from Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.810
for the Prevention of Heart Disease found
that for many people, cholesterol levels seem

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.759
to be higher in the winter.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.580
The researchers think that less sunlight plays
a role in these rising levels.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.450
As we are exposed to less light during the
winter, because of staying inside and shorter

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.799
days, we get less vitamin D. Another study
published in the journal Menopause found a

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.329
link between more vitamin D and lower cholesterol
levels.

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.959
So with less vitamin D, cholesterol levels
might rise.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.719
But even though more research is needed, there’s
other evidence that shows how your body takes

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.400
a whopping in the winter.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.790
So much so, that it affects your gene!

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.510
One study published in the journal Nature
Communications found that around 23% of human

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.769
genome expression changes from season to season
mostly to boost your immune system.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.049
This time of year is prime cold and flu season,
so to fight off infections, your body switches

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.769
on certain pro-inflammatory genes.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.279
Your DNA is made up of two strains that wrap
around each other in the famous double helix

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:53.049
structure, to get even more compact and tiny,
that DNA is wrapped around little proteins

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.049
called histones.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.230
Think of how thread is wrapped around spool,
that’s kind of what histones look like.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.249
When DNA needs to be translated to make proteins,
these histones unravel to let out a little

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.140
bit of DNA at a time.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.199
But which histones unravel when depends on
various influences.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.900
In this case, it’s seasonal influences,
probably the amount of sunlight.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.540
When the participants went through winter
months, no matter what hemisphere they were

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.689
in, the lack of sunlight seemed to activate
pro-inflammatory genes.

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.469
And like we know from other DNews episodes,
inflammation, while it can help us fight off

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:30.639
some infections, too much can also harm our
health, leading to heart disease, diabetes,

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.840
or stress related mental health issues.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.169
Which interestingly, the authors think could
be another reason for more cardiovascular

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.510
deaths in the winter.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.139
But if you live somewhere where there isn’t
a winter, your immune system is impacted by

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.989
other kinds of seasonal changes.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.670
In this study, the researchers found that
those who live in Gambia have seasonal peaks

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.849
correlated with the rainy season (June to
October), when infectious diseases seem to

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.339
be more prevalent.

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.479
So happy winter to everyone who’s in it!

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.760
Enjoy your body’s changes.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.019
I hope this season brings you more joy than
it brings cardiovascular, psychiatric or inflammatory

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.019
issues!

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.489
Or maybe if you wait long enough, climate
change could take away our seasons, starting

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.519
with fall.

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.500
To find out more about the end of autumn,
Trace has the scoop in this episode right

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.500
here.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:29.240
So are you a fan of winter?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.210
Love to build snowmen in the frozen outdoors?

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.539
Or are you a curl up by the fire with a good
book kind of person?
