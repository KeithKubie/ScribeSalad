00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520
 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.100
so Jonathan you asked a question that

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
so Jonathan you asked a question that
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.629
so Jonathan you asked a question that
actually gets to the heart of a lot of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
actually gets to the heart of a lot of
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.150
actually gets to the heart of a lot of
my ideas about science and culture and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
my ideas about science and culture and
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.980
my ideas about science and culture and
you asked about the celebrity culture

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
you asked about the celebrity culture
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.420
you asked about the celebrity culture
you know we hear about these famous

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
you know we hear about these famous
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.430
you know we hear about these famous
scientists it goes you know Albert

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440
scientists it goes you know Albert
 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.860
scientists it goes you know Albert
Einstein you know or Stephen Hawking or

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870
Einstein you know or Stephen Hawking or
 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.080
Einstein you know or Stephen Hawking or
Neil deGrasse Tyson we know of these

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
Neil deGrasse Tyson we know of these
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.000
Neil deGrasse Tyson we know of these
wonderful kind of larger-than-life

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
wonderful kind of larger-than-life
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.130
wonderful kind of larger-than-life
personalities and does that really

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
personalities and does that really
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.319
personalities and does that really
reflect what the practice of science is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
reflect what the practice of science is
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.069
reflect what the practice of science is
and in fact it to me this is actually a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
and in fact it to me this is actually a
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020
and in fact it to me this is actually a
deeper question because I think it's one

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
deeper question because I think it's one
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.610
deeper question because I think it's one
of the ways that people are kept out of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
of the ways that people are kept out of
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.880
of the ways that people are kept out of
science we hold up examples about these

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
science we hold up examples about these
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770
science we hold up examples about these
these incredible heroic sort of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
these incredible heroic sort of
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.869
these incredible heroic sort of
seemingly perfect people and then we

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
seemingly perfect people and then we
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209
seemingly perfect people and then we
compare ourselves to them and this is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
compare ourselves to them and this is
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.799
compare ourselves to them and this is
exactly the same as comparing ourselves

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
exactly the same as comparing ourselves
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.840
exactly the same as comparing ourselves
to supermodels and then looking at the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
to supermodels and then looking at the
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209
to supermodels and then looking at the
way we look or comparing ourselves to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
way we look or comparing ourselves to
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.099
way we look or comparing ourselves to
athletes or to incredibly famous rock

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
