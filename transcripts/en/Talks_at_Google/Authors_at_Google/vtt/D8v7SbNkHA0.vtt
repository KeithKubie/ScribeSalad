00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; I myself have read Ramit's book, and I'll
tell you, as a finance major in college, I

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.160
have not learned more about bank accounts
and credit cards than I can in four years.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.150
I learned it from Ramit more than college.
His book focuses on personal finance for people

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.230
in their 20's and 30's, by weaving in together
threads from health and fitness, social psychology,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.089
and personal finance.
His blog, IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com, frequently

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.700
crashes because so many people access it.
It hosts over 300,000 readers per month, and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.330
Ramit just told me he's getting new servers
to back up more readers.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.050
He's no stranger to Silicon Valley.
Previously, he cofounded a company called

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.230
PBwiki, where he helped develop user acquisition
of millions of users.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.440
Ramit graduated from Stanford where he studied
technology and psychology.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.180
Please welcome Ramit Sethi.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.180
&gt;&gt; [applause]

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.940
Ramit: Thank you very much. Testing one, two,
three.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.620
Ramit: Is this okay? Can you guys hear me?
Okay.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.940
Thank you very much for having me.
When I was doing my first start-up, we used

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.430
to meet here about four times a week.
So thank you very much for that.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.250
Just a quick question.
Who here has read my blog or my book already?

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.610
Okay.
Who here thinks it sounds like a big, fat

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.340
scam?
"I will teach you to be rich" yeah.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.510
What I want to talk about today is a system
that I've been working on building for the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.540
last ten years.
And it comes down to, "Personal finance is

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.440
not about willpower."
People think, "If I just try harder, I can

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.960
save more money.
I can earn more money."

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.330
Very similar to, "If I just try harder, I
can lose ten pounds."

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.750
And clearly, it's more complex than trying
harder.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.770
It's clearly more complex than throwing tactic
after tactic out at people.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.140
What we're going to do today -- I want to
spend about a half an hour talking about the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.500
psychology of automation -- the psychology
of personal finance.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.469
And then, I'm going to talk to you a little
bit about the system -- how you can implement

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.469
it today.
It takes about six weeks.

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.920
People are pretty smart here, so you can probably
do it a little faster.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.549
And then, we'll just do a lot of Q and A.
I'd love to take questions.

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.189
Personal finance is intensely psychological.
And, first of all, when I talk about, "I will

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.629
teach you to be rich," I want to emphasize
that 'rich' is not just about money.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.450
For some people, 'rich' could mean buying
a Louis Vuitton bag or expensive shoes or

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.071
traveling all the time.
That's perfectly fine. That could be a rich

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.669
life to you.
For other people, it might be about charity

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.370
or, you know, more traveling or whatever it
may be.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.829
That's fine too.
But 'rich' is only partly about money.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.400
The reason that I started this was, I got
sick and tired of personal finance experts

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.689
telling us things like, "Don't spend money
on lattes," and "Keep a budget" -- which no

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.749
one ever does, and is the most useless advice,
but continues to be expressed for the last

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.150
50 years, even though no one keeps a budget.
It just doesn't work.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.499
So today, these are things we're not going
to talk about.

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.129
We're not going to tell you to keep a budget.
I'm not going to lecture you about lattes.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.480
And for some reason, kooky people start talking
about Ron Paul and commodities when it comes

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.499
to investing.
We're not going to talk about that either.

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.909
What we are going to talk about is building
an automated system so that, by default, without

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.549
trying, your money is doing the right thing,
okay?

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.900
And that will let you lead a rich life and
spend your money guilt-free.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.169
Because 'I will teach you to be rich' is about
spending extravagantly on the things you love

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:40.239
if you're cutting costs mercilessly on the
things you don't.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.290
So let's get to it.
In the next hour, we are going to go through

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.790
a bullet-proof system.
This is a system that you can use for your

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.590
own money.
And most people, if I ask you, "Where's your

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.799
money going?" most people look at their bills
at the end of the month and go, "I don't know.

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.819
I guess I spent that much."
I don't know why they talk like that, but

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.599
they do.
Instead, what I'll propose is a bullet-proof

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.870
system where, if I were to say to you, "Hey,
you need to start saving 500 bucks for this

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.090
trip to Thailand you want to take."
You're going to say, "No problem.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.239
I know exactly where to take the money out
from here to here and have it flow over here.

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.470
And it will be a couple clicks, and it will
be done -- automatically.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.370
We're also going to examine the psychology
of it.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.680
And I want to ask you guys to first take a
couple minutes with me to go deep into the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.889
psychology, because it's not just about tactics.
It's not about me telling you, "You need to

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:26.889
spend less on this and earn more and do."
We know that.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.701
We know what we need to do. Why aren't we
doing it?

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:34.080
I took a survey of about 1600 users and asked
them, "What are the things you wish you saved

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.000
for 10 years ago?" And it was almost a uniform
curve.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.440
People in their 20's wished that they had
saved more for travel.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.039
People in their 30's wished that they had
saved more for their down payment on their

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.110
house.
And people in their 40's were often really

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.199
screwed if they haven't started -- wished
that they had saved more for their retirement.

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.060
So we know what's going to happen to us ten
years from now, yet we delude ourselves into

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.710
thinking, "We'll do it later."
I met a girl on my book tour. She's about

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.629
25, 26.
And she told me a really interesting story.

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:11.250
She said, "Ramit, I read your book, and I
started saving for my wedding.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:21.840
Already, I have a little sub-savings account."
I said, "Great, can I get this on flip cam?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.439
This would be awesome."
And she got very uncomfortable.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:35.440
She said, "No, no, no.
I don't want to talk about it on camera."

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.340
I said, "Why?"
And she told me, "I'm not engaged yet." [laughter]

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:57.069
Isn't it interesting that we know the average
age where a woman gets married, where a man

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:04.880
gets married.
We know the average cost of a wedding.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:16.789
Put the numbers together, and it means that
if you're 20 years old, you need to be saving

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:32.289
over $300 a month for your wedding.
If you're 25, over a thousand dollars a month.

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:39.150
But who does this? It's so weird.
And it struck me, "Isn't it interesting that

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:46.860
it's weird for this young woman in Portland
to be saving where it's actually normative

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.550
for us to say, "Oh, I'll just figure that
out later."

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.159
Or even more delusional, I'm just going to
have a small, simple wedding with a few friends.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.159
No, you're not. You're going to have a big-ass
wedding, because that's what we want.

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.410
It's our day. So let's get real.
Let's be honest and acknowledge what the costs

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.410
are going to be, okay?
There's also people who are even more delusional.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.410
Twenty percent of people actually believe
they'll get rich by winning the lottery. [laughter]

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.410
I hate these people.
Ten percent think that they'll get rich through

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.410
an inheritance.
I hate them as well.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.410
And perhaps, the most delusional of all.
Three percent via an insurance settlement.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.410
Yes, I'm sure -- smart three percent.
Not going to happen.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.410
Why don't we do this?
If I were to ask someone in their 40's, "What's

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.410
the number one thing that you are worried
about or concerned about?" They would say,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.410
almost all of them, "Money."
We know it. We know we need to exercise more.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.410
We know we need to work out more, eat less,
and manage our money.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.410
Why don't we do it?
It's not about trying harder.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.410
That's something I want to emphasize today.
Let's take a look at some comparisons.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.410
When it comes to personal finance and food,
there's a lot of similarities.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.410
So the health and fitness world directly inform
your money behaviors.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.410
We spend more than we think.
We also eat more than we think.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.410
If you were to actually look and measure what
you ate, what you spent, you wouldn't like

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.410
it.
You wouldn't tell people what you did.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.150
In fact, there's great research showing that
there were people who were more comfortable

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:23.360
talking about their sex lives than their credit
card bills, making me ask, "Where do I find

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.199
these people?" [laughter] Okay?
We value anecdotal stories over actual research.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.789
How many times have you heard your friends
say, "Oh, you really should invest in real

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:36.320
estate -- it's the best investment." No, it's
not.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.550
Or you know, friends telling you, "the baby
minutiae."

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.850
How many of you have heard friends saying,
"Don't eat fiber after 11 p.m., because it

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.319
doesn't metabolize.
You need to eat fruit.

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:50.560
But make sure you get your carbs in the morning"
 -- these weird theories that are not backed

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.409
up with literature.
How many people do you know that complain

00:07:54.409 --> 00:08:00.449
about money but have never spent one weekend
actually optimizing their finances?

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:03.199
You can do it once, and you can have the residual
benefits forever.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:08.060
So there are profound, psychological reasons
why we don't do what we know we need to do.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.449
We also have the media shoving down our throats
these ridiculous covers and ridiculous messages

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:17.280
like, "Top ten stocks you must own in 2010."
Actually, analyze those media messages, and

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.900
they are almost always wrong.
They don't even match the market.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.819
What they are doing is selling advertisements
and selling magazines, not selling good financial

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:29.901
advice.
The answer is far more prosaic, and it's something

00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:33.060
I like to talk about which is, "Would you
rather be sexy or would you rather be rich?"

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.530
Would you rather go to a party -- I'm a nerd.
I don't know if you guys do this, but when

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.419
I go to parties, we talk investment strategy.
This is what we do.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:45.030
And people say, "What are you investing in?"
And it's sexy to say, "Well, I got this stock,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.390
and I'm looking at some early-stage angel
funding.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.661
Whereas the real individual investors are
simply saying, "Well, I picked an index fund,

00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:53.640
I got my asset allocation right.
It took me a weekend.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.960
And all I do is just automatically send money
every month.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:02.650
It's not as sexy, but it'll make you rich.
Other reasons -- and this is perhaps the most

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.440
important of all.
There's just too much information.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.580
And everywhere we go, we've got our parents
who don't know anything about money, generally,

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.370
telling us stuff.
We've got the media.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.500
We've got friends, who think they know, but
they don't really know.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:21.530
And we've got information all over the place.
What's the result of all this?

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:26.690
It makes us actually want to do less.
It makes us -- when we see -- let's look at

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:32.510
401k's, for example, great study in the the
book, The Paradox of Choice.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:37.590
When there are more options in your 401k,
people actually participate less.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.010
It's very counterintuitive, but it's true.
How many of you have ever opened up your 401k

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.450
and just gotten overwhelmed with the choices?
Anyone here? Interesting.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.290
And we're all -- in this room, we've got a
lot of very, very smart people.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.580
It's not that you're not smart, it's that
it's a human tendency to be overwhelmed by

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.440
too much.
The results of all this information, all this

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.420
media messages is predictable.
It's, we do nothing.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:08.470
We say, "We'll do it later."
So, if we know it's important, why don't we

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.850
do it?
One of the biggest things that I talk about

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.750
with 'I will teach you to be rich' is that,
every day we wake up and we're confronted

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.210
with 50 choices we could make about our money.
We can pay off debt. We can earn more.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:25.050
We can try to do better at our job.
We can not go out and spend that money on

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.050
lattes.
Whatever it may be.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.010
Instead, I prefer to focus on the big ones.
Pick the one or two things that actually matter.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:34.440
And do those, and let your friends worry about
saving money on diet cokes.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.580
Let me give you a couple of examples.
This is a simple one.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.400
You may have seen these numbers before.
Smart Sally starts investing a hundred dollars

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.180
a month at age 25.
She stops at age 35.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.600
She just lets the money grow.
Dumb Dan doesn't start until he's 35.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.220
He says, "Oh, I better keep investing till
I retire."

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:57.910
Both of them at the end -- remember, one person
invested for ten years, another for 30 years.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.800
Smart Sally has $50,000 more.
So let your friends worry about ordering lattes.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.070
You could focus on the one or two things that
actually matter.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.490
Another example.
The difference in having good credit when

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.610
you go to buy a house.
Typical house, let's say, $300,000.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:20.880
The difference between having good credit
and poor credit is over $100,000.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.570
It's not sexy, but it'll make you rich.
So what I want to do now is, get into the

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.850
six weeks.
And I want to talk to you about what you can

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.930
do in six weeks to automate and optimize your
finances.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.800
Because the No. 1 goal is that no one here
needs to be a financial expert.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.440
You don't need to be an expert to do this.
You get it set, you get it automated, and

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.550
you get on with your lives.
All right. So here's what we're going to do.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.790
First, Week One.
I picked Week One as 'credit,' because we

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.810
all have credit cards.
We all hate our credit card companies.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.071
So, I want to show you how to screw them a
little bit like they screwed some of us.

00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:55.730
There are six commandments.
I'm going to skip the first four, because

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.770
a lot of us know that, but I'm going to talk
to you about the last two.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:04.380
They're a little bit counterintuitive.
Who here knows that, when you buy something,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.870
and let's say, it's got a one-year warrantee.
And your new phone breaks on day 366.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.360
That's no problem.
Your credit card automatically gives you an

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.360
extra -- it doubles your warrantee up to a
year.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.880
So if something breaks on day 366, no problem.
Call your credit card; they'll write you a

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.270
check.
It's no problem.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.430
The other thing that's pretty interesting
that I learned recently was, if you buy something,

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.930
in the first 90 days, it gets stolen, you
break it, or you even lose it, they'll write

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.130
you a check $500 or $1000.
It actually happened to this laptop.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.740
I bought my first Mac. It was my little baby.
I bought it a few months ago.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.000
First week, I spilled a huge glass of coffee
on it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.870
I was almost weeping. And couldn't repair.
It was destroyed.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.180
And so, I called up the credit card company.
They wrote me a check for 600 bucks.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.520
I sold it for parts on E-bay and broke even
on my $1400 mistake.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.591
You can do this with anything -- a sweater
 -- anything.

00:12:56.591 --> 00:13:01.930
Anything you buy with your credit card, okay?
So the point is, you want to use all the benefits

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.180
you get with credit, or with anything for
that matter.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.190
I was actually going to work at Google as
an APMM.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:13.070
And I remember, when they made the offer,
I built my own super-anal, wierdo spreadsheet

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.570
about the benefits that I would get here.
And I think, for me, it was something like

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.300
22 to 26k a year in benefits -- if you use
them.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.330
You guys know this. Your car insurance.
It's huge discounts.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.020
Movie tickets, flowers, all kinds of stuff.
Did you know that? These are things you can

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.560
use.
The other thing about credit is to negotiate

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.750
like an Indian, okay?
I have been bred to negotiate like an Indian,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.930
so I want to share some of this with you.
You can negotiate your car insurance.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.070
You can negotiate your credit card late fees,
overdraft fees, your gym, cable.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.050
You can -- even if you carry debt -- you can
negotiate your credit card APR, which if you're

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.600
carrying a lot of debt is a huge win for you,
okay?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.490
Do you guys want me to do a mock negotiation
right now?

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.490
Would that help?

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:56.490
A Yes.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.390
Q All right. So it's easy to say 'just negotiate'
but, for some reason in America, we're scared

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.870
of using the phone.
I don't know why, but people are really afraid

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.460
of using the phone.
Which allows me to No. 1, mock them, but No.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.880
2, in the book, I actually wrote the e-mail
scripts, or the scripts you can use on the

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.630
phone.
People literally call these companies and

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.070
read them the scripts.
So the companies don't like me very much.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.270
Let me give you an example of an overdraft
negotiation, okay?

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:24.470
So, I am -- I have $500 in my checking account.
I just used my debit card -- which by the

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.710
way, you shouldn't -- I just used my debit
card to buy a $700 purchase, so I'm overdrafted.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.910
And what they do is, they just hit me with
a $37 overdraft fee.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:37.440
So I call them up, and I say this, "Hi, there.
I just wanted to confirm that you've received

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.140
my extra transfer that I sent in after that
overdraft.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.680
Can you confirm that you've received that
money now?

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.810
There should be about a thousand dollars in
my account."

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.450
"Well, yes sir, as a matter of fact, we did
receive that transfer yesterday.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.150
Thank you very much."
"Okay, now, I wanted to talk to you about

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.760
that overdraft fee.
I see that an overdraft fee was incurred,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.460
and I'd like to ask you to waive that please."
"Why?"

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.770
"Well, I made a mistake.
I was moving some accounts around, and it's

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.630
not going to happen again.
I'd like you to waive that overdraft fee,

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.200
please."
Now, two things right here.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.180
Just stop right here for a minute.
First of all, you have a 50 percent chance

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.360
right there of getting that fee waived -- right
there.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.360
For two reasons, one because you asked, and
most people don't.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.230
And second, you didn't say, "Can you remove
that overdraft fee?" Because the natural response

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:22.260
of a customer service rep is to say, "No."
You said, "I'd like you to waive that overdraft

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.300
fee, please." Okay.
So let's say they do it, 50 percent.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.190
If not, you're going to have to go a little
tougher.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:32.281
Say, "Sorry, sir, I'm not able to waive that
overdraft fee, but we have blah, blah, blah

00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:35.860
 -- marketing pitch -- blah, blah, blah."
"Well, you know, I'm looking at my account

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.720
here, and I've been a customer for four-and-a-half
years, and I'd hate to have to switch just

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.440
because of one, minor, overdraft fee.
Can you take another look and see what you

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.990
can do for me?"
Right there, your chances go up to about 65,

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.030
70 percent. [laughter] It works.
And then, if it still doesn't work, you can

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.550
escalate, or you can call back later.
But the point is, you can do this.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.590
And actually, I'm going to teach you three
words you can use right after this call.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.160
And you can say.
A lot of people save a lot of money using

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.560
this.
And it's true, by the way.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.760
The phrase is this, you call up your cable
company.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.960
Do this with your -- they hate me -- call
your cable company, and say this, "Hi, Mr.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.650
Comcast, I noticed this $80 a month fee that
I'm paying.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.560
You know what? Times are tough. Times are
tough.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.850
I just can't afford that anymore.
What can you do for me?"

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.690
"Well, sir, as a matter of fact, we have a
special $50 offer that we can offer you for

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.760
the next 12 months."
"Oh, thank you very much."

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.610
You just saved $400 a year, okay?
That's the money that you could use to start

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.860
investing and use on things you love, whether
it's going out or traveling.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.090
These things work.
So I would really urge you to call up all

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.330
your companies and take them for all they're
worth, because you're paying them.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.830
These companies pay $300 to $1,500 in customer
acquisition costs.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:44.450
They don't want to lose you for a $37 fee.
So take advantage of it. They expect it.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.460
They build it into their models. All right.
We've now covered credit.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.500
Let's get to bank accounts. This is pretty
easy.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.770
I just want to share the actual accounts I
use and how I set it up.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.640
Rather than having all your money sitting
in a big pool in a savings account, don't

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.840
do that, because it's easy to just say, "Oh,
I've got 5k or 10k -- or whatever the number

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.100
is -- yeah, I'll just take some of it out.
And then, you just stay stagnant for a year

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.829
to five years.
Instead, use sub-savings accounts.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.450
So, I'll actually show you a screenshot of
my own savings account.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:21.320
I'm saving for certain sub-goals like a wedding,
even though I'm not engaged, car repairs,

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.720
because those are unexpected, and a trip to
China.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.680
What happens is, if I want to take some money
out to do something, it's not that I can't

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.830
take it out, of course I can.
But it's just that minor, psychological barrier.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.160
I have to think for a second, "Do I really
want to take $1,000 out of my down payment

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.480
fund? Do I really?"
Just think about it for one extra second.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.800
That, often enough, is the default to help
you make the right decision.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.210
The accounts that I use, I'd recommend too.
So one is for ING Direct, for Orange, I like

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.140
them a lot.
They're simple, they don't spam you with a

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.380
bunch of mail and stuff.
It just works.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.160
The second is Schwab for checking.
The reason I like Schwab is two reasons.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.830
One, they pay you interest on your checking
account.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:02.630
Two, I don't know if I'm the only one who
finds myself at like, a liquor store at 3:30

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:07.410
in the morning withdrawing $380.
Am I the only one?

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.940
Well, you know, you get hit with these huge,
like $5, $10 withdrawal fees that make me

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.260
boil and rage.
Schwab actually refunds all your ATM fees.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.080
So I really like them for that, especially
if you live in like a New York area.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.230
You're getting hit with these fees all the
time.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.630
So these are the two accounts that I use and
I like personally, okay?

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:30.360
Let's now talk about Three, which is investment
accounts.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.390
Now, people get really confused where they
tend to conflate investing with opening your

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.430
investment accounts.
That's not the case.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.790
You can break it down, and in this week, you
just opened up your investment accounts.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.850
And I know here, you've already got investment
accounts opened by default.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.460
So you're already a step ahead.
People often wonder, "Which account should

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.630
I open up when it comes to investing?" Here's
a typical ladder of investing.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.410
First, your 401k.
Then, you want to pay off debt.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.940
Then, you've got your Roth IRA.
If you have all these three steps, by the

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:03.060
way, you're investing roughly about 5 to 10k
a year, which is great.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.320
If you still have more money, you can go back
to your 401k.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.730
And then, if you have more -- you're investing
over $20,000 a year -- open up a taxable account.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.320
A little bit different for Googlers.
So I want to cover that for you for a second.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.000
I know you've got a Roth 401k, which is great,
and the match is very generous.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.840
So, if you simply do the first one or two
things, you are ahead of the game, you're

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.070
ahead of 99 percent of your peers.
I'll take questions at the end.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:34.030
So just doing a Roth 401k as much as you can
and paying off debt is wonderful.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.400
That's what I call the 85 percent solution.
It gets you 85 percent of the way there.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.380
Now, get on with your life, okay?
If you really want to get fancy, you could

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.790
do the rest of that stuff.
Especially in 2010, there's a bunch of cool

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:49.240
tax stuff, especially if you're a highly-compensated
employee, but that's more complex, and that

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:56.020
is the 85 to 100 percent of the process, okay?
Quick numbers on 401ks.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.460
I just want to show you how these numbers
work.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.170
Many of you have seen these.
These are the kind of things that you'll see

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.100
in these magazines all the time.
They're just numbers.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.850
They don't really persuade you to take action.
So, when you -- some of this stuff that I've

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.510
have done with 'I will teach you to be rich.com'
in the book is all about behavioral change.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.140
Just quickly notice these numbers here in
terms of ages on the left.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.070
You'll see that, with an employer match, your
money actually just grows.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.010
This is without. This is with a match.
And your money just grows tremendously.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.710
And notice that, by the way, the Google match
is actually more generous than these calculations.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.360
So, your money really, really grows quickly,
all right?

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.730
I won't say more about that.
Oh, except one more thing.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.350
Psychologically, it's very important.
They did some great research where they went

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.490
into companies and they -- people had to opt
in -- they had to fill out a form to get into

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.190
the 401k.
Remember, there are big, tax benefits.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.970
You save a lot of money using a 401k.
About 35 percent of people opted in.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.490
Then they made it 'opt out.' In other words,
you're automatically enrolled.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.680
Compliance -- or contributions -- skyrocketed
to over 90 percent.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.420
That's why it's really important to automate
this.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.970
Because, you might be motivated right after
you leave this talk, but six months from now,

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.030
you're like, "Let's drink."
You're not thinking about personal finances.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.800
So just automate it, and you don't have to
worry about it again.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.630
Quickly -- investment accounts -- I like Vanguard.
I know you've got Vanguard here. They're great.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.350
They don't try to gouge you with fat commissions
like some of the other guys.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.260
T Rowe Price and Schwab are also great.
So any of these companies are wonderful, and

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.360
they have great funds that you can do for
low cost.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.300
We've now covered credit, your bank accounts,
your investment accounts.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:37.100
This is the tough one. Conscious spending.
So, like I said, I don't want to tell you

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.220
"You shouldn't spend on x, y, z," because
the first thing you're going to do is say,

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.440
"Screw this guy.
He's telling me what to do." And, in psychology,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.930
that's the term reactives.
We don't like someone to tell us what to do.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.370
We actually rebel against that.
Not the case.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.020
I think you should spend extravagantly on
the things you love, as long as you're handling

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.930
the other stuff.
So I want to talk about how you do that.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.520
Again, if I asked you, "Where does your money
go?"

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.170
Most people don't know.
Or if they think they know, they don't.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.309
We're not cognitively wired to amortize our
spending.

00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:03.450
So if I were to ask you, "How much did you
spend?"

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.660
Did you really count in the $700 in Christmas
gifts you spend at the end of the year, adding

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.809
about 60 bucks a month? No.
You didn't count vacation.

00:22:10.809 --> 00:22:15.760
You didn't count all these one-time events.
Here's a nice baseline for what your spending

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.330
could look like in your 20's and 30's.
Okay, I say that specifically, because 20

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.610
to 35 percent of guilt-free spending, like
drinking, is almost a criminal amount for

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.780
some parents.
That's okay. When you're in your 20's and

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.990
30's, this is what we spend money on.
It's fine.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.640
As you get older, your spending numbers are
naturally going to change.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.471
What I want to emphasize here is that, if
you cover your 50 to 60 percent of fixed costs,

00:22:39.471 --> 00:22:42.900
your investments and your savings, the rest
of the money is guilt-free spending.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.110
You don't have to feel bad about buying $300
jeans, because you know you're already hitting

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.000
these numbers. Okay.
So what's going to happen after this?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.250
You might take a look at this, and you might
analyze your own spending.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.400
And you might say, "Wow, I'm like, wildly
off.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.230
I'm not even contributing close to what I
want to put into my retirement or savings

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.120
or whatever.
How do I tweak this, so I can get the numbers

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.510
in order or in line?" I think 'saving' is
a bad word.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.150
We don't like to think of saving, because
it means "giving up on the things we love,"

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.011
right?
It means saying 'no' to the things we love.

00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:18.520
So instead, I like to use something I call
the 'CEO model' -- cut costs, which is one,

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.580
we know that. Earn more.
We always forget that.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.990
I'm actually in the middle of launching something
on my site right now to help people take their

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.430
skills and turn it into income on the side.
I think it's a very easy thing to do, especially

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.440
for highly-skilled people.
And you can earn a nice $500,000 dollars on

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.440
the side.
And then, optimize spending, which is like

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.770
the thing like negotiating.
If you do these three things, you can make

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.670
huge wins.
I've got people who read my site who previously

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.450
said, "Oh, there's no way I could cut down
any more. There's no way."

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.420
And then, they automate and they go through
this and they're now saving a thousand dollars

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.650
a month into their savings and retirement
accounts.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.170
Very normal salaries.
So it's not like they're making a huge amount

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.870
of money.
Instead of trying to save on 50 things and

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:03.440
not succeeding at any of them, forget that.
Use the 80/20 principle.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.670
Or what I call the 'two-headed savings approach,'
and just focus on your two biggest, discretionary

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.650
expenses.
Who here knows what their first or second

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.500
biggest, discretionary expense is?
Yeah, just shout it out.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.660
A Travel.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:20.400
Q Travel. What else?
Eating out. Okay. Drinking.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.730
I know you guys don't want to admit it. What
else?

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:29.440
So there are these big, discretionary expenses.
I don't want to say, "Cut down your travel

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.160
all the way."
Because maybe you really value that.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.220
Or eating out. That's what it is for me.
Instead, what I say is, "I'm going to pick

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.981
these two discretionary expenses that I want
to cut down on, and over a period of six months

00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:44.390
 -- not tomorrow -- but over six months, I'm
going to cut down by roughly 30 to 50 percent."

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.300
Just slowly. Look at the numbers. They're
really slow.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.100
By the end of these six months, if you do
this with two, you've got $500, $600, $700

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.190
in extra, discretionary income.
Extra cash where you can do whatever you want

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.110
with that.
And it's not like you went from eating $500

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.620
a month out to $200.
That would never work.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.260
Take it slow, take it gradual, but make it
sustainable, okay?

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.670
And don't worry about saving money on $3 here
and there.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:10.460
If you focus on the biggest two expenses,
that's all you really need to worry about

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.420
for cutting costs.
That's the 80/20 rule.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.990
Now quickly, I'm just going to power through
these power techniques.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.640
How do you track your spending?
I use mint.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.840
I use this in conjunction with my two-headed
savings approach.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:24.370
So I'll say, "Hey, if I'm spending too much
on eating out, which is my thing, text me."

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.641
You can compare it to people near you.
I'm like a little bit of a wierdo -- as you

00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:30.410
can tell -- when it comes to this financial
stuff.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.670
So one thing I do is, any time there's a human
involved, I don't trust them.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.090
Actually, you guys at Google should know what
I'm talking about.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.929
What I'll do is, I'll save these receipts
any time I write something human, like there's

00:25:41.929 --> 00:25:45.360
a tip involved.
And once a week, I'll take two minutes and

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360
just check and make sure they didn't add an
extra zero to that tip.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.130
You don't have to do that. That's a little
bit extreme.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.230
I use Google Calendar as well.
On the 15th of the month, I just check it.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:00.730
"Hey, am I spending too much on eating out
or not?" And if I am, I'll just maybe say

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.000
'no' to one of my friends asking me out, or
I'll cook at home.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.340
I'm not going to cook at home.
But if I'm doing fine, then I won't have to

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.980
worry about it.
Shut it down, and I'm done. Get on with my

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.370
life, okay?
That's conscious spending.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:16.110
And that lets you spend on the stuff you love,
instead of worrying about spending here and

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.560
there.
Okay, automated. This is my favorite.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.890
This is my favorite part of the whole system.
I want to take you step-by-step through that

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:27.200
system now and show you how it works.
You get -- let's pretend that you make a hundred

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.310
percent of your income from your salary -- which
is the case for most people.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.809
How does it work?
You get paid, let's pretend, for ease of use,

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:38.610
you get paid on the first of the month.
Some of that money is going to automatically

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.430
be taken out and sent to your 401k.
You then send the remainder -- 95 percent

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.679
ballpark -- to your checking account.
This is your e-mail inbox. This is where everything

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:47.510
happens.
You filter money, you disburse money right

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.340
from here.
It all happens from your e-mail inbox or your

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.520
checking account.
You're going to set up an automatic transfer

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.179
to your Roth IRA, or maybe your debt, whatever
it may be.

00:26:57.179 --> 00:27:00.920
You're going to set up an automatic transfer
to your savings account where it's split into

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.440
sub-savings goals. Okay?
Now, if you do simply these things, you are

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.420
handling your money better than 99 percent
of people. You're good to go.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.270
So now, it comes down to spending money.
I tend to spend most of my money on credit

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.429
cards, because I get, you know, a bunch of
consumer rewards and points and stuff.

00:27:16.429 --> 00:27:19.870
This is guilt-free money, because you've already
handled the stuff you need to handle.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.910
And if you've got -- some people don't accept
credit cards -- like, the landlord?

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.920
You don't need to write those checks.
I hate writing checks.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.270
So every 26th of the month, my bank automatically
sends a check to my landlord, and I never

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.410
have to touch that again.
You can automate that as well.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.462
Now, look at the power of this.
If I were to tell you now, "Hey, I want you

00:27:36.462 --> 00:27:39.970
to start saving $200 a month for our trip
that we're going to take to China."

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.970
You can easily say, "Oh, perfect, I know exactly
how to do that.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:48.170
I can use a two-headed approach here to generate
a couple extra hundred bucks, or I can tweak

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.870
my savings goals to generate that extra hundred
bucks.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.150
And I would create another savings goal here."
You can do all these different things with

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:58.890
your automation system instead of just having
this, you know, nebulous sense of money that's

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:03.270
coming in and going out.
It's very powerful to be able to control it.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.100
There is a missing piece and that is 'timing'.
You can't have all these transfers going around

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.210
all the time, because you'll be hit with tons
and tons of fees.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.940
So, let's pretend -- for just a moment, for
simplicity -- that you're paid on the first

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.110
of the month, okay?
What you would do is, on the second of the

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.890
month, you would initiate a transfer to your
401k -- just like we saw -- the rest would

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.480
go to your checking.
Then on the fifth of the month, you would

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.030
go to savings and your Roth.
Then on the seventh etc.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.230
And after the seventh, the rest is guilt-free
money.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.179
Timing is important.
I know you get paid twice a month.

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:37.080
So you can tweak it a little bit.
One is, you can just pay yourself in the first

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.370
15 days.
Do your 401k and your retirement accounts.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.480
And then, the second half, you can pay your
fixed income.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.150
The other thing is, if you have enough money
just sitting there, you can just treat it

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:50.530
as a buffer and go back to this once-a-month
system, which is, in my opinion, simpler if

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:55.890
you've got the money.
So that's how automation works, okay?

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:01.200
Now, we'll go on to the last part, and we're
now on to investments.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.590
How many people here have not invested at
all?

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:08.230
Okay. Not that many.
I know it's automatic for you, which is great.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.420
You've already got a leg up.
Let me just quickly walk you through the important

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.150
stuff to know about investments, and then,
we're going to do questions. Okay.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:22.500
Ignore these stupid magazines. Okay?
They -- like I said -- are selling ads and

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.890
magazines.
They're not selling good, financial advice.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.679
Repeat -- please listen to me when I say this;
this is very important.

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:32.400
Investing is not about picking stocks, okay?
Investing is not about picking stocks.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.690
People think it is.
All of our friends think it is. It is not.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.679
Even the fanciest portfolio managers in New
York could do this for a living can not even

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:43.580
equal the market, okay?
And they're paid millions of dollars.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:49.870
So it's not about picking stocks.
It's much different than that.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.410
Okay. Thinking that investing is like picking
stocks is like thinking that any individual

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.520
word in a book is the most important thing
you do when writing it.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.030
No, the most important thing when writing
a book is your table of contents -- your organization.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.309
The way that you structure it, right?
Same as writing code; same as writing a book.

00:30:06.309 --> 00:30:09.010
So asset allocation is basically your investment
plan.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:15.970
When you're 25, you want to be pretty aggressive,
because you can afford the volatility, and

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.390
you want to go for rapid growth.
When you're 35, you don't necessarily want

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.780
to be -- you want to tone it down a little
bit.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.049
When you're 65, you know, you can't afford
to lose that money.

00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:27.120
You've got medical bills.
You've got bingo bills. [laughter]

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.790
What are you going to do? It's life or death.
So, what happens?

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.280
How do you actually turn this into investing?
What do you do?

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:41.480
And just quickly -- at the bottom of this
pyramid of investing is where you have the

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.190
most control -- stocks, bonds, cash -- you
can pick individual stocks.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.360
Most people think this is what investing is,
and they get overwhelmed because, How are

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.799
you supposed to know what stock to pick?
So, they came up with mutual funds and index

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:55.870
funds.
And instead of having some smart guy in New

00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.110
York pick it for you, they have a computer
mirror it and cut your fees by a tremendous

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.690
amount.
Great, the problem with index funds is that

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.500
you still have to create an asset allocation.
You can't just buy one index fund.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.960
You have to buy like an international fund,
a domestic fund, large cap fund.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.220
And people don't do that.
They're horrible at it.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.990
So then, they recently came up with something
called "life cycle funds" or "target date

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.160
funds".
How many of you guys have heard of that phrase?

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.320
Life cycle or target? Excellent.
And I know that that's an option that they

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.030
offer here, which is perfect, because people
think -- they say, "Oh, yeah, asset allocation

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.730
is really important."
But psychologically, they don't want to get

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.460
in there and rebalance, because rebalancing
is really hard.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.049
So people don't do it.
That's why Granny, in 2008, sometimes lost

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:39.220
65 percent of her money -- which she never
should have -- because she was improperly

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.280
allocated.
So you pick the target date fund, a low-cost,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.200
target date fund where you have access to.
And basically, you don't have to worry about

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.730
rebalancing over time.
All you have to worry about is funneling as

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.240
much money as possible into it.
That's it. I will teach you to be rich.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.179
Reduce your choices.
Focus on the stuff that matters, and then,

00:31:56.179 --> 00:32:01.500
get on with your life. Okay?
That's investing in a nutshell. So what do

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.350
you do now?
First, you want to get your credit cards straight.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.590
Make sure you've got the right credit cards.
Make sure you're taking advantage of every

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.840
benefit they offer.
Call them up and ask for something called

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.559
their Booklet of Benefits, so you'll know
all about the purchase protection and warrantees

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:18.049
and all that stuff. Use it.
It saves you hundred dollars of dollars a

00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:22.210
year if you do.
Go through, set up the right accounts -- investing,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.790
savings, checking accounts.
Look at your conscious spending. I'm not telling

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.940
you to keep a budget.
You can actually do it in one day.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.169
Just plug your info into something like Mint
and or, you know, you can do it in Quicken

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:35.120
and look at your last month and just start
from there, okay?

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.190
It doesn't have to be difficult.
After that, you basically automate it.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.840
That will take about a week or two to get
set up straight.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.470
And make sure your investments are right.
And then, that's it.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.270
It's really about just getting on with your
life.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:50.370
It's not about becoming a financial expert.
So with that, I want to leave plenty of time

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.630
for questions.
And I want to emphasize before we get to those

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.470
that this is all about living a rich life,
right?

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:59.090
It's not about the money itself.
As you can tell, the most intellectually exciting

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.429
part for me is the automation, because you
figure out how to make all these models work

00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:05.190
and everything go.
It's not about the money.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:09.570
The money is nice, but it's about being able
to live a rich life -- whether it's shoes

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.460
or jeans or travel or charity -- or whatever
it may be.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.080
So, with that said, let's open it up for questions.
Yes.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.230
Q So, I really appreciate you being here,
first of all.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:18.910
Second of all, it seems like it's pretty easy
to get your retirement and asset allocation

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.370
put away and have that secure.
So, once you feel comfortable with your long-term

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.049
retirement savings, how do you focus on short-term
investments, like I have a down payment -- figure

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:30.480
in a few years, I've got that going on.
And maybe I have a Master's degree going forth.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:40.179
How do you make sure investments for that?

00:33:40.179 --> 00:33:49.190
A That's a great question.
The question is, How do you -- you've already

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.980
got your retirement handled -- how do you
think about short-term investments?

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.130
And I would actually flip it and say, "Think
about it as short-term savings."

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.550
Anything above five years roughly, you can
go ahead and invest that, depending how long

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.620
it is out.
But for something that I'm planning to do

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.600
in the next five, seven years, I would just
put it in a sub-savings account.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.500
And this is something I call the ten-year
strategy.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.559
A lot of people say, "Well, I already got
my retirement handled.

00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:13.979
What am I supposed to do now?
I have a little bit extra money."

00:34:13.979 --> 00:34:18.629
Simple. Go ask someone ten years older than
you what they wish they had saved for.

00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:24.200
And they will say things that we don't think
about -- diapers, insurance -- all these weird

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.419
things that we don't think about.
And then, create a sub-savings account and

00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:30.119
simply put it in there, and that's it.

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:31.311
Q You're barely making inflation.

00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:34.329
Ramit: You're barely making inflation, but
if you have a goal in the next, roughly, three

00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:38.069
to five years, you don't want to undertake
the volatility, and you're not going to make

00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:40.869
that much in three years anyway.
So it's better to just go for security in

00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:44.599
that case and save.
Things that we typically need to save for

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:49.999
are, down payment on a house, kids, car, wedding.
Those are some of the things that are life

00:34:49.999 --> 00:34:53.450
events for many of us.
Yeah, Ben.

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:58.859
Q How do you negotiate if you don't have mutual
funds?

00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:02.150
Ramit: Question is, How do you negotiate with
something like cable when they know they have

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.940
a monopoly and you don't have another choice?
Well, first of all, you're not talking to

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.410
like, the head strategist at Comcast.
You're talking to a customer service rep.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.430
So I just decide to crush them.
I don't tell them that.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:17.010
Remember, these companies pay hundreds of
dollars to acquire you as a customer.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.140
So they don't want to lose you.
So, you can say, "Well, I'm going to cancel."

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.170
Or what would I say these days?
I'm going to use Hulu, all right?

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.809
They are petrified of this.
So use whatever tactics you have.

00:35:26.809 --> 00:35:29.731
And by the way, remember, if it doesn't work
the first time, say, 'Thank you very much'

00:35:29.731 --> 00:35:34.849
 -- you're always polite; you're always respectful.
Hang up. Call back in a week and try another

00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:36.481
test.
I love testing these guys, because you can

00:35:36.481 --> 00:35:49.559
figure out what actually works.
Other questions. Yes.

00:35:49.559 --> 00:35:53.702
Q So explain why do the Roth 401k is better
than the traditional? because I have [indecipherable]

00:35:53.702 --> 00:35:59.349
Ramit: Okay, question is, Why is Roth 401k
better than a traditional 401k?

00:35:59.349 --> 00:36:02.190
And it's actually a pretty complex question.
I don't want to go too in-depth.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:08.180
But in general, for people in their 20's and
30's, a Roth 401k for tax purposes can be

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.539
better. It can be better.
As you get older, it becomes a little more

00:36:11.539 --> 00:36:14.950
dicey, because the taxes are different on
a Roth or a traditional 401k.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:20.119
So as you get older and you have a different
set of outcomes and income levels, then it

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:22.289
varies.
We could talk offline, but for most people

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:26.680
in their 20's and 30's, Roth, whether it's
IRA or 401k, is a pretty good choice. Yes.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:39.819
Q You mentioned in one of your blogs that
you're better off with maxing out your 401K

00:36:39.819 --> 00:36:41.359
before taxes?

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:48.079
Ramit: Question is, in one of my slides I
mentioned that 'you should max out your 401k

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:51.500
before going to pay off debt' but since interest
rates are so high on these credit cards, what

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.289
should you do?
So actually, what I said in the slide was

00:36:54.289 --> 00:36:57.970
'max out up to your match'.
So if you -- I know here, you get something

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:02.000
like a three percent match, a hundred percent.
Etc.. Whatever the numbers are.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.650
Maxing out your match is free money.
And then, going and paying off your debt is

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.589
good.
And then, if you still have money, you can

00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:11.380
go back to your 401k and pick up the rest
of that.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.869
So the match is important, but you're right.
Debt levels -- debt interest rates are extremely

00:37:15.869 --> 00:37:18.759
high.
So you have to carefully weigh that.

00:37:18.759 --> 00:37:19.759
Yep.

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:20.859
Q [inaudible]

00:37:20.859 --> 00:37:23.049
Ramit: Better to buy or lease a car? Easy
answer.

00:37:23.049 --> 00:37:27.460
For most people, it's better to buy.
The only people who should lease cars are

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.290
companies -- because you get some tax benefits
 -- and really rich people who are like, "You

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.099
know what?
I'm just going to buy a new Mercedes next

00:37:34.099 --> 00:37:37.190
year, so screw it."
Those are the only two types of people who

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:40.589
should lease.
It almost never makes sense for individuals

00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:43.039
to lease.
Buying a car whether it's used or new -- I

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:45.130
bought a new car.
Of course, I'm Indian, so I bought a Honda

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.819
Accord.
It was either that or a Camry.

00:37:47.819 --> 00:37:57.430
I mean, I don't have any choices. [laughter]
So that's what I got. Other questions?

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:58.430
Yes.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.430
Q [inaudible]

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:04.559
Ramit: Oh, God. Okay. Great question.
Question is, I get a lot of advice from my

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:07.529
parents about buying a house.
What do you think we should do, particularly

00:38:07.529 --> 00:38:11.019
living in the Bay Area?
So, okay, let me say it very clearly.

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:15.140
Real estate is not the best investment that
all Americans have thought it is.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.160
If you run the numbers, you need to remember
a couple things.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.549
First of all, people say, "Well, you get the
tax benefit for buying a house."

00:38:22.549 --> 00:38:26.390
The answer to that is, you don't spend a dollar
to save thirty cents, okay?

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:30.890
It makes sense in some areas, particularly
in the Midwest, it can make a lot of sense.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.229
That's Part 1. Part 2 -- when people look
 -- so, let's say my rent is $2,000, okay?

00:38:35.229 --> 00:38:41.390
Let's say that I find a mortgage that's $2,000.
So you're like, "Oh, might as well build equity."

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:45.670
Hold on a minute.
Your mortgage -- you have to add -- listen

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:51.880
closely -- you have to add 40 to 50 percent
for maintenance, taxes, insurance, to actually

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.479
cover your out-of-pocket costs.
And remember, you have to amortize your roof

00:38:56.479 --> 00:39:00.539
or your dishwasher, which is going to cost
$500 or $25,000 into those costs.

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:02.450
So people forget that. And there's a third
part.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:05.359
They forget that when you buy a house, you
all of a sudden increase your spending.

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:08.940
You all of a sudden start getting magazines
like Better Homes and Living Gardens or whatever

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.680
it's called.
And you buy, you know, these nice vases.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.279
So you have to factor these things in.
For some people, it makes sense.

00:39:15.279 --> 00:39:19.570
But when you run the actual numbers, it becomes
a lot less attractive on the coasts to buy

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.619
it as an investment.
Also remember that all your money will be

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:26.150
going into this one fixed investment, which
is very, very risky, okay?

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.951
So, I'm not trying to say it's bad all the
time.

00:39:28.951 --> 00:39:32.660
I am trying to say that, Americans -- especially
our parents who don't know anything about

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.869
money, because no one knows anything about
money -- have just blindly repeated this thing.

00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:38.910
"Oh, real estate, real estate, build equity,
tax ben--."

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.650
What? Ask them to actually run the numbers
with you, and they will quickly -- like, they'll

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:46.510
say, "Oh, I got to go watch something on TV."
[laughter]

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.200
Yes, question in the back.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.299
Q [inaudible]

00:39:51.299 --> 00:39:56.569
Ramit: Good question. The question is, where
should I learn about building up a good credit

00:39:56.569 --> 00:40:01.039
score? Okay.
So, the single best place is to actually go

00:40:01.039 --> 00:40:02.450
to the source.
Go to myFICO.com.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:06.381
And they have a nice pie chart right there
that will show you what your credit score

00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:09.399
is made up of.
Like 35 percent of it -- the largest portion

00:40:09.399 --> 00:40:11.219
 -- is made up of just paying your bills on
time.

00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:14.900
Which is one reason why, if you automate,
you'll never miss a payment.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:19.119
So, it's not complicated, but it does take
some consistent work.

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:24.839
That's why, if you just give it time and automation,
it's kind of like nurturing your credit plant.

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:31.660
That's my new analogy. Other questions? Yes.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.140
Q Back to the house question.
Pulling money from a Roth 401 or IRA, is it

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.759
okay for a first time home buyer?

00:40:36.759 --> 00:40:41.380
Ramit: Sure. If you have a Roth IRA or, indeed,
many different types of retirement accounts,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.190
you can actually pull the money out penalty-free
 -- and there are exceptions in some of these,

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:49.160
like buying a house -- you won't pay a penalty.
If you're going to buy a house, absolutely.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.930
That's a fine place to pull it out. I prefer
not.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:55.369
I prefer you have a separate sub-savings account.
But, you know, if you've got your money in

00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:58.869
there, and you want to pull some of it out
for a down payment, sure. Yeah.

00:40:58.869 --> 00:41:02.239
Q [inaudible]

00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:08.890
Ramit: Yeah. Question is, How do you handle
sub-savings accounts if you don't have something

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:15.559
like ING?
So there's two answers to that. One is, Excel.

00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:17.799
If you're like, you know, a big Excel nerd,
that's fine.

00:41:17.799 --> 00:41:20.599
The other thing is, just get an account that
does.

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:24.640
Because, like I said, you might be motivated
now, but I am not motivated six months from

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.380
now.
I want it to be all automatic.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.559
And I think we all know like, we don't want
to be focusing on this stuff.

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:34.039
So, either do it in Excel and commit to that,
or just get an account that does that.

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:36.309
Other questions? Yes.

00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:39.569
Q What do you think about [inaudible]

00:41:39.569 --> 00:41:43.599
Ramit: What do I think about credit watch
sites like Equifax?

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:47.900
They're okay.
These sites basically will alert you if something's

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.619
going on with your credit -- if it's gone
up or down.

00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:54.989
I think there's a new site called CreditKarma.com
which lets you do this for free.

00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:58.180
I personally don't understand how it works,
so I don't want to recommend it or not, but

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.520
you can check it out.
A lot of people are using it. These sites

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.619
are okay.
They charge about 9.95 a month.

00:42:02.619 --> 00:42:10.440
Basically, you can get your free credit score
and credit report, and I put the details in

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.650
the book. These are fine.
I mean, if you really are anal about it, that's

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.180
fine.
Personally, you can just check it once a year.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.329
You'll probably be fine.
Yeah, I mean, this is like -- that's a question

00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:21.400
of someone who's already done 85 percent of
the work, and they really want to get down

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.749
to the nitty-gritty.
And if that's you, then absolutely, you should

00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:25.359
do it if it makes you comfortable.

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:28.960
Q You showed an example -- your personal example
 -- like Charles Schwab checking and ING savings.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.289
You mentioned like, you made a comparison
to inboxes that your inbox that you are -- are

00:42:33.289 --> 00:42:38.119
you just using that to make your money sort
of movable and then putting all the rest in

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:44.940
your savings at ING or do you have a savings
at Charles Schwab?

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:54.079
Ramit: Okay, so the question was, Do I use
labels and archiving and, you know, all these

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:59.670
shortcuts for my bank accounts?
Do I have just a savings account and a checking

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.219
account?
Mine has gotten a little bit more complicated

00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:05.229
than when I initially started, because I have
a business account and things like that.

00:43:05.229 --> 00:43:11.319
But you can get a hundred percent of your
needs as an individual met with one good checking

00:43:11.319 --> 00:43:14.650
account and one good savings account, and
then, your investment accounts.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:27.579
You don't need to get any fancier than that.
Okay? Yes, Tolu.

00:43:27.579 --> 00:43:30.740
Q [inaudible]

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:36.900
Ramit: Yeah. Ad words consulting. [laughter]
All right.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:41.550
Okay, so question is, How do I earn more on
the side without being in conflict with Google

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.880
or my employer?
I would urge you to think broadly about your

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.400
skill set.
People here, especially -- you guys are supertalented.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.359
And it's not just that you know how to optimize
ad words.

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:56.549
It's that you know how to build all my funnels
or you are even really good at writing copy

00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:59.640
for -- not even for ads -- just for something
else.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.410
Or you're a good project manager, right?
So I've got a friend who -- this is a true

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.180
story by the way -- it's happened in the last
two weeks.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.910
So I was giving a webcast. I do live webcasts
on my site.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.559
And I was just talking about earning more
and telling people, "Here are some ways you

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:13.729
can think about it."
And I was saying, "Look, there are people

00:44:13.729 --> 00:44:18.319
like me who are horrible at cooking, don't
know how to cook, and don't want to cook,

00:44:18.319 --> 00:44:20.130
and I'm busy.
I want someone to just do it for me."

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:23.630
So he writes me an e-mail afterwards.
I think he's like an engineer, but he loves

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:26.200
cooking.
And he spends a thousand dollars a month on

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.469
groceries just because he loves it.
He said, "Hey, Ramit.

00:44:28.469 --> 00:44:31.920
Come to my house this weekend, and I'll teach
you how to cook.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.859
You'll know five good dishes by the end."
I wrote back -- I'm like, "No, no, no.

00:44:34.859 --> 00:44:36.630
You misunderstand me.
I don't want to learn.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:41.279
I want someone to do it for me."
He's now bringing food over to me Sunday nights

00:44:41.279 --> 00:44:44.759
in Tupperware, clearly labeled.
The guy now has two clients, and he makes

00:44:44.759 --> 00:44:48.069
over $1,500 a month -- just with two clients
in the last two weeks.

00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:50.529
That was his hobby. He turned it into his
skill.

00:44:50.529 --> 00:44:54.180
So I'm actually launching something on my
own site right now to help people identify

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.219
the niche of people who want what you guys
have to offer.

00:44:58.219 --> 00:45:02.279
And then, earning that money on the side -- something
you can do with a few hours of work.

00:45:02.279 --> 00:45:06.059
The results are actually pretty powerful -- we've
got people who are earning, you know, thousands

00:45:06.059 --> 00:45:09.300
of dollars with a few hours of work every
month.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.400
So that's how you do it on the side.
Other questions.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.769
Q I have a question from San Francisco.

00:45:16.769 --> 00:45:17.769
Ramit: Sure.

00:45:17.769 --> 00:45:23.060
Q So, I actually -- I own your book -- and
I was trying to put together the conscious

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.369
spending plan.
And with regard to the fifty to sixty percent

00:45:26.369 --> 00:45:33.339
on fixed costs, I know that -- the way that
you built it out -- that comes after tax.

00:45:33.339 --> 00:45:38.039
And so, how would you recommend that we factor
that out at a company like Google where we're

00:45:38.039 --> 00:45:44.450
getting a lot of fixed costs factored in pretax?
For example, you know, I pay something like

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:49.269
60 bucks pretax a month on my bus pass and
my gym membership.

00:45:49.269 --> 00:45:53.190
And so, that definitely kind of changes the
balance a little bit.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:58.440
And I was just -- kind of wanted to ask you
how to kind of factor that in for people like

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.609
us who want to do the conscious spending plan
as well?

00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:05.019
Ramit: That is a tough question.
What I would try to do is just look at the

00:46:05.019 --> 00:46:08.779
simplest case first.
Just forget about taxes and look at what you

00:46:08.779 --> 00:46:13.619
are paying -- like I did in my diagram.
And then, after that, you can take the certain

00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:17.329
areas where you're getting pretax benefits
and you can factor those in too.

00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:21.799
There's really not a great, simple answer
for this one, because it's so different depending

00:46:21.799 --> 00:46:25.930
on, you know, are you using an HSA or your
bus pass or whatever it might be.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:30.729
Basic bottom line I would say is, "Start off
with the simplest example you can, and then

00:46:30.729 --> 00:46:34.930
just deduct the taxes out of there.
In the grand scheme of things, it shouldn't

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.680
be too big of a deal, since those expenses
are fairly small anyway.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.630
Hope that helps.
Okay, any last questions? Okay.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:47.410
Well, I think we will wrap it up there.
Thank you guys very much.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:47.849
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
