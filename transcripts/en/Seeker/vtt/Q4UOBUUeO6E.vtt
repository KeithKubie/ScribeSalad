This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Ting: mobile that makes sense.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.339
THE SEA STARS ARE DYING OFF AND TURNING INTO
GOO.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.440
WHAT KIND OF NIGHTMARE PLANET ARE WE ON?!

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.870
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.210
One of my first experiences that I can remember
with the ocean involved a huge wall of sea

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.210
stars.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.550
Guys -- it was magical.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.390
So it's slightly traumatizing to hear that
some kind of plague is sweeping the sea star

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.439
population.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.759
Last November, scientists up in the Vancouver
and Seattle region started noticing something

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.470
really strange: hundreds of sea stars had
their limbs detached and their bodies turned

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.470
to goo.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.539
At this point in their investigation, the
scientists think it's a pathogen that debilitates

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.820
their immune systems.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.690
The limbs dissolve off and fall away while
the infection just disintegrates the rest

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.829
of the poor animal.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.809
Since November, the disease has spread down
the coast as far south as Mexico, and they've

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.110
even seen it in Maine and New Jersey.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.050
In some populations, up to 95% of the sea
stars have died off.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.750
So, we've seen illnesses like this before,
and it's all turned out okay - but this time

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.670
is particularly alarming because of the SHEER
NUMBER of animals that are dying.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.600
Plus, it's been almost a year and...well...they
still don't know WHAT exactly the disease

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.500
is or HOW it's happening!

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.770
The fact that it's on 2 separate coasts with
no connection to each other is strange - how

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.049
the heck is this thing spreading?

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.250
It's also concerning because sea stars are
top predators in their ecosystem.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.770
They're the keystone, the backbone, the star
of the tide pool show!

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.610
Without them (or without an adequate population
of them) the balance of the tide pools could

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.940
change in a few key ways.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.539
For one, sea stars feed on mussels, so without
any threat, we could see a massive mussel

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:35.539
takeover!

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.530
Which, to be honest, my stomach probably wouldn't
mind.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.829
I might be able to handle those excess mussels
singlehandedly.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.680
But on a more serious note: slugs.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.979
Sea stars also eat sea slugs, or more specifically,
slug larvae.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.869
So without any population control, those could
also take over.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.619
These critters all play a role in maintaining
the chain of command in the ecosystem -- they

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.189
regulate the availability of nutrients for
other animals and aerate the sediment.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.299
It's probably not the end of the world as
we know it, but hey: it's significant.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.130
The fact that multiple species of animals
are dying off without explanation is a big

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.360
deal -- especially given what we know about
humans' contribution to polluting our oceans.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.330
In recent years, we're responsible for all
kinds of toxins that wreck unknowable havoc

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.850
on marine life -- but hey, we can't be sure
yet that there's a connection there.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.780
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone,
we'll be back soon with more science updates.
