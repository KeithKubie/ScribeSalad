00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.080
One of the most surprising aspects about one
of the saddest of all human possibilities,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.940
suicide, is that the suicide rate goes up
markedly the richer and more developed a society

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.199
becomes. We might expect suicide rates to
vary across time and place, but not to increase

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.859
alongside developments in wealth, comfort
and security. That we should be unwittingly

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.259
creating nations in which more of us end up
killing ourselves at our own hands appears

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:40.460
to negate the whole purpose of economic growth.
Nevertheless, the disturbing connection was

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.650
first conclusively identified towards the
end of the 19th century by the leading French

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.400
sociologist, Emile Durkheim – and has continued
to be noted ever since. The suicide rate of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.150
an undeveloped country like the Democratic
Republic of the Congo is a fraction of the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.400
rate in a developed nation like South Korea.
The crucial factor behind people’s decision

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.340
to end their lives is not really wealth or
poverty. As Durkheim discovered, it is the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.399
extent to which the surrounding culture ascribes
responsibility for failure to individuals

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:22.890
or else maintains a faith that poor luck,
or divine intervention is to blame instead.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.920
It so happens that as societies become modern
and industrialised, they very frequently give

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.439
up their beliefs in demons and gods and start
instead to trust in a meritocratic, individualistic

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.240
philosophy that suggests to people that their
fate is always in their own hands. This may

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.139
sound generous but it carries an immense psychological
burden, for it means that – when failures

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:54.609
occur – the individual is held entirely
responsible for them. Reversals start to seem

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.420
like a horrendous judgement on one’s worth
and a public humiliation from which there

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.460
may, at the extreme, seem no escape other
than through annihilation.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.860
There are two big cultural ideas that may help to
mitigate the pressures upon us: Luck and Tragedy.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.130
To believe in Luck is accurately to observe
that merit and success are in fact never reliably

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.700
aligned; one may be a fool and win – or
a virtuous person and fail. If we fully internalise

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.860
and widely share the notion of luck, then
the shame of failure will be greatly reduced

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.651
and our agony along with it. We will be able
to admit, publically and to ourselves, that

00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:47.340
decent people can fail in their outward circumstances
and, therefore, that professional success

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.401
isn’t the only, or even, the crucial marker
of the merit of human beings.A Tragedy, as

00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:59.870
it originated in Ancient Greece, is the story
of a capable and intelligent person who happens

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.820
to make a small mistake – which, however,
leads to appalling consequences. The point

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.210
of presenting such stories in very public
ways (at Greek festivals the entire community

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.650
had to attend) was to continually renew acquaintance
with a hugely important idea: that one can

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.680
be a likable, even admirable person, and end
up in an utterly desperate situation. Tragedy

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.320
is the careful telling of how disaster can
come into the lives of people like (or even

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.250
a bit nicer) than us. They – and hence we
– are always deserving of compassion rather

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.570
than contempt. Durkheim knew that it is not
prosperity by itself that increases the suicide

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.340
rate, the toxic element is an unwittingly
cruel culture that assigns a high burden of

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.810
responsibility to us, while seeming to deny
the truth that chance and tragedy will of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.470
course always continue to affect our destinies.
The real solution to a high suicide rate lies

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.360
in an unexpected place: an ideology that firmly
reminds us that we are never the sole authors

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.800
of our destinies.  and therfore should neither panic nor celebrate when we win or loose.
