00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.480
With superheroes dominating the box office
around the world, the average movie fan can

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.920
probably tell you the biggest points in any
superhero’s origin story.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.890
But the origin stories and classic comic arcs
that every fan knows by heart are usually

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.109
the ones the publisher wants them to remember.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.400
Even the brightest heroes tend to have some
dark stories in their past.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.210
And when we say dark, we mean so dark, fans
will wonder why they were ever published in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.210
the first place.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.620
Here are Screenrant’s DARK Stories About
The Most Popular Superheroes.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.460
Spider-Man: Sins Past (Marvel)

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.680
Thanks to the Amazing Spider-Man movie series,
even non comic fans know just how beloved

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.780
and innocent Peter Parker's first girlfriend
Gwen Stacy was - which made her death at the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.160
hands of Green Goblin so shocking.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.070
But when J Michael Straczynski told the Marvel
editors he wanted to give Peter an adult child

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.510
Gwen had delivered in secret, they turned
him down, wanting to keep the illusion that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.059
Peter was still a young man.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.530
Instead, the change to Gwen's secret past
was a bit more complicated – and a lot less

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.530
logical.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.460
Apparently, Gwen found herself so attracted
to Harry Osborn’s father Norman, she spontaneously

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.000
slept with him while she and Peter were together.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.940
That's right, Norman Osborn impregnated a
teenage Gwen Stacy.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.040
When she promised the madman that he would
never see his children and would raise them

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.040
with Peter, he suited up as Goblin one last
time, leading to her death in issue #121.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.940
Changing the past happens all the time in
comics, but this story left most fans outraged

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.210
and upset - not to mention in need of a hot
shower.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.800
Superman: The Suicide Snare (DC Comics)

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.290
There's no greater love story than Mister
Miracle and Big Barda, two children of Apokolips

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.430
who fell in love, and escaped to Earth.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.790
That was until writer John Byrne had Barda
end up kidnapped by Sleez, a former minion

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.610
of Darkseid with...even darker tastes.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.580
Using mind control, he doesn't seek to beat
or even kidnap Barda, but strip her down,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.540
and make an adult film of her dancing in his
sewer.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.500
By the time her husband finds out – with
one video hand-delivered by Darkseid - Superman

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.590
is already on the case.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.920
Actually, he's been brainwashed to co-star
with Barda in Sleez's next movie.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.700
Mister Miracle breaks in just in time, leaving
readers to wonder what could possibly have

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.880
made this story seem like one that should
ever be told, let alone one starring Superman

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
himself.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.480
On the plus side, it shows Superman isn’t
always a gentleman: instead of explaining

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.980
or uncovering what happened, they all go their
separate ways.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.850
Because, you know, he’s Superman.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.970
Green Lantern: Emerald Twilight (DC Comics)

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.460
When DC decided to kill off Barry Allen, they
had the speedster sacrifice himself to save

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.460
the universe.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.010
But when it came to his best friend Hal Jordan,
the writers tried something different.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.640
Instead of a sacrifice, readers watched as
his home Coast City was turned to ash along

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.850
with the millions who lived there.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.680
When the Green Lantern Corps refused to let
him bring the dead back to life, Hal went

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.200
on a killing spree.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.000
The greatest Lantern slaughtering the entire
corps and all except one of their Guardians

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.980
would eventually be rewritten to spare Hal
any blame, claiming he had been “infected”

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.700
with an embodiment of fear, and driven insane.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.460
But there's no way to forget that DC once
turned a Justice League superstar into a bloodthirsty

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.130
murderer on a galactic level.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.190
Spider-Man &amp; The Power Pack (Marvel)

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.360
The 1980s and 90s saw tons of comics reaching
out to kids, teaching them to steer clear

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.600
of drugs, alcohol, or even physical abuse.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.380
So it isn’t hard to see why Marvel chose
to use their famous webslinger for such a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.380
good cause.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.260
In a 1984 issue, Peter Parker rescues his
young neighbor from his babysitter, sharing

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.980
a story form his own childhood.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.900
Apparently, Peter became friends with an older
boy named Skip Westcott when he was around

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.170
12 years old.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.069
One day Skip showed Peter some adult magazines,
and pressured him into acting out the pictures

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.180
themselves.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.569
Saying he was “too frightened to leave,”
it would be years before Peter realized he

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.569
shouldn’t be ashamed.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.000
It was a strong message to send to young readers,
but ever since, fans have debated just how

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.290
much of the Spider-Man identity was a result
of the abuse.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.319
And it’s no surprise that Marvel has decided
to keep that side of his character out of

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.819
the live-action movies.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.819
Batman: Venom (DC Comics)

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.950
These days, the strength-enhancing drug called
“Venom” is tied directly to Bane, the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.020
Batman villain who uses it to grow to insane
size and strength.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.090
But the drug was introduced long before Bane
got his hands on it, in a comic meant to show

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.120
Bruce Wayne’s earlier days of costumed crime-fighting.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.709
In Legends of The Dark Knight, readers got
to see one of Batman’s first failures, when

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.380
he wasn’t strong enough to save a kidnapped
girl from drowning.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.660
Since he couldn’t forget the girl he had
let die, Batman turned to Venom – and his

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.640
slow descent into a laughing, grinning, and
out of control addict followed.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.539
When he finally realizes that he’s gone
too far, Batman demands Alfred lock him in

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.150
the Batcave for a month, and not to let him
out for any reason.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.129
Quitting cold turkey brought Bruce’s worst
demons to the surface, showing comic fans

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:32.800
that the heart of Batman was darker and more
damaged than most realize.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.080
The Incredible Hulk: Monster (Marvel Comics)

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.960
Thanks to Ang Lee's first crack at a live-action
Hulk movie, audiences now know that the mild-mannered

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.620
Bruce Banner came from a truly broken home,
with a raging father who regularly beat both

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.939
Bruce and his mother, Rebecca.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.030
That origin story was ripped from the pages
of Marvel Comics, but left out some of the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.710
darkest parts.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.189
Even though Bruce would only become the Hulk
when exposed to Gamma rays as an adult, his

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:00.090
father was convinced that Bruce's intelligence
at a young age was the result of radiation

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.319
he had passed onto him.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.930
He was wrong, but beat the son he saw as a
monster and his mother anyway, eventually

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.009
killing Rebecca in front of Bruce.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.830
When Bruce visited his mother's grave while
in college, his father appeared to blame him

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.020
all over again, and the fight between the
two ended with Bruce knocking his former abuser

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.279
into his mother’s headstone, killing him
instantly.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.169
To cope with killing his own father, Bruce
just blocked it out, convincing himself for

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.330
years that his father had left to be killed
by muggers.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.340
Maybe the Hulk wasn’t really the monster
side, after all?

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.139
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.940
