00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.669
Okay, let's get
these cameras set.

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:05.405
Perfect.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:08.508
Everything's recorded,
nobody can betray me.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.511
And there's absolutely nothing
that can go wrong,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.046
that's for sure.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.580
â€˜Cause it's all on tape, right?

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.649
That's right, Donald.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.117
Hey buddy!

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.418
When you watch this tape,

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:23.390
remember that you set these
cameras up and don't get scared.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.629
Hi, uh, this is Elizabeth Warren
and I need two pizzas.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.432
And I want it sent
to my home address,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:39.472
which is 222 Cherokee Drive,
Pocahontas, Massachusetts.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.607
(sounding out)
Anominous?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.213
(organ playing)

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.848
I don't see what the big deal
is,

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.517
kids love being separated
from their families.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.718
It's like camp.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.520
(sounding out)
Omininous?

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:58.558
(organ playing)

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.634
(rock music)

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.372
(knocking)
Come on, Mike!

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:14.406
I'm trying, sir! I don't-

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.676
(knocking harder)
Shred it all, shred it all!

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.811
I'm trying! You can only
do one at a time!

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:21.280
Why did we write all this stuff
down in the first place?!

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:22.515
I don't remem-

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.317
(sounding out)
Amuminous?

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.720
...frustrate parts of his agenda
and his worst inclinations.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.490
I should know,
I am one of them-

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.125
Mike, what the hell are you
doing at my desk?

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.393
Oh sir!

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.661
I was writing your memoirs,
because you didn't wanna do it.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.863
Oh, that's great.
I love memoirs.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:37.997
Sure, sure.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.866
They're the things in your head
that you cry about!

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.000
And then put on paper.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.736
Make sure you include
that I killed Osama bin Laden,

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.204
Uh huh.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.639
and that I passed
the healthcare bill,

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:47.807
Yes.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.176
and that I was the first
black president.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.211
Comin' right up sir.
