00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.779
What does massage do anyway, and are there
health benefits besides feeling really, really

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.740
good?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.150
Hey guys, Crystal here with DNews.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.789
I grew up a dancer and a gymnast, and therapeutic
massage was just a part of my athletic life.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.240
Even now after a tough week at the gym or
too much time spent on airplanes I turn to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.460
a masseur to work things out.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.650
Its no secret that massages make us feel good
and this fact has even been verified by science!

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.120
In one of my favorite mouse studies ever,
Caltech researchers identified a specific

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.590
set of sensory neurons common among mammals
that trigger pleasurable responses when activated

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.680
by a firm stroking sensation.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.170
Yes, some researcher massaged a bunch of mice
and then wrote a paper on it, because science

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.170
is awesome.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.539
But is massage actually helping to improve
muscle function and recovery after a hard

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.539
workout?

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.910
What are muscle “knots”?, and what about
those “toxins” that my masseur keeps talking

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.910
about?

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.579
A study by researchers at McMaster University
studied the biological changes in the muscles

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.000
of 11 young men after they pushed themselves
to exhaustion with exercise.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.180
Using biopsy of leg muscle tissue, the researchers
were able to show that a 10 minute post-workout

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.741
massage can reduce cellular stress and inflammation
in response to mechanical injury, increase

00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:24.330
mitochondrial production leading to improved
muscle repair and function, and reduce pain!

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.240
Notably absent in the study was any evidence
that massage could help clear lactic acid

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.840
from tired muscles or improve glycogen levels.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.030
Two benefits commonly associated with the
practice, So please, continue to drink water

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.100
after your workout and massage to keep your
body hydrated, but “flushing out the released

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.850
toxins” isn’t really a thing.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.930
The scientific literature is less clear when
it comes to defining just what is going on

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.079
when your muscle contracts into painful knots
or why massage seems to help.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.079
In fact there was very little in the way of
convincing literature out there on the subject,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.560
but the most compelling argument I found proposed
that a “muscle knot is your muscle remaining

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.310
flexed and refusing to relax,” and the result
of inflammation due to the release of lactic

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.310
acid.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.759
In this case massage of the affected area
would help reduce the inflammation and allow

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.129
the muscle to relax, similar to the ameliorating
effect of NonSteroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.450
like ibuprofen.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.480
But obviously more research is needed before
we can say we know for sure.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.430
So massage does actually help your muscles
heal and recover, and that positive affect

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.879
is from more than just physical manipulation
of your muscle tissue!

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.760
It actually increases activation of biochemical
pathways that respond to mechanical stress

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.180
and suppresses immune responses that lead
to inflammation.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.180
Pretty cool.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.200
Im totally going to use this new information
to justify more frequent massage appointments.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.870
Speaking of reducing pain, have you ever wondered
what the difference is between some of the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.489
most well-known over-the-counter pain relievers?

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.620
