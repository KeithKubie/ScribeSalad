00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.230
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Welcome everyone and welcome
to another at Google event.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.120
We're here today from the Mountain View campus
and we're very excited to welcome Stephen

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.800
Merchant who's coming through.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.559
[Applause]
[Cheering]

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.970
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's just to prove we don't
do laugh tracks.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.170
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: That was not as spontaneous
as I was hoping for.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.170
[Laughter]

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.010
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Cause we got,
[Claps]

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.680
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: "Oh, alright.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.359
I'm trying to eat."

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.359
[Laughter]

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.369
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So Stephen is actually performing
tonight.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.800
He's doing his stand up routine, "Hello Ladies"
at Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco and

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.120
we were lucky to grab him on his way through.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.480
So I was just gonna kind of ask some questions
but start

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.480
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: with how's the tour going?

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.480
This is final

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.480
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: This is the final show.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.550
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: show

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.770
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: final show, yes.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.399
Well, I did about 3 months in the UK and then
I found out that there were 72 fans of me

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.399
in America.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.399
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And so I decided to do

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.399
some shows here.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.780
So I did some in New York and a couple in
Los Angeles and I'm doing this one in San

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.780
Francisco.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.780
So far they've gone very well.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.780
America's always been excellent.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So 74 fans?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.490
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: 74 dynamite fans
[Laughter]

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.950
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And, um, sometimes in
the UK the audience can be a bit, even though

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.480
they're fans they can be a bit sort of
[Sigh]

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.950
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: "We had to come out, it

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.950
was raining.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.950
This better be funny."

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.750
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Where in America, generally

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.799
I find people have been really up front and
just set a really good atmosphere and everything.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.270
So, yeah it's been good fun.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.750
So yeah, this is the last show.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.920
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So coming to the last show
I know in doing a little, in reviewing some

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.229
of your interviews and stuff, that standup
you've done before, you kind of started that

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.229
way

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.229
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.440
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: but now you kind of had to
rediscover the muscle or how to exercise --

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Right.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: --this kind of muscle.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.509
So how are the muscles feeling at the end
of the tour?

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.040
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Muscles are lean and tight
[Laughter]

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.670
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You're ready for a long distance?

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.259
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well I, yes, I used to
do standup when I first left university and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.020
the audience was generally indifferent
completely indifferent, occasionally rising

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.920
to annoyance or anger.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.400
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I did it on and off for

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.849
a while then we started doing these TV shows
and we won awards and things and there was

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.620
no reason to carry on doing standup in small
clubs.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.819
Why was I going to drive for 3 hours to amuse
50 people?

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.560
And then just recently I sort of had the urge
to go back and start doing it again and its

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.660
bit, like I know, it's a bit like boxing,
I imagine.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Um, once you've been out

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.739
of the ring for awhile you've gotta get back
in and take some punches and get match fit

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.739
and everything.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.690
And so I just worked the show in all the clubs
here and there and then over time it sort

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.670
of developed and expanded and I started touring.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.630
So by the time I came to America I was in
pretty good shape, I hope.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.010
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So how much prep work did you
put in before you actually?

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.320
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Oh, a long time, I sort
of dabbled with it on and off for a couple

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320
of years.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.760
Not relentlessly but just when I had free
times and things.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.900
Just because I wanted to remind myself of,
sort of, whether I could do it and my, sort

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.910
of, what I would talk about and the thing
I kept on returning to, anecdotally, was just

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.159
sort of my failure with women
[Laughter]

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.319
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: You know people that work
in computers would understand that

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.940
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Is that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.940
[Laughter]

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.459
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: but out there in the real
world it can be tough meeting girls.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.560
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So, yeah, it was a lot

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.661
about my experience growing up as something
of a geek which I know is a surprise to a

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.760
lot of you but I was a bit of a nerd.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.130
And yeah, so that's the sort of spine of the
show but there's more stuff we talk about

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.130
as well.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.500
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Did you find the show evolves
every time?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.860
We actually had Mazer in awhile ago and he
kind of evolved the show with each performance.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.860
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.860
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do you find that helps?

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.380
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well it's interesting
cause he, I remember reading a quote with

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.739
him once where he said, "the thing with standup
is you sort of walk to the edge of the precipice

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.150
and then step off."

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.130
And that's the only way that you can sort
of be brave enough to be more interesting

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.760
or experimental because you've got to be willing
to fall and fail, potentially.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.069
I don't have that bravery.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.530
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Unlike Eddy, so I try

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.580
to be quite cautious and that was why I spent
so long, I think, working out in just small

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.470
clubs because I didn't, I didn't, I suppose
I was a reputation I had and a certain expectation

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.100
and it's uncomfortable the idea of sort of
performing to a thousand people and trying

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.410
an idea and it just crashing and burning and
it's just that can be, it's just agonizing.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.590
So I think in a weird way I probably braver
when I was younger but I think I'm better

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.020
at it now if you know what I mean.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.720
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And did you find that there's
that kind of joke that hits one night and

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720
doesn't really hit the second night?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.250
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So bizarre, it's so bizarre
and I can't under, there's no rhyme or reason

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.210
it can sometimes be to do with the shape of
the room, the size of the room.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.400
They always say in comedy never blame the
audience.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.660
It's never the audiences fault.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.390
It's always the audiences fault.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.570
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: If they don't laugh it

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.880
has nothing to do with me.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.360
It's because they are not paying attention,
because they're stupid

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.820
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: whatever the reason.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.000
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well, you know your audience.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah, I know my audience.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.380
Yeah I just, there's no rhyme or reason to
it it's just sometimes the audience doesn't

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.410
gel as an audience, you know, it's like there's
little pockets of people but they're not this

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.720
one organism laughing and enjoying it.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.120
Other times they're all, they move as one,
they think as one, they laugh as one and it's

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.840
a very strange experience.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Are there parts of the act
that you had worked on or had done in the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.470
UK and then when you came to the US they had
a profoundly different reaction?

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.710
Or stuff that really resonated different?

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.120
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I was concerned about
that and, actually, there's a comedian friend

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.580
of mine who I actually sent the show to, a
taping of the show, for him to look through

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.330
and point out all the references that wouldn't
make sense and substitutions and, just little

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.100
things like we say pedophile, you say pedophile
[Laughter]

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.710
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: You know just little things
like that.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.130
Just to give you a flavor of the show.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.130
[Laughter]

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.430
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: How much of a break did you
actually take from writing TV while doing

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.430
this?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.419
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well once I was on the
road I didn't, I didn't do anything except

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.020
do the show really.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.229
I mean, it's just schlepping around, journey
after journey and I thought it would be a

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.400
lot more exciting on the road.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.080
I thought it would be a lot more glamorous,
I thought there'd be a lot more groupies

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.259
[Laughter]

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.270
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: What's a lot more?

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.420
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Some, some groupies.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.590
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: but there wasn't.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.760
There wasn't disappointing, disappointingly
and I, a lot of, a lot of the groupies I have

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.000
tend to be, sort of, middle age guys who work,
who work in tech support.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.410
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: No disrespect if there's

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.410
any here.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.330
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah, but not the kind

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.160
of playboy bunnies that I was expecting.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.680
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: but there we are.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.530
But so just kind of touring, it's not as exciting
as I thought and endless hotels rooms and

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.620
you get very bored of club sandwiches and
those little bottles of shampoo

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.620
[Laughter]

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.669
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Does boredom kind of bring
back the creative ideas about future shows?

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.740
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: It lets your mind wander
into other areas, I suppose.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.540
So you're thinking about other possible screen
plays or TV shows and stuff but nothing solid.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.710
A lot of it was just sitting around in my
underwear

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.759
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: in hotel rooms and, you

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.200
know, just counting the hours until, cause
it, when you know you got to do a show in

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.770
the evening there's this kind of strange low
hum of anxiety that builds all day.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.190
It sometimes can be a bit hard to concentrate
on anything else.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.610
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well, I know you started off
with radio as one of your main, "The Steve

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.610
Show"

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.610
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Right.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.610
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Which is well named

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.610
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Right.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.670
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And then you came, you keep
coming back to it as a medium that you're

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.670
comfortable with.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.670
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Radio?

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.670
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.670
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yes.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.889
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Is that something that you,
what is it about radio that you think

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:24.889
kind of keeps you coming back?

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.270
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well, radio and then,
obviously, later pod casting, one of the great

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.800
things is that it's a lot more, you know,
freedom, generally, in just terms of the sense

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.061
that the audience isn't expecting laughs a
minute, they have to pay attention, they have

00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:46.690
to concentrate so you can, you delve down
more, sort of, unusual avenues or you can

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:52.690
just ramble a lot which can be very engaging
and you, I think there's a sort of intimacy

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.690
with radio.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.580
It's like you're eavesdropping on a conversation
with friends, hopefully when it's at its best.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.800
With TV and with films and things there's
just so much more manufactured, you know,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.639
there's so much more production involved,
it just takes longer, there's so much more

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:10.669
money, there's so much more personnel and
so you just feel like you've got to just sort

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:12.900
of refine it and polish it and so on.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.770
Whereas with radio you can really talk rubbish
for as long as possible and that's fine.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.581
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And, yeah, there's just

00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:21.919
something different about it.

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:25.600
It's unique, it's immediate, I think, an idea
occurs to you and you can just say it.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.500
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And is having that sort of
diversity of maybe working on TV and then

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.810
radio and then doing standup, it just keeps
the ideas flowing cause I've heard, talking

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:38.669
to the other comedians who do go down the
TV route and they do a lot of it, it's kind

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.669
of tough to stay fresh.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.839
They feel they need to push themselves more.

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:44.700
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: it's not only that I think
it's also, it's very insular TV.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.430
You know, you, we don't work with a live audience
so you just sort of, there's a danger of forgetting

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.190
what it is that makes people laugh or how
to make people laugh.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.740
And so coming back out and doing standup I
think it's sort of reminded myself, I think

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.100
it's sort of, I think hopefully it will feed
back into the writing in a positive way.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.370
And, also, I felt like I was getting a bit,
in kind of complacent and it was good to,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.320
sort of, you know, to get out of your comfort
zone, as they say.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.339
often on American Idol or whatever
[Laughter]

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:16.450
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Does having a partner help
keep you out of your comfort zone?

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.650
Is that one of the reasons you decided to

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.650
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: a working partner?

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.650
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: yeah, go with a working partner?

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.650
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I know you're so worried about

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.650
the other

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.650
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah, I was gonna say
I don't have a love partner.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.790
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: A love partner.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.980
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: this is my partner in

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.980
love.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.591
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Um, yes, no it's good.

00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:35.120
It's good having a working partner because
you, you know, you just, you're constantly

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.620
bouncing ideas back and forth and you suggest
something and then he builds on it and it

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.860
can expand that way and stuff.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.571
But the good thing about standup is that the
difference from that is that you are, you're

00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:49.040
on your own so you have, you're working on
your own, you know, on your own and there's

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.570
something challenging about that.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.570
It's exciting.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.089
You know there's nowhere to run, you can't
hide behind anyone or anything.

00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:58.090
So, yeah, it forces you to sort of, to take
responsibility for yourself.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.029
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And when you were first starting
saying, "Okay, I definitely wanna do comedy"

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:04.519
were you saying, "I wanna be like" you know,
"those guys" Dudley Moore, Peter Cook, the

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:06.160
Pythons?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.399
Or were you saying, "No, it's just gonna be
me."

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.570
Or did you just kind of?

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.100
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: No, I shamelessly ripped
off various people and continue to do so;

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.029
John Cleese, was one of my first influences
and then later Woody Allen.

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:24.360
And then, my act, my standup act is really,
it's Woody Allen with a bit of Jack Benny

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.029
and Bob Hope but it's disguised with an English
accent so hopefully

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:29.700
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: You won't realize.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.649
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So it's all shamelessly

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:33.709
ripped off from other people.

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:37.560
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And you find you go back to
a lot of those kind of heroes and re watch

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560
their stuff?

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.079
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I tend not to so much
now.

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:43.290
Partly cause I'm worried I will literally
just steal joke ideas

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.160
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: But I think what it is,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.640
is you respond to certain comic traits.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.931
Like, Woody Allen, what I find revolutionary
when I first started listening to him was

00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:57.850
how, sort of, confessional it felt and how
honest and the fact that he felt like he was

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.850
talking about adult problems, you know, sex
and love and death and all these other things

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.650
which I never, sort of, heard in comedy before.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.420
So I think that's why those people are important
to you, not, it's not just cause you steal

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.750
from them but more that you feel, you feel
sort of empowered.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.100
Someone's done; someone's trodden the path
that you can kind of follow them down.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.130
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah you don't really wanna
meet them and say, "I really enjoyed stealing

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.410
from you over the years."

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.190
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: There, again, Woody Allen's
always been really honest about who he's sort

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.970
of lifted his persona from, so, yeah, I have
no shame in that.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.130
An also, I'm 6 foot 7, John Cleese is very
tall and he was always very physical and used

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.600
his body in every comic way which is something
I do in the standup as well.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.350
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And as you perform more and
more over time, you first, when you started

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:46.970
with the "Office" you only, I think it was
second season [inaudible], yeah, and then

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.060
with "Extras" with Darren Lamb and taking
on more of a central role in performing in

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.420
that kind of comfort zone and was that just
performing in general or were you kind of

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.770
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well we realized after
the "Office" that I'd missed a trick because

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.820
Ricky was getting paid three times
[Laughter]

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.750
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: as a writer, director
and an actor, I was only being paid twice.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.230
Plus he was also getting sent a lot of free
stuff.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Um, I don't know if you're

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.240
aware of this but if you are on TV people
just send you things for free; computers,

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.959
watches, clothes.

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:23.839
And I was angry about that and jealous and
decided I wanted some free stuff, so pretty,

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:25.639
much I've started performing for free stuff.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:28.620
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: That's my sole reason

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.620
to do it.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.620
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So you're flat as well

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.870
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I got lots of free stuff,
ya, TV and all sorts of stuff that I didn't

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.870
even pay for.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.870
[Laughter]

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.710
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So I was back in, I was actually
living in England when the "Office" has hit

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.161
and it was a huge success and then they were
talking, they had just broken the news that

00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:46.990
it was gonna be moving over the states, the
US, and how did that process work?

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.401
Did you have, once you guys practiced did
you think, "Oh this is definitely something

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:51.401
we would export?"

00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:54.779
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well I was always a huge
fan of American sitcoms.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:56.639
They were, again, a big influence on me.

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:02.370
"Mash" when I was younger, the later "Roseanne"
which I adored and "Friends" and "Seinfeld"

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.540
and I liked, one of the particular things
about "Friends" was it was kind of a soap

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.320
opera with laughs.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.990
You know, had a continued narrative, the romance
and so on, which we didn't tend to do in UK

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.990
TV.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.089
So that was one of the things that was important
for us was to have a sort of, a story arc,

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:23.350
if you like, which as I say, British sitcoms
didn't do very often and have a romantic thread

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.750
running through it.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:29.380
So when the idea of transporting it to American
happened it didn't seem crazy to me.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.420
People thought of it as being very British
and very small and insular but, actually,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.170
in our minds it was very influenced by American
things; by Billy Wilder films, This is Spinal

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.990
Tap and in some way by "Friends" as well.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.980
So it didn't seem crazy to us that they would
try and transpose it but what was important

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.430
was that Ricky and I didn't get involved closely
because we thought we would end up trying

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:55.990
to replicate ours bit by bit and that we always
knew was gonna be madness, really.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.320
So we felt it was important to just find someone
here who could just, cause what do we really

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.269
know about the mechanics of working 9 to 5
in America?

00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:07.490
So it was important that we work with Greg
Daniels, very closely.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.260
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And now that kind of approach,
you've got what, I think there's "Office"

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.269
in Israel, Germany, France, French Canadian

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:16.430
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: French Canadian

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.430
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sweden?

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.820
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I don't think there's
one in Sweden, there's one in South America

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.820
somewhere.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.820
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah, Brazil and Chile.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.820
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Chile, that's right.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.820
I thought it was Bolivia.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.820
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Not in Brazil?

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.820
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Not in Brazil, thank you
for that.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.160
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: My accountant there.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.500
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Not in bloody Brazil.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I got to see a Japanese

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.920
version where they just do a really good days
work and go home.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920
[Laughter]

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.570
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: But looking back in hindsight,
the idea, there's always, the work environment,

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.639
there's something strangely familiar.

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:49.430
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I think the work environment
is, well I don't know, I don't work here and

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:54.029
I don't know, I know there's this, Google's
got kind of a relaxed approach but my suspicion

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:58.029
is wherever you work, NASA, the mob, anywhere
[Laughter]

00:14:58.029 --> 00:15:02.241
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: You still get annoyed
about, in a power politics and then someone

00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:07.610
borrowed your chair, you've written your name
on the back and this is my chair.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.970
This is Dave's, he's got Dave's, and people
still get annoyed with that.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.699
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So, to us, there were

00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:18.680
certain universal things like the fact that
you're often, you work alongside people who,

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.370
and you spend more time with them, probably,
than your friends and family at times, so

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.540
if you don't get along it can cause a lot
of friction.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:29.190
And there just seems to be a number of just
universal aspects of working in offices which,

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.610
hopefully, is what we translated.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:35.600
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And looking back, obviously,
in hindsight, it's kind of clear that that

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.690
structure worked and paid off but do you think
it's something you'd ever like to revisit?

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.899
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: The show itself?

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.170
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah and actually do it again
cause you only, there was only 2 seasons and

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.330
now US is, I think, on its 8th season?

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.480
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.880
Would we revisit?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:55.360
I've got affection for it I just think going
back to it now would be, would probably be

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360
a mistake.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.980
So, I directed an episode of the American
version which was great, it was like being

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.840
in a kind of bizarro parallel universe
[Laughter]

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.390
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Looked very similar but
everyone was better looking

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.300
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I don't think we will

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.510
go back to it but never say never.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.230
Once some of the free stuff starts coming,
stops coming in

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.519
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: and we need the money

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:19.700
and I'm living in my car then we'll definitely
do it, yeah.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.360
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And kind of continuing on TV,
you've recently finished the first season

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.029
of "Life's too Short" how to did that come
to pass?

00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:31.410
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well, we worked with Warwick
Davis in our show extras and Warwick was in

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.279
"Willow" and he's in the "Harry Potter" he
was in "Return of the Jedi" and he worked

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:40.709
with us on a lot of extras and he said, "I
wonder if there's a show sort of exploring

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:45.700
the adventures or misadventures of a little
person which is what he is and the more he

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:51.209
told us about kind of the experiences from
his own life the more it amused us and it

00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:57.180
sort of seemed like an interesting perspective
and it allowed us to, we like characters who

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.430
have chips on their shoulder in some way.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.329
You know, David Brent had issues and all the
characters we've had and what we liked about

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:08.490
Warwick's character was making him a small
person with a small man complex.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.760
You know, he's Napoleonic in some way, he
feels like he deserves more and that he would

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.350
be perfectly happy as the real Warwick is
if he just accepted who he is and just lived

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.140
is life as best he could.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:26.740
But the character of Warwick in the show is
very desperate and so, although it's, the

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:32.400
little person aspect is just something to
sort of motivate his behavior, it could have

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.059
been anything.

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:40.380
And so, a little bit like "Extras" there are
celebrity appearances; Liam Neeson pops up,

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.360
Johnny Depp is in one, Sting and all the time,
Warwick is kind of hustling trying to climb

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360
the ladder.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.730
He plays a version of himself, the real Warwick
is very successful, in the show he's making

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:56.870
much less so, and in the show he's sort of
battling with a divorce and he's got a terrible

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:02.210
tax bill and so he's constantly, and he also
runs an agency for small actors all of who

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.210
he's exploiting.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.490
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Making them do the worst

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.480
possible jobs while he takes the good stuff
for himself.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.160
So yeah, so that's the sort of,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.480
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And you and Ricky play yourselves?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.559
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Ricky and I are in it
occasionally as ourselves.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:19.630
He comes to us and he's desperate for work
and he's, sort of, constantly bothering us.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.760
And the joke is it's as though everyone we've
ever worked with is constantly hassling us

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.309
for work and they keep coming to our office
and we can never get anything done and then

00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:31.730
the one episode Johnny Depp is making Tim
Burton's "Rumpelstiltskin"

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.120
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And wants to get in the

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.080
mindset of a small person so he's spending
time with Warwick and

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.420
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And through that encounters

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.310
Ricky and badmouths him at the Golden Globes
and so it's, it's his opportunity for revenge.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:50.080
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And how is it to play yourself
after, you're obviously writing for it but

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.490
you're yourself in the

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.580
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: We don't, it's not hard.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.580
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: It's

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.920
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do you practice in the mirror
or, are you me?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.920
Am I you?

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.920
[Laughter]

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.750
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I heard Jerry Seinfeld
won an Emmy for his role in Seinfeld and then

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.080
a year later he lost and he made the point
that, "Oh, I wasn't as convincing as myself

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.340
this year as I was last year."

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.559
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah, Ricky and I just

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:16.650
sit there and it's a lot of improvising and
it's not difficult.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.179
Most of the time in the scenes I'm just texting
or not paying attention.

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:21.179
[Laughter]

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:22.179
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Ordering free stuff.

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:23.179
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah.

00:19:23.179 --> 00:19:24.179
Exactly, exactly.

00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:28.309
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well, I wanna open up to questions
in a sec so folks wanna go over to the mic.

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:32.840
You've also built up a lot of experience in
voice over now, both in animated as well as

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.390
in video games with weekly.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.179
How did that, when they originally called
you and said, "Hey, video game, wanna try

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.320
it?" were you into it?

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.320
Were you a gamer?

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.010
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I was a big video gamer
when I was younger and then when I got a life

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.100
I stopped.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.630
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: No I just stopped, I just

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.750
stopped playing cause I didn't have the time
to play as much and I was never very good

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.700
so it would take me months to finish a game.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.250
And so I sort of, I think we knew what was
happening in the video game world and then

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:05.090
they contacted me and I just thought that
would be interesting, something different

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.700
to do and then when I mention it to people,
people got very excited, the Portal 2, they

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.640
obviously heard a lot about the first one,
they played it, they loved it, so then I started

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.659
feeling this tremendous responsibility of
this weight of expectation

00:20:16.659 --> 00:20:18.570
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And I worked really hard

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:24.559
on that and I thought I just swung in in and
do a sort of half assed voice over, take the

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.559
money
[Laughter]

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:30.070
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: and I was in this booth
for hours shouting down imaginary corridors

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.570
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: and then, of course, what

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:35.980
I didn't realize was with a video game every
possible option that you could play you've

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.980
got to cover.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.799
So if some idiot goes down the wrong corridor
[Laughter]

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:41.960
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: and doesn't know how to
get out of it you've got to have things for

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.520
them and it went on and on just every option.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And I was thinking, oh,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:55.950
anyway, eventually we did like four four hour
sessions or something and then it just seemed

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.590
to be really popular and they let me improvise
but they were very good, the guys involved,

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.929
and it turned out to be really good.

00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:03.890
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Have you started actually playing?

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.549
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: They told me they'd send
a free copy.

00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:06.549
[Laughter]

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:07.549
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Only right.

00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:08.650
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: They didn't, they haven't
sent one.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.460
I've already, I'm not gonna buy money.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.340
I'm not gonna spend money on a game I was
involved with.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So I haven't played it,

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.490
I don't know.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.220
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And the name Wheatley, have
you come to own that.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:23.080
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I'm amazed at how many
people, particularly, a lot of the people

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.450
that wait for me outside the stage door and
have pictures of Wheatley they've drawn or

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.250
they've made models of Wheatley and stuff,
which is crazy, amazing.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.100
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I know pathetic, right?

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.210
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I'm sorry, no, I mean

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.210
beautiful.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.210
But, no, seriously great, it's amazing.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.520
I don't think I realized how much people engage
with video games.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.990
It sort of, in my, in the same way you do
with a TV show or a film that they respond

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.440
to, people respond to video games in the same
way.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.750
So I was, it was revolutional, I just was
amazing and dumbfounded.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.250
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Why don't we turn it over to
some questions from the group?

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:59.300
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi, thanks for coming out, in the
recent interview with, I think it was with

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.570
Dinner Party Download, you admitted that you've
never seen any of the Rocky movies.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.690
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: The Rocky movies?

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:05.830
No, I've never seen any of the Rocky movies,
no.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:10.049
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, they kind of gave you a hard
time about that like couldn't believe you

00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:11.049
hadn't seen the movies.

00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:14.080
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, so I was wondering if you

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.340
have an equivalent British movie or show that
you elicit the same reaction from you, like

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.340
I

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.090
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Oh, like if someone said
they hadn't seen it?

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:29.970
Um, well, I'm constantly, I mean it never
surprises me the people, that people aren't

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.990
aware of great British TV and films.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.549
What would be the one that I would be surprised
by?

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:44.110
Hm, I guess something like "I'm Alan Partridge"
or "Fawlty Towers."

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.250
That was baffling to me, you know, cause they're
just such a phenomenon.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:52.420
The weirdest one is there's a double act that
were huge in Britain in the 70s called "Morcambe

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.860
and Wise" who were the biggest thing on British
television and they still are legends.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:02.050
Now they were, they used to get sort of 18
million viewers at Christmas.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.130
Their Christmas special was the most hotly
anticipated thing every year and no one over

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.390
here generally knows them.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.830
And, again, I have shamelessly stolen from
their act knowing no one over here know anything

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:12.830
about it.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So whenever I do a film

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.780
over here I'm just ripping those guys off.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.270
Safe from the knowledge no one knows.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.980
&gt;&gt;male #2: Yeah, hi, thank you for coming.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.980
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Thank you.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.110
&gt;&gt;male #2: I have to confess I did bring my
copy of Portal 2

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.110
[Laughter]

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.110
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Not a problem.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.110
&gt;&gt;male #2: I hope that's not to sad or pathetic.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.110
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Don't worry, don't worry.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.110
[Laughter]

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.020
&gt;&gt;male #2: But I think, I think among all
major or kind of, kind of well known British

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.990
comedians, I think you're probably the last
person who hasn't been on Doctor Who yet.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.990
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Right.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.730
&gt;&gt;male #2: Has Stephen Merchant, or Stephen
Moffat, rather, contacted you at all?

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.140
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I've had no contact from
Doctor Who.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:49.880
We did an episode of "Extras" where we mocked
the way the comedians would pop up in Doctor

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.880
Who
[Laughter]

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.910
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: as a monster, we had Ricky
in a sort of bad prosthetic, and the guy that

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.530
was playing Doctor Who, named David Tennant,
throw salt in his eyes cause he's like a giant

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.530
slug.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.510
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: He throws salt at him

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.510
and he's like, "Ah!"

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.610
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So maybe we upset the

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:07.610
people at Doctor Who.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.779
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: with that and neither

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:12.559
him or I have had any calls from them.

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:15.350
So who knows, I'd rather play Doctor Who.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.150
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I'd rather do that I think.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.290
It's basically like Sherlock Holmes in space
isn't it?

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.870
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And I always liked the

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.029
idea of doing Sherlock Holmes as well.

00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:29.221
I was also angling for the role of Q in the
James Bond films but

00:24:29.221 --> 00:24:30.570
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: But they gave that to

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.910
some good looking young bloke, you know, which
annoyed me but

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.210
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Come on Bond pay attention!

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.210
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: It'd be brilliant.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.210
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Amazing.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.210
[Applause]

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.830
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I think you got the part.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:47.710
&gt;&gt;male #3: I hate to say it but I'm yet another
one of the Portal 2 fans.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:48.710
[Laughter]

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.710
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Sure.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:50.860
&gt;&gt;male #3: I hope you're not offended but
I actually had not heard of you

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.860
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Okay.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.669
&gt;&gt;male #3: before Portal 2 came out but what
I was wondering was of course you were known

00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:58.720
for the "Office" and stuff before you actually
did that and, of course, now you have a different

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.720
set of fans

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yes.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720
&gt;&gt;male #2: because you did Portal 2.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.929
The question is did you notice anything change
in like how fans, like how those sets of fans

00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:08.690
acted differently toward you?

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:15.650
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Um, they, they are, well,
it's interesting because occasionally I would

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:22.660
stumble across conversations, often online,
about, between Portal fans and people who

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.029
knew me before.

00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:27.500
I mean it's, "You only know him cause he was
Wheatley, we've know him before!

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.500
We knew him for five years before that!"

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And they just get so angry,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.100
"He's not just a computer!

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.150
He's not just a robot!"

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And it's incredible, I

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720
mean, thank you, it's fine.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.100
They're both welcome and it's amazing.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.320
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Passionate people.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.260
I don't go near blogs and things cause those
people terrify me.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.809
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: It's absolutely terrifying.

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:47.240
And I think I would have been the same.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240
I would have been those people.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.360
I would have been equally, kind of, angry
and passionate about things.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:26:00.590
But, the sort of Wheatley people, pertaining
to the fans that I've met are far more, are

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.590
far more passionate than people I've met through
the TV stuff.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:12.590
Quite a lot of sort of younger girls, like
15 year old women who kind of quiver as they

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:19.539
come up, "It's Wheatley" they draw a picture
or something, it's very sweet, very nice but

00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:20.539
yeah.

00:26:20.539 --> 00:26:27.690
As I say it's like they, the character itself
is really important to them.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:32.860
I guess, again, if you spend, you know, five
or six hours and I'm just talking to you the

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.860
whole time

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.860
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Five or six?

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.580
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Or longer, yeah, it may
seem like we're friends

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.960
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: by the end of it but we're

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.710
not, we're definitely not.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.779
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So kindly step away.

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:46.779
[Laughter]

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:48.409
&gt;&gt;male #4: Thanks for coming

00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:50.159
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Thank you.

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:53.610
&gt;&gt;male #4: I just have to ask, is Karl Pilkington
real?

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.610
[Laughter]

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.070
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Is Karl Pilkington real?

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.070
Uh, well

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.580
&gt;&gt;male #4: Is he a prod and go type guy?

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.220
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah, he is a humanoid.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.590
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: He, I mean, Karl is unique.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.730
There's no one like him.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:12.039
I mean, he, I can't explain Karl to people,
it's sort of, I mean, he is obviously a moron.

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:14.980
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: but sort of like a genius

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.159
moron like an idiot savant.

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:21.059
It's, sometimes he doesn't know what he's
talking about, occasionally he does and he'll

00:27:21.059 --> 00:27:24.929
stumble across an amazing point, a profound
point.

00:27:24.929 --> 00:27:30.030
We were talking to him once about how there's
a lot of these reality stars who are only

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:35.890
famous because of the people that, their fathers,
their fathers or parents, you know; Kim Kardashian

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.890
or whoever.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.120
And Karl said, "Well, you could say the same
about Jesus."

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.150
[Laughter]

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.260
&gt;&gt;male #4: Thank you.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:49.430
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And, actually, just to take
one moment to give a little more context for

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.111
folks who haven't seen it, Karl was, worked
on the show

00:27:53.111 --> 00:27:56.620
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Right, so Karl worked
on a radio show and then we started asking

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.140
him questions and he was just a guy pressing
buttons and things, and we started asking

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:06.340
him questions and he just started saying the
most bizarre things.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.190
What was that one thing, "You never see, you
never see a young Chinese person."

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.190
[Laughter]

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.190
&gt;&gt;audience member: You never see an old man
eat a Twix.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:19.000
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: "You never see an old
man eat a Twix which is a candy bar."

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.120
Or no, "You only ever see really old Chinese
people or very young Chinese people.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.549
You never see Chinese people in the middle"
was his observation.

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:26.870
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Bizarre.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.110
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And then you invited him in
to regulate

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.200
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And then we started asking,
every week we'd ask him questions and he would

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.510
just come out with just utter gobbly goop.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: He's fascinated by monkeys,

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:45.360
he's fascinated by insects, to him insects
are, he can't compute that they have no motivation

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.190
for what they're doing beyond a sort of basic
insect motivation.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.590
To him they're rationalizing it.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.340
Like, an ant carrying a twig going, "I don't
know why I'm carrying this twig.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.640
Where am I taking it?"

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.179
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: He can't imagine that

00:28:56.179 --> 00:28:58.550
they just do things because of instinct.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.679
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So the perfect person to send
into other climates.

00:29:00.679 --> 00:29:03.230
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Not only to send into
other climates but you just, on the radio

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:08.669
or on the podcast, you just prod him and he'll
go down avenues which can seem offensive but

00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:11.200
you know are born out of ignorance not through
any malice.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Just pure ignorance

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.020
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And you try to explain

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:22.299
to him things like the infinite monkeys, model
of infinity, you know, an infinite number

00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:26.809
of monkeys given enough typewriters will eventually
do the complete works of Shakespeare, and

00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:29.220
he's like "So have they read Shakespeare?"

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.320
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: No, it's just random,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.840
it's just random.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.450
"Okay, they must know first, they know the
plots, they know the plots."

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:41.090
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: He's remarkable.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.020
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And there's "An idiot Abroad"
one and two and now three?

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.299
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: No, "An Idiot Abroad"
two just started airing on the science channel

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:51.960
in the U.S. the Science Channel, that's absurd!

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.470
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: This is why we send Collin

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.380
around, this time he's doing the Bucket List,
so it's things to do before you die.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.179
And he chose the list but obviously when he
shows up it's obviously not the things he

00:30:02.179 --> 00:30:03.179
thought.

00:30:03.179 --> 00:30:05.210
So he thought he'd be swimming with dolphins,
he swam with sharks.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.809
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And so, just routine mischief.

00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:11.960
&gt;&gt;male #5: Hi Stephen, a question about the
"Office."

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yes.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.980
&gt;&gt;male #5: Obviously I think the character
of David Brent kind of predated the show itself

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.549
and it was kind of Ricky's creation but were
there any aspects of the Office that you would

00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:25.370
like to take credit for now, whether that's
characters or plots, do you have clearly defined

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.940
roles as writers or do you just bounce it
back and forth?

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:33.210
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Not really, um, Ricky
had some observations about sort of office

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.210
types.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.890
But they weren't sort of coalesced into characters
really and then when we started working on

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:44.210
it we sort of expanded that character and
then we started slotting in the other kinds

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.780
of people that we felt we'd worked with in
offices in the past.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.210
But it was never as demarcated as this is
my bit and this is his.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:59.690
We always sit in a room together and we just
keep talking until ideas bubble up and then

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:04.460
often we'll share anecdotes so we'll talk
about people that we've met who are like David

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:10.540
Brent or who are like Garret and then any
kind of things that spark from them we make

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.540
notes of.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.529
So it's a much more organic process than one
of us going away and writing dialogue for

00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:17.120
Tim and Dawn or something.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.419
We're always in a room together.

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:22.210
So it's not really as defined as that.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:29.020
I'm sure there are aspects that have come
from me but I can't, I can't remember specifics

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:35.270
&gt;&gt;male #5: Sorry, I was just gonna say in
terms of comedy writing partnerships, you

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.519
were in the movie "Hall Pass" last year, I
may go as far as to say you were the best

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:39.519
thing

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:40.519
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Thank you.

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:41.519
&gt;&gt;male #5: about "Hall Pass" last year.

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:43.441
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #5: I actually met the Farrelly brothers

00:31:43.441 --> 00:31:45.450
last year and they're really nice people.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:46.450
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Lovely guys.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.970
&gt;&gt;male #5: And I was just kind of wondering
what your experience was kind of seeing how

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:49.970
they work?

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.480
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I love the Farrelly brothers,
they're amazing.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:59.020
They, obviously being brothers they have a
strange sort of simpatico way of thinking

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.460
and working.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.080
But they're not dissimilar to the way Ricky
and I work.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.380
They sit, they huddle behind little monitors
looking at the performances and are gossiping

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.890
with each other, probably saying the tall
English guy was a terrible mistake.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.080
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: "You're doing a great

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080
job!"

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.080
"What are we gonna do with this"
[Laughter]

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.409
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Which is very much like
Ricky and I operate.

00:32:16.409 --> 00:32:19.049
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: "Well done, Johnny Depp!"

00:32:19.049 --> 00:32:21.440
"This is crazy, what were we thinking?"

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.029
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: But they, they're just

00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:26.320
very easy going.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.559
They let the actors improvise and play around
with the script, they're not precious, they

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:34.120
create a great atmosphere on the set, you
know, it all sort of seems very supported

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.530
and particularly in comedy I think you need
that.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.529
You need the opportunity, like I was saying
earlier, you need that with any to walk to

00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:42.710
edge and walk off and do silly things or brave
things.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.669
So I really enjoyed working with them.

00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:45.669
They're great, they're really good.

00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:47.200
&gt;&gt;male #5: Great, thank you.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.430
&gt;&gt;male #6: Hi, Stephen.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:52.500
Thanks for coming in today and I'm with you
on the Malcombe and Wise comment, absolutely

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.500
great.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.210
Anyway my, just developing the idea of the
"Office" what's your favorite scene from the

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.480
"Office" or are you most proud of looking
back on it?

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.130
And that's the British Office.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.020
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well, I'm very proud of
the moments of drama, I feel like that was

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.930
stuff that always felt like the hardest dive.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:14.429
And there's an episode where the character,
Tim, decides to sort of confess his feelings

00:33:14.429 --> 00:33:19.550
to the receptionist and he takes his microphone
off and sort of, it's like a fake interview

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.690
and takes it off and unplugs it and the show
goes silent at that point, you can't hear

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.690
what he's saying to her.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:28.740
And that was one of those moments where I
just felt like everything coalesced, you know,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.600
the star of the show, the fake documentary
and it was realistic but it was also kind

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.120
of dramatic and you couldn't do that in any
other medium cause you wouldn't have a microphone

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.299
to pull off and so I just thought that was
a moment where everything kind of, and it

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:46.210
was really effective and the performances
were great in that, you know?

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.752
It was just one of the moments where what
you imagined in the writing room was just

00:33:48.752 --> 00:33:51.190
sort of better than you could have hoped for,
really.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.460
So that's the stuff that I really love.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.830
But, also the funny dance.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.830
[Laughter]

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:56.910
&gt;&gt;male #6: Thank you.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:03.659
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And with "Cemetery Junction"
that's a dromedary, dromedary, dramedy, would

00:34:03.659 --> 00:34:05.510
you like to do more drama in the future?

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:10.790
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah and I don't know
that I'm naturally inclined to it.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:17.310
The thing I love most is drama, it's the thing
I watch as a fan, you know, "The Wild" "The

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:21.889
Sopranos" and that's the stuff I'd rather
do but I'm always fearful of being one of

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:28.540
those comedy people who goes into drama and
is just terrible at it and that makes me anxious.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:33.240
So I feel like I'll ease my way into it and
hopefully add more drama to the humor.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.970
But the thing I think we've done is hopefully
born out of truth, in some way, or observations

00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:42.369
we've experienced, in the standup or in the
TV shows.

00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:47.090
No matter how silly they get it's always hopefully
grounded in some kind of reality.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.242
And that seems, to me, sort of the basis of
drama as well so I feel there is some sort

00:34:50.242 --> 00:34:52.010
of middle ground somewhere.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.109
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And now you have a three way
as a writer, actor and director.

00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:56.109
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Right.

00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:58.760
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Is there one that you're really
feeling right now?

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.900
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Well, as an actor I always
feel that I'm just, when I do something like

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.910
the Farrelly brother's movie, I'm just showing
up cause I know it's gonna be good fun.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.460
You know, it's just, I don't have any responsibilities
I just have to learn my lines and be silly

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.200
on screen and that's easy.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.359
So I love that, that's like taking a day off,
it's like a holiday, that stuff whereas the

00:35:18.359 --> 00:35:22.599
writing and the stuff Ricky and I make or
anything I might do on my own, that's just

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:23.599
labor intensive.

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:28.780
You know, the standup, it's hard work to then
make it look easy.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.200
And I never got into show business for hard
work.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.780
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I got into it for the

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.170
groupies, that didn't work out.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.660
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And for the free stuff

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.780
and that is.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.650
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So, yeah.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.270
I don't know, maybe do another film.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.770
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi, Stephen.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:44.890
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Hello.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.450
&gt;&gt;female #1: thank you for coming.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.290
Besides being a Googler I'm also a filmmaker
because for some reason I like to live in

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.290
perpetual suffering.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.290
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Sure.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:54.290
[Chuckles]

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:57.710
&gt;&gt;female #1: I wanted to ask you, by any chance,
if you have any advice for someone wanting

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.120
to write and direct comedy?

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.890
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Writing and directing
comedy?

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.240
Right, well, steal from the best.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.470
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: That's the first one.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:10.981
Um, it's tricky, I do think, it seems a cliché
but I think the writing what you know, at

00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:14.390
least to begin with, seems a good way in.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:21.270
I think, uh, it was sort of what we did with
the "Office" we; it was all based on our observations

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.089
and experiences of that.

00:36:25.089 --> 00:36:31.020
Sometime, the more unique you are in your
own experience the more people seem to relate

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.020
to it.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:36.130
It's when you start trying to second guess
the audience, that's when it gets harder.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:40.540
You know, when you try and write something
imaging what people are gonna find funny,

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.270
that I've always found troublesome whereas
if you write something that you think is very

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.579
funny and is very personal to you and is,
perhaps, a unique experience it's amazing

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:49.410
how many people connect with that.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.140
So that's the way I always sort of proceed.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.230
But I do think writing in partnership is good.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.180
I think, you know, particularly in comedy
it's good to have someone to bounce ideas

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.180
off.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:04.390
It's much harder to just sit in front of a
typewriter on your own.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.390
A typewriter.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:06.390
[Laughter]

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.180
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And also I think having
it read out loud.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:14.900
The sooner you can have people read it, perhaps
in a room like this in front of people, the

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.710
sooner you'll realize what isn't funny and
what is and how hard it is.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.690
That's the best I can offer you.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.800
&gt;&gt;female #1: And about directing?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.920
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And directing, um, point
the camera in the right direction

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.430
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Just make sure it's on

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.500
the face unless it should be on something
else.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.510
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Again, I think, keep it

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.510
simple.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.900
Don't, there's no need, personally I'm a fan
of people like Billy Wilder who were never

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.070
terribly flash in the way they shot things
they just tried to, it was all about the performances

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.570
and making them as effective as possible because
in the end

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.599
[Clears throat]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: telling the story is the

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:50.599
most important thing.

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:51.680
That's what people engage with.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.500
You can show off all you'd like with crane
shots and tracking shots and shooting from

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:01.250
behind a fireplace and people can applaud
but it's not necessarily engaging or useful

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:02.250
to the story.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.390
I think, so keep it simple.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:09.270
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Were you surprised at how much
hard work just writing in the entertainment

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.270
world was?

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.660
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: yeah, it's crazy.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.660
It's terrible.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.660
It's really hard work.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.280
But it's not as hard as doing Portal 2.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.119
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: That is the hardest thing.

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:18.240
It's just shouting.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.540
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah I suppose, it's funny,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.290
it's just weird and I feel like for the first
time I can say this is what I do now, professionally.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.730
I always felt like I was sort of keen amateur
who couldn't quite believe that they were

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.730
doing this for a living.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:31.730
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Someone was gonna clue in and

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.050
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah eddy points all is
gonna sort say, "This is silly go back to

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:35.050
a real job."

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.220
But, no, so far we've got away with it.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.240
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So if you were doing a real
job what would that be?

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.700
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: If I was doing a real
job, um,

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.700
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Carphone warehouse?

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.790
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Carphone warehouse.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: probably, I don't know,

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.530
maybe a teacher, I guess.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:53.640
I like to think of myself as a kind of dead
poet society Robin Williams figure

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.810
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: energizing kid's imaginations

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:56.810
but I wouldn't.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:58.619
I'd just be one of those ones that shows up
and takes the money

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.430
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I don't give a damn about

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.430
these kids
[Laughter]

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.510
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: goes home again.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.910
&gt;&gt;male #7: Last year we had Phil Rosenthal
who created "Everybody Loves Raymond" the

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:12.220
traditional sitcom and I got to ask him the
same question I wanted to ask you.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.730
How do you feel about four camera shows where
there's a live audience versus the one camera

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.650
show like the "Office" and "30 Rock?"

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.210
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I don't have snobbery
toward them.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:26.730
I know some people are a bit snooty about
the four camera traditional sitcom.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:32.060
A lot of my favorites, as I say, were always
shot like that, "Friends" "Seinfeld" and probably

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.820
"Roseanne."

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.120
I've no, I don't have a, I think if a show
is right for it it can be very good.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.040
I think "The Big Bang Theory" is very charming
and often very funny and that works well because

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.570
there are very kind of cartoony characters
and they are clearly playing off the audience

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:47.570
a lot.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:50.339
A shot of the "Office" would have never worked
that way because it had to be like a fake

00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:53.420
documentary that was built into the fabric
of the show.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.740
But, I suppose, with the single cameras it's
a little more cinematic maybe, a little bit

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.460
more in the lineage of comedy movies.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:07.650
But, as I say, I think that sort of live performance
in front of an audience brings a different

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.780
dynamic, there's an energy to those shows
that is very engage, very infectious I think.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:17.110
So, I see now, I just think it's all about
what is right for the subject matter.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.500
I certainly don't think there's any reason
why we should try and get rid of one or the

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.500
other.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.390
&gt;&gt;male #7: Have you seen their movie "Exporting
Raymond" where they take

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.800
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: No I've heard it's very
interesting, yes, that's where they take it

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.880
all over the world, right?

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.930
&gt;&gt;male #7: They take it to Russia, yeah.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.010
They've showed that here.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.530
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: The Russian "Everyone
Loves Raymond" wow, fascinating, yeah.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.340
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Where is the Russian "Office?"

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.960
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I mean there's a lot of

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960
people in that country.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960
[Laughter]

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.450
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I wanna take a quick moment
and see do we have folks on VC?

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:50.400
I know London and, ask a question or is that
too tough?

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.850
Okay, out of time, okay we'll do about two
more questions, one more question maybe now.

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:56.850
[Laughter]

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.860
&gt;&gt;male #8: Going back to the real job question,
you like free stuff, we have tons of free

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.860
stuff here at Google.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.860
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Keep talking.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.860
[Laughter]

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.860
&gt;&gt;male #8: We're hiring.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.860
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Okay.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.010
&gt;&gt;male #8: So, would you like to come work
here at Google?

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.010
[Laughter]

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.682
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Okay, let me ask you this,
what do you do at Google?

00:41:11.682 --> 00:41:12.682
[Laughter]

00:41:12.682 --> 00:41:13.682
&gt;&gt;male #8: Well, there's launch and then there's

00:41:13.682 --> 00:41:18.960
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I mean, isn't, isn't it,
all I know is I type something into Google

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.270
and it tells me, but that's the computer doing
that, right?

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.470
That's not you people
[Laughter]

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.710
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: When I'm typing in, you
know, "porn" you're not going, "Steve wants

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.440
porn what's, what do you think he's in to?"

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.560
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: You're not, that's not

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.780
you doing that right?

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.079
So what are you, what's going on?

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:38.220
Are you feeding all the information into Google?

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.359
I'm so confused.

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:41.700
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I can't understand how

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:42.700
it's this big.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.700
I honestly
[Laughter]

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.541
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: It's like a man and I
guess there's some IT guys who've got to keep

00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:48.770
the computers up and running
[Laughter]

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:49.770
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And the typewriters

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:53.109
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: And someone who changes
the little Google thing like if it's Halloween

00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:54.410
they put little
[Laughter]

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.599
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: they put a little jack-o-lantern
but it's just, aside from that what are you

00:41:58.599 --> 00:41:59.599
up to?

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:00.599
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: That's pretty much it,

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:01.599
right?

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:02.599
[Laughter]

00:42:02.599 --> 00:42:03.599
&gt;&gt;male #8: I gotta get back to work.

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:04.630
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Okay, good.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: But doing what?

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:09.350
[Laughter]

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.640
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Okay, I think, I wanna allow
one more.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.040
&gt;&gt;female #2: Um, one quick question, so obviously
there's a big philosophical difference between

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.030
American television shows and British television
shows

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.030
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Right.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:24.100
&gt;&gt;female #2: Where Americans, you wanna keep
it on as long as possible and all this syndication,

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.530
how do you feel about that, especially with
a lot of the projects that you've been working

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:29.530
on?

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.150
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Um, the idea of keeping
the shows running a long time, well obviously

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:36.040
it's financially it's better for me.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.190
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: So don't forget to watch

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.140
the "Office" Thursdays, NBC.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.589
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: But, I don't, I mean I

00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:47.569
was always a big fan, as I said, of American
shows and I love the fact that they were on

00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:51.800
every week, you know, for like 25 weeks a
year and I could watch "Make a Date" every

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.990
week, that was great to me.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.089
I never, I mean, obviously creatively there's
probably a point at which you're gonna run

00:42:56.089 --> 00:43:00.869
out of steam but they, you know, they rejuvenate
the show by bringing in new writers and so

00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:01.869
on.

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:05.829
In the end I think what makes it suffer is
that the actors grow weary and they wanna

00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:07.350
move on and do other stuff.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.839
I remember toward the end of "Roseanne" where
John Goodman was doing more and more films

00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:14.170
so every week they'd be like, "Where's Dad?"

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.280
"He's away doing some work out of town."

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.980
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Hm?

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.950
And so yeah, I think it can be disappointing
from a viewers point of view but I don't sort

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:30.470
of see a, yeah, it obviously makes more sense
to be able to wrap it up nicely and conclude

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:35.870
it but I think, for instance, the last series
of "Friends" I thought they found a new energy

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:39.200
and sort of rejuvenated the show and it, and
I thought the ending was very beautifully

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200
done.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.700
The last episode of "Mash" was fantastic so
I'm, I don't think that just the theory of

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.961
it is wrong, I just think it's hard to execute
well.

00:43:46.961 --> 00:43:50.690
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well I think, unfortunately,
that's all we have time for today.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:53.670
But, actually, one last question, so what's
next?

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.490
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Just put my feet up, I
think, really I just feel very tired.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.109
Hopefully spend some more time in the states
because I find it very nice here.

00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:05.440
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: I like it.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.550
And I, who knows, I don't know.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.270
Maybe some more standup, I honestly couldn't
tell you, I really couldn't.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.190
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That'd be a nice place to be
in.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.960
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: Yeah, maybe I'll work
here at Google.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.661
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Merchant: If I knew what you did.

00:44:15.661 --> 00:44:16.661
[Laughter]
[Applause]

00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:17.661
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Thanks again.

00:44:17.661 --> 00:44:17.662
[Applause]
