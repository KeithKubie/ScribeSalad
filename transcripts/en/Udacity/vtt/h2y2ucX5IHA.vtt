00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We've accomplished this first part to find which arts have coordinates.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's just stick our comments up here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now let's say, if we have any arts coords, make an image URL.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If points image URL equals--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
let's call this gmaps_image, and that's going to take some points.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And guess what? You get to write this function.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What I'd like you to do is implement this function_gmaps image.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's going to take a list of points.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, in the ASCII Chan program

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
there's going to be these Google GeoPoint objects,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but since we don't have access to that in the IDE

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I made a fake Point_class that just has two properties - lat and long

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so it should work the same way as a Google Point does,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I made a little fake list of points here that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we'll be testing with and we'll also throw you some other ones.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You should generate a URL that looks like this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
These parameters are all fixed--the size and the sensor--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and you can have a template URL here and then

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
what you need to do is you need to add these marker parameters

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.432
to the end of this URL and return it. It shouldn't be too bad. Good luck.
