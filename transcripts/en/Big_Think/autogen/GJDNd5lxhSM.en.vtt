00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.769
We were proud to sign on to the UN Sustainable
Development Goals.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.469
For us goal number three is our north star:
“Good health and well-being.”

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.310
Every day our scientists are working to discover,
develop and bring to market medicines and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.100
vaccines that help people live longer and
healthier lives.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.011
And for us goal number three allowed us to
have a dialogue and an engagement with the

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:33.190
United Nations and with governments globally
to ensure that we’re partnering with them

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.500
to provide access to quality healthcare.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.760
When we think about access to medicines we
think about a comprehensive strategy that

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.780
includes both donation and philanthropic support
as well as creative commercial strategies

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.239
designed to drive access to the most vulnerable
and under-served populations globally.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.680
So for Pfizer we have a number of initiatives
that we’re very proud of.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.430
One which I like to say is our oldie but goodie
was launched in 1998.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.449
The International Trachoma Initiative was
launched to address a blinding disease called

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.960
trachoma.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.360
At the time it was launched, we had a product
that treated active infection that causes

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
this disease.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.640
And if the infection goes untreated over time
people do go blind.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.850
And what we discovered was that our medicine
could treat this infection, but our medicine

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.829
was not sufficient: Alone that medicine would
not do the work that needed to be done at

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.570
a public health level.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.369
For our work to address a blinding disease
called trachoma we’ve used a public health

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.700
strategy called SAFE.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.180
SAFE stands for surgery – S, for advanced
cases of the disease.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.510
A – the distribution of the antibiotic that
Pfizer makes to treat the active infection.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.140
F which is face washing and E which is environmental
development.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.000
Together that comprehensive initiative working
now with more than a hundred partners has

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.039
achieved elimination of this disease in six
countries.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.100
That’s profound.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.020
And it’s one of our greatest accomplishments
as a company.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.179
It did not happen overnight.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.070
It has taken more than two decades to achieve
that progress, but we have our eyes on the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.169
prize which is full elimination of this disease
by the year 2020.

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:25.570
Another example where Pfizer is working to
meet the evolving global health needs is in

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.520
the area of oncology.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.320
We have chemotherapy agents that are very
important for patients globally.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.230
And we worked with our partners, the American
Cancer Society, the Clinton Health Access

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.889
Initiative, and CIPLA to make 11 prioritized
chemotherapy agents available in East Africa

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.269
where there is a disproportionate burden of
cancer.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.060
We’re really proud of that initiative because
we’re taking some of our very important

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.380
core essential medicines and making them available
to reach more patients in areas of the world

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.580
that several years ago did not have this need.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.620
So the business case for corporate responsibility
has been debated for years and there are different

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.770
perspectives on this.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.560
I think for Pfizer and for the pharmaceutical
companies we can’t deliver our business

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.040
unless we deliver for society.Keeping that
patient that we serve front and center to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.150
how we make the decisions that the company
takes every single day.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.030
When we discover, develop and bring to market
medicines and vaccines that help people live

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.820
longer and healthier lives our communities
are healthier, society is healthier, and we

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.819
deliver both for our business and our shareholders,
but also for society.
