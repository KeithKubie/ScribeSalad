00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:01.192
- [Voiceover] Let's do some examples

00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:03.550
creating picture and bar graphs.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.336
So it says Mr. Smith
assigned a special project

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:08.275
about the ocean to the students

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.630
in his Earth Science class.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.709
To find out if students
who spend more time

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.729
on their projects got better grades,

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.436
he asked the students how much time

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.978
they spent completing their projects.

00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:20.975
Create a bar graph to show how much time

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:24.632
each student spent
completing the ocean project.

00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:27.556
So James spent 36 minutes.

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:29.252
So I'm gonna click here

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:34.174
and I'm gonna move this up to 36.

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:37.630
Eji spent 54 minutes.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.799
So I'm gonna move this up to 54 minutes.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.607
Then Minli spent 36 minutes.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:48.450
So I'm gonna move Minli up to 36 minutes.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.471
Then Simone spent 30 minutes.

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:52.595
So I'm gonna move Simone up to 30.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:54.639
Then Kiran spent 12 minutes.

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.635
So I'll move Kiran up to 12.

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:59.784
And there you go, I have
constructed the bar graph.

00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:01.740
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:03.310
All right.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.085
So on Thursday, Ming went to see a loud

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:09.207
and exciting performance
by the Dinosaur Orchestra.

00:01:09.207 --> 00:01:10.624
Create a bar graph to show how many

00:01:10.624 --> 00:01:11.901
of each type of dinosaur were

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:13.921
in the Dinosaur Orchestra.

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.382
So I guess there were 42 Stegosaurus's.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:20.624
I don't know if that's a
plural for Stegosaurus.

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:22.646
So there are 42 Stegosaurus's,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:24.488
63 Raptors.

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:26.891
So we move the Raptor up to 63.

00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:29.237
35 Triceratops.

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:34.163
Then you had 49 Tyrannosaurus.

00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:35.898
49 of these.

00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:37.731
So fairly straightforward.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.856
So let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:43.002
All right, so now it tells
us Rose's flower shop

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.475
makes bouquets for special occasions.

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:46.612
Each bouquet comes with

00:01:46.612 --> 00:01:48.400
a different number of flowers.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.699
Create a picture graph to show the number

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:51.976
of flowers in each bouquet.

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:53.659
So this is kind of like a bar graph,

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.181
but instead we're gonna use pictures.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.513
Each picture shows a certain number.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:01:59.151
So in this case, a picture of a flower

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.170
represents three flowers.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.988
So the Mother's day
bouquet has 21 flowers.

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:07.892
So 21 flowers.

00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:11.107
Now you might be tempted
to put 21 pictures

00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:13.186
of flowers here, but you have to remember

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:16.506
each of these flowers
represent three flowers.

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:17.388
So one way to think about it,

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:18.890
you could count by threes.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.612
Three, six, nine,

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:26.211
12, 15, 18, 21.

00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:27.836
So that over here, this right over here,

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:29.429
would represent 21 flowers.

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:33.145
And you notice I just made
seven of this picture,

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:34.769
and that makes sense because seven

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.267
of these pictures, and
each of these pictures

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:39.761
represent three flowers,
seven times three is 21.

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:43.942
The Mother's Day bouquet
has 21 flowers in it.

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:46.727
All right, the Anniversary
bouquet has 27 flowers.

00:02:46.727 --> 00:02:48.897
So three, six, nine,

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:53.897
12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27.

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:55.189
I have nine flowers here.

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.289
Nine times three is 27.

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.913
The Birthday bouquet has 18.

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:05.835
So three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18.

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:07.438
And I just made six pictures here

00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:09.400
because each of them
represent three flowers.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.382
Six times three is 18.

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:14.217
Then finally, the Congratulations bouquet

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:15.796
has 12 flowers in it.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:20.695
Three, six, nine, and 12.

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:21.704
There you go.

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:23.136
I think we're done.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.913
I think we're done.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.987
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.043
All right.

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:31.945
Barry Bee and his bee friends love

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:33.744
to pollinate flowers.

00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:35.799
They created a chart and a picture graph

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.088
to show how many flowers each

00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:38.830
of them pollinated today.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.884
Use the information in the chart

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:43.658
to answer the question
about the picture graph.

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.566
So it says, On the picture graph,

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:48.085
each flower equals blank flowers,

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:50.209
or each picture of a flower, I should say,

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.867
equals a blank number of flowers.

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:56.121
So it says Barry pollinated 27.

00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:57.330
These are impressive bees

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.025
that they sit there making charts.

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:03.900
Barry pollinated 27 flowers,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.607
and they only drew three pictures here.

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:10.285
So these three flower
pictures must represent 27.

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:11.840
So the way that they would represent 27

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.664
is if each of these represent nine

00:04:13.664 --> 00:04:17.448
because we'd have nine, 18, 27.

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.700
So each of these must be nine flowers.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.141
But let's see if that works.

00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:23.728
So for Bumbly, 63.

00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:28.338
So let's see, nine, 18, 27,

00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:33.086
36, 45, 54, 63.

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:34.781
Yep, it looks like it works out.

00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:38.205
Betty is one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:40.597
Six, six times nine is 54.

00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:43.384
That is the number of
flowers she pollinated.

00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:45.903
Bertie, one, two, three, four, five.

00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:47.980
If each of those pictures represent nine,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.778
then this would be five times nine is 45.

00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:53.140
That is the number of flowers Bertie

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.170
had actually pollinated.
