00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:01.144
 In this video I want to help you 

00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:03.814
 to gain experience by building an important skill - 

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:07.656
 seeing some algebraic calculations that are made, 

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:09.224
 to be able to judge if they are true. 

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:10.014
 This is a very valuable skill. 

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:11.448
 You can check the work of other people, 

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.380
 you can check your own work, say: 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.290
 "Did I do it right?" 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.131
 "Does my logic support the verification?" 

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:19.502
 "Why do not I get the answer, 

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:21.126
 who do I think I should get? " 

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.309
 Let's get some experience with this. 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.284
 I have one equation, 

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.326
 nine in and then in brackets, 

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:30.702
 2x plus 1/3 equals 39. 

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:32.188
 And someone has decided it. 

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.997
 This is step one, step two, and finally step three. 

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:37.459
 This solution was obtained: x equal to two. 

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:39.525
 Pause the video now 

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.752
 and try to find out if this solution is right. 

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.260
 Whether all the steps that have been made are logical, 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.048
 whether they have algebraic meaning? 

00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:49.254
 Or is there a mistake in any of these steps, 

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:52.052
 and if so, in which of these steps was an error occurred? 

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:55.523
 Now let's go through this task, 

00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.961
 to see if all these steps have logic. 

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.326
 In the first step, 18x, 

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.161
 it seems that brackets have been revealed. 

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:07.636
 Nine in two x will be 18x and then of course 

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:10.190
 you will also have to calculate nine by one third. 

00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:13.326
 Nine per 1/3 will be 9/3 or three, 

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:14.394
 this also seems acceptable. 

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:16.855
 And you got 39 here on the right. 

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.595
 Therefore, step one is verified. 

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:21.368
 Now, let's see what they did here? 

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:24.904
 After step one, or at this stage, 

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:26.738
 we have 18x plus three, 

00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:28.851
 then we only have 18x here. 

00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:30.964
 They must have pulled three 

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:33.681
 on the left side to get rid of it. 

00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.079
 They took three on the left side. 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.559
 But if they pull out three on the left, 

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:40.019
 they have to pull out three also on the right side 

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.948
 and they seem to have done so. 

00:01:40.948 --> 00:01:45.244
 39 minus 3 is 36. So this step is checked. 

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:48.123
 We have 18x equals 36. 

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:49.210
 To find x, 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.022
 you will just split the two sides to 18. 

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:56.853
 You will get x equals 36 on 18 or 2. 

00:01:56.853 --> 00:01:58.966
 We've checked all the steps 

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:02.333
 and there is no mistake. 

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:06.952
 And you can check that x is really equal to two. 

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:11.435
 Let's solve a few more tasks 

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:15.266
 and see if we can determine whether there are mistakes or not. 

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:20.165
 We have 8/3 is equal to 3 in "c" plus 5/3 

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:21.767
 and we want to find "c". 

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:25.956
 Pause the video and see if there are any errors 

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:28.216
 and if any of these steps are wrong, 

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.716
 or maybe there are no errors at all. 

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.402
 Let's do it step by step. 

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:35.467
 In step one left side is left the same. 

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:36.953
 The right side, let's see ... 

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:38.973
 We get 3 out of this 3c, 

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:41.155
 seem to reveal brackets. 

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:44.243
 Three in "c" is really 3c. 

00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:47.540
 Then we need to multiply 3 by 5/3, 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.817
 it will be five. 

00:02:48.817 --> 00:02:50.141
 It will not be 5/3. 

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.508
 This thing here should be five, 

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:56.549
 not 5/3, this is not true. 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.079
 So we found an error in step one. 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.981
 Let's continue. Let's do one more of these tasks. 

00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.077
 I find this funny. 

00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:06.325
 Okay, this is a bit simpler. 

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:09.273
 1/4 r plus 2 is equal to 10. 

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:11.880
 And then they immediately received only 1/4 r, 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.318
 they are getting rid of this pair on the left side. 

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:17.011
 Well, to do this, you can pull two left, 

00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:18.312
 but of course you have to do it too 

00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:20.564
 and on the right side. 

00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:22.746
 And you get 1/4 r plus 2 minus two, 

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:24.093
 this will be only 1/4 r. 

00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:26.021
 Yes, the left side is logical. 

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.551
 10 minus 2 is not 12. 

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.081
 10 minus 2 is eight. 

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.404
 This should be eight. 

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:34.937
 They added two on the right side. 

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:36.957
 They took two on the left, 

00:03:36.957 --> 00:03:39.023
 but they have added it to the right. 

00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:41.020
 Then equality will no longer be true. 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.692
 There is definitely a mistake. 

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:45.269
 Step one is not true.
