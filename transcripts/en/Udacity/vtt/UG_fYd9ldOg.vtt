First we have disturbance. And here we mean, disturbance of though, emotion or

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:09.626
behavior. That is, things are not going well in how a person thinks, feels or

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:14.924
behaves. Second, we have dysfunction. And here we mean, dysfunction of

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:20.590
biological or development processes. Dysfunctional behavior interferes with

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.302
everyday functioning, and could lead a person to being at risk, or the person

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:29.850
is risking the safety of others. Dysfunction can mean the inability for a

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.315
person to hold down a job or engage in meaningful social relationships with

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:39.079
close friends or loved ones. And third, we have distress or disability. And

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.199
here we mean, distress or disability in everyday life. Especially

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.583
relationships, work or other activities. Here, the behavior leads to real

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:52.484
discomfort or anguish. Either in the person directly or in others. The

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:56.564
distressing element is one reason we may say a person is suffering from a

00:00:56.564 --> 00:01:01.643
disorder. It can cause pain to a person and/or other people, especially family

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:06.576
members. And this is an important point to bring up. In something we discussed

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:10.172
throughout the class, that it's not only the person with the disorder that

00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:15.521
experiences the difficulty, pain, anxiety or sadness. It's also the person's

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:20.164
loved ones who can experience difficulty as well. That is, it can be painful

00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:22.804
and sad to watch a loved one suffer through some of the symptoms of mental

00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:27.892
illness. Remember in the lesson on memory, when we talked about HN and people

00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:32.130
with amnesia or dementia. And how we talked about how difficult it could be, if

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.562
you were the husband or wife, mother, father, brother, sister of the person who

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:41.768
was unable to remember you? Obviously, it'd be really painful to deal with. And

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:47.372
now finally, for the last D, we have deviant. By this we mean, deviant thought,

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:53.316
emotion or behavior. But only if it's also dysfunctional. Deviance alone is not

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:57.926
enough. Deviant literally means, different from the norm, or different from

00:01:57.926 --> 00:01:59.904
what most people do. The

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:00.528
[UNKNOWN]

00:02:00.528 --> 00:02:05.412
does stress that deviant behavior can be classified as a disorder, only if it's

00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:11.204
also dysfunctional. Einstein, for example, was deviant in many ways, but he

00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:13.360
wasn't dysfunctional.
