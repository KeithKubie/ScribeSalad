00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.220
Now let's do another quiz considering a slightly different piece

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.050
of code. In this case we have five layers of

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.684
code. We have a variable i, a variable j. Variable

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:11.620
j is read from the input. And then based on

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.500
this predicate, we either print the value of i or

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.850
simply exit. And what I want to know from you is

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.990
whether you can create a test suite to achieve statement

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.660
coverage for this simple piece of code. Yes or no?
