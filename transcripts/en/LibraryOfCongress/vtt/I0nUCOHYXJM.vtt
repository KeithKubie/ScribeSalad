00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D. C.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.620
&gt;&gt;Mark Dimunation: So
welcome back to Rare Book

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.210
and Special Collections
Division everyone.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.340
We're very excited
about today's talk.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.580
Glen Emil is a collector
and a donor to the Library

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.540
of Congress the collection that
you're hearing about today.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.460
The Edward Gorey Collection
now resides in this division.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.230 position:56%
It was a wonderful gift that came in
last year and it also came with Glen

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.400
who now resides in our
division on a regular basis.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.640
He's not only an expert collector
that brought in 800 pieces

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.450
of Goreyana but is also a compiler

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.890
of the Goreyography his online
bibliography of Gorey pieces

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.040
so he brings a great
deal of expertise.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.600
He's a great chap.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.670
He's become a real
friend of the division,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.810
actually a colleague
already at this point.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.100
We're really thrilled to have
him here and he's going to talk

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.140
about something that we
have all grown to love.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.760
If you didn't love Gorey before
you'll love him after this.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.560
So please welcome Glen.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.970
[ Applause ]

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.580
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Thank you Mark.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.810
Well, he already introduced
me so I can just tell you

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.740
that I started collecting
Gorey when I was

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.850
about 18 years old
so had a good time.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.830
The challenge was actually being
18 not having a lot of income

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.140
at the time trying to find Gorey
on the cheap without the Internet,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.980
so fortunately it wasn't
too difficult.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.290
I think there may be one or two
spots that we need to fill in

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.420
and you can call it
a 100% collection.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.380
Of course, there are 800 pieces
but Gorey only published about 100

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.340
and some odd of his
own original books.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.600
He's done maybe two to
three hundred illustrations

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.020
for other publications
and periodicals.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.320
I'll go over that.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.540
But I just want to say thank you.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.840
Thank you for coming.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.080
This is really hard for me and
I really do like this place.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.930
This is what my, I want my
library to look like this.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.230
That's why I like it.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.290
You let me hang out
here and this is why.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.250
Anyway, let's go ahead and dive in.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.640
I have a small presentation.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.220
It's broken into two parts.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.120
For those who don't know
Gorey's bibliography,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.740
some of the major details about
his career I'll provide that.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.160
I apologize.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.390
I understand after speaking to Mark

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.290
that I'm not a professional
presenter

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.930
so I don't know how
to do this very well.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.410
But I have text and I have
images so for those who really,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.140
really dislike watching I'm
saying I have on the right hand

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.870
of the screen there will be
images of the entire collection

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.300
of books passing through and
to keep it interesting I have a

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.600
prize [laughter].

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.700
Like I say there's about 106
books that can you be attributed

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.520
to him directly but I've
omitted presenting the albums,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.970
the "Amphigorey" series and
that leaves four more books

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.780
that aren't presented so if there
are any collectors out there

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.790
who actually can name three of
those four books that are missing

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.690
from this screen presentation then
I have an Edward Gorey pen from,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.030
made by the Edward Gorey
House up in Cape Cod.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.390
It's a very nice one.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.760
It's almost like [inaudible] so.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.060
It's three books.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.330
Name the three books that don't
show outside of "Amphigorey."

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.660
&gt;&gt; Let's make this clear.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.940
Three books that are in
the "Amphigorey" series

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.070
but they're not going to
be in your presentation?

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.370
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: That's right.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.760
I'm sorry, three books out
of the entire collection

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.580
that aren't shown outside of the
"Amphigorey" volumes themselves.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.750
There are four of them.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.650
I didn't photograph them.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.660
So there are four individual
books of his

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.300
that he wrote that won't be shown.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.020 position:56%
So if you can think of those I think
you have the collection, right?

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.780
So before we get started
Mark brought up a good point.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:01.670
I think it would be interesting
to know that along with part

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.160
of Gorey's charm is that
he's a very mysterious man.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.550 position:56%
He's as mysterious as the books that
he's written and so there's a lot

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.980 position:56%
of talk, a lot of hearsay generated.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:25.180 position:56%
So I'm going to try to expose one
or two of these if this will let me.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.530
It is said that Edward Gorey --

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.610
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Ah.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.660
It is. This is what's
mysterious about it.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.020
It's the words.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.620
It's not the pictures.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.130
Ah, anyway, I was saying
that did it come up?

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.510
No signal.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:10.280
Okay. So as I was saying, Edward
Gorey there's a lot of legends,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.580
a lot of myths about Edward Gorey.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.080
One of them might be that he was
actually a child of a refugee

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.990
from the turn of the century,
Russian, a Russian czar,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.610
left his children in England and
got stuck on a boat and came here.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.930
Another one is that he
might have English --

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.700
he might be English and ran to
America and plied his trade here

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.700
or that he also has a very
famous mother who's a --

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.880
who happens to be either
a songstress or a dancer

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.420
or [inaudible] serious actress.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.720
Let's see.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.520
Let's see if we can find.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:08:34.070
[ Video playing ]

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.330
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: In the mirror was an
obviously very popular although not

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.750
many people know her name
it was Edward Gorey's mother

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.380
for 11 years maybe,
eight to 11 years.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:50.240
It's not entirely clear but he was,
she and his father were divorced

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.690
when he was 11 and then he --

00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:01.210
his father remarried and when
he was 27 years old his parents

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.960
reunited again.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.540
So for a brief period Edward Gorey
did have a very interesting mother.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.800
Anyway, so I explained
about the story.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.660
I'm going to just basically --

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.720
indulge me while I
read the text portion.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:27.350
The right side will show eventually
the books in Gorey's collection.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:35.690
"In 1925 Edward Gorey is born
22nd in Chicago, Illinois.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.050
He has no the siblings.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.200
He develops a taste
for reading and drawing

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.270
and pursues creative
activities in the theater,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.730
writing in his formative years.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.260
By the time Gorey is five years
old he has read 'Dracula',

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.830
'Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland' by nine.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.210
Supposedly 'Dracula' terrifies him.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.980
In 1943 he studies at the Chicago
Art Institute for one semester.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.430
That's his formal training.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.570
In 1946 Edward enrolls at
Harvard University majoring

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.870
in French literature.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.960
While there he becomes
involved with poets, theater

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.830 position:56%
and Cambridge eventually befriending
John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.120
Alison Lurie and Buddy Lang.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.430
Gorey starts shopping at the Gotham
Book Mart in Manhattan in 1946

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:22.550 position:56%
and he meets Francis Steloff who
later agrees to help sell his books.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:36.910
He also starts -- in 1952 Jason
Epstein, a friend of his takes

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.230
over at Doubleday Anchor Paperbacks
which used to be just kind

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.590
of low quality paperback
books and asks Gorey

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.100
to leave the art department.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.810 position:56%
Gorey accepts and for the next seven
years he polished his craft book

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.100
illustration, layout, typography

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.140
and the book series
was very successful."

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.610
Now there's about 60
of these book covers

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.570
and they have a very distinctive,
very beautiful touch to them.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:05.390
Some collectors just collect those
books and they're hard to find some

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.470
of them because a lot of
them are just trashed,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.830
thrown away after they're-- "In
1953 he publishes his first book,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.530
'The Unstrung Heart' and moves
from the Boston area to Manhattan

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.250
and over time Gorey publishes
at least two books a year

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.600 position:56%
until his death creating his stories
first and then illustrating them.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.900
Gorey produces camera ready
artwork and typography and except

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.180
for the stage work he doesn't
reduce or enlarge his drawings.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.470
1957 impressed by the ballet

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:38.230
under George Balanchine's guidance
Gorey embarks upon a dedicated

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.990
resolve to attend every
performance of [inaudible].

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:45.490
Apparently, it was true and by
1982 he had quenched his thirst

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.510
for the most ephemeral
art but he as openly said

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.890
that this is probably the
strongest influence on his style.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.290
In 1959 he starts work as
editor and art director

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.040
at Looking Glass Library another
Epstein venture at Random House

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.670 position:56%
until that closes three years later.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.830
Gorey finds this job to be the most
satisfying because he actually got

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.350
to choose some of the stories

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.470
as well illustrate
some of the cover work.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.970
In 1962 unable to find a publisher

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.700
for the 'Beastly Baby'
Gorey self-publishes it

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.550
under the Fantod Press name.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.230
The Fantod Press eventually
publishes 28 of his works many

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.510
of which attract mainstream
publishers.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.230
Besides 'The Beastly
Baby' other Gorey classics

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.030
from Fantod Press includes
the 'Chinese Obelisks',

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.770
'The Deranged Cousins',
'The Disrespectful Summons',

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.960
'The Evil Garden' which I love
very much, 'The Lost Lions',

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.390
'The Osbick Bird' and 'The Pious
Infant' and 'The Untitled Book.'

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.880
Gorey publishes the
'The Vinegar Works'

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.580 position:56%
in 1963 a three volume set including
his famous, 'The Gashlycrumb Tinies'

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.340
with A is for Amy who
fell down the stairs.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.730
His favorite job at the
Looking Glass Library folds

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.500
so he takes a designer
position at Bobbs-Merrill.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.950
He finds this assignment difficult
so buoyed by his modest success

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.230
so far Gorey decides to
launch his free-lance program.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.920
In 1965 Gorey's first
solo art exhibit opens

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.240
at the California College of
Arts and Crafts in Oakland

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.260
across the bridge from
San Francisco.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.360
Although he does not attend
this exhibit he ships over 190

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.420
of his own original artworks.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.170
Gorey also begins teaching classes

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.880

illustration at the School

of Visual Arts in Manhattan and
this lasts for one semester."

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.770
No comment.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:49.480
[laughter] "In 1967 Andreas Brown,
a young antiquarian book appraiser

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.280
and bibliographer from California
buys the Gotham Book Mart

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.970
from Frances Steloff.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.650
Already a fan of Gorey's
work, he begins actively

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.260
to promote Gorey's
art and literature

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.620
and this includes yearly
art exhibits

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.900
at Gotham's Art Gallery while
managing Gorey's publications

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.060
and building a small but growing
clientele of collectors thirsty

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.250
for Gorey's limited editions

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.410
and by this time Gorey
has published 24 books.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:20.360
Mr. Brown is still involved
in the Gorey community.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.240 position:56%
He's on the -- as many of Gorey's --

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.670
were issued with fewer than
500 copies each Brown suggested

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.620
that he assemble them in
a [inaudible] collection

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.480
and that became 'Amphigorey'
in 1972.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.130
It wins notable book of the year
awards from the New York Times

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.470
and American Institute
of Graphic Arts

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.490 position:56%
and it has been in print ever since.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:49.800 position:56%
Many believe that this is more or
less what launched his book career."

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.100

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.400
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.700
That was Andreas Brown, yeah.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.190
In the -- quite a few years ago.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.720
"Gorey designs in 1977, he
designs a sets and costumes

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.790
for Broadway's revival of
'Dracula' starring Frank Langella

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.090
at the Martin Beck Theatre.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.430
The show is a huge hit
with over 900 performances

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.880
and as Gorey owns a piece
of the show it allows him

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:16.010
to buy a cozy home near his
family in Cape Cod [inaudible].

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.050 position:56%
Gorey also wins a Tony Award for
his costume design, not stage design

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.740
but costume design and he
doesn't like that at all.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.450
Gorey purchases his dream house,
a sea captain's home built

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:30.090
in 1821 in Yarmouth Port.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:35.560
In 1980 Gorey is asked design
opening and closing credits

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.700
for the 'PBS Mystery' series.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.090
He works with Canadian
broadcasting animator Derek Lamb

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.770
and he also creates the hand-drawn,

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.140
two-dimensional stage sets
prompting Vincent Price

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.250
to call it Gorey's Mansion.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:53.870
From 1980 to his death Gorey
publishes forty more books,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:58.420 position:56%
creates over 20 small stage plays
and renders several hundred drawings

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.310
for other books, periodicals
and so on and so on."

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.610
These are great.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.920
There's got to be at least four
to five different iterations

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:16.090 position:56%
of this animation and originally
Gorey said his plan would have taken

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.350
somewhere along like 30
minutes of animation.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:24.170
They cut it down to
just under two minutes.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:29.400
"In 1980 Andreas Brown estimates
that Gorey had produced well

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.430
over 10,000 drawings
over his lifetime.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.450
In 1983 Gorey leaves Manhattan,
moves to Cape Cod permanently.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.850
Gorey tells people that this is
precipitated by the recent death

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:45.980
of Balanchine but Gorey lives
happily on the Cape with a handful

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:54.140
of cats until his death and Andreas
Brown is currently the co-trustee

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.510
of the Edward Gorey Trust.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.200
They handle all the
original art work

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.820
and intellectual property rights

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.430
and so the archive he
says are just dozens

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.850
of boxes just illustrations
that Gorey never used.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.930
He would just draw, so the estimate

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.880
of ten thousand illustrations
is conservative."

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:26.690
No this probably goes back
before published work but --

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:32.270
"On April 13, 2000 Gorey
suffers a massive heart attack

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.940
in his home while his friend
Rick Jones repairs a toaster

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.240
in the kitchen.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.110
He's rushed to the Hyannis Hospital

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.130
but two days later he
dies from complications.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.180
Gorey was 75 and was survived
by two cousins and a nephew.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.950
Gorey chooses to be cremated.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.820
Half of his ashes were set adrift
off a beach on Cape Cod Bay

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.120
by his friends and family."

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.520
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: There's more.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.710
"In 2002 Gorey's home opens to the
public as the Edward Gorey House,

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.680
a museum dedicated to
preserving his legacy.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.890
His original artwork is
like I mention is archived

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.840
by the Edward Gorey
Charitable Trust.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.170
His personal library of 25
thousand books is housed

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.530
at San Diego Library State
University in California.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.220
Most of Gorey's effects were
distributed amongst his friends

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.100
and according to his will Gorey
wanted his artwork to continue

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.860
in perpetuity to benefit
animal welfare.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.510
Before he died, Gorey and Rick
Jones were discussing funerals

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.970
and Gorey said 'just
throw me in the yard.'

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.670
So 11 years later his
friend honored his request.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.470
Gorey's last remaining
ashes were scattered along

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.320
with his last four cats
around his property

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.100
in Yarmouth Park, Yarmouth Port."

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:01.760
This is one of his
plays that was performed

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.560
at the scattering of the ashes.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:23:14.110
[ Video playing in background ]

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.880
I was at that performance and
afterwards Rick Jones told me

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.620
that they hadn't planned
on putting the picture

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.050
of Gorey up at the very end.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.350
This was just a restaging,

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.540
supposedly just a restaging
of several of his plays.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.700
So, thank you for sitting
through the tough part.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.260
That was just a lot of information.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:38.140
But yeah, the scattering of the
ashes was a very interesting show.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.830
It showed that Gorey's work was
just as strong on the play side,

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:48.490
the whole entire community of
players, puppet players and so on,

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:52.370
the puppets being those little
white head figures of paper mache.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:59.310
Gorey had made about 100 of those
little things about an inch or so.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.430
So they didn't have much
detail but the second part

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:06.040
of the presentation is just
more or less this objective,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.120
my opinion about what
makes Gorey so interesting.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.990
One of the things that Gorey used

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.480
to tell people whenever people
asked him what does any of it mean

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.000
and even the person who used

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.880
to ask this question was
Andreas Brown himself

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.680
and Gorey would almost
always invariably say,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.090
"What you see is what you get."

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:35.410
And I think that answer more or
less just managed to push off a lot

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:39.770 position:56%
of people but I think when you think
about what Gorey was talking about,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:45.030
what you see is what you get, what
you understand, you can take this

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.070
as what you understand is
what you can read into it.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.430
He loved it when people
read into his work only

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.040
because it showed how
engaged people were.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.290
He didn't divulge meanings
pretty much of any of his works.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.120
He would say, "Read into it.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.570
I'm happy to take whatever
you feel like,

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.200
whatever translation
you come up with."

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.560
But there are some things
that he really enjoyed.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.000
What you're seeing here is
some of the, some old footage

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.030
of films of Louis Feuillade.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.390
This one happens to
be from "Fantomas."

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:29.860
When Gorey was in Harvard
they used to watch and also

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.590
in New York they would
look for performances.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.120
This is 100 years old.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.380
Most of this was, this
particular one was done in 1914.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:46.760
It was a series of what's
called -- the French hated it.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.650
It wasn't supposedly the high
art of filmmaking so they had,

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.470
I forgot the name they gave it
but it wasn't a complimentary one

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.640
but Gorey truly found
something in it and I think

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:05.300
in a way you can actually see
some of his style being used here.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.380
I mean this is truly
different than a lot

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.690
of silent film movies
especially the setting, the stage.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:21.740
An analyst, a critic for film
had a wonderful interpretation

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.950
about the Feuillade films.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:30.580 position:56%
These were films that were not of
course, popular because they were --

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.030
the narration proved to
be somewhat deceptive.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:38.190
Feuillade enjoyed leading
a narration

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.260
that wasn't necessarily
showing on the screen

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.210
so that oftentimes the
audience would have to come

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.960
up with their own conclusion
at the end

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.240
because it wasn't a
straightforward narration

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.150
and I think Gorey really
picked up on that style

00:26:54.150 --> 00:27:00.630
of not knowing who's
telling the story

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.810
and what is going to
happen at the end.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.140
It's not a very linear kind
of unless you watch it over

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.310
and over again you're not going to
know what's going to happen next.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.720
This is the original music
that came with these.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.020
It's very interesting.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:19.670
It's very surreal and the
colors were also intentional.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.590
Another favorite of Gorey's
was the "The Tale of Genji"

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:31.930 position:56%
by Murasaki Shikibu and her thousand
year-old novel Gorey read and found,

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:36.970
read several times and just
he never became exhausted

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.290
from some of the details.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:46.790
It's known that " The Tale
of Genji" uses what's known

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.450
as [foreign language spoken]

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:57.790
which is basically the
transient moment that's captured.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:03.520
It can be captured by a
simple expression of oh,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:12.810
or ah and so [foreign word] can
also be seen as the magic moments,

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:17.600
the breathing moment
that will pass eventually

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.400
and I think Gorey really
latched on to that as well.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.510
He was a very sensitive man.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.530
He was never married.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.400
As a matter of fact, he's come out
in a couple of introduce and said

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.370
that he was asexual as his
preference but we do know

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:42.420
that he has had quite a few
very, very close relationships

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:47.970
with other people, soulmate
kind of relationships.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:53.350
One of the more remarkable
ones was with Peter Neumeyer.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:29:01.020
He had done three books with Peter
Neumeyer and the exchange of ideas

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:06.280 position:56%
and so on that the two men shared
is truly, truly remarkable and Gorey

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.480
and Peter Neumeyer who had a
family, was raising a family

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:17.710
on the East Coast while teaching
was interesting enough to come up,

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:22.400 position:56%
Peter Neumeyer had saved his
letters that he and Gorey used to go

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.970
over all these details about coming
up with these books and they talked

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:30.950
about art, literature and so on and
that's just absolutely fascinating.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.780
The book that just came out
about five years ago is called

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:39.940
"Floating Worlds" is still
available but it if you do want

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.390
to find the kind of
thread that Gorey loves

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:49.990
to dwell on a lot of it's there.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.340
&gt;&gt; That was "The Leathers?"

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.340
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: "The
Letters" the correspondence

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.160
between Peter Neumeyer
and Edward Gorey.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.400
Edward Gorey also had several
other friends who he had very,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.510
very close relationships as well

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:09.070
but the letters obviously
are unique to Peter Neumeyer.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.670 position:56%
And ballet, of course everyone knows

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.950
that Edward Gorey loved
George Balanchine's work

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.250
at the New York City Ballet.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.190
And a lot of that flamboyance and
freedom of the characters shows

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:31.180 position:56%
up in his work not just the
moments of ballet, the books written

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.780
of ballet directly but
he has several characters

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.270
that truly can say reflect their
artistic freedom of ballet,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:44.320
and transient moments
that ballet brings

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.050
to the stage and brings to light.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:53.550
Then Gorey loved savoring some of
those and tries convey some of that

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:59.650
in his work, spent many hours
talking to Andreas Brown

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.280
and other collectors and
people who love Gorey

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.990 position:56%
and the list of influences are huge.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:10.960
They're enormous, very well-read,
loved several artists enough to say

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.930 position:56%
that he wishes he could draw like
let's say like Edward R. [Inaudible]

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:21.630
or the drawing techniques but his
work is very unique in the sense

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.440
that he tries to convey
more than just literature.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.070
He's a storyteller.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.480
I think he uses whatever
medium and whatever style

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.810
that actually helps produce
the most interesting story.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.410
If you look at the stage
settings you can almost see some

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.600
of Gorey's attention to detail,
framed and the wallpaper,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.690
the fabric designs, the
furniture it's just --

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:17.280
and I love how he's
picked up on that.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.530
He's not just imitating it.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.210
He's in a lot of his work
he shows some of the details

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.970
that helps isolate the story.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:50.310
So I think these are some of the
things that I've come up with.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:55.500 position:56%
I'm sure everyone, people have ideas
as well about what makes Gorey click

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.860 position:56%
for them and click for other people.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.990
He's, Gorey is interesting that a
lot of people will readily admit

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:08.380
that they don't understand
Gorey and I find that wonderful

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.350
that they would just
come out and say,

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:30.900
"I don't understand
any of this at all."

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.850
Supposedly he and Alison
Lurie, one of his early friends

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:38.660 position:56%
from Harvard would spend, have spent
hundreds of hours watching some

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:44.700
of these in the vaults, not in
the vaults but in the festivals

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.410
that would show up every
once in a while in Boston,

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:53.980
somebody would uncover
some of these old things.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.820
[inaudible] Yes he did, he did.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.250
&gt;&gt; So you're pretty sure
that Gorey had watched these?

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.660
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Oh, without doubt,
without doubt he'd seen these.

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:12.000
His favorite Feuillade
films were "Barrabas."

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.930
I haven't seen "Barrabas" but
I understand it's available now

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.280
so I think it's worth
taking a look at.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.170
But he also loved the
"Fantomas" series

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:26.180
and it's a very, very long series.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.340
It's a wonderful series,
so thank you.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.640
Thank you so much.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.510
That's my presentation.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:39.620
[ Applause ]

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.140
Does anybody have any questions
and does anybody have an idea

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.500
about which books were missing?

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.800
Yes.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.330
&gt;&gt; I have no idea about the books

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.050
that are missing [inaudible]
but I'm curious.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.620
Have you ever met him?

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.490
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Well,
I wanted to meet him.

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:59.290
I lived in San Francisco when I
was doing most of my collecting

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.010
so it was the choice
of either going out

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:08.780
and visiting Edward Gorey meant a
book or two or three, actually ten.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.490
I also wanted to give
Gorey his space because by

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.080
that time I was collecting
in 1978 started

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.310
and by 1990 I think
most people understood

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:24.730 position:56%
that Gorey was constantly approached
by his fans who would just come up

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.280
and just to stand with him and that
would be it but and I didn't want

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.550
to be so intrusive, so I decided
just to be happy with his output

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.820
and just kind of imagine the rest.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.960
After he passed away I
became as a collector

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.310
and after putting my
collection online and it's more

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.390
or less a portal that allows people

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.580
to explore Gorey growth a little
bit not just from one side

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.500
but from plays and from books
and from around the world Gorey,

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.490 position:56%
there's Gorey collectors from around
the world who have sites as well.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:03.780
They have interesting things that
they've put up so I create links

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:08.050
as well as a bibliography
of his main works.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:15.590
I'm sorry, you had,
there was a -- yes.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:20.390
&gt;&gt; What made you decide to donate
your collection to the Library?

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:25.370
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Well, I wanted
to find a much better home.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:31.460 position:56%
My collection after dragging it from
California to here the humidity,

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.990
the weather and so on I just,

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.250
I could watch it withering
away, the edges of the pages.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:40.680
The pages were turning colors and
I just, it was breaking my heart

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:46.070
and I just wanted it to actually
be preserved in one piece

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:50.790
because it's a remarkable
amount of energy to put together

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:58.340
and so I think it came up
somebody had knew somebody

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.390
who visited the Edward Gorey House.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.490
I'm a member of the board
of the Edward Gorey House

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:08.350
so I get some information of some
of the travelers and the head

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:13.080
of your poetry department had come
to the Gorey House a few years ago

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:19.280
and that came up and we,
a few thoughts came around

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.710
and I thought you know this
would be a perfect place

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:25.040
for Edward Gorey to be.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.690
&gt;&gt; Have you kept back anything?

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:31.990
[laughter]

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.280
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Should I tell him?

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.580
[laughter]

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.880
&gt;&gt; Any particular treasure?

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.180
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Actually there is one

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.070
and it's got a very Goreysque
kind of almost ending.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.850
He has, Gorey loved to make
these little stuffed dolls

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.290
which you'll look at
these things a little bit.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:52.500
Just last week one of
the treasures I decided

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.760
to keep it was a Figbash
doll, very, very long arms.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.210
I guess there's nothing
like it here,

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.810
anyway it was filled with rice.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:07.990
So you can imagine what
rice sounds like to a mouse

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:13.150 position:56%
and unfortunately I thought it was a
very unsafe place and just a couple

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.410
of weeks ago I opened it up and lo

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.800
and behold mice had been
munching on Figbash's.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.810
But I have to say it
really doesn't bother me

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.200
because at this point
I think the bulk

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.050
of the collection is
safe now from mice.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.140
It was kind of Goreyesque,

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.740
apparently Gorey loved
animals and I can see why.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:38.570
If we had a very valuable piece
here and nature comes along decides

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.920
to do natural things to it.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.060
It didn't bother me.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.950
It should bother me but it doesn't.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.250
Yes.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.970
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us something

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:55.470
about poster here, the
green covers, books?

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:57.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: Ah, well, these two --

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:02.940
are you talking about the
second, the first one?

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.240
Oh, this one here.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.840
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.600
This would be a what they
call a bus size advertisement

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.230
for "Mystery", the TV series.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:16.540 position:56%
So he did the animation and he would
create these large advertisements

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.760
posters to be used in public
spaces like bus stops and so on.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.670
So this is probably the largest.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:28.290
I mean Gorey draws to
scale so this is his work.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.420
This is a good one actually
to look at the details.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.220
When you get a chance
I'll let you look

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.070
around because I'm sure you're
really here for the books.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.310
There's a lot of fascinating,

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.730
mostly natural/super natural
little hints running all

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.350
over these, the artwork itself.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.740
This is an excellent example.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.650
This is the second poster is from
the same series but it just takes,

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.610
it looks like the animation.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:03.360 position:56%
So this one was yes, I think he
tries to capture some of the stories

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.910 position:56%
that were being told in this series.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:10.680
I don't know which ones
were Agatha Christie's or

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:17.730
but he was an enormous fan of
Agatha Christie as everyone knows.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:22.070
Possibly we have people like to
call Edward Gorey's work macabre.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:25.000
If you think about no one calls
Agatha Christie macabre so.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.210
&gt;&gt; But he didn't do any
of her covers did he?

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.510
&gt;&gt; Glen Emil: For Agatha Christie?

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.650
You know that's interesting,
no not that I know of.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.140
Some of his favorite
works he would have loved

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.620 position:56%
to become involved in but he didn't.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.650
I think he was waiting
for someone to ask.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.300
That's more or less what happened.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:51.750 position:56%
Most of Gorey's artwork was produced
by somebody who just would come up

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:57.690
and say okay, we think you
can do this and he'd say okay.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.580
He was very amiable
to doing whatever.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.260
I get this first hand
from Andreas Brown.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:13.300
Andreas and I are good friends and
he's told me a lot about Gorey.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.440
I hope somebody actually walks
up to Andreas and follows him

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.740
around and tape records him.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.040
He knows the story that's not
in print about Edward Gorey.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.340
Maybe I can drag him
down here one day.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.140
&gt;&gt; I'm going to stop the
questions there if we can.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.330
