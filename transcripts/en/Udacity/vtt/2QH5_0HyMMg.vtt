All we have to do now is explicitly write down the solution for the values of x

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.398
that satisfy this inequality. First, I'd like you to write the solution using

00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:12.174
inequalities to show the ranges of x and then, I'd like you to write it in

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:16.476
interval notation. Be really careful about where on a number line these

00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:21.076
intervals fall, and think back to what we learned about compound inequalities.

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:25.504
These use either, or, in-between two inequalities or and, where things with and

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:30.109
can be written using the change notation, or something similar to this. Remember

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.339
also how compound inequalities translate into interval notation. If you need to

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.535
review any of this, you can always go back to a previous lesson to look it up

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:41.244
and refresh your memory. Or you can go to the forums, they're always there to

00:00:41.244 --> 00:00:41.988
help you.
