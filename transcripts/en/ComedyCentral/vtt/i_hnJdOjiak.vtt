00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.102
Black people would be
perfectly justified

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:04.670
in only tending to issues
affecting the Black community.

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:08.341
Why you think Black superheroes
only save Black people?

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:12.344 line:92%
They're busy.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.248
They ain't got the time
to save the rest of the world.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:18.752
That's a luxury that only
White superheroes have.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.487 line:92%
My neighborhood's great.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.359
What else is going on
out here in the world?

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:29.295
At which point we detonate
the explosives,

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:33.099
and once again save the world.
Let's man up. Any questions?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.436 line:92%
Yeah, I got a question.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.538
Why y'all always
got to say the world?

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.206
Why y'all never help me
with the problems

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.641
I'm dealing with up
in the hood?

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.577
Well, it's difficult
coordinating

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.812 line:92%
all of our schedules.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:46.946 line:92%
Schedules.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.116
I mean the avenging ones focus
on protecting all lives,

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.218
so we should start
with saving the world.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.420
I get what you're saying,
but alien invasion

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.255
that don't happen
but once every couple of years.

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:58.291
Y'all ain't be doing shit
in between time.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.327
I ain't seen you in the hood.
I ain't seen you in the hood.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.096
I ain't seen
Dracula cape in the hood.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.664
I ain't seen none of y'all
come through.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.399
Why you won't come
to the Black folks?

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.167
Well, if we help the world
at large

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.303
that trickles down
to those smaller communities.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.672
Don't answer him.
He's not even an avenging one.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.474
Because I ain't got the time
to be an avenging one.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.342
Black superheroes
got to worry about

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.444
Black issues
in the Black community.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.546 line:92%
Well that's just shortsighted.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.849
I mean take Black Cougar
for instance,

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.151
he understands that
being an avenging one

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:28.488
means saving the world first
before he works on his own-

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.556 line:92%
Oh, oh. Got to stop you there.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:34.427
I am only here
to protect my part of Africa.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.429 line:92%
But you said teamwork was the-

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:38.498 line:92%
That was a lie.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:42.468
White, I do not care about
White people's problems

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:45.872
unless those problems
affect my people of

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.306 line:92%
Lawanda

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:48.540 line:92%
See what I'm saying?

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:52.846
Stop getting Black superheroes
to solve your global issues.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.149
Now your ass
ought to be ashamed.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.617
Rounding up all these magical
White folks,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.218
and then you won't bring
none of them to the hood,

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.787
fam. I oughta pluck
that other eyeball out.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.757
And where was you at
when Dr. King got shot?

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.827
You got the technology.
You could have saved Dr. King.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.334 line:92%
No, no. (arguing)

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.239 line:92%
Sorry I'm late.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.240 line:92%
What's going on here?

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.476
He's returned from
another time realm.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.378 line:92%
Yes. With the stone of time

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.581
we can travel to the future
and the past.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:29.916
-You time traveled?
-Yes.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.785
The stone you can go
wherever you want in time?

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.855
Why didn't you go back
and just stop slavery?

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:39.525 line:92%
That was about state's rights.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.896
Oh, y'all can kiss my ass.
I'm going back to Harlem.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.398
I can't deal with this
no more, man.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.599 line:92%
Night Pigeon, you rolling?

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.601
No. I'm good, man.
I'm just gonna stay.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:50.870 line:92%
You going to stay here?

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:52.505 line:92%
I want his health insurance.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:53.839
-That don't matter.
-Yes, it do matter.

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.241
You got to stand
for something that's

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.311
Who do you think is paying
for these wings, man?

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.512 line:92%
His insurance plan.

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:00.680 line:92%
It's a good plan.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.781 line:92%
Dental.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.951
Y'all lame as hell, man.
No, I can't do this, man.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:08.554
They gonna kick y'all ass,
all y'all ass.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.223 line:92%
9-1-1 What's your emergency?

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.857 line:92%
Are you calling 9-1-1 on me?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.259
Hello?
Yes, you are.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.460 line:92%
Miss, are you safe?

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.262 line:92%
Y'all some lames.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.902 line:92%
Woo.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.738 line:92%
Well that was awkward.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.508
Didn't you guys solve racism
while I was frozen?

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:30.876 line:92%
It got worse.

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.247
Ah, all right.
Well let's go kill some aliens.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.283
That sounds bad.
Let's go defeat the bad guys.
