00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.930
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.260
So today we're going to start
the last section.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.980
We're going to do three lectures
on phase diagrams.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.460
And I've given this the label
here of Stability, Sustaining

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.320
the Solid State.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.500
We've talked a lot about the
solid state in 3.091 as the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.870
vehicle for teaching the
rudiments of chemistry.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.370
One of the things we have not
talked about, is what are the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.600
conditions that sustain
the solid state?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.730
How do I know whether
something's going to be a

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.845
solid, or a liquid, or a gas?

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:56.250
This is very important.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.060
For example, if you're in a
foundry, you're running

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.350
places, making auto parts,
you have to know what the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.790
solidification temperature is of
the alloys, so you can get

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.150
the parts out quickly and
keep productivity high.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.850
It's even important in
failure analysis.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.950
You know, when they were looking
at things like the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.420
rubble from the World Trade
Center by understanding phase

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.670
stability, the thermal history
was imprinted in the metal.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600
It's possible to determine
what temperatures were

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.720
achieved, and therefore, what
the chain of events was that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.860
led to the collapse of
those buildings.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.680
Now you might say, well, isn't
this straightforward?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.350
I mean, for example, you just
look up the melting point or

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.200
boiling point.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.800
Water, 0 degrees C. Melting
point, boiling point, 100

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.210
degrees C.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.090
Well, suppose you decide to
realize your life's ambition.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.150
You're going to go and
scale Mount Everest.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.440
So you pay the $10,000, you
get a license from the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.390
Nepalese Government,
and you're at base

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.710
camp at 20,000 feet.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.870
You're sitting there, you've
got your campfire going,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.185
you've got a hankering for
a hard-boiled egg.

00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:58.570
And you start, you put the eggs
into boiling water and

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.550
you cook them 10 minutes, you
take them out, and they're

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.020
still runny.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.550
You say, I must've lost
track of time.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.940
So you cook them 20 minutes,
and they're still runny.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.250
And you cook them 30 minutes,
and they're still runny.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.470
And you eventually come to the
realization that at 20,000

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.290
feet, the boiling point of water
is below the denaturing

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.300
temperature of egg yolk.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.930
So now the boiling point is
a function of pressure.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.360
So you know, we could have one
of these Iron Chef cookoffs,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.360
only the dish is souffle, only
we'll have the contest at

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.510
Flagstaff, Arizona, where the
altitude is so high that the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.940
classical recipes won't work,
because the boiling point, the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.820
atmospheric pressure, and
everything conspire so that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.235
you're not going to be able
to support the souffle.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:56.360
So you're going to have to
understand phase diagrams.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.150
In fact, if you understand phase
diagrams, that's your

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.650
ticket to being a four-star
chef in the kitchen.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.560
Well, here's another place we
can look at, where pressure

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.760
has an important role.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.650
Let's look under the
hood of a car.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.360
You're running an internal
combustion engine.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.160
So this is the engine
block, and there's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.530
combustion going on inside.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.290
We've got to keep this thing
from overeating.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.620
It could damage the metal.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.510
In extreme, you could
melt the metal.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.360
So we've got cooling channels
in here with water flow.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.880
But then the water's going
to heat up, and the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.860
water's going to boil.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.280
So we've got, over here,
the radiator.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.500
So it's really a double
cooling system.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.290
The water cools the block,
and then the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.820
radiator cools the water.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.840
So how's that going to work?

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.340
Well, here, the temperature is
on the order of about 90

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.110
degrees C, and here the
temperature inside the engine

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.680
block is much greater than 90
degrees C. It's several

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.580
hundred degrees C inside that
engine block, and we've got

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.330
water going like this.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.270
So we've got cooling water
flow in this manner.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.630
And now cold water goes in and
hot water comes out, and then

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.480
we get into the radiator, and
we've got channels here, and

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.515
we've either got a fan or
some kind of air flow.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.200
And so now, what's
the gambit here?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.920
I want to see what's going
on inside this radiator.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:28.130
So if this is the wall of the
radiator, and in here I've got

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.220
water, and over here I've got
air, the idea is to have a

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:43.510
high heat flux to get the energy
out of the water and

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.750
cool it down.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.790
Now, if things get really,
really hot in here-- let's say

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.690
you're zooming along down the
highway at about 90, I mean,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.910
about 65 miles an hour, and all
of a sudden you come upon

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.400
a collision, and you have to
go to a dead stop, all that

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.220
energy in the engine
is now dumped, and

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.580
the water could overheat.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.860
And in the extreme, if it
overheats, it can actually go

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.080
into a boil.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.070
And this is bad.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.510
Because heat transfer is really
good between a liquid

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.180
and a solid, and it's
really poor

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.780
between a gas and a solid.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.380
This is a low heat flux,
and this is bad.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.220
High heat flux, that's good.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.710
This is the bubbles.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.480
This is boiling.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.520
And why?

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.430
Because what transfers energy?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.370
It's the atoms.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.950
And what's the atom density in
a liquid versus the atom

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.230
density in a gas?

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.870
You just have really crummy
heat transfer.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.050
That's why insulation involves
dead airspace.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.210
Because you have very
poor atom density.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.080
So what can we do in
order to try to

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.360
repress the bubble formation?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.690
Well, we said if we went up
Mount Everest, we went to high

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.180
altitude, the boiling
point went down.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.470
And why did it go down?

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.880
Because the atmospheric
pressure is lower.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.180
So why don't we go the inverse
here, and we'll put a pressure

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.990
cap on the radiator, and make
the pressure go up, and when

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.930
the pressure goes up, it exerts
a back pressure and

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.620
represses bubble formation?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.690
So by increasing pressure, we
can increase the temperature,

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.190
and get the temperature up.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.880
So let's say p equals-- if you
look on the top of the

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.290
pressure cap, it will
say 15 psi.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:44.100
And 15 psi is almost 14.7 psi,
which is exactly 1 atmosphere,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.020
which in SI units is, and I know
this to six significant

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.340
figures, 101325 Pascals.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.760
Or, you know, from Torricelli,
760 millimeters of mercury,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.510
that's the column that's
supported.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.530
So we're at 2 atmospheres
pressure in there, and with

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.905
two atmospheres of pressure, we
can raise the boiling point

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:09.050
to 106 degrees C. And then what
we can do, is now change

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.970
the composition.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.970
So we change the pressure, and
I change the boiling point.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.400
I change the composition.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.260
add 50% ethylene glycol.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.690
So now I've got a
one-to-one mix,

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.210
ethylene glycol and water.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.170
And that takes the boiling point
up to 130 degrees C, or

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.640
265 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.600
So another example of how
we can manage systems.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.030
So when I'm showing you by these
several examples, is

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.770
that the boiling point is a
function of pressure and

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.260
composition.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.640
So we can tune the
boiling point.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.600
See we were tuning materials
properties before.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.900
Now we're tuning physical
chemical properties, because

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.280
that's what chemistry
is all about.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.730
It's about control.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.430
It's about management.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.220
Management to advantage.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.270
So how do we know
what to do here?

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.240
Can we predict this from
first principles?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.080
No.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.860
Systems are still
too complicated.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.390
Our models aren't
robust enough.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.150
So instead, we turn
to an archive.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.165
So we have phase diagrams.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.370
And the phase diagrams guide
us in our search for better

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.140
management of material
systems.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.670
And these are stability maps.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.570
They tell us which phases are
stable under which conditions

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.100
of pressure, temperature,
composition.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.220
You can consider them
as archives.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.460
So that's what I want to talk
about, because it's really

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.540
important to know this stuff.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:49.950
OK.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.190
So what are we going to do?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.510
So first of all, let's--

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.650
I don't want to write
on that one.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.400
This is interesting.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.960
This could be a work of art.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.850
I'd hate to desecrate it.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.860
You like?

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.250
This is really good!

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.540
So I'm just going
to leave that.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.680
That's very good.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.330
That's excellent.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:08.630
OK.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.200
So I've been talking
about phase.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.080
What is a phase?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.490
Let's get the right
definition here.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.440
What is a phase?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.920
It's a region uniform chemical
composition.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.940
Just to get it down.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.630
it's a region in a material,
region of uniform chemical

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:33.060
composition, and it has these
other properties.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.130
Uniform chemical composition.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.790
It's physically distinct.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.130
And I'll show you by examples,
but let's just get the

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.340
definition down.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.980
It's physically distinct, and
in the extreme case--

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.500
so that means it's bounded.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.710
It's physically distinct.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.460
That's a fancy way of saying
that you can put a

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.150
boundary around it.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.480
It's bounded.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.490
And then the other property that
it has, it's mechanically

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.740
separable in the extreme.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.320
And so that's in the
case where you have

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.640
a multi-phase system.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.730
You can point to the
different p.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.450
So what I'm going to
do, is I'm going to

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.430
give you some examples.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:20.400
And so I'm going to let circle
p equal number of phases.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.530
I'll give you some examples.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.870
Why am I using circle p?

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.720
Because just plain old p
is already pressure.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.410
So pressure, so this is kind of
a Western motif, you know?

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.800
Like a Circle Bar Ranch
or something.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.890
So it's a p with a circle.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.640
That's my font.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.110
That's how I say number
of phases.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.600
So let's take a look
at some examples.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.760
So here's some examples
of p equals 1.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.730
So simple one is pure water.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.980
Pure H2O liquid.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.300
It has all of this.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.700
Wherever I have the water, all
right, here's some water, it's

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.200
all of the same chemical
composition.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.940
It is physically distinct.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.510
I can put a boundary
around it.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.840
And in this case, there's
nothing to separate, because

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.010
it's just a one-phase system.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.480
White gold.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.170
White gold is one phase.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.050
Because we have gold.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.160
Obviously we have gold.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.570
If you market something as white
gold, it has no gold,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.620
you'll go to prison.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.270
And how do we make white gold go
to its white color from the

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.190
normal yellow?

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.930
We add silver and
we add nickel.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.100
And these are all FCC metals,
and they substitute for one

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.670
another on the lattice, and if
you sample anywhere in the

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.700
white gold, you get
the same chemical

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.410
composition, and so on.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.970
Air is an example of
a one-phase system.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.230
It's a gas, and in decreasing
order, we

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.860
have nitrogen, oxygen.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.900
So it's a solution.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.590
We're breathing a solution.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.600
Nitrogen, oxygen, argon are
the main constituents.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.730
There's some CO2, some sulfur
dioxide if you live near a

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.870
power plant, NOx if you're
near a tailpipe, and

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.490
so on and so forth.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:59.740
And then the last one I'll
give as an example is

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.990
calcia-zirconia.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.820
Or cubic zirconia.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.530
Let's just call it
cubic zirconia.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.010
The holidays are coming,
so we better get

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.460
cubic zirconia up here.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.950
That's the poor man's diamond.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.100
Cubic zirconia, which consists
of a solid solution of calcium

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.700
oxide in zirconium oxide.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.160
This is a solid solution, so
it's continuous and chemical

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.230
composition identical.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.920
Now, contrast that with
two-phase system.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.640
So p equals 2 looks like this.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.830
So let's look at, instead of
simple water liquid, if I have

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.320
ice cubes in water.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.980
So now I have two different
phases, and they're separated

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.720
by state of matter.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.290
State of matter is
the issue here.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.000
Because I have a solid--

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.400
this is solid--

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.490
and I'm going to put the
boundary around them.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.170
The composition of the solid
is different from the

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.300
composition of liquid.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.820
They're both the same water,
but you can tell it's a

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.740
different crystal structure
and so on.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.820
And I can put boundaries
around, and it's

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.910
mechanically separable.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.880
You can pull the ice cubes
out of the mix.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.710
Milk is two-phase.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.780
Milk has a fatty phase and
it has an aqueous phase.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.650
The aqueous phase contains
the minerals.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.650
That's why you can drink skim
milk and still get your

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.560
calcium, because calcium, even
the general public knows

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.030
calcium is a mineral.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.050
It's not elemental calcium,
it's a calcium compound.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:32.290
But it's ionic, it's soluble in
water, and the fat contains

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.150
the other parts.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.730
You know from last day, this
is one of the lipids.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.910
And so you have fat globules
that are mechanically

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.150
separable and distinct
from aqueous.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.730
So they actually have
a different chemical

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.370
composition, different
type of bonding.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.640
Right?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.500
This is largely nonpolar, and
nonpolar doesn't like to

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.990
dissolve in something that is
polar and hydrogen-bonded.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.860
So they phase separate.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.580
I've been saying phase
separate all along.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.290
Now you know what we mean
by phase separate.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.890
Here's a third one.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.500
This is really cool, because
you won't get this in any

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.640
other chemistry class,
because only 3.091

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.060
talks about such things.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.100
David, can we cut to the
document camera?

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.580
I want to show you a piece
of snowflake obsidian.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.880
Obsidian is a volcanic glass.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.450
So here's the piece
of obsidian.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.410
And what you're looking at is,
the black area is the glassy

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.000
part, and the white is actually
some of the obsidian

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.510
that has decided to devitrify.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.200
And it is turning crystalline.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.560
And so those are islands of
obsidian crystal sitting in a

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.305
matrix of obsidian glass.

00:14:51.305 --> 00:14:54.460
If we go back to the--

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.020
I picked that up in
Yellowstone Park.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.980
It's fantastic.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.690
There's a wall, just a wall of
obsidian that comes down.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.150
And I think I've got
an image here.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.720
There it is.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.060
This one I pulled off
the internet.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.720
So this is crystalline
phase, and this is

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.200
the amorphous phase.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.030
And the overall composition,
it's a glass, it's a silicate.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.050
And why isn't it transparent
to visible light?

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.440
Because it's got iron in it.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.400
The iron gives it the absorption
and capabilities.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.250
The band gap is invisible,
so it's black.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.500
But then when this crystallizes,
it's got a

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.060
different index, and
it's mainly SiO2.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.740
It's really the cristobalite
phase of the obsidian.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.180
So that's cool.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:41.690
So this is actually
differentiated on the basis of

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:50.700
amorphous and crystalline of
something that's virtually the

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.960
same chemical composition.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.020
So this could give you an idea
of what happens in the area of

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.660
phase separation.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.430
OK.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.340
Now the second thing that
I have to bring to your

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.830
attention, is that these phase
diagrams treat systems at

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.150
equilibrium.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.990
They're stability maps, and
they treat systems at

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.680
equilibrium.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.560
So what is equilibrium?

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.340
Let's just get one time up
here a definition of

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.000
equilibrium.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.680
Equilibrium is a condition which
there is no net reaction

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.270
taking place.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.540
The system could be reacting.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.230
If you're looking at the ice
cubes in water, the ice could

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.260
be dissolving, and some of the
water could be freezing, but

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.430
overall, with time, there's
no net reaction.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.420
It's a dynamic system with
no net reaction.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.430
And it's characterized as
the lowest energy state.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:46.270
Systems strive towards
equilibrium.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.040
If it's the lowest energy state,
no net reaction then.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.050
If a system is truly at
equilibrium, the properties

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.190
should be invariant
over time, because

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.130
there's no net reaction.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.980
You can't prove equilibrium.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.150
You can only demonstrate the
absence of equilibrium.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.990
Because at equilibrium, there's
nothing, there's no

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.240
net reaction.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.070
And it could be attainable
by multiple paths.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:18.910
So in other words, if I have ice
as the equilibrium phase,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.940
I can make it by freezing water,
and get to the same ice

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.700
at the given temperature
and pressure.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.960
Or I could sublime.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.150
But if I specify the pressure
and the composition, I should

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.100
always end up with
the same system.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.663
So attainable by
multiple paths.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.900
Because it's a stable
state, so it doesn't

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.490
matter how you got there.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.440
It's a state function.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.840
And you know from your physics,
a state function has

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.880
the same value, regardless
of how you arrived there.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.400
And then the last thing is,
I want to differentiate.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.370
See, these are all single phase,
but some of them are

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.470
just one element, some of them
are just one compound, and

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.720
some of them have a whole mix.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.780
So we have a way of quantifying
the degree of

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.270
chemical complexity by using
the term called component.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.195
It's a measure of chemical
complexity.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:27.715
It's the number of chemically
distinguishable constituents.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.060
And again, these are
definitions.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.160
I'll give you some examples
so then the

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.880
definition comes to life.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.395
I like to think of it as the
number of bottles you've got

00:18:43.395 --> 00:18:47.460
to pull off the shelf to
make the final product.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.210
The building blocks.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.950
So for example, water
is just water.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.580
You could say, but it's
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.830
But if you take 560 or some
other thermal class, you'll

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.560
learn that they're bound
by mole ratio.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.220
You don't have freedom of
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.980
So it's just one bottle, whereas
to make white gold,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.600
you need three bottles.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.810
You need a bottle of gold,
a bottle of silver,

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.590
and a bottle of nickel.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.240
So that's a three component
system.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.440
And I'm going to designate the
components by c with a

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.280
circle around it.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.670
Because c without a circle
is already composition,

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.270
concentration.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.560
OK.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.160
So now we can put all of this
together, and we'll show the

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.480
difference between
multicomponent and multiphase.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.070
So we'll make a little table
here, and here I'm going to

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.260
talk about one-phase systems,
and distinguish on the basis

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.320
of components.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.540
So if it's single phase single
component, that's just water.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.860
One phase, one component.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.160
Simple liquid.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.640
If it's two components one
phase, that could be

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.930
calcia-zirconia.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.340
I need a bottle of calcia and a
bottle of zirconia in order

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.350
to make this two component
single-phase system.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.320
And then to have three
components,

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.070
that's the white gold.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.680
It's still single phase, but I
need the gold, silver, and the

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.860
nickel, whereas if I come over
here, I've got two phases.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.480
That could be slush.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.910
Slush, that's ice water.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.420
It's just one component.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:26.550
I just start with water, and
drop it down to 0 Centigrade,

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.230
and I'm going to end up with
ice crystals in the water.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.600
So that's one component.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.930
I just needed one bottle.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.800
Literally, one bottle.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.230
All right.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.210
Now what about two components,
two phases?

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.950
Well, we saw earlier when we
started thinking about

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.720
solubility, we did the
bilayer with carbon

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.690
tetrachloride and water.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.270
Remember, we dropped potassium
permanganate and iodine, and

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.380
the potassium permanganate
dissolved in the water, and

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.540
the iodine dissolved in the
carbon tetrachloride?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.200
Two different components.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.550
I need a bottle of carbon tet
and a bottle of water.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.010
And they'll phase separate.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.150
They don't dissolve in one
another, because this is a

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.460
nonpolar liquid, and this is
polar hydrogen bonded.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.890
That's the origin of
phase separation.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.700
It's all about bonding, and
bonding is all about

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.690
electronic structure, and that
sounds like a good topic for a

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.280
class in chemistry.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.260
And then the last one
here is obsidian.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.780
The snowflake obsidian,
in which the

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.220
components are SiO2--

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.020
so I'm going to have three
components and

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.070
end up with two phases.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.210
SiO2, there's some magnesia, and
then the black comes from

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.710
the magnetite.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.670
Fe304.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.610
So I've got three bottles off
the shelf, and I end up with

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.990
something that is crystalline
and amorphous.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.830
So that's where I get
the two phases.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.040
Three components, two phases.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.540
It's great.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.560
So now I want to look at
some stability maps.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.290
And I'm going to start with the
simplest of all, which is

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.030
the one we know best from human

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.030
experience, and that's water.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.910
So we're going to look
at the one--

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.150
so it's a one component.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:09.830
So for water, we start with c
equals 1, and the example is

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.470
going to be water.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.150
One component phase diagram.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.890
So we don't have a composition
axis, because the only thing

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.300
we can vary is pressure
and temperature.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.760
If we change composition,
we've lost water.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.860
So it has to be axiomatically,
no variation composition.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.660
All we have is that
the coordinates of

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.080
temperature and pressure.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.160
So there it is out of the book,
and I'm going to draw it

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.740
a little bit differently, just
to emphasize three of my

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.500
favorite words.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.490
Not to scale.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.370
Otherwise you can't see some
of the subtle features.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.005
So overall, it's a
y-shaped diagram.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.020
And this is pressure.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.970
Let's make it pressure
in atmospheres.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.410
Then our human experiences
is at 1 atmosphere.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.400
So at the highest temperatures,
we expect to

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:16.125
have vapor, and at the lowest
temperatures, we expect solid.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.660
And in between, we
expect liquid.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.020
And then if we look at the 1
atmosphere isobar, what's

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.440
happening on this line?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.500
On the one side of line it's
liquid, and the other side of

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.460
line, it's vapor.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.550
At this temperature, liquid
and vapor coexist.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.030
I call that the boiling point.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.510
So I'm going to put 100 here.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.180
And we already learned from our
little example of Mount

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.920
Everest that this locust here,
this line, is the liquid

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.050
equals vapor two phase
equilibrium.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.500
And you see how it changes?

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.390
If I go to the top of Mount
Everest, the pressure is less

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.410
than 1 atmosphere.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.940
which means the boiling point
of water is below the

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.930
denaturing point.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.810
So this actually gives
you the map.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.420
Or if I put the pressure
cap on, I go up here.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.540
And you can use this in
the kitchen again.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.420
If you love wild rice, and you
can't wait 45 minutes when you

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.760
get home, use a pressure
cooker.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.750
What the pressure cooker does,
is it allows you to have

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.100
liquid up to 130 degrees
Celsius.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.050
See, you can't steam it.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.940
You've got to soak
it in water.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.175
And you know the
Arrhenius Law.

00:24:25.175 --> 00:24:28.490
If you can get the temperature
up by 30 degrees, you'll cut

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.440
the cooking time in half.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.460
So how do you get water,
liquid, at 130 degrees?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.920
Then you can cook quicker!

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.240
Pressure.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:38.730
Seal it.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.240
And then you've got liquid
water way, way up here.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.630
Now over here, this is
solid goes to liquid.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.530
So this is the freezing
point line.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.500
At 1 atmosphere, that's 0.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.600
0 Celsius.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.370
And you know, if you
go skating--

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.720
so let's say the ice
is minus 5 Celsius.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.350
And you're here, but you put
your weight on the blades, and

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.270
the blades have small area.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.410
So pressure is force per area.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.900
So that puts you up here, and
now you cross, and now you

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.170
glide on water.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.360
Film of water.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.870
You ever watch a hockey game?

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:14.730
I grew up in Canada.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.580
We used to say, well,
the ice is fast.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.520
Why is the ice fast?

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.700
Because you get down to
temperatures where you just

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.335
get the right slickness
of water.

00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:27.580
If the ice is slow, the
temperature is so close that,

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.910
you know, you get these big,
bruising hockey players, and

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.210
they're moving up into
here, and it's

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.770
like they're dragging.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.050
And if you ever come from
Minnesota or North Dakota, if

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.560
you've ever skated when the
temperature gets down about

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.050
minus 20, minus 30?

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.630
It's a different experience,
because you never

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.820
get across this line.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.950
Your blades are just, they
can't get a good grip.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.250
See?

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.490
Everything you need
to know is here.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.800
This is four-star chef, this is

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.780
prize-winning hockey player.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.530
We haven't got off the 1
atmosphere line yet.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:25:59.870
OK.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.110
So now I'm going to say, this
is single phase, right?

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.360
It's just vapor.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.870
This is single phase, and
this is single phase.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.130
It's all solid.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.510
And along this line, it's
two phase, isn't it?

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.040
Solid-liquid.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.250
This is ice cubes, isn't it.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.410
Anywhere along this line
is ice cubes in water.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.370
Look at this one.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.750
This is liquid vapor.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.890
This is solid, liquid--

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:30.210
all three of them
coexist here.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:36.910
This is p equals 3, which means,
ice cubes floating in

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.160
boiling water.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.940
And this happens at
only one point.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:50.270
It's called the triple point,
and its coordinates are--

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.480
this is not to scale.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.610
So this is 0.01 degrees
C. It's a

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.460
1/100 of a degree higher.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:03.730
And the pressure here is 4.58
millimeters of mercury, which

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.080
then you can convert using
the 760 as 1 atmosphere.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.070
Oh, and this is solid-vapor.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.000
You can go directly from solid
to vapor down here.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.300
If you hang up your clothes on
a line and it's minus 20

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.800
degrees outside, first
thing that

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.890
happens, the clothes freeze.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.330
You come back five
hours later, and

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.080
the clothes are dry.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.660
Well, what happened?

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.580
Did somebody take them in?

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.820
Run them around the clothes
dryer, then

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.750
hang them up for you?

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.920
No.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.340
You're going directly from solid
to vapor, down in here.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.590
So here's the whole story
of the phase diagram.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.930
One last thing I want
to point out.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:39.530
Here, you're at a given
temperature and it's vapor.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.390
And then you squeeze, squeeze,
squeeze, and now things get

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.390
closer together, and you go
from paper to liquid at

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.180
constant temperature.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.290
That makes sense, right?

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.430
I start from vapor, constant
temperature.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.740
I squeeze it, I get liquid,
I keep squeezing,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.150
I should make solid.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:52.980
Here's vapor.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.510
I squeeze, I get solid,
and I squeeze

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.550
harder, and I get liquid.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.910
That makes no sense at all,
but that's what happens.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:00.850
What does this tell me?

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.680
It tells me that the number of
nearest neighbors in the solid

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.900
is greater than the vapor.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.700
Yeah, I get that.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.040
But the number of nearest
neighbors in the liquid must

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.420
be greater than the
number of nearest

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.770
neighbors in the solid.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.980
This is an exception.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.480
When I see this negative slope,
it means that ice cubes

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.100
are going to float on water.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.170
That's what I learn from
this negative slope.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.520
So let's put that down.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.020
dp by dt when dp by dt
is less than zero.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.870
This is for solid
equals liquid.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.880
That means that the density of
the solid is less than the

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.640
density of the liquid.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.350
All from here.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.780
OK.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.640
Good.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.810
So let's look at a few
other phase diagrams.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.020
I think I've got a few
things up here.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.980
Here's silicon.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.290
Pressure versus temperature.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.940
Its normal melting
point is about--

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.650
see, now I said normal
melting point.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.920
After today's lecture, if
somebody says, what's the

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.000
boiling point of water?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.050
You don't go, 100 degrees.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.300
You say, at what pressure?

00:29:01.935 --> 00:29:03.780
And they go, oh, I hate you.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.020
I hated you before.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.990
I'm going to use
an adverb here.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.020
Now I really hate you.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.630
OK.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.150
So this is the normal melting
point of silicon.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:14.110
It's about 1430 degrees
Centigrade, or a 1700

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.150
something Kelvin.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.080
And it also has this
negative slope.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.980
And what does that tell you?

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.510
That liquid silicon is denser
than solid silicon, and it's a

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.150
good thing it is, because
we wouldn't have the

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.200
microelectronics age if
it weren't for that.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.460
We couldn't have Teukolsky
crystal growth and everything

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.420
else that makes silicon
dirt cheap.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.450
You know why it's dirt cheap?

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:32.440
Because it's made from dirt.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.510
That's why it's dirt cheap.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:36.240
It's true.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.020
Here's aluminum.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.260
This is normal.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.440
This is the normal solid-liquid
equilibrium.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.430
This is FCC metal, which
is the closest packed.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.430
Axiomatically, the liquid must
be less well-packed.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.030
All right?

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.460
So this is dog bites man,
this is man bites dog.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.320
This is the unusual one.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:54.770
OK.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.430
What else do we have?

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.140
Nitrogen!

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.620
Here's nitrogen.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.200
I drew this.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.120
So there's the 1 atmosphere
line.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.750
Nitrogen boils at 77
Kelvin, and it

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.680
freezes at about 63 Kelvin.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.320
And it's got the positive slope
that you'd expect, and

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.570
so solid nitrogen is denser
then liquid nitrogen.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:15.010
And you can remember
77 Kelvin.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.560
You want to remember a
few of these things.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.220
I wanted to point out to
you that at atmospheric

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.520
temperature, ambient
temperature, you

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.080
can remember 20-20.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.270
20-20 vision.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.850
So at 20 degrees C, it's roughly
20 millimeters of

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.120
mercury, is the vapor
pressure of water.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.240
It's not exactly true, but
it's close enough.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.420
I think it's really 24.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.500
But 20-20 is nice to know.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.240
And what's the street
address for MIT?

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.490
77 Mass Ave. That's the boiling
point of liquid

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.390
nitrogen, 77 Kelvin.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.170
So I thought we'd do
a few things here.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:54.320
And I'm going to show you a
little bit of fun and games

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.250
with liquid nitrogen.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.120
But first, I've been instructed
I have to practice

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.400
safe laboratory--

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.200
So I'm going to put
on my lab coat.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.780
Yes.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.140
It's a nice lab coat.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.100
Mm-hm!

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.370
Yeah, look.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.030
You want to know--

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.460
let's go back to this.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.820
They have to know where
the-- this is not

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.990
just any old lab coat.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.990
This is a nice lab coat.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.880
This is from France.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.060
It's from MAISON DUTECH.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:21.680
See?

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.595
Notice the collar.

00:31:22.595 --> 00:31:25.460
It's not that typical,
you know.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.560
MAISON DUTECH.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.420
OK.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.880
Let's go back to the
phase diagram.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:37.140
So Dave Broderick is going
to help us here.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.990
So we're going to
have some fun.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.004
I'm going to put on
a face shield so

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:44.776
I don't blind myself.

00:31:44.776 --> 00:31:47.340
All right.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.240
Here we go.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.030
All right.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.700
So let's get some
liquid nitrogen.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.950
Sounds different, huh?

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.912
Sounds terrible for me.

00:31:57.912 --> 00:31:58.520
All right.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.080
So we've got some liquid
nitrogen here, and I'll pour

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.330
it into a Dewar.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.760
So what happens when you wet a
sheet of paper with ink with

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.650
liquid nitrogen?

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.765
What kind of bonding is there
in liquid nitrogen?

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:31.370
Look.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.480
No running, no running.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.730
If it's liquid nitrogen.

00:32:39.715 --> 00:32:42.600
I tell you, everything you
learn here is so valuable

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.790
compared all the other stuff
you learn here--

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.110
All right.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.450
So there's a couple of things.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.140
So let's look at glass
transition temperature.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.320
So this is a latex glove.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.460
You can see it's above its glass
transition temperature,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.150
and the cross-links are
snapping it back.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:00.060
What I'm going to do, is take
it down below its glass

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.960
transition temperature, and turn
it glassy and brittle.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.440
So that it's below the TG.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.260
Here's some paraffin.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.806
Paraffin, which is also
a polymer here.

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.470
Take the paper off.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.760
OK.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.570
So here's paraffin.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.880
Look.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.956
Look at the van der
Waals bond.

00:33:34.956 --> 00:33:35.815
All right?

00:33:35.815 --> 00:33:38.480
This is van der Waals bond.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.730
Now we're going to
go below the TG.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.350
It's liquid nitrogen!

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.600
It doesn't matter.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.350
OK, you can hear it already.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.340
So it's now below the glass
transition temperature.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.290
So what else have we got?

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.970
Oh, you've heard of the glass
flowers at Harvard?

00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:14.460
Well, we've got glass
flowers here, so.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.520
Here's a rose.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.818
See, in the proteins, you know,
it's above the-- you

00:34:19.818 --> 00:34:21.700
know, it's soft.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.250
But now, we're going
to put the--

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.730
mm-hm.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.140
Here we go.

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.390
You ready?

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:31.780
Oh, come on.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.490
It's not a kitten.

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:33.740
What's the matter?

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.490
It's still burbling here.

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:41.854
We have to wait until
it's dead.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.830
This is for science.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:54.630
OK.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:59.480
Now it's below its glass
transition temperature.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.117
Oh, I'm sorry, David.

00:35:00.117 --> 00:35:01.367
I should put this over
on the other side.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.420
But maybe it's the red,
or maybe it's

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.250
because it's a rose.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.410
So here's the chrysanthemum.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.670
Today is your day.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:16.740
Let's go.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.980
Get this thing moving!

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:25.980
Yeah.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:31.860
So there you have it.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.830
There you have it.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.940
I think that's--

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:42.742
oh, there's one, may we
go back to the slide?

00:35:42.742 --> 00:35:44.710
Better put the gloves
on for this.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.970
I'll have to write
apology letters.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.990
OK.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:53.660
So we're going to do next, is
we're going to look at phase

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.470
equilibriums.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.890
There's the melting points and
boiling point of oxygen,

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:57.780
argon, and nitrogen.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.970
And what you notice is that
nitrogen boils at a lower

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.060
temperature then oxygen
and argon.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.860
So what I'm going to do, is I'm
going to pour some liquid

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.930
nitrogen into this beaker.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.550
And then inside the graduated
cylinder, I'm going to let it

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.070
sit here, and we're going
to condense air.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.680
And the result will be that
we're going to start

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.170
condensing liquid oxygen, and
they'll be little bits of

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.995
argon ice floating
in liquid oxygen.

00:36:24.995 --> 00:36:28.850
And liquid oxygen is faintly
blue, and it's paramagnetic,

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.800
as you know, because it's got
the unpaired electrons, which

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.700
means that it will levitate
in a magnetic field.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.120
I couldn't bring a big magnet
in here, but we'll see if we

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.000
can make some blue stuff.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.160
And it's foaming, because this
would be like pouring water

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.990
into something that's--

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.310
I don't know.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.340
300 degrees Centigrade.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.680
But eventually, the heat
transfer gets low enough that

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.845
you have stability here, and--

00:36:52.845 --> 00:36:54.095
yeah.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.080
OK.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.870
Oh, that's terrific.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:09.120
OK.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.500
What else have we got?

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:15.995
Let's go back to the slide.

00:37:15.995 --> 00:37:17.245
God, I hate this thing.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.310
OK.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.390
So you've been looking
at that nitrogen.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.800
Let's look at what's next.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.090
Ah.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.280
Now if you solidify nitrogen
here, you get a whole bunch of

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.730
different polymorphs.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.030
Different crystal structures.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.630
So there are about five or six
different crystallographic

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.110
forms of solid nitrogen.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.640
For that, we'd have to
bring liquid helium.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.000
4.2 Kelvin.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.210
Very cool stuff.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.510
Here's carbon dioxide.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.660
Now, it also has the positive
slope, so solid

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.760
will sink in liquid.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.610
But look, the interesting
point here.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:55.400
The triple point is
5 atmospheres.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.750
At atmospheric pressure, you go
directly from solid to gas.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:59.990
It sublimes.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.120
And that's advantageous.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.830
When we use carbon dioxide as
a coolant, when it gives up

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.520
its enthalpy to cool, it doesn't
then turn into liquid.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.560
If you chill something with ice,
with water ice, when it

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.680
gives up its enthalpy,
the object is

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.460
now swimming in water.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.210
And that's no good.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.140
So hence we have the term dry
ice, because we go directly

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.310
from solid to vapor.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.460
And we want to prove this.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:33.660
So what we've got here is
a big block of dry ice.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:40.850
So this is at minus 78 degrees
Celsius, and it's

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.040
still stable here.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.670
Well, it's subliming
before your eyes.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.570
It's smaller than it was when
we started the lecture.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.990
So what I'm going to do now--

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:55.170
oh, I'm not wearing
that stuff.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.720
I guess I'd better.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.540
They're going to write
me up on some log,

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.960
teaching you bad practice.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.145
But anyways.

00:39:03.145 --> 00:39:03.670
All right.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.170
So what we're going to do, is
we're going to test the

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.130
proposal that this actually
goes-- so I've got some water.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.920
Here, David, let's go
out to the video.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.865
So let's take some water.

00:39:11.865 --> 00:39:13.680
I think we got water
from France.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.700
Goes with the lab coat.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.335
This is Evian, OK?

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:30.180
So I pour the Evian into
the Florence flask.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.430
This is Florence.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:42.290
Florence is round, and the
Erlenmeyer is the flat one.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.850
So let's move this guy.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.070
You're going in the backstage
for a while.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:47.540
You just keep

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.900
condensing All right.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.440
So now, this is here.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.230
Now what we're going to do, is
we're going to put some dry

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.870
ice in there, and see
if we go directly

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:59.150
from solid to a vapor.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.910
Take a chip off the
old block, here.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.680
OK.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.590
So now you can see that
it's going directly

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.030
from solid to vapor.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.820
So that's carbon dioxide
bubbles.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.480
And we assume that the phase
diagrams is correct.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.980
I mean, another thing
we could do, is--

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.342
I mean, I know what club
soda tastes like.

00:40:33.342 --> 00:40:34.870
I could just test it, right?

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.790
Yeah.

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.590
It's carbon dioxide.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:45.840
Now!

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.870
Here's the other thing.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:54.140
You know, Schweppes likes to
pride itself on tiny bubbles.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.370
They have a tagline,
Tiny Bubbles.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:57.630
Right?

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:02.550
So here's Schweppes.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:05.930
And you can see Schweppes,
with their

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.410
wimpy little tiny bubbles.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.190
Can you get that, David?

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.690
But we have, we have
big bubbles.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.950
I mean, this is pure.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.080
You can't get any better
than that.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.280
I got Evian water, and I got
a block of carbon dioxide.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.080
I like making my own
carbonated water.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.770
I've taken it to a new level.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.840
OK.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.930
What else do we have?

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.890
Well, let's see if we made
any liquid oxygen here.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.720
Try this.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.270
I don't know if we got
anything here.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.670
Oh yeah!

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.140
Oh, wow.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.390
Look.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.280
OK.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.890
So that liquid in there--
oh, I see.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:55.023
You've got a separate thing.

00:41:55.023 --> 00:41:56.382
I don't know if you can see.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.210
It's condensing.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.750
That liquid in there, that's
liquid oxygen.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.100
I won't drink this.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.990
But I can inhale it.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.440
Pure oxygen.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.570
I could have a cigarette,
and just put the

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.310
cigarette in there.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:23.640
What happens if I put the lit
cigarette into the oxygen?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.200
All that happens is that it
burns quickly, that's all.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.130
There's no explosion.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:27.950
It burns quickly.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.990
If you walk into a room full of
oxygen, all that happens is

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.310
you'll singe your nose,
that's all.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.410
There's no explosion.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.780
It's just oxygen.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.740
There's no fuel.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.550
The fuel is just in tobacco,
and there's not much.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:39.220
It's not a problem.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.390
A room full of oxygen?

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:41.390
Pfft!

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.660
OK.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.501
Let's go back to the slides.

00:42:46.501 --> 00:42:48.780
What have we got here?

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.940
We've got some examples of
other phase diagrams.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.030
All right.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.820
Yeah.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.070
[MUSIC PLAYBACK: FROM 'PHANTOM
OF THE OPERA']

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.840
PROFESSOR: Actually,
it's quite tasty.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.340
All right.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.080
So.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.650
Now, here's zirconia.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.440
Now, here's the thing to
know about zirconia.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.170
Look at all the different
phases.

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.565
And cubic zirconia is the one
that has a high index of

00:43:15.565 --> 00:43:20.460
refraction, but it's stable only
at temperatures exceeding

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:24.160
2000 degrees C. So
that's no good.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.700
So what I'm going to show you
next day is that by changing

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:32.290
the composition, and adding
calcium oxide, we open up this

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:35.250
zone here that's labeled cubic,
and we get it stable

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.940
all the way down to
room temperature.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.920
It's an example of changing
composition to get the

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.160
stability of a phase
that we want.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.130
This is carbon.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:46.700
So down here, the normal form,
as we've learned earlier, the

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.070
normal form is graphite.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.860
Diamond is formed at elevated
temperatures and pressures.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.812
And this is liquid carbon.

00:43:52.812 --> 00:43:53.630
All right?

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.270
Now, to make artificial diamond,
you can try putting

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.850
graphite in an anvil, and
squeezing, and squeezing, and

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:01.610
squeezing, and coming
up into here.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.330
And then it becomes metastable,
and then maybe,

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.470
because the activation energy
to jump from that sp3

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:11.010
hybridized state to sp2 is so
high, the diamond is stable.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.820
So you don't have to go running
home to see if your

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.300
diamond studs are now turning
into graphite.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:16.700
They won't.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.700
Once you get into this
zone, they'll stay.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.160
The activation energy
is too high.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.850
You need more than 1/40 eV
to do it, is necessary.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.820
But in the 1950s, General
Electric, its Schenectady

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.280
research labs, reasoned that
because carbon is so soluble

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.130
in iron, they could dissolve
carbon in liquid iron, and

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:38.880
then raise the pressure and
temperature, and then change

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.660
to exsolve and cause carbon
to precipitate

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.560
out of molten iron.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.340
That's the birth of artificial
diamond.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.100
That's how they did it.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.268
Using this concept, but then
dissolving it in molten iron.

00:44:50.268 --> 00:44:52.760
[MUSIC PLAYBACK: 'DIAMONDS ARE
A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND']

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.700
PROFESSOR: I don't know
how that got in there.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.450
All right.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:56.680
Here's one for mercury.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.430
I looked it up, using the tools
that you've been taught

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.300
here in 3.091.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.620
So this is a paper phase
diagram for mercury.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.500
And physicists drive me nuts,
because they plot temperature

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.330
versus pressure.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.300
I want pressure versus
temperature.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.060
So I just turned it around.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.070
And so here's the liquid line.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.950
So you know that liquid mercury
is going to float on

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:21.120
solid mercury, and there's a
plurality of solid phases.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.230
And these are all different
crystal structures.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.370
Now I've got a treat for you.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.590
I was in Barcelona several
years ago, and I saw the

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:32.920
mercury fountain that was made
by Joan Miro in collaboration

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.450
with Calder.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.630
Calder has the big sail outside
of East Campus.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:39.670
So Calder collaborated
with Miro, back in

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.690
the '30s and '40s.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.480
And this is in honor of the
miners of Almaden, where there

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.950
are cinnabar mines.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:50.960
And the miners fought bravely
against the Fascist forces of

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.600
Franco, and Miro wanted
to honor them.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.872
So here's their museum.

00:45:55.872 --> 00:45:58.150
It's a beautiful place
up on top of an

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.200
escarpment over Barcelona.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.710
And what I'm going to show you
is a mercury fountain.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.160
[MUSIC PLAYBACK]

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.410
This is liquid mercury.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.636
The speed has not
been altered.

00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:14.540
This is a liquid at room
temperature, density 13.5,

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.980
metallic bonds.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.205
Look at it.

00:46:19.205 --> 00:46:20.848
Very high surface tension.

00:46:20.848 --> 00:46:22.098
Look at the way it shimmers.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.170
Look at this shot.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.360
This has not been altered.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.130
That's the way it pours
into gravity field.

00:46:30.956 --> 00:46:32.210
It's really fantastic.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:34.250
And of course, mercury vapor
is toxic, so the

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.220
whole thing is in a--

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.180
[END MUSIC PLAYBACK]

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.850
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's the--

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.340
I cut that snippet out
of the documentary.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.460
OK, we don't want to see that.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.960
So they have the whole
thing inside of a

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.930
polymethylmethacrylate cage, to
keep the mercury vapor from

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.060
affecting the people that
work in the museum.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.630
Here are some phase diagrams
from hell.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:53.800
This is bismuth.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.110
And look at bismuth.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.830
Bismuth is like water,
and like silicon.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.590
So the solid is less dense
than the liquid.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:04.170
But look at all of these
different phases.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:04.800
Here's sulfur.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.570
Sulfur is crazy.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.680
Look, phases in the solid phase,
there's even phases in

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.330
the liquid!

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.130
Different phases.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:12.990
They're allotropes.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.810
Here's sulfur.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.865
Elemental sulfur, the disulfide,
hexasulfide.

00:47:16.865 --> 00:47:19.890
It makes rings, it makes
long chains.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.320
And these are called
allotropes.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.950
They're different forms
of the same element.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:29.520
So oxygen is O. There's
the diatomic molecule.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.290
And the triatomic molecule,
which is ozone, these are all

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:33.540
allotropes of oxygen.

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:36.720
What else do we have?

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.030
OK.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.880
This is polymorphs.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.090
So this is alpha goes to beta.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.310
See, different crystal
structures.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:43.720
You could see with your naked
eye what's going on here.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.720
Different crystal structures.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.820
And then this goes to lambda,
and then finally, they're

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:48.850
pouring here.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.710
And if you get a very high
cooling rate, and you've got

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.670
those long chains,
what happens?

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:53.880
You don't form the crystal.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.280
You form the amorphous form.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.110
So they'll call this forming
plastic sulfur.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:58.810
We know better.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:00.300
It's amorphous sulfur.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.550
It's not plastic sulfur.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.350
Here's water, a complete
diagram.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.400
Now, this is in kilobars.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.260
So there's all the different
phases of water.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.450
There's the negative line.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.450
That's the thing here.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.850
But at very, very high.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:15.350
Look at all the different
phases of water.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.370
And they have numbers on them.

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:17.940
If you read Kurt Vonnegut's
Cat's

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.650
Cradle, there's ice nine.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:23.720
You get that going, it freezes
the whole world, right?

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.560
But here's, I draw your
attention on this one.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.850
You see this point here?

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.110
This is ice seven.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.840
At 100 degrees C, it's solid.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.945
You need 25 kilobars.

00:48:32.945 --> 00:48:37.000
So we could go over to the lab,
take some water, put 25

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.600
kilobars on it, make solid
ice at 100 degrees C.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.020
And it'll be stable.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.220
Look!

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.500
This is minus 78.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.730
It's been here for
a long time.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.060
So now I come into a cocktail
party with this, I drop this

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:54.150
ice cube into a glass of aqueous
beverage, it sinks to

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:59.460
the bottom, and the beverage
heats up to the boiling point.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.350
That's what this
is telling you!

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:06.200
That'll get you popularity
instantly.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.660
How did you do that?

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.850
How did you do that?

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:12.070
And up here is the supercritical
fluid, the last

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:13.600
thing we haven't said
anything about.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.040
Look.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.410
If you take a gas, and you
keep squeezing it and

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:20.080
squeezing it, eventually the gas
molecules are close enough

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.470
together that they're
indistinguishable from the

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:23.590
liquid phase.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:26.700
Or if you start here, with the
liquid, and you keep raising

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:31.540
the temperature, the density
goes lower and lower until the

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.090
molecules are far enough apart
that you can't tell this zone,

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:41.270
whether it's a rarefied liquid
or a highly compressed gas.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.860
The properties criss-cross.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.940
This is supercritical.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:49.840
It has liquid-like transport
properties, and vapor-like

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.780
chemical properties.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.150
So you can end up doing things
that are very, very different.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:56.300
Now, I'm going to give you an
example of decaffeinating

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.020
coffee by taking the coffee,
going up into the

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.900
supercritical regime, which
allows you to extract the

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.340
caffeine, and not
brew the coffee.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.070
So you want to just get the--
well, if you just heat it up,

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.920
you'll make the coffee.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.930
So here's an example.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:12.360
It's called solvent
extraction.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.910
Historically, this solvent was
methylene chloride, which is

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.900
also used as paint stripper.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.810
We don't do that anymore
to coffee.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:21.580
They did in the '60s!

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.020
They did.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.290
They also used
trichloroethylene.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:26.750
It works really well to leech
out the caffeine.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.780
How much is left in there for
you to taste in your coffee?

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.210
I don't know.

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:34.320
Maybe that's why people were
so excited in the '60s to

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.160
drink their decaffeinated
Sanka.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:36.610
I don't know.

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:41.240
But anyway, so you take the
green beans in carbon dioxide

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.250
as supercritical, and drop the
caffeine level, and then you

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:49.110
play with temperature and
pressure to go over the KSP.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:54.810
The caffeine salts out, and
then you recycle the CO2.

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:55.130
OK.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.190
I hope I've given you some

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.700
introduction to phase diagrams.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.320
And we'll see you on Monday.
