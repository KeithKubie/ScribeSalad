00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.290
All right.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.530
We're in the home stretch of
this first, I guess we could

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.310
have called almost experimental
section, but

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.820
hopefully it's been working
out decently.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.980
So we're on number 17.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:26.830
And it says, if a plus 2, times
x plus 1 is equal to s,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.800
what is x plus 1 in
terms of s and a?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.770
So x plus 1 is essentially
equal to what?

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.250
So let's just take this
equation-- so what happens if

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.690
we subtract a from both sides?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.550
Well, we get 2 times x plus
1 is equal to s minus a.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.550
I just subtracted a
from both sides.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.880
Let me switch colors.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.820
And then if we divide both sides
by 2, we get x plus 1 is

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.150
equal to s minus a over 2.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.690
And I think we're done.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.390
That's it.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.450
That was choice B.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.520
It was actually surprising to
see a problem that took so

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.430
little time this late in the
test. Because they normally

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.360
get kind of harder as
you go through.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240
And I guess the reason why this
is a little tricky is a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.420
lot of people's initial
motivation would be to try to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510
solve for x, and then
try to figure out

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.870
what x plus 1 equals.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.440
But the trick is to just not
break apart this x plus 1.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.390
I mean, you could kind of view
this as a variable, once

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.820
again, like a couple of problems
ago, where you have

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.070
to avoid distributing
this 2 out.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.900
If you just keep it as x plus 1
and you solve for x plus 1,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.860
you get very quickly to
s minus a over 2,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.240
which is choice B.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.250
The next problem, number 18.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.350
We are in the home stretch.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.560
And this is normally when
the problems get on

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.950
the difficult side.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.050
So let me clear this, because
it looks like it might take

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.300
some space.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.350
The shaded region above,
so let me draw the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.600
shaded region above.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.570
That's the y-axis-- oh man, I
want to draw it straight, but

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.130
anyway, I'll deal.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.745
I'll deal.

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:08.030
You can't always be perfect.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.570
So this is the y-axis,
this is the x-axis.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.130
And then I have this neat
looking curve that looks

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.380
something like this.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.840
The curve keeps going.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.620
Let's see, it draws
off some points.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.640
So it's like 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.370
And it draws this boundary
line here.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.550
It draws this boundary
line at 4.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.800
So it's like this.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.510
And then they shade the region,
and I have a feeling

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.990
you're going to ask about
the shaded region.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.010
Actually, let me-- because
I'm going to use

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.290
the shaded in tools.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.250
Let me make sure that I don't
end up filling up the whole

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.800
screen, so I want to make sure
that I close all the gaps.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.590
So now let me use the
shaded in tool.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.930
Ah, there, it worked out.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.120
All right, so what
do they say?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.380
The shaded region in the figure
above is bounded by the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.300
x-axis, that's this.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.280
The line x equals 4,
that's this line.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.580
And the graph y equals f of x.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.480
That's this, that's
the brown line.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.140
y is equal to-- I never use
grey, maybe I should use grey.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.270
I don't like grey.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.010
Anyway, green.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.330
If the point a, b lies in the
shaded region-- so we don't

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.660
know where.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.660
It's some place in this-- let
me use a darker color.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.330
Let me use navy blue.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.290
This point a, b is some place
in the shaded region.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.300
Which of the following
must be true?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.960
And they have choice number
one-- now I have to use a

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.630
lighter color-- choice number
one is that a is less than or

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.740
equal to 4.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:14.130
Choice number two is that b is
less than or equal to a.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:22.990
And choice number three is
that b is less than or

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.700
equal to f of a.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.100
Interesting.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.855
So we know that a, b is in this
grey region, so it's some

00:04:30.855 --> 00:04:32.040
place around there.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.410
So if that's a, b, so that means
that this point-- and

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.510
it's not exact. a, b could have
been anywhere in this

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.090
grey area, but let's say
that this point is a.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.470
And we know that this
point is b.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.830
So we know a couple of things.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.765
We know that a is some place
between 0 and 4.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.540
So that means that a is less
than or equal to 4, because it

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.420
could be 4, because we're
including the boundary.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.000
So this is correct.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.800
We know this is true.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800
Let's see.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.180
We also know-- well, we don't
know whether-- let's see, b is

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.740
less than a.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.480
How can we come to
that conclusion?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:26.320
Because if we had the point that
was, like, right-- well,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.920
even where it's here, but
let's say that this

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.800
point was our a, b.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.580
And I mean, just eyeballing it,
just looking at the graph,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.570
it just looks-- I mean,
we don't know.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.350
It looks like b in this
situation would

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.150
be larger than a.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.170
So I definitely don't think we
can make that conclusion.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.420
At least, there's no obvious way
to make that conclusion.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.790
Because we don't know what f
of x is. f of x could be

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.210
really steep and have a really
high slope, in which case, b

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.440
would grow faster than a at
this point earlier on.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.460
So I don't think that
this is right.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.690
So this is not right.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.980
And then let's see, is
b less than f of a?

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.840
So what is f of a?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.440
If this is point a,
what is f of a?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.760
Well, f of a is going
to be right here.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.010
This is f of a.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.840
And no matter where you draw it,
b is definitely going to

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.430
be less than f of a.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.370
If you picked this as our point,
and if you said that

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:34.050
this is b, and that this is a,
then this would be f of a in

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.210
bloody red.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.210
And b would still be less than
f of a, because b is in the

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.500
shaded region that is less
than f of a, essentially.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.590
So we also know that this
last term is correct.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.410
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.600
If this one doesn't make
sense, I want you to

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.150
experiment with it.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.290
And you'll see.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:59.420
But we're essentially saying
that the point is all the y

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.260
values less than f of x.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.650
This is the shaded region
essentially.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.820
So let's see, what
choice is that?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.230
One and three.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.320
One and three only,
that is choice D.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.460
D as in dog.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.020
Number 19.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.050
I don't know if we're going
to have time for this.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.050
I might have to do it
in the next video.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.850
Actually, let's just do it in
the next video, because I have

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.680
two more problems, and I'm going
to have to have another

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.930
video no matter what.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.380
So I'll see you in
the next video.
