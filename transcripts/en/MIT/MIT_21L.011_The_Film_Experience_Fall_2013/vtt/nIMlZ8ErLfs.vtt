DAVID THORBURN: One of the
things I aim for in the course,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.810
is to try to show students, in
ways as concrete and rich as I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.440
can, what the authority,
or power, of movies

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.700
in a cultural moment might be.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.759
And I try to give them
some examples of that.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.500
In my first lecture, I
sometimes read to them

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.834
from a passage from James Agee's
novel, A Death in the Family.

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:41.250
In the very beginning
of the novel

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.520
he describes, beautifully,
an excursion between a father

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.020
and son, going to see a
Chaplin comedy in 1915

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450
in some southern city.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.800
And what he describes is
what a social occasion

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.250
it was, what a moment of bonding
it was for father and son,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.290
what a cultural
moment it was more

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.700
broadly for the whole
of the population that

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.090
went into the theater
to laugh uproariously

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.530
at Charlie's shenanigans.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.160
"And then the screen
was filled with a city,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.540
and with a sidewalk of
a side street of a city,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.930
and a long line of palms.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260
And there was Charlie.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.950
Everyone laughed the minute
they saw him squattily walking,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.450
with his toes out and his knees
apart, as if he were chafed.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.880
Rufus's father laughed,
and Rufus laughed, too.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.210
This time, Charlie
stole a whole bag."

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.510
This time.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.230
What does that imply
about the audience?

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.120
An intimate familiarity
with the previous adventures

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.880
of this character, right?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.170
An ongoing, routine connection.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.000
"This time he caught a
sight of-- this time Charlie

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.497
stole a whole bag of eggs.

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:43.080
And when a cop came
along, he hid them

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.810
in the seat of his pants."

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.840
What it showed was the cultural
embeddedness of movies,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.075
even in their earliest
days, in the society,

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.470
and in the life of individuals.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.680
So, part of what I mean
by the power of movies,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.960
and what I try to encourage
the students to see,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.500
is something of this
anthropological energy,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.760
as well as its artistic
power as a representation

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.330
of human experience.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.380
That the way these kinds of
stories permeated the society

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.100
helped to shape America's--
Americans understanding

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.940
of their natures.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.500
Of what the social
fabric was like.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.900
Of what masculinity was.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.230
Of what femininity was.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.375
Of what families were.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.740
Of what the relations
among the races were.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.920
Of what American history was.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.680
About what the founding
story of America is.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.850
About what the central,
organizing values

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.740
of our culture are.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.900
All of those things are
dramatized, either explicitly

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.290
or implicitly, in movies.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.230
And because the
movies were so central

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.940
through the 20th
century, they were

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.760
one of the central ways in which
the belief system, the values,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.870
of American society were
promulgated, dramatized,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.220
rehearsed, and in some
ways, altered and changed.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.210
A related matter that
connected again to film,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.320
in part as an anthropological
or sociological phenomenon, not

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.630
simply an artistic one, as
a social practice in a way,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.780
has to do with the
power and role of genre

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.710
in movies, which is a
recurring theme in my course.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.980
Because we use genre
in American society.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.640
I think all cultures
do this, but we've

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.630
made particularly rich
and cunning use of genre

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.220
in American society.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.310
In many media, but
especially in film.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.550
And if you look at
particular long live genre,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.060
like the Western, or
the detective story,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.870
or the domestic melodrama,
over time what you of course

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.760
can recognize are changing
cultural and social attitudes.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.490
So, the Western
has become a screen

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.820
on which America's anxieties
about the Vietnam War

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.900
have been projected.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.160
Why would the Western
work so well for this?

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.810
One answer is what
I've been saying

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.570
all along about
the power of genre,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.740
and the power of repetition.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.780
Look if a thing is
repeated again, and again,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.065
and again, it looks familiar.

00:03:57.065 --> 00:03:58.565
When it's so familiar,
what happens?

00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:03.650
It licenses something
disturbing Because the genre,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.010
it seems on the surface, to
contain so many familiar,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.390
reassuring elements, those
very elements of reassurance

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.820
enable the exploration of
disturbing, or uncertain,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.240
or problematic materials.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.540
And of course, because--
not any one of these films

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.940
would have nothing
like the power

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.570
they actually have if
they existed individually.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.560
But it's because they're part
of this long conversation that

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.524
goes back to the
earliest days of movies,

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:34.190
that they have the
power that they have.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.580
One of the functions of genre
is one of the deep subjects

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.690
of my course.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.400
And I want students to see
how centrally variations

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.010
in genre forms can reflect
social and historical

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.690
realities.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.940
And you can feel
this in every film.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.110
You can feel this in
every television program.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.000
If you look at American
television from the 1950s

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.860
to the 1990s, let's say
you've restricted yourself

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.820
to situation comedy, what
do you think you would see?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.250
You would see a drama in which
the American family undergoes

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.770
profound change.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.760
What happens?

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.260
Women become more important.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.610
Patriarchal values become
less, and less powerful.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.550
Children become
more respected-- are

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.070
treated less like
appendages to the family.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.560
And in some-- by
the '80s and '90s,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.420
sometimes the children have more
dominant roles than the adults,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.090
and are often even shown to
be wiser than their parents.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.142
Right?

00:05:31.142 --> 00:05:32.850
Something that would
have been impossible

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.730
in the early 1950s, a
more patriarchal era,

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.940
when the classic television
program about families

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.425
was called, Father Knows Best.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.695
Another spine question,
or organizing key question

00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:53.650
in the course, is
deeply literary for me.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.650
In other words, what
I try to do here,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.650
is encourage the
students to develop what

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.010
I'll call an aesthetic sense.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.940
To begin to have
confidence when they say,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.510
that's a good film,
or that's a bad film.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.950
I think that's a good movie.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.130
I think that's a bad movie.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.546
I think that's a
good-- and what I

00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:11.290
try to tell them is that
that judgment, good or bad,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.480
isn't merely subjective.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.990
It isn't just what
you feel, right?

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.210
That there may be potentially
objective standards,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.170
by which we can judge
the excellence of texts.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.200
Part of it may
remain subjective,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.190
but we can still judge
excellence when we see acting.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.110
We can judge
excellence when we ask

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.290
how well the film is edited.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.380
We can judge the excellence of
various aspects of the film.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.690
And teaching students
how to do that,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.280
and to distinguish between
effective and ineffective uses

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.600
of the medium, turns out
to be not simply a skill

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.510
that you give to students
who are watching movies,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.150
it's a skill you can give to
students who read poems, who

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.930
read books, who go to plays.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.000
So one of the
central principles I

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.570
try to teach them about this,
how they can distinguish what

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.090
I call a work of art from
a mere entertainment,

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.550
is what I call the
multiplicity principle.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.550
And what I mean by the
multiplicity principle

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.780
is fairly clear.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.660
And I give many
examples in the course.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.580
Essentially, it's
the idea that what

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.750
happens in a particular moment
will have multiple functions.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.000
You won't just look
at the scene in order

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.320
to have the plot extended.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.760
The scene will also
dramatize character.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.670
It will also tell you
something about the atmosphere

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.140
in which the character lives.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.000
Do you remember the
moment in the passage

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.170
I showed you, from the De
Sica movie, Umberto D.?

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.050
That very brief moment, where we
see a man get on a tram, a bus,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.540
and sit next to someone on
the bus and the bus moves.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.482
It's a completely
wordless sequence.

00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:43.940
And there's a
character we've never

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.640
seen in the field
before, who sits

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.690
down next to the protagonist.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.230
No words exchanged.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.050
When our protagonist gets
up, and gets off the bus,

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.840
the camera lingers briefly
on the man he left behind.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.530
And we see that
men go like this.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.950
And what I suggested
to you, again,

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.860
I suggested that this
was a moment of richness

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.670
and complexity of
multiplicity, in a way,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.860
because one implication
of that scene

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.640
was that the man, this stranger
that we'll never meet again,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.360
that we only saw for
one brief instant

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.640
in the course of the film, might
have concealed a story as deep,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.420
as rich, and as moving, as
that of our hero, Humberto D.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.720
When a text contains-- when a
moment contains multiplicity,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.770
when it many things
simultaneously,

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.620
you're in the presence
of a kind of excellence.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.740
That's only one principle, but
it's a very valuable principle.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.640
And you can see it's
worth if you compare,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.360
let's say, a trivial
or relatively banal

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.330
form of action entertainment,
on the one hand,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.799
with a movie that has
complex characters in it.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:46.840
And you could see the
different kinds of demands.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.960
Or, even that a serious
action adventure film,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.590
a film that incorporates action
adventure elements in it,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.500
but also has a serious subject
matter, to ones that don't.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.410
Let's say, Kurosawa's
samurai movies,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.260
against the trivial,
merely entertaining samurai

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.150
movies that weren't interested
in history or character.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.380
What you try to do
is give the students

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.450
a greater and
greater sensitivity,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.840
not just to the particular text
that exhibits such excellence,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.800
but you want to arm them, so
that when they encounter things

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.485
on their own, they'll be
able to make this judgment.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.320
A second aspect of
this excellence,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.440
what I call artistic quality,
is the quality of organic form.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.690
I talk about this again,
and again in the course,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.140
and try to show them
instances of it.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.810
At its simplest level,
the term, of course,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.590
derives from Coleridge,
who borrowed it

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.850
from the German romantics.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.400
But essentially, it's
the idea that every text

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.900
should generate a form that
is unique to its needs.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.540
Form should be--
in other words, you

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.670
should not have a
prior form into which

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.060
content is poured, right?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.560
The form of the text,
the shape of the text,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.870
should take it nature from
the meaning of the text.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.262
From what the text is saying.

00:10:09.262 --> 00:10:11.470
And if you think about the
structure of modern times,

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.140
you'll see that it's a
marvelously distilled

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.250
instance-- a marvelously clear
instance of the principle

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.410
of organic form.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.750
What happens to Charlie
serially is more meaningful,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.260
in a way, than what happens
to him in a single episode.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.960
And the fact that this-- that
we have this sense that things

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.920
are repeating, that
Charlie is on a treadmill,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.010
that he lives a cyclical life,
that he'll always have moments

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.050
of hope and hopelessness, that
he'll have momentary times when

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.280
he's free of-- when he
finds a place to live,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.710
or finds sufficient food,
but that it will always

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.410
be temporary.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.300
That his life is
always on the road.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.150
That his life is
always in process.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.890
And, that at the
same time, he never

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.100
lets himself completely despair.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.190
There's always a moment where
his resilience reasserts

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.780
itself.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.150
Well, those elements are
embedded, in some sense,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.320
in the very structure, the
very organization, of the film.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.430
There should be a symbiotic
relationship, a marriage,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.450
a linkage, between
form and content.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.980
Between the way, the
shape of the text.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.770
Between the strategies
and techniques

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.370
that are used to embody the
story, and what the story says.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.350
There should be a marriage
between form and content.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.790
That's what organic form is.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.455
If you can show students
moments of organic form,

00:11:25.455 --> 00:11:27.490
and if they can
really recognize it,

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.320
they are proofed for
life against banal art.
