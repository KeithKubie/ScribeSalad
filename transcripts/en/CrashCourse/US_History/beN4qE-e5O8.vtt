00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.370
Hi I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
U.S. history and today, after last week’s

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.469
bummer on slavery, we turn to a happier topic:
the rise of democratization in the U.S.

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.230
This was also known as the Age of Jackson,
no Stan, not that Jackson. No, no, Stan, come’on

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.181
seriously. No not, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. YES. That Jackson. Andrew

00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:26.550
Jackson.
intro

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:36.840
...Sorry, I just had to check my collar.
Right, so you’ll recall that the initial

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.790
democracy of the United States wasn’t terribly
democratic—almost all voters were white

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.550
male land owners.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. That’s just radically

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.170
unfair.
Exactly, Me from the Past. But, between 1820

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.680
and 1850, this started to change. State legislatures
lowered, or else eliminated, the property

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.750
qualifications for voting, which allowed many
more people to vote, so long as they were,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.320
you know, both white and male.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. So, I’d be in, right?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.090
Yeah, that seems reasonable.
Yeah, Me from the Past, quick privilege check.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.440
One of the reasons we study history is so
that you can learn that people like you are

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.250
not actually at the center of history, even
though, you know, you’ve been taught that.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.530
But, anyway, the whole idea of owning land
as a prerequisite for voting is sort of Jeffersonian—

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.499
an individual who works his own land can be
truly independent, because he doesn’t need

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:23.549
to rely upon markets to acquire stuff or,
God forbid, wages to give him money with which

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.279
to buy stuff. No, he makes his own stuff and
he doesn’t need anybody...except for slaves

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:33.979
and also women to make shoes and clothes and
to cook food and also make children.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.100
But, in light of the Market Revolution, the
idea of excluding wage workers seemed very

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.119
outdated.
The idea of excluding women and non-white

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.319
people, though, still quite popular.
But, this defining characteristic of the Age

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.189
of Jackson really had very little to do with
Andrew Jackson himself because, by the time

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.249
he became President in 1829, every state except
for North Carolina, Virginia, and Rhode Island

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.329
had already gotten rid of their property requirements.
In fact, that’s probably why he got elected.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.469
Right so you’ll recall that America’s
mostly fake victory in the War of 1812 and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.219
the subsequent collapse of the Federalist
party ushered in the “Era of Good Feelings”

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.310
which was another way of saying that there
was basic agreement on most domestic policies.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.590
The American System was a program of economic
nationalism built on

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.370
(1) federally financed internal improvements,
like roads and canals, what we would now call

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.290
“infrastructure”
(2) tariffs, to protect new factories and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.220
industries, and (3) a national bank that would
replace the First Bank of the United States

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.660
whose charter expired in 1811.
You’ll never guess what we called this second

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.269
bank, unless you guessed that we called it
“The Second Bank of the United States.”

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.920
The main supporters of this American System
were our old friend John C. Calhoun and our

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.000
new friend Henry Clay.
Both were Jeffersonian Republicans, which

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.640
isn’t surprising because that was the only
political party, but it’s kind of surprising

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.230
because the American System had nothing to
do with the Agrarian Republic that Jefferson

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.829
had championed.
But whatever, this was the Era of Good Feelings,

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:55.230
so we’re gonna go with it. By the way, this
nationalism also extended to foreign affairs.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:04.420
And if they did, we would, like, do stuff.
This so called “Monroe Doctrine” also

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.159
said that the U.S. would stay out of European
wars. Hahahaha that is hilarious!

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.270
But, we did live up to the other end of it,
you’ll remember that when the British came

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.200
for the Falkland Islands, we were like, “This
shall not stand.” Just kidding. We were

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.879
like, “Go ahead.”
The last Good Feelings era president was John

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.219
Quincy Adams, who was quite the diplomat and
expansionist. He actually wrote the Monroe

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.939
Doctrine, for instance.
But in fact, it turns out that all feelings

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.260
were not good. There was significant disagreement
over three main issues.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.739
First, many people felt that the federal government
shouldn’t invest in infrastructure. Like,

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.629
James Madison, who’d initially supported
those bills, ended up vetoing one of them

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.640
that included a big spending increase to finance
roads and canals.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.939
Now, the roads and canals did get built, but,
in the end, most of the financing fell to

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.171
the states.
There were also big problems with the Second

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:49.470
Bank of the United States, which you know
is why you can’t visit a branch of it these

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.440
days. But we’ll get to that in a minute!
And, lastly, there was the perennial issue

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.819
of slavery. In this case the problem started,
as so many problems do, in Missouri.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.920
So, in 1819 Missouri had enough people in
it to become a state, but despite the fact

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.970
that there were already more than 10,000 slaves
there, a New York congressman, named James

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.249
Tallmadge, made a motion to prohibit the introduction
of further slaves into the proposed state.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.150
It took almost two years to work out the John
C. Calhounstorm that blew up after this. Actually,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.160
it took more than that. It took until the
end of the Civil War basically.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.080
But in the short run, Missouri was allowed
to enter the union as a slave state, while

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.470
Maine was carved out of Massachusetts to keep
the balance of things.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.100
But the Missouri Compromise also said that
no state admitted above the 36 30 line of

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.420
latitude would be allowed to have slaves,
except, of course, for Missouri itself, which

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.610
as you can see, is well above the line.
Anyway, this solution to westward expansion

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.620
worked out magnificently provided that you
enjoy Civil Wars.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.100
So, Thomas Jefferson, who was by the way was
still alive, which gives you some context

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.690
for how young the nation truly was, wrote
that the Missouri Compromise was “like a

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.980
fire bell in the night that awakened and filled
me with terror. I considered it at once the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.890
death knell of the union.”
Eventually, almost. But in the short term,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.340
it did mean the rise of political parties.
So, America was becoming more democratic,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.380
but if there was only one political party,
that democratic spirit had nowhere to go.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.320
Fortunately, there was a tiny little magician
named Martin Van Buren.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.130
They really did call him the “Little Magician,”
by the way. Also “The red fox of Kinderhook,”

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.010
but we remember him as the worst-haired president.
So, despite having been President of the United

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.950
States, Van Buren is arguably more important
for having invented the Democratic Party.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.860
He was first to realize that national political
parties could be a good thing.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.900
So, I mentioned that Martin Van Buren was
known as the “Little Magician, and I know

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.610
this sounds a little bit silly, but I think
it’s telling.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.000
You see, Van Buren was only the second American
president with a well-used nickname. And the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.490
first was his immediate predecessor, Andrew
Jackson, or Old Hickory.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.830
Why does this matter? Well when you’re actually
having to campaign for office, as all presidential

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.930
candidates did after the election of 1828,
and you’re trying to appeal to the newly

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.130
enfranchised “common man” what better
way to seem like a regular guy than to have

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.210
a nickname?
I mean, if you think this is crazy, just think

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.650
of the nicknames of some some of our most
popular presidents. “Honest Abe,” “The

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.300
Bull Moose,” “The Gipper.”
Even our lesser known presidents had nicknames.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.870
“Young Hickory,” “Handsome Frank;”
“Old Rough and Ready,” “Big Steve.”

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.370
James Buchanan, and I am not making this up,
was “Old Public Functionary.”

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.670
Who’re you gonna vote for? Oh, I think the
“Old Public Functionary.” He seems competent.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.120
As it happens, he wasn’t.
So, by now you’re probably wondering, where

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.520
does Andrew Jackson fit into all of this?
When we last caught up with Jackson, he was

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.950
winning the battle of New Orleans shortly
after the end of the War of 1812.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.850
He continued his bellicose ways, fighting
Indians in Florida, although he was not actually

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.720
authorized to do so, and became so popular
from all of his Indian killing that he decided

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.441
to run for president in 1824.
The election of 1824 was very close. And it

00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:38.300
went to the House, where John Quincy Adams
was eventually declared the winner. And Jackson

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.890
denounced this as “a corrupt bargain.”
So, in 1828, Jackson ran a much more negative

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.790
campaign—one of campaign slogans was “Vote
for Andrew Jackson who can fight, not John

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.810
Quincy Adams who can write.”
Adams’ supporters responded by arguing that

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.940
having a literate president wasn’t such
a bad thing and also by accusing Jackson of

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.530
being a murderer, which given his frequent
habit of dueling and massacring, he sort of

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.590
was.
So as you can see, the quality of discourse

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.010
in American political campaigns has come a
long way. Anyway, Jackson won.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.190
Jackson ran as the champion of the common
man and in a way he was. I mean, he had little

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.540
formal schooling and in some ways he was the
archetypal self made man.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.190
Jackson’s policies defined the new Democratic
party, which had formerly been known as the

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.345
Jeffersonian Democratic Republicans. It’s
very complicated, so here, I made you this

00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:23.310
chart.
So who were these new Democrats? Well generally,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.320
they tended to be lower to middle class men,
usually farmers, who were suspicious of the

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.770
widening gap between the rich and the poor
that was one of the results of the Market

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.400
Revolution.
And they were particularly worried about bankers,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.720
merchants and speculators, who seemed to be
getting rich without actually producing anything.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.460
Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.
This vision probably would have carried the

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.440
day except a new party arose in response to
Jackson’s election: the Whigs.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.450
No, Stan, the Whigs. Yes.
The American Whigs took their name from the

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.230
English Whigs, who were opposed to absolute
monarchy.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.880
And the American Whigs felt that Andrew Jackson
was grabbing so much power for the executive

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.290
branch that he was turning himself into “King
Andrew.”

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.220
So, the Whigs were big supporters of the American
System and its active federal government.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.090
You know, tariffs, infrastructure, etc.
Their greatest support was in the Northeast,

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.550
especially from businessmen and bankers who
benefitted from those tariffs and the stability

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.090
provided by a national bank.
And they also thought the government should

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.620
promote moral character because that was necessary
for a person to act as a truly independent

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.720
citizen.
So Jackson’s policies must have been pretty

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.390
egregious for them to spawn an entire new
political party. What did he actually do as

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.340
president? Well, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.919
Let’s start with Nullification. So, in 1828,
Congress passed the Tariff of 1828 because

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:39.000
they were not yet in the habit of marketing
their bills via naming them with funny acronyms.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.080
Jackson supported this in spite of the fact
that it benefitted manufacturers. The tariff

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.010
raised prices on imported manufactured goods
made of wool and iron, which enraged South

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.960
Carolina because they’d put all their money
into slavery and none into industry.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.830
Unlike northerners, who could avoid the higher
prices by manufacturing sweaters and pants

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.450
and such at home, South Carolinians would
have to pay more. They were so angry at this

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.010
“Tariff of Abominations” that the South
Carolina legislature threatened to nullify

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:10.080
it. Jackson didn’t take kindly to this affront
to federal power, but South Carolina persisted,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.890
and when Congress passed a new tariff in 1832
– one that actually lowered the duties -- the

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.710
Palmetto State’s government nullified it.
Jackson responded by getting Congress to pass

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:25.050
the Force Act, which authorized him to use
the army and navy to collect taxes. A full

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.880
blown crisis was averted when Congress passed
a new tariff in 1833 and South Carolina relented.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.460
This smelled a bit of dictatorship – armed
tax collectors and all – and helped to cement

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.500
Jackson’s reputation as a tyrant, at least
among the Whigs.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.840
And then we have the Native Americans, much
of Jackson’s reputation there was based

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.520
on killing them, so it’s no surprise that
he supported southern states’ efforts to

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.710
appropriate Indian lands and make the Indians
move. This support was formalized in the Indian

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:55.370
Removal Act of 1830, which Jackson supported.
The law provided funds to re-locate the Cherokees,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:01.220
Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creek and Seminole Indians
from their homes in Georgia, North Carolina,

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.630
Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama. In response,
these tribes adopted a novel approach, and

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.920
sued the government. And then, the Supreme
Court ruled that Georgia’s actions in removing

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.050
the Cherokees violated their treaties with
the federal government and that they had a

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.360
right to their land.
To which Jackson supposedly responded by saying,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.310
“John Marshall has made his decision. Now
let him enforce it.” So, Jackson set the

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.270
stage for the forced removal of the Cherokees
from Georgia to Oklahoma, but it actually

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:31.980
took place in the winter of 1838-1839 under
Jackson’s successor Van Buren. At least

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.230
¼ of the 18,000 Indians died during the forced
march that came to be known as the Trail of

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.131
Tears.
Boy, Thought Bubble, you do know how to end

00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:42.810
on a downer. But, thank you.
But Andrew Jackson also changed our banking

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.510
system. Just as today, banks were very important
to the industrial and mercantile development

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.340
of the U.S.
And at the beginning of Jackson’s Presidency,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.940
American banking was dominated by the Second
National Bank, which you’ll remember, had

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.560
been established by Congress as part of the
American system.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.370
Oh it’s time for the Mystery Document? The
rules here are simple.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.190
When I inevitably fail to guess the author
of the Mystery Document, I get shocked with

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.550
the shock pen.
“The powers, privileges, and favors bestowed

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:15.410
upon it in the original charter, by increasing
the value of the stock far above its par value

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:21.260
operated as a gratuity of many millions to
its stockholders … Every monopoly and all

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.150
exclusive privileges are granted at the expense
of the public which ought to receive a fair

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:31.600
equivalent. The many millions which this act
proposes to bestow on the stockholders of

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.050
the existing bank must come directly or indirectly
out of the earnings of the American people

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.050
…

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.050
Stan, I know this one!

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.380
Is it not conceivable. It is not conceivable
how the present stockholders can have any

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.840
claim to the special favor of Government.
Should [the bank’s] influence become concentrated,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.600
as it may under the operation of such an act
as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.310
… will there not be cause to tremble for
the purity of our elections[?]”

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.790
It is Andrew Jackson’s veto of the charter
of the Second Bank of the United States. YES.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.420
So in 1832 bank leader Nicholas Biddle persuaded
Congress to pass a bill extending the life

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.160
of the Second US Bank for 20 years.
Jackson thought that the Bank would use its

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.020
money to oppose his reelection in 1836, so
he vetoed that bill.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.970
In fact, the reason I knew that was from the
veto message is because it talks about the

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:20.550
bank as an instrument to subvert democracy.
Jackson set himself up as a defender of the

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:25.070
lower classes by vetoing the bank’s charter.
Now, Whigs took exception to the idea that

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:30.270
the president was somehow a more democratic
representative of the people than the legislature,

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.400
but in the end Jackson’s view won out. He
used the veto power more than any prior president,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.120
turning it into a powerful tool of policy.
Which it remains to this day, by the way.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.480
So the Second Bank of the U.S. expired in
1836, which meant that suddenly we had no

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.470
central institution with which to control
federal funds.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.250
Jackson ordered that money should be disbursed
into local banks, unsurprisingly preferencing

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.680
ones that were friendly to him.
These so-called “pet banks” were another

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.370
version of rewarding political supporters
that Jackson liked to call “rotation in

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.130
office.” Opponents called this tactic of
awarding government offices to political favorites

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.400
the spoils system.
Anyway, these smaller banks proceeded to print

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.170
more and more paper money because, you know,
free money.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:15.620
Like, between 1833 and 1837 the face value
of banknotes in circulation rose from $10

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:21.060
million to $149 million, and that meant inflation.
Initially, states loved all this new money

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:26.040
that they could use to finance internal improvements.
But, inflation is really bad for wage workers.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.370
And also, eventually, everyone.
So all this out-of-control inflation, coupled

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:34.560
with rampant land-speculation eventually lead
to an economic collapse, the Panic of 1837.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.620
The subsequent depression lasted until 1843.
And Jackson’s bank policy proved to be arguably

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.100
the most disastrous fiscal policy in American
history, which is really saying something.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.839
It also had a major effect on American politics
because business-oriented Democrats became

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:53.730
Whigs, and the remaining Democrats further
aligned with agrarian interests, which meant

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.620
slavery.
So the Age of Jackson was more democratic

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.230
than anything that came before and it gave
us the beginnings of modern American politics.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.471
I mean, Jackson was the first president to
really expand executive power and to argue

00:14:03.471 --> 00:14:07.490
that the president is the most important democratically
elected official in the country.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.290
One of the things that makes Andrew Jackson’s
presidency so interesting and also so problematic

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.240
is that he was elected via a more democratic
process, but he concentrated more power in

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.399
the executive in a thoroughly undemocratic
way.

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:23.440
In the end, Andrew Jackson probably was the
worst American president to end up on currency,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.180
particularly given his disastrous fiscal policies.
But the Age of Jackson is still important.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.680
And it’s worth remembering that all that
stuff in American politics started out with

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.110
the expansion of democracy. Thanks for watching.
I’ll see you next week.
