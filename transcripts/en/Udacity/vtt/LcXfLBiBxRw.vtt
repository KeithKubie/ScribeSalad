It's important to note that geolocation isn't just about your

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.270
position on a map, it's also incredibly useful for location

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.860
aware presentation. For example, for a website for a chain

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.320
of stores, right in the front page you can show what

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.550
the closest store is to the user's current location. And

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.690
what their current hours are. This is almost certainly exactly

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.950
what the user was looking for when they navigated to

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.890
your app. You don't have to bury it under a store

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.870
locator link. You can certainly do lots of other things with geolocation,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.890
too. You could use geolocation to implement a geocaching game, for example,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.470
or to do augmented reality. But Geolocation has many uses that just

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.730
make the user experience better by

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970
better integrating with the real world environment.
