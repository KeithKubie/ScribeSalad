00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:25.480
On 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.449
July 20th, 1969, with “one small step,”
Neil Armstrong became the first person to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.730
walk on the moon.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.440
Since that date forty five years ago, the
moon landing has been the subject of intense

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.730
study and historical analysis.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.300
From what Armstrong actually said with his
first step to if the American flags the astronauts

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.030
planted are still there, mankind’s first
rendezvous with the moon has captured the

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.379
world’s attention in a way few other things
have.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.239
Despite this, there are still several noteworthy
facts that have remained obscure after all

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.239
these years.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.210
Allow us to bring just a few to (moon) light:

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.341
Neil Armstrong was chosen to be the first
person on the moon due to the basic structural

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:01.341
design of a part of the Eagle.

00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.280
Out of a group of 29 astronauts that trained
for the Apollo mission to the moon, only three

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.479
were chosen when the final announcement was
made in January of 1969.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.380
Neil Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, and
the oft forgotten Michael Collins became the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260
official crew of Apollo 11.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.240
Immediately, attention turned to which crew
member – Armstrong or Aldrin — would be

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.880
the first to walk on the moon (Collins was
the command module pilot and, therefore, was

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.880
ineligible).

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.619
Even though both men were going to walk on
the moon, it was a great honor to be the first.

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.670
In fact, the question was asked at the press
conference and the response was that it had

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.670
yet to be decided.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.789
Over the next four months, as the astronauts
continued their training, debate and rumors

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.201
circulated among the media.

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:42.090
At first, it seemed that Aldrin would have
the honor.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.700
This speculation came from the precedent set
by the Gemini program, which made ten crewed

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.009
flights for the purpose of testing ships and
astronauts to spacewalk.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.470
During the flights, the commander (which Armstrong
was to be for Apollo 11) stayed inside the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.899
ship while the pilot (which Aldrin was to
be for Apollo 11) did the space walking.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.749
Further fueling this thinking was that it
was rumored that Aldrin was actively campaigning

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.039
to be the guy.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.090
According to the memoir written by Chris Kraft,
head of Mission Control, “Buzz Aldrin desperately

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.900
wanted that honor and wasn’t quiet in letting
it be known.”

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.290
In April, only three months before liftoff,
it was announced that Neil Armstrong would

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.100
be the first man to walk on the moon.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.350
The main reason NASA gave for the decision
was that the Eagle’s hatch opened to one

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.710
side – rather than up or down – and that
side was towards the pilot, Aldrin.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.960
The bottom line was that when the hatch was
opened, the commander, Armstrong, had a clear

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.380
path to exit, while the pilot was pinned in
the rather cramped space of the module.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.780
By a sheer happenstance, it made more sense
for Armstrong to exit first.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.680
Plus, as NASA’s heads pointed out, Armstrong
was actually the more senior member of the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.450
team anyway, having entered the program in
1962, while Aldrin came in 1963.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.980
In later years, despite the official hatch
story, some, including Kraft and fellow astronaut

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.270
Al Bean of have come out and said that NASA
wanted Armstrong to have this honor rather

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.450
than Aldrin because they thought Neil’s
ego could handle it better than Aldrin’s.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.630
So perhaps the hatch design simply gave them
the excuse they needed.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.620
Armstrong’s famed “one small step” line
was pre-planned, at least according to his

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.620
brother.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.380
Even until his last breath in 2012, Armstrong
adamantly insisted that his first line was

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.450
spontaneous and was only settled on in the
moments prior to the walk.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.570
A BBC documentary released after the astronaut’s
death disputes that.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.910
In the film, Dean Armstrong – Neil’s brother
– tells the story of a note passed during

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.910
a late-night game of Risk (yes, the board
game).

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.900
In the months leading up to the mission, Dean,
Neil, and their families spent time together

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.390
on Cape Cod.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.030
After both men put their boys to bed, Neil
challenged his younger brother to a hearty

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.340
game of Risk.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.530
During that game, Neil handed Dean a piece
of paper:

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.870
“On that piece of paper there was ‘That’s
one small step for [a] man, one giant leap

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.880
for mankind.’

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.810
‘He says, ‘What do you think about that?’

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.810
I said ‘fabulous.’

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.580
He said, ‘I thought you might like that,
but I wanted you to read it.”

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.640
That said, both Aldrin and Collins made it
clear that at no point did Armstrong share

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.730
his thoughts about what he would say.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.820
Of course, perhaps his brother was an exception.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.110
The second thing said on the moon was a tad
less poetic than the first.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.030
While everyone remembers that first line,
few can recall the second.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.170
That’s because it didn’t hold the same
“oomph” factor.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.440
According to the official Apollo 11 Air to
Ground Voice Transcription, that line was

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.380
“And the – the surface is fine and powdery.”

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.250
Armstrong continued on this line of thinking,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.110
“I can – I can pick it up loosely with
my toe.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.470
It does adhere in fine layers like powdered
charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.460
I only go in a small fraction of an inch,
maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.100
the footprints of my boots and the treads
in the fine, sandy particles.”

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:45.749
After further discussion about the ease of
movement on 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:05:29.479
the moon, they began to go back and forth
about Buzz’s placement of the camera and

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.219
backlighting.

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:36.419
Exciting conversation, indeed!

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:59.719
President Nixon had an “In Event of Moon
Disaster” speech ready

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.629
After the Apollo 1’s tragic fire in 1967
and the unproven nature of space travel at

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.999
the time, the safe return of Apollo 11’s
crew was far from an assured thing.

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:13.729
To that point, President Nixon had to prepare
for every scenario when he addressed the nation,

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.100
including the tragedy of a “moon disaster.”

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.300
So, he had his speechwriter, William Safire,
prepare remarks that are both chilling and

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.300
inspiring.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.160
The speech begins with these two lines,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.460
“Fate has ordained that the men who went
to the moon to explore in peace will stay

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.650
on the moon to rest in peace.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.659
These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin
Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:35.659
recovery.

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.539
But they also know that there is hope for
mankind in their sacrifice.”

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.009
Additionally, below the “death” speech
were instructions to what needed to be done

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.699
both before and after the address to the nation.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.620
Before, the President should “telephone
each of the widows-to-be.”

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.660
Afterwards, NASA will end “communications
with the men” and “a clergyman should

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.599
adopt the same procedure as burial at sea,
commending their souls to the ‘deepest of

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.750
the deep,’ concluding with the Lord’s
Prayer.”
