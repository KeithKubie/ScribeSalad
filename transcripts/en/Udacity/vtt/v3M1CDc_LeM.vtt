00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now looking at this same data, I'd like

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to ask you a different question.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Suppose we draw a line at a 45-degree angle,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This represents the relationship y = x

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and divides the plot into 2 regions

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or 3 if we count the line itself.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We have a region here

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
above the line and a region here below the line.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What I'd like you tell me is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
what the position of a point relative to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
these 3 sections tells us about

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the given students' GPAs.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So in which of these regions would a student

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with the same GPA in high school and college fall?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Would it be above the line,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
on the line or below the line?

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Select the region in which you think it is.
