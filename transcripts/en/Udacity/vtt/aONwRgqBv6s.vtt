00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.770
When we multiply something
by a positive power of 10,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.470
the product is a bigger number and
we move the decimal to the right.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.480
When we multiply something
by a negative power of 10,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.580
we get a smaller number and
we move the decimal to the left.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.458
This is worth writing down.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:28.363
Now convert 3.2 x 10 to the -5th
into standard notation.

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:33.079
