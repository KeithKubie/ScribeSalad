00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:02.438
- [Voiceover] So I have written
here the formal definition

00:00:02.438 --> 00:00:04.187
for the partial derivative of

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:08.014
a two-variable function
with respect to X, and what

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:10.327
I wanna do is build up
to the formal definition

00:00:10.327 --> 00:00:13.086
of the directional derivative
of that same function

00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:16.121
in the direction of some
vector V, and you know,

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.555
V with the little thing on top,

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:20.246
this will be some vector in
the input space, and I have

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:22.086
another video on the formal definition

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:23.610
of the partial derivative if you want to

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.940
check that out, and just to
really quickly go through here,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.227
I've drawn this diagram before,

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.933
but it's worth drawing again, if you

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:33.200
think of your input space,
which is the X Y plane,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.917
and you think of it
somehow mapping over to

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:36.461
the real number line, which is where

00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:38.899
your output F lives,
and when you're taking

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.764
the partial derivative at
a point A B, you're looking

00:00:41.764 --> 00:00:43.612
over here and you say,
maybe that's your point,

00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:47.171
some point A B, and you imagine nudging it

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:49.128
slightly in the X direction, and saying,

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:51.285
hey, how does that influence the function?

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.407
So, maybe this is where
A B lands, and maybe

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:55.572
the result is a nudge that's
a little bit negative.

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:57.782
That would be a negative
partial derivative, and you

00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:01.379
think of the size of that nudge
as partial X, and the size

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.730
of the resulting nudge in the
output space as partial F.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.434
So, the way that you read
this formal definition

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.616
is you think of this
variable H, you know, people,

00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:12.420
you could say delta X, but H seems to be

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020
the common variable people
use, you think of it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.093
as that change in your input space,

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:21.314
that slight nudge, and you
look at how that influences

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.183
the function when you only
change the X component here,

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:25.789
you know, you're only
changing the X component

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.288
with that nudge, and you
say what's the change in F?

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.022
What's that partial F?

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:32.412
So, I'm gonna write this in
a slightly different way,

00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:34.323
using vector notation.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:37.241
Instead I'm gonna say,
you know, partial F,

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:41.566
partial X, and instead of
saying the input is A B,

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:44.816
I'm gonna say it's a, you know,

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:46.996
just A, and then make it clear that that's

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:49.315
a vector, and this will be
a two-dimensional vector,

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:51.169
so I'll put that little arrow on top

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:53.948
to indicate that it's a
vector, and if we rewrite

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:56.211
this definition, we'd be thinking

00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:58.628
the limit, as H goes to zero,

00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:02.096
of

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:05.711
something divided by H, but that thing,

00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:06.855
now that we're writing in terms of

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.688
vector notation, is gonna be F of,

00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:14.051
so it's gonna be our
original starting point A,

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.636
but plus what?

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.322
I mean, up here, it was
clear we could just add it

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:19.354
to the first component, but
if I'm not writing in terms

00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:21.403
of components, and I
have to think in terms of

00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:24.566
vector addition, really what I'm adding

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:28.534
is that H times the
vector, the unit vector

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:30.411
in the X direction, and it's common

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.605
to use, you know, this little I with a hat

00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:37.371
to represent the unit
vector in the X direction.

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:39.441
So when I'm adding these,
it's really the same.

00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:40.884
You know, this H is only gonna go to

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:43.810
that first component, and the
second component is multiplied

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.560
by zero, and what we subtract off

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:49.101
is the value of the function at

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.496
that original input, that original

00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:53.692
two-dimensional input
that I'm just thinking of

00:02:53.692 --> 00:02:56.746
as a vector here, and
when I write it like this,

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:59.428
it's actually much clearer
how we might extend

00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:02.357
this idea to moving in
different directions.

00:03:02.357 --> 00:03:04.653
'Cause now, all of the information

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:06.305
about what direction you're moving

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.505
is captured with this vector here,

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:13.410
what you multiply your nudge
by as you're adding the input.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.646
So let's just rewrite that over here

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:17.615
in the context of directional derivative.

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:20.051
What you would say is that
the directional derivative

00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:23.407
in the direction of
some vector, any vector,

00:03:23.407 --> 00:03:26.784
of F, evaluated at a point,
and we'll think about

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:30.064
that input point as
being a vector itself, A.

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.326
Here, I'll get rid of this guy.

00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:35.553
It's also gonna be a limit, and as always,

00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:37.579
with these things, we think of some,

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.420
not, I mean, always, but with derivatives,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.964
you think of some variable
as going to zero, and then

00:03:43.964 --> 00:03:45.890
that's gonna be on the
denominator, and the change

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.950
in the function that we're looking for

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.639
is gonna be F, evaluated at
that initial input vector

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.806
plus H, that scaling value,
that little nudge of a value,

00:03:57.942 --> 00:04:01.476
multiplied by the vector whose direction

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:03.691
we care about, and then you subtract off

00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:06.858
the value of F at that original input.

00:04:08.717 --> 00:04:12.130
So, this right here is
the formal definition

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.697
for the directional
derivative, and you see how

00:04:14.697 --> 00:04:16.695
it's much easier to
write in vector notation,

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:18.381
because you're thinking of your input

00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:22.008
as a vector and your output as
just some nudge by something.

00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:23.226
So, let's take a look at what that

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:24.567
would feel like over here.

00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:27.066
You know, instead of
thinking of D X and a nudge

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:31.236
purely in the X direction,
and I'll erase these guys,

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:34.335
you would think of this point as being A,

00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:36.835
as being a vector valued A, so

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:40.995
just to make clear how it's a vector,

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:42.677
you'd be thinking of it starting at

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:43.835
the origin, and the tip represents

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:47.052
that point, and then H times V, you know,

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:49.552
maybe V is some vector, often,

00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:52.673
you know, a direction that's neither

00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:55.386
purely X nor purely Y, but when you

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:59.874
scale it down, it'll just
be a tiny little nudge

00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:03.417
that's gonna be H, that tiny little value,

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:06.804
scaling your vector V, so that
tiny little nudge, and what

00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:09.648
you wonder is, hey,
what's the resulting nudge

00:05:09.648 --> 00:05:10.786
to the output?

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:12.696
And the ratio between the size of that

00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:15.917
resulting nudge to the output
and the original guy there

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:18.151
is your directional derivative,
and more importantly,

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.207
as you take the limit
for that original nudge

00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:22.163
getting really really
small, that's gonna be

00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:24.679
your directional derivative,
and you can probably anticipate

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.812
there's a way to interpret
this as the slope of a graph.

00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:29.437
That's what I'm gonna
talk about next video,

00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:31.627
but you actually have to
be a little bit careful,

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:34.294
because we call this the
directional derivative,

00:05:34.294 --> 00:05:37.889
but notice, if you scale
the value V by two,

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.123
you know, if you go over here
and you start plugging in

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:42.909
two times V and seeing how
that influences things,

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.070
it'll be twice the change, because here,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.979
even if you're scaling
by the same value H,

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.692
it's gonna double the initial
nudge that you had, and it's

00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:56.623
gonna double the resulting nudge out here,

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:59.101
even though the denominator
H doesn't stay changed.

00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:01.458
So when you're taking the
ratio, what you're considering

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.063
is the size of your initial nudge

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:04.923
actually might be influenced.

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:06.589
So, some authors, they'll actually change

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.702
this definition, and
they'll throw a little

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:12.214
absolute value of the original
vector, just to make sure

00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:14.660
that when you scale it by
something else, it doesn't

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.984
influence things, and you
only care about the direction.

00:06:16.984 --> 00:06:18.312
But, I actually don't like that.

00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:21.240
I think there's some
usefulness in the definition

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.798
as it is right here,
and that there's kind of

00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:25.128
a good interpretation to be had,

00:06:25.128 --> 00:06:27.982
for when, if you double
the size of your vector Y,

00:06:27.982 --> 00:06:31.762
that should double the
size of your derivative,

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:33.367
but I'll get to that in following videos.

00:06:33.367 --> 00:06:35.419
This right here is the formal definition

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.940
to be thinking about, and
I'll see you next video.
