specifically but whatever we have gives
more degrees so you can see there's

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.130
 
 

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:53.450
 
again this is a discovery the first the

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460
again this is a discovery the first the
 

00:31:53.460 --> 00:32:10.360
again this is a discovery the first the
first this is not the results today so

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:10.370
first this is not the results today so
 

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:17.990
first this is not the results today so
there could be anything I cannot but so

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000
there could be anything I cannot but so
 

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.840
there could be anything I cannot but so
again - you mystical it's a possibility

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:20.850
again - you mystical it's a possibility
 

00:32:20.850 --> 00:33:25.519
again - you mystical it's a possibility
because this is not

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:25.529
 
 

00:33:25.529 --> 00:33:31.409
 
so we need which even attached me

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:31.419
so we need which even attached me
 

00:33:31.419 --> 00:33:33.260
so we need which even attached me
neither me neither

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:33.270
neither me neither
 

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.750
neither me neither
so this is what written is very smart is

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760
so this is what written is very smart is
 

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.980
so this is what written is very smart is
the collaboration either the only

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:40.990
the collaboration either the only
 

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.130
the collaboration either the only
integer which have been made but we were

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:44.140
integer which have been made but we were
 

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.260
integer which have been made but we were
so happy that they did that because we

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:46.270
so happy that they did that because we
 

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.049
so happy that they did that because we
really documented the defective status

00:33:49.049 --> 00:33:49.059
really documented the defective status
 

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:51.390
really documented the defective status
for the coming weeks

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:51.400
for the coming weeks
 

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.720
for the coming weeks
and I think so so let me about what was

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:54.730
and I think so so let me about what was
 

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.460
and I think so so let me about what was
really important here is that we have

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:56.470
really important here is that we have
 

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.920
really important here is that we have
algorithms that find these kind of

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:58.930
algorithms that find these kind of
 

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.920
algorithms that find these kind of
events within minutes of their

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:01.930
events within minutes of their
 

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.570
events within minutes of their
occurrence so it's an extremely quick

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:03.580
occurrence so it's an extremely quick
 

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.549
occurrence so it's an extremely quick
thing and one things that we do this is

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559
thing and one things that we do this is
 

00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:07.620
thing and one things that we do this is
to be able to look at the same events

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:07.630
to be able to look at the same events
 

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.690
to be able to look at the same events

the Penguins other things but the reason

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679
the Penguins other things but the reason
 

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.440
the Penguins other things but the reason
is really what Joe is saying is that we

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:13.450
is really what Joe is saying is that we
 

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.720
is really what Joe is saying is that we
can stop whatever we're doing and we can

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:15.730
can stop whatever we're doing and we can
 

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.580
can stop whatever we're doing and we can
make sure that's the defector conditions

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:17.590
make sure that's the defector conditions
 

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.350
make sure that's the defector conditions
are fixed so if you collect that

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:19.360
are fixed so if you collect that
 

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.970
are fixed so if you collect that
background so we can reclaim things like

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:20.980
background so we can reclaim things like
 

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.919

this we were lucky there were many

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:22.929
this we were lucky there were many
 

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.450
this we were lucky there were many
engineering practices I think there's no

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:24.460
engineering practices I think there's no
 

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.510

one we may have not been final to the

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:29.530
one we may have not been final to the
 

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.930

problems was sort of a nominal thing of
 

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:59.330
problems was sort of a nominal thing of
that but everything meaningful was fine

have see something so what are the
 

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.700
have see something so what are the
limitations for example if you look at

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:18.710
limitations for example if you look at
 

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.620
limitations for example if you look at
the low frequency part where these are

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:20.630
the low frequency part where these are
 

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.840

stops me again we have to improve a lot

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:29.260
stops me again we have to improve a lot

wouldn't it would be a much bigger
difference but can't do the factor three

models yes and I guess so there's the

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:09.290
models yes and I guess so there's the
 

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.400

there's the sort of stellar astrophysics

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:11.410
there's the sort of stellar astrophysics
 

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.810
there's the sort of stellar astrophysics
question there which I haven't actually

question there which I haven't actually
 

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.020
question there which I haven't actually
posed and then the other thing which is

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.030
posed and then the other thing which is
 

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.760
posed and then the other thing which is
somehow related to that in my mind is

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:18.770
somehow related to that in my mind is
 

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:22.630
somehow related to that in my mind is
that because the GR is scale free there

must be able to change the Doppler shift

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:32.270
must be able to change the Doppler shift
 

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:34.450
must be able to change the Doppler shift
to change the total mass so that is the

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:34.460
to change the total mass so that is the
 

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.250
to change the total mass so that is the

was that this is a very heavy black ball

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520
was that this is a very heavy black ball
 

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.280
was that this is a very heavy black ball

typically we don't expect such a black

now there's an observational bias right

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:07.250
now there's an observational bias right
 

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.920
now there's an observational bias right
it's harder to detect these big things

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:08.930
it's harder to detect these big things
 

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.620
it's harder to detect these big things
but basically the sort of trends in the

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:11.630
but basically the sort of trends in the
 

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:12.880
but basically the sort of trends in the
field

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:12.890
field
 

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.640
field
that's how people think it starts or how

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:15.650
that's how people think it starts or how
 

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:16.930
that's how people think it starts or how
people understand how big back was our

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:16.940
people understand how big back was our
 

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.030
people understand how big back was our
fourth is really there's a lot of micro

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040
fourth is really there's a lot of micro
 

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.350
fourth is really there's a lot of micro
physics our goal but we don't understand

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:20.360
physics our goal but we don't understand
 

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.850
physics our goal but we don't understand
this point and if you look at the trend

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:21.860
this point and if you look at the trend
 

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.010
this point and if you look at the trend
basically how big the black holes can

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.020
basically how big the black holes can
 

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.470
basically how big the black holes can
get depends on how much mass the Stars

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480
get depends on how much mass the Stars
 

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.150
get depends on how much mass the Stars
lose before they collapse into a black

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160
lose before they collapse into a black
 

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.460
lose before they collapse into a black
hole and this is where our understanding

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:30.470
hole and this is where our understanding
 

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.410
hole and this is where our understanding
will it changed even in the past few

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:32.420
will it changed even in the past few
 

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.150
will it changed even in the past few
years there's a lot of uncertainty

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160
years there's a lot of uncertainty
 

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.520
years there's a lot of uncertainty
because we cannot derive these numbers

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:36.530
because we cannot derive these numbers
 

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.100
because we cannot derive these numbers
from first principles but if you look at

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:39.110
from first principles but if you look at
 

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:40.690
from first principles but if you look at
before the Dutchman now what's gonna

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:40.700
before the Dutchman now what's gonna
 

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.010
before the Dutchman now what's gonna
happen is a whole different question but

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:42.020
happen is a whole different question but
 

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.600
happen is a whole different question but
before the deduction what people were

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:43.610
before the deduction what people were
 

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.090
before the deduction what people were
trying towards this to introduce models

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:46.100
trying towards this to introduce models
 

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.580
trying towards this to introduce models
where the starts to lose less mass of

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:48.590
where the starts to lose less mass of
 

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:50.680
where the starts to lose less mass of
stellar winds are less importance and so

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:50.690
stellar winds are less importance and so
 

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.410
stellar winds are less importance and so
the black holes can grow bigger so if

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:53.420
the black holes can grow bigger so if
 

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.180
the black holes can grow bigger so if
you take everything but year ago it's

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:55.190
you take everything but year ago it's
 

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.070
you take everything but year ago it's
not that surprising anymore that this

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:57.080
not that surprising anymore that this
 

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.500
not that surprising anymore that this
can happen but again we are in the dark

00:46:59.500 --> 00:46:59.510
can happen but again we are in the dark
 

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:02.200
can happen but again we are in the dark
to some extent for example if you want

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:02.210
to some extent for example if you want
 

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:04.630
to some extent for example if you want
to have bigger stars you have to go back

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640
to have bigger stars you have to go back
 

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.220
to have bigger stars you have to go back
in time so you have less metallicity

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:06.230
in time so you have less metallicity
 

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.620
in time so you have less metallicity
which is more typical not at our

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:08.630
which is more typical not at our
 

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:10.600
which is more typical not at our
environment but farther away but we

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:10.610
environment but farther away but we
 

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.400
environment but farther away but we
don't we don't really see stars that far

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:12.410
don't we don't really see stars that far
 

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.870
don't we don't really see stars that far
unfortunately so we have to extrapolate

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880
unfortunately so we have to extrapolate
 

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.670
unfortunately so we have to extrapolate
based on what we see there's lots of

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680
based on what we see there's lots of
 

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.500
based on what we see there's lots of
uncertainties involved but again the

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:17.510
uncertainties involved but again the
 

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:19.570
uncertainties involved but again the
trend was even before their stats this

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:19.580
trend was even before their stats this
 

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.460
trend was even before their stats this
is going to be possible and now I think

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:21.470
is going to be possible and now I think
 

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:23.530
is going to be possible and now I think
it's gonna accelerate even further the

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:23.540
it's gonna accelerate even further the
 

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.980
it's gonna accelerate even further the
second part of the question can I say

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:25.990
second part of the question can I say
 

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.290
second part of the question can I say
there are additional papers if you go to

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:29.300
there are additional papers if you go to
 

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:35.980
there are additional papers if you go to
line go to work yes so actually both of

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:35.990
line go to work yes so actually both of
 

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:37.330
line go to work yes so actually both of
your questions got a separate paper on

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:37.340
your questions got a separate paper on
 

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.510
your questions got a separate paper on
it so excellent questions yeah and

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520
it so excellent questions yeah and
 

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.680
it so excellent questions yeah and
there's many I think there's roughly 10

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:41.690
there's many I think there's roughly 10
 

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.350
there's many I think there's roughly 10
different papers again you got two of

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:44.360
different papers again you got two of
 

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.270
different papers again you got two of
they're a good question the second

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280
they're a good question the second
 

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.610
they're a good question the second
question is again very good so we have

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:48.620
question is again very good so we have
 

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.900
question is again very good so we have
an ascertain see if it's something is

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:49.910
an ascertain see if it's something is
 

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:53.290
an ascertain see if it's something is
farther right you on its right shifted

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:53.300
farther right you on its right shifted
 

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.970
farther right you on its right shifted
you will see just a lower a slower

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:54.980
you will see just a lower a slower
 

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.430
you will see just a lower a slower
motion why is that how can we

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440
motion why is that how can we
 

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.840
motion why is that how can we
differentiate between something that's

00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:58.850
differentiate between something that's
 

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:02.560
differentiate between something that's
on that just lower as opposed to just a

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:02.570
on that just lower as opposed to just a
 

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.390
on that just lower as opposed to just a
something that that's actually bigger

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400
something that that's actually bigger
 

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.970
something that that's actually bigger
right or actually closer and there's a

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:06.980
right or actually closer and there's a
 

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.220
right or actually closer and there's a
so in principle that's a good question

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:09.230
so in principle that's a good question
 

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:10.810
so in principle that's a good question
there are different things we can put

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:10.820
there are different things we can put
 

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.450
there are different things we can put
together to understand on which that's

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:13.460
together to understand on which that's
 

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.070
together to understand on which that's
basically to break the degeneracy in

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:15.080
basically to break the degeneracy in
 

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.620
basically to break the degeneracy in
this case if you look at the specs

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:17.630
this case if you look at the specs
 

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.330
this case if you look at the specs
revolution right that's where you can

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:19.340
revolution right that's where you can
 

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:19.610
revolution right that's where you can
have

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:19.620
have
 

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.620
have
such a redshift but for example if you

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:21.630
such a redshift but for example if you
 

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:23.540
such a redshift but for example if you
use basically three pieces of

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:23.550
use basically three pieces of
 

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:25.640
use basically three pieces of
information you use there's a special

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:25.650
information you use there's a special
 

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.020
information you use there's a special
evolution at the early phase when there

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:27.030
evolution at the early phase when there
 

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.250
evolution at the early phase when there
is a really distance or until you look

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260
is a really distance or until you look
 

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.620
is a really distance or until you look
at the later part of the evolution where

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:30.630
at the later part of the evolution where
 

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.940
at the later part of the evolution where
you really form a black hole and you

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:31.950
you really form a black hole and you
 

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.070
you really form a black hole and you
look at the the brightness basically how

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:34.080
look at the the brightness basically how
 

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.930
look at the the brightness basically how
strongest source was this is enough

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940
strongest source was this is enough
 

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.220
strongest source was this is enough
information to to basically derive the

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:40.230
information to to basically derive the
 

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.410
information to to basically derive the
actual distance now the one uncertainty

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420
actual distance now the one uncertainty
 

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.060
actual distance now the one uncertainty
and server before just what a certain

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:44.070
and server before just what a certain
 

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.760
and server before just what a certain
time having the results the distance

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:46.770
time having the results the distance
 

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.500
time having the results the distance
this if you look at the actual distance

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:48.510
this if you look at the actual distance
 

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.880
this if you look at the actual distance
there's a large uncertainty there yeah

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:52.890
there's a large uncertainty there yeah
 

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.490
there's a large uncertainty there yeah
anyway so there's a 410 there's a large

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500
anyway so there's a 410 there's a large
 

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.750
anyway so there's a 410 there's a large
uncertainty there and that uncertainty

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760
uncertainty there and that uncertainty
 

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.550
uncertainty there and that uncertainty
is not because of this so this is not

00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560
is not because of this so this is not
 

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.710
is not because of this so this is not
really the source of the uncertainty

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720
really the source of the uncertainty
 

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.960
really the source of the uncertainty
uncertainty is really that's we cannot

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:02.970
uncertainty is really that's we cannot
 

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.630
uncertainty is really that's we cannot
tell what direction of the orbit

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640
tell what direction of the orbit
 

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.820
tell what direction of the orbit
happiness so is the inclination of the

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:07.830
happiness so is the inclination of the
 

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.910
happiness so is the inclination of the
orbit is the main source of this

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920
orbit is the main source of this
 

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.320
orbit is the main source of this
uncertainty that you see there we cannot

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.330
uncertainty that you see there we cannot
 

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.570
uncertainty that you see there we cannot
resolve that uncertainty but that's not

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:14.580
resolve that uncertainty but that's not
 

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.540
resolve that uncertainty but that's not
that's not a distance okay good so let

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:17.550
that's not a distance okay good so let
 

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.190
that's not a distance okay good so let
me just slightly rephrase the question

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200
me just slightly rephrase the question
 

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.070
me just slightly rephrase the question
does that mean that this system alone

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:22.080
does that mean that this system alone
 

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.220
does that mean that this system alone
provides a point in the distance

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:25.230
provides a point in the distance
 

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:31.730
provides a point in the distance
redshift relation or there are there are

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740
redshift relation or there are there are
 

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.950
redshift relation or there are there are
papers in there so that in principle the

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960
papers in there so that in principle the
 

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.350
papers in there so that in principle the
answer is yes the problem is that the

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:36.360
answer is yes the problem is that the
 

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.460
answer is yes the problem is that the
uncertainties are still large enough

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:37.470
uncertainties are still large enough
 

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:40.520
uncertainties are still large enough
such that you cannot provoke from one

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:40.530
such that you cannot provoke from one
 

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:41.660
such that you cannot provoke from one
measurement you cannot really have

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:41.670
measurement you cannot really have
 

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.000
measurement you cannot really have
anything meaningful in this term but in

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:44.010
anything meaningful in this term but in
 

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.650
anything meaningful in this term but in
principle if you had and that's an

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660
principle if you had and that's an
 

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.820
principle if you had and that's an
excellent question if you had many of

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:46.830
excellent question if you had many of
 

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.590
excellent question if you had many of
these observations then you could really

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:48.600
these observations then you could really
 

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.940
these observations then you could really
do what you're suggesting it could

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:49.950
do what you're suggesting it could
 

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.610
do what you're suggesting it could
really use this as sort of an extra

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:52.620
really use this as sort of an extra
 

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.560
really use this as sort of an extra
measurement for the evolution of the

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:54.570
measurement for the evolution of the
 

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.790
measurement for the evolution of the
universe so that's something that people

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800
universe so that's something that people
 

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.170
universe so that's something that people
are proposing there are many articles is

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.180
are proposing there are many articles is
 

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.850
are proposing there are many articles is
not in this 10 articles but there are

00:49:58.850 --> 00:49:58.860
not in this 10 articles but there are
 

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.800
not in this 10 articles but there are
many articles on that again you need

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:00.810
many articles on that again you need
 

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.560
many articles on that again you need
multiple measurements of this but you

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:03.570
multiple measurements of this but you
 

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.420
multiple measurements of this but you
know it's a very interesting direction

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:05.430
know it's a very interesting direction
 

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.450
know it's a very interesting direction
good question thank you I'm sure this is

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460
good question thank you I'm sure this is
 

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.160
good question thank you I'm sure this is
discussed in the papers too but I just

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:10.170
discussed in the papers too but I just
 

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:11.420
discussed in the papers too but I just
wanted to ask about constraints you have

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:11.430
wanted to ask about constraints you have
 

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.880
wanted to ask about constraints you have
an electromagnetic counterpart so how

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:13.890
an electromagnetic counterpart so how
 

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.520
an electromagnetic counterpart so how
rapidly were you able to constrain the

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:16.530
rapidly were you able to constrain the
 

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.560
rapidly were you able to constrain the
localized part of the sky that is might

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:18.570
localized part of the sky that is might
 

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.970
localized part of the sky that is might
have happened on and how rapidly do you

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980
have happened on and how rapidly do you
 

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.990
have happened on and how rapidly do you
actually trigger follow-up object

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000
actually trigger follow-up object
 

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.990
actually trigger follow-up object
that's something we have a slide on that

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000
that's something we have a slide on that
 

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.130
that's something we have a slide on that
yeah sure sure peaceful on the slide

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140
yeah sure sure peaceful on the slide
 

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.049
yeah sure sure peaceful on the slide
yeah that's a clean so basically yeah

00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:33.059
yeah that's a clean so basically yeah
 

00:50:33.059 --> 00:50:34.870
yeah that's a clean so basically yeah
just what I wanted to slice there um

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880
just what I wanted to slice there um
 

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.670
just what I wanted to slice there um
there's two things the first is as we

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680
there's two things the first is as we
 

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.950
there's two things the first is as we
mentioned after three minutes after the

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960
mentioned after three minutes after the
 

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.930
mentioned after three minutes after the
dissidents they're right other sites

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940
dissidents they're right other sites
 

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.170
dissidents they're right other sites
we've recovered the signal we recovered

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180
we've recovered the signal we recovered
 

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.420
we've recovered the signal we recovered
this is an event so I would say order of

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.430
this is an event so I would say order of
 

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.999
this is an event so I would say order of
minutes we already know that this is

00:50:49.999 --> 00:50:50.009
minutes we already know that this is
 

00:50:50.009 --> 00:50:51.440
minutes we already know that this is
significant and we brought in another

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:51.450
significant and we brought in another
 

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.359
significant and we brought in another
direction we sort of refined the

00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:53.369
direction we sort of refined the
 

00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:55.339
direction we sort of refined the
direction directional distribution later

00:50:55.339 --> 00:50:55.349
direction directional distribution later
 

00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:57.589
direction directional distribution later
on this is a plot from our paper so

00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599
on this is a plot from our paper so
 

00:50:57.599 --> 00:51:00.680
on this is a plot from our paper so
that's that that's so that's the sofa

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:00.690
that's that that's so that's the sofa
 

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.180
that's that that's so that's the sofa
that's fine that's a so-called sky map

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:02.190
that's fine that's a so-called sky map
 

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.009
that's fine that's a so-called sky map
that's the area on the sky that we

00:51:04.009 --> 00:51:04.019
that's the area on the sky that we
 

00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:06.499
that's the area on the sky that we
recovered so basically something like

00:51:06.499 --> 00:51:06.509
recovered so basically something like
 

00:51:06.509 --> 00:51:08.359
recovered so basically something like
this not as precise but order magnitude

00:51:08.359 --> 00:51:08.369
this not as precise but order magnitude
 

00:51:08.369 --> 00:51:11.059
this not as precise but order magnitude
this precise is really recovered within

00:51:11.059 --> 00:51:11.069
this precise is really recovered within
 

00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:12.170
this precise is really recovered within
minutes very quickly

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180
minutes very quickly
 

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.999
minutes very quickly
well not quickly for a gamma-ray burst

00:51:13.999 --> 00:51:14.009
well not quickly for a gamma-ray burst
 

00:51:14.009 --> 00:51:16.190
well not quickly for a gamma-ray burst
for example but very quickly for many

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200
for example but very quickly for many
 

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.230
for example but very quickly for many
other photos so that's a time frame and

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240
other photos so that's a time frame and
 

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.529
other photos so that's a time frame and
so when we talk to on electromagnetic

00:51:21.529 --> 00:51:21.539
so when we talk to on electromagnetic
 

00:51:21.539 --> 00:51:22.849
so when we talk to on electromagnetic
partners that we talk to neutrino

00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859
partners that we talk to neutrino
 

00:51:22.859 --> 00:51:24.829
partners that we talk to neutrino
telescopes we really can be talking

00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839
telescopes we really can be talking
 

00:51:24.839 --> 00:51:26.809
telescopes we really can be talking
about this time frame for the precision

00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819
about this time frame for the precision
 

00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:28.730
about this time frame for the precision
well you see roughly what the precision

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:28.740
well you see roughly what the precision
 

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.859
well you see roughly what the precision
is now two things to note here the first

00:51:30.859 --> 00:51:30.869
is now two things to note here the first
 

00:51:30.869 --> 00:51:33.650
is now two things to note here the first
thing is that right now we have two

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660
thing is that right now we have two
 

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.269
thing is that right now we have two
detectors or two like those sites next

00:51:35.269 --> 00:51:35.279
detectors or two like those sites next
 

00:51:35.279 --> 00:51:36.950
detectors or two like those sites next
year in the next science run we're gonna

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960
year in the next science run we're gonna
 

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.960
year in the next science run we're gonna
have at least we're going more and then

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:38.970
have at least we're going more and then
 

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.509
have at least we're going more and then
but maybe two more detectors within the

00:51:41.509 --> 00:51:41.519
but maybe two more detectors within the
 

00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:43.970
but maybe two more detectors within the
decade so that will bring down this huge

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:43.980
decade so that will bring down this huge
 

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.980
decade so that will bring down this huge
region a lot so it's gotta be much

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:45.990
region a lot so it's gotta be much
 

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.749
region a lot so it's gotta be much
smaller right now what you're looking at

00:51:47.749 --> 00:51:47.759
smaller right now what you're looking at
 

00:51:47.759 --> 00:51:51.200
smaller right now what you're looking at
is 600 square degrees it's difficult

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:51.210
is 600 square degrees it's difficult
 

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:52.880
is 600 square degrees it's difficult
it's challenging but for some telescopes

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:52.890
it's challenging but for some telescopes
 

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:55.279
it's challenging but for some telescopes
so it's a special effort to look over

00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:55.289
so it's a special effort to look over
 

00:51:55.289 --> 00:51:57.170
so it's a special effort to look over
this whole area so did you look at

00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180
this whole area so did you look at
 

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.910
this whole area so did you look at
previous all-sky survey data from

00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920
previous all-sky survey data from
 

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.190
previous all-sky survey data from
rosette or Fermi or other things to see

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200
rosette or Fermi or other things to see
 

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.930
rosette or Fermi or other things to see
if there happened to be some interesting

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940
if there happened to be some interesting
 

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.289
if there happened to be some interesting
so it's not like previous what people

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:06.299
so it's not like previous what people
 

00:52:06.299 --> 00:52:08.509
so it's not like previous what people
did before what we have is a set up

00:52:08.509 --> 00:52:08.519
did before what we have is a set up
 

00:52:08.519 --> 00:52:12.380
did before what we have is a set up
program where we send out these signals

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:12.390
program where we send out these signals
 

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.809
program where we send out these signals
to partner yeah no no I understand I

00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819
to partner yeah no no I understand I
 

00:52:14.819 --> 00:52:15.859
to partner yeah no no I understand I
just meant that I mean this is a very

00:52:15.859 --> 00:52:15.869
just meant that I mean this is a very
 

00:52:15.869 --> 00:52:17.180
just meant that I mean this is a very
large region of sky so obviously you

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:17.190
large region of sky so obviously you
 

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.980
large region of sky so obviously you
can't trigger immediate follow-up at 600

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:18.990
can't trigger immediate follow-up at 600
 

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:20.539
can't trigger immediate follow-up at 600
square degrees but their current all Sky

00:52:20.539 --> 00:52:20.549
square degrees but their current all Sky
 

00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:23.839
square degrees but their current all Sky
Survey data sets that exist look and see

00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:23.849
Survey data sets that exist look and see
 

00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:24.800
Survey data sets that exist look and see
if there was something there

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:24.810
if there was something there
 

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:27.740
if there was something there
for the very good so it's a whole

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:27.750
for the very good so it's a whole
 

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:29.630
for the very good so it's a whole
different direction

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640
different direction
 

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.460
different direction
research direction how you can actually

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:31.470
research direction how you can actually
 

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.080
research direction how you can actually
find counterparts for these events

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:33.090
find counterparts for these events
 

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.450
find counterparts for these events
there's two things you can do the one

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460
there's two things you can do the one
 

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.130
there's two things you can do the one
thing is you can look at something which

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140
thing is you can look at something which
 

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.440
thing is you can look at something which
has a large magnetic or neutrino for

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:39.450
has a large magnetic or neutrino for
 

00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:42.170
has a large magnetic or neutrino for
example that has a very large field of

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180
example that has a very large field of
 

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.730
example that has a very large field of
view itself so if you have a gamma-ray

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740
view itself so if you have a gamma-ray
 

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.190
view itself so if you have a gamma-ray
burst for example that will be detected

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200
burst for example that will be detected
 

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.330
burst for example that will be detected
practically over the whole sky anyway so

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:47.340
practically over the whole sky anyway so
 

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.410
practically over the whole sky anyway so
you don't really need to look in

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420
you don't really need to look in
 

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.060
you don't really need to look in
distraction if you have something like

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.070
distraction if you have something like
 

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:52.160
distraction if you have something like
an optical counter product you looking

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:52.170
an optical counter product you looking
 

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:52.520
an optical counter product you looking
for it

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:52.530
for it
 

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.320
for it
you really have to scan through this

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:54.330
you really have to scan through this
 

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.090
you really have to scan through this
area especially if you have a small feel

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:56.100
area especially if you have a small feel
 

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.740
area especially if you have a small feel
of you and that takes time fortunately

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:57.750
of you and that takes time fortunately
 

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.920
of you and that takes time fortunately
there are predictions that there are

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:00.930
there are predictions that there are
 

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:03.230
there are predictions that there are
canta parts for example for a binary

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240
canta parts for example for a binary
 

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.330
canta parts for example for a binary
neutron star merger that will last for

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:05.340
neutron star merger that will last for
 

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.250
neutron star merger that will last for
days so you will have enough time to

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260
days so you will have enough time to
 

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.480
days so you will have enough time to
actually look through this area and this

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:08.490
actually look through this area and this
 

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.940
actually look through this area and this
is what we're doing so fortunately even

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:10.950
is what we're doing so fortunately even
 

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:11.930
is what we're doing so fortunately even
though you have a small philia but

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940
though you have a small philia but
 

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.550
though you have a small philia but
typically you will have enough time you

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:13.560
typically you will have enough time you
 

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.950
typically you will have enough time you
have days for optical you have years for

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960
have days for optical you have years for
 

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.290
have days for optical you have years for
radio for example to scan through this

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300
radio for example to scan through this
 

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.150
radio for example to scan through this
area this is again something you're very

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160

we don't need to look in any direction

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:29.900
we don't need to look in any direction
 

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.530
we don't need to look in any direction
excellent question thank you yeah Emre

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540
excellent question thank you yeah Emre
 

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.770
excellent question thank you yeah Emre
just I mean this is this requires a long

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780
just I mean this is this requires a long
 

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.630
just I mean this is this requires a long
answer to some extent but if you look at

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640
answer to some extent but if you look at
 

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.270
answer to some extent but if you look at
your inferred rate it's pretty high yeah

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280
your inferred rate it's pretty high yeah
 

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.450
your inferred rate it's pretty high yeah
something like maybe 0.1% of the

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460
something like maybe 0.1% of the
 

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.730
something like maybe 0.1% of the
supernova rate in the universe is what

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740
supernova rate in the universe is what
 

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.020
supernova rate in the universe is what
you're seeing for the inferred rate of

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:48.030
you're seeing for the inferred rate of
 

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:50.570
you're seeing for the inferred rate of
these mergers and so it could point to

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:50.580
these mergers and so it could point to
 

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.670
these mergers and so it could point to
these being in some special location

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680
these being in some special location
 

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.790
these being in some special location
within the galaxy in which has I've been

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800
within the galaxy in which has I've been
 

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.530
within the galaxy in which has I've been
thinking about that and yeah very good

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540
thinking about that and yeah very good
 

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.480
thinking about that and yeah very good
very good so what can we say beyond the

00:53:59.480 --> 00:53:59.490
very good so what can we say beyond the
 

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.610
very good so what can we say beyond the
fact that this is you know how often

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:01.620
fact that this is you know how often
 

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.230
fact that this is you know how often
it's happening and let me add one extra

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240
it's happening and let me add one extra
 

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.840
it's happening and let me add one extra
piece of information is really the size

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:05.850
piece of information is really the size
 

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:07.640
piece of information is really the size
of these zone of these black holes that

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:07.650
of these zone of these black holes that
 

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.620
of these zone of these black holes that
was one of the previous questions how

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:09.630
was one of the previous questions how
 

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:10.940
was one of the previous questions how
can they grow this big and one of the

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:10.950
can they grow this big and one of the
 

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.670
can they grow this big and one of the
things we know for sure is that for them

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680
things we know for sure is that for them
 

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.190
things we know for sure is that for them
to grow this big the metallicity of the

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200
to grow this big the metallicity of the
 

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.080
to grow this big the metallicity of the
area where they are has to be fairly low

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:18.090
area where they are has to be fairly low
 

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.360
area where they are has to be fairly low
it's basically our constraint is below

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:20.370
it's basically our constraint is below
 

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:23.270
it's basically our constraint is below
1/2 the solar medal but likely or

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280
1/2 the solar medal but likely or
 

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.640
1/2 the solar medal but likely or
possibly even lower so to that extent we

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:25.650
possibly even lower so to that extent we
 

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:27.440
possibly even lower so to that extent we
can say things like this now another

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:27.450
can say things like this now another
 

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.420
can say things like this now another
piece of evidence we can say for example

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:29.430
piece of evidence we can say for example
 

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:33.470
piece of evidence we can say for example
do we see any eccentricity in the in a

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480
do we see any eccentricity in the in a
 

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.930
do we see any eccentricity in the in a
signal can we tell whether this was the

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940
signal can we tell whether this was the
 

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.330
signal can we tell whether this was the
two black holes dynamically merging

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:38.340
two black holes dynamically merging
 

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.740
two black holes dynamically merging
dynamically just meeting in some

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:39.750
dynamically just meeting in some
 

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.240
dynamically just meeting in some
environment with lots of black holes or

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:41.250
environment with lots of black holes or
 

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:44.030
environment with lots of black holes or
they possibly fought together now we

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040
they possibly fought together now we
 

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.470
they possibly fought together now we
have not seen any a meaningful

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480
have not seen any a meaningful
 

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.230
have not seen any a meaningful
eccentricity so it is more likely

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240
eccentricity so it is more likely
 

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.370
eccentricity so it is more likely
that's the black holes formed a binary

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:51.380
that's the black holes formed a binary
 

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.020
that's the black holes formed a binary
long before they actually merged so that

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:54.030
long before they actually merged so that
 

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.480
long before they actually merged so that
also is limiting on where the specific

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:56.490
also is limiting on where the specific
 

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.100
also is limiting on where the specific
thing is so there are many things you

00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:58.110
thing is so there are many things you
 

00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.410
thing is so there are many things you
can add to this picture on on where they

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420
can add to this picture on on where they
 

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.150
can add to this picture on on where they
form now the other thing to notice in

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160
form now the other thing to notice in
 

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.650
form now the other thing to notice in
terms of the formation mechanism is that

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660
terms of the formation mechanism is that
 

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.600
terms of the formation mechanism is that
the two masses are fairly similar so

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:05.610
the two masses are fairly similar so
 

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.700
the two masses are fairly similar so
that's also potentially meaningful in

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:07.710
that's also potentially meaningful in
 

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.470
that's also potentially meaningful in
terms of what the what the process was

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480
terms of what the what the process was
 

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.700
terms of what the what the process was
that created this thing so there were

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:10.710
that created this thing so there were
 

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.700
that created this thing so there were
specific options proposed of why this

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:13.710
specific options proposed of why this
 

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.590
specific options proposed of why this
specifically is the case which may not

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:15.600
specifically is the case which may not
 

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.050
specifically is the case which may not
happen in every scenario so we do have

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:18.060
happen in every scenario so we do have
 

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.550
happen in every scenario so we do have
something ditches I don't think this is

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:19.560
something ditches I don't think this is
 

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.680
something ditches I don't think this is
a we have a final word on this there's

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:21.690
a we have a final word on this there's
 

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.780
a we have a final word on this there's
many uncertainties the good news is that

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:23.790
many uncertainties the good news is that
 

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.610
many uncertainties the good news is that
the high rate also means we'll have many

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:25.620
the high rate also means we'll have many
 

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.130
the high rate also means we'll have many
more detections very soon so we can we

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140
more detections very soon so we can we
 

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:35.450
more detections very soon so we can we
can tell much more about that soon so I

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460
can tell much more about that soon so I
 

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.640
can tell much more about that soon so I
noticed in the fact sheet so you have an

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:37.650
noticed in the fact sheet so you have an
 

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:41.960
noticed in the fact sheet so you have an
upper bound on the gravity of mass so

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:41.970
upper bound on the gravity of mass so
 

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.270
upper bound on the gravity of mass so
I'm sure this is not the priority in

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280
I'm sure this is not the priority in
 

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.830
I'm sure this is not the priority in
this experiment and everything so but I

00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:45.840
this experiment and everything so but I
 

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.850
this experiment and everything so but I
cannot help myself from asking so yeah

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:49.860
cannot help myself from asking so yeah
 

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.730
cannot help myself from asking so yeah
yes 10 to the minus 22 yeah so if you

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740
yes 10 to the minus 22 yeah so if you
 

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.100
yes 10 to the minus 22 yeah so if you
look at yeah so the priority just two

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:55.110
look at yeah so the priority just two
 

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:56.810
look at yeah so the priority just two
questions about it so is it derived in a

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:56.820
questions about it so is it derived in a
 

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.070
questions about it so is it derived in a
more-or-less model independent way and

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:00.080
more-or-less model independent way and
 

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.480
more-or-less model independent way and
do you think that with the improvements

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:02.490
do you think that with the improvements
 

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:03.950
do you think that with the improvements
in the future you could lower this

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960
in the future you could lower this
 

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.900
in the future you could lower this
significantly um this is um this is

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:08.910
significantly um this is um this is
 

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.880
significantly um this is um this is
model independence and if you look at

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:10.890
model independence and if you look at
 

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.010
model independence and if you look at
how this compares to other measurements

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020
how this compares to other measurements
 

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.430
how this compares to other measurements
that are out there this is better than

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440
that are out there this is better than
 

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.080
that are out there this is better than
model independence estimates we had

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:18.090
model independence estimates we had
 

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:20.000
model independence estimates we had
before but it's worse than model

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.010
before but it's worse than model
 

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.980
before but it's worse than model
dependent estimates we had already from

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:21.990
dependent estimates we had already from
 

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.650
dependent estimates we had already from
from galaxy clusters so depending on

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660
from galaxy clusters so depending on
 

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.690
from galaxy clusters so depending on
your taste you can call this the best or

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700
your taste you can call this the best or
 

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.730
your taste you can call this the best or
not the best but you can definitely

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740
not the best but you can definitely
 

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.280
not the best but you can definitely
improve on this a lot let me just say

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:31.290
improve on this a lot let me just say
 

00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:32.900
improve on this a lot let me just say
two things first of all if you have

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:32.910
two things first of all if you have
 

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:34.100
two things first of all if you have
multiple detections it's going to

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:34.110
multiple detections it's going to
 

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:35.900
multiple detections it's going to
improve this number is gonna improve

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:35.910
improve this number is gonna improve
 

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:37.640
improve this number is gonna improve
with that if you have an actual in the

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:37.650
with that if you have an actual in the
 

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:38.780
with that if you have an actual in the
counterpart you can potentially improve

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:38.790
counterpart you can potentially improve
 

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.850
counterpart you can potentially improve
this as well so this number will

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:40.860
this as well so this number will
 

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.470
this as well so this number will
definitely go down as we go on

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480
definitely go down as we go on
 

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.809
definitely go down as we go on
and again we don't really use any model

00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819
and again we don't really use any model
 

00:56:44.819 --> 00:56:46.539
and again we don't really use any model
medicine so it's fairly straightforward

00:56:46.539 --> 00:56:46.549
medicine so it's fairly straightforward
 

00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:49.940
medicine so it's fairly straightforward
okay so we can expect lower orders of

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:49.950
okay so we can expect lower orders of
 

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:51.920
okay so we can expect lower orders of
magnitude like to be lowered

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:51.930
magnitude like to be lowered
 

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:52.730
magnitude like to be lowered
significantly

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740
significantly
 

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.309
significantly
I wouldn't say you know whether it's

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319
I wouldn't say you know whether it's
 

00:56:55.319 --> 00:56:56.900
I wouldn't say you know whether it's
orders minor - it's hard to say but it's

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:56.910
orders minor - it's hard to say but it's
 

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.819
orders minor - it's hard to say but it's
you know as we have more data we

00:56:58.819 --> 00:56:58.829
you know as we have more data we
 

00:56:58.829 --> 00:57:00.740
you know as we have more data we
definitely will improve this on quite a

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:00.750
definitely will improve this on quite a
 

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.870
definitely will improve this on quite a
bit okay thank you thank you

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880
bit okay thank you thank you
 

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.670
bit okay thank you thank you
hey I have a naive question about

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680
hey I have a naive question about
 

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.549
hey I have a naive question about
latency ya know this counterpart

00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559
latency ya know this counterpart
 

00:57:07.559 --> 00:57:08.960
latency ya know this counterpart
business what really matters is how fast

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:08.970
business what really matters is how fast
 

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:10.700
business what really matters is how fast
you actually discovered the same so if

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:10.710
you actually discovered the same so if
 

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:11.839
you actually discovered the same so if
somebody watching the screen all the

00:57:11.839 --> 00:57:11.849
somebody watching the screen all the
 

00:57:11.849 --> 00:57:13.430
somebody watching the screen all the
time and did you actually find it as it

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440
time and did you actually find it as it
 

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.750
time and did you actually find it as it
was happening or it was this the next

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760
was happening or it was this the next
 

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.329
was happening or it was this the next
morning is it oh my god what is it

00:57:16.329 --> 00:57:16.339
morning is it oh my god what is it
 

00:57:16.339 --> 00:57:19.549
morning is it oh my god what is it
yeah very good so so what was the

00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559
yeah very good so so what was the
 

00:57:19.559 --> 00:57:21.859
yeah very good so so what was the
latency or how fast we go from okay well

00:57:21.859 --> 00:57:21.869
latency or how fast we go from okay well
 

00:57:21.869 --> 00:57:23.720
latency or how fast we go from okay well
the doctors back is something to do hey

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:23.730
the doctors back is something to do hey
 

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:25.309
the doctors back is something to do hey
let's let's open a bottle of champagne

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319
let's let's open a bottle of champagne
 

00:57:25.319 --> 00:57:26.930
let's let's open a bottle of champagne
and I would say this is a long process

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940
and I would say this is a long process
 

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.910
and I would say this is a long process
for many reasons especially for this

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920
for many reasons especially for this
 

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.339
for many reasons especially for this
specific event and the one thing I would

00:57:31.339 --> 00:57:31.349
specific event and the one thing I would
 

00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:34.190
specific event and the one thing I would
want to emphasize here is that again

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200
want to emphasize here is that again
 

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.470
want to emphasize here is that again
since this is the first section of this

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480
since this is the first section of this
 

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.020
since this is the first section of this
kind and since we have no way to produce

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:39.030
kind and since we have no way to produce
 

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.670
kind and since we have no way to produce
a gravitational wave detector detectors

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680
a gravitational wave detector detectors
 

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.640
a gravitational wave detector detectors
we wanted to collect extraordinary

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:43.650
we wanted to collect extraordinary
 

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:45.020
we wanted to collect extraordinary
evidence to make sure that nothing goes

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:45.030
evidence to make sure that nothing goes
 

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:47.480
evidence to make sure that nothing goes
wrong right so we will that everything

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:47.490
wrong right so we will that everything
 

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:49.940
wrong right so we will that everything
besides aliens that could produce this

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:49.950
besides aliens that could produce this
 

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:51.530
besides aliens that could produce this
signal so that was a long effort than

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540
signal so that was a long effort than
 

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.690
signal so that was a long effort than
the reason we took this long from

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700
the reason we took this long from
 

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.910
the reason we took this long from
September to today is really to make

00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920
September to today is really to make
 

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.380
September to today is really to make
sure that all these things are accounted

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:57.390
sure that all these things are accounted
 

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.120
sure that all these things are accounted
for now this will not be repeated every

00:57:59.120 --> 00:57:59.130
for now this will not be repeated every
 

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:00.589
for now this will not be repeated every
time you detect something I hope at

00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599
time you detect something I hope at
 

00:58:00.599 --> 00:58:03.020
time you detect something I hope at
least right so it's gonna go way faster

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:03.030
least right so it's gonna go way faster
 

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.150
least right so it's gonna go way faster
in the future but let me let me add

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160
in the future but let me let me add
 

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.190
in the future but let me let me add
another aspect and that's related to the

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200
another aspect and that's related to the
 

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.930
another aspect and that's related to the
fact that this was an engineering run

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940
fact that this was an engineering run
 

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.089
fact that this was an engineering run
right after we turn on the detector what

00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099
right after we turn on the detector what
 

00:58:11.099 --> 00:58:13.430
right after we turn on the detector what
happens is as you turn on you really

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440
happens is as you turn on you really
 

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.549
happens is as you turn on you really
have no way to characterize your

00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559
have no way to characterize your
 

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.349
have no way to characterize your
sensitivity characterize your data

00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359
sensitivity characterize your data
 

00:58:18.359 --> 00:58:20.270
sensitivity characterize your data
what's happening is our background is

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280
what's happening is our background is
 

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.620
what's happening is our background is
not Gaussian it's something slightly

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:21.630
not Gaussian it's something slightly
 

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.510
not Gaussian it's something slightly
more complicated we have so-called non

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520
more complicated we have so-called non
 

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.760
more complicated we have so-called non
Gaussian transients so in order for us

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:25.770
Gaussian transients so in order for us
 

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.650
Gaussian transients so in order for us
to understand how sensitive something is

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:27.660
to understand how sensitive something is
 

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:30.200
to understand how sensitive something is
we have to collect more data that's why

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:30.210
we have to collect more data that's why
 

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.549
we have to collect more data that's why
it was very important what you dimension

00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559
it was very important what you dimension
 

00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:33.799
it was very important what you dimension
to keep the detector configuration on

00:58:33.799 --> 00:58:33.809
to keep the detector configuration on
 

00:58:33.809 --> 00:58:37.490
to keep the detector configuration on
after this this observation so the three

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500
after this this observation so the three
 

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.039
after this this observation so the three
minutes detection or a sort of trigger

00:58:40.039 --> 00:58:40.049
minutes detection or a sort of trigger
 

00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:41.990
minutes detection or a sort of trigger
that we found had no way to tell what

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000
that we found had no way to tell what
 

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.460
that we found had no way to tell what
the actual significance was that first

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:43.470
the actual significance was that first
 

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:45.440
the actual significance was that first
trigger was only saying hey this is

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:45.450
trigger was only saying hey this is
 

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:47.180
trigger was only saying hey this is
interesting you should look more if you

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:47.190
interesting you should look more if you
 

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.470
interesting you should look more if you
looked at the data it looked like hey I

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480
looked at the data it looked like hey I
 

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.809
looked at the data it looked like hey I
can see with my eye you know you can

00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819
can see with my eye you know you can
 

00:58:53.819 --> 00:58:55.340
can see with my eye you know you can
sort of tell but

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:55.350
sort of tell but
 

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:57.440
sort of tell but
the five Sigma that we have you cannot

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:57.450
the five Sigma that we have you cannot
 

00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.060
the five Sigma that we have you cannot
tell that right away so that takes

00:58:59.060 --> 00:58:59.070
tell that right away so that takes
 

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:00.860
tell that right away so that takes
longer now if you have a longer

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:00.870
longer now if you have a longer
 

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.030
longer now if you have a longer
observation rod and you detect something

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040
observation rod and you detect something
 

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.010
observation rod and you detect something
in the middle you will have a much

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020
in the middle you will have a much
 

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.840
in the middle you will have a much
better way to tell right away what is

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:05.850
better way to tell right away what is
 

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:07.220
better way to tell right away what is
happening but this was again not the

00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:07.230
happening but this was again not the
 

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:09.470
happening but this was again not the
case here so this made our lives a

00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480
case here so this made our lives a
 

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.410
case here so this made our lives a
little harder in their sense but again

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420
little harder in their sense but again
 

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.910
little harder in their sense but again
as we understand it effects are better

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920
as we understand it effects are better
 

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.380
as we understand it effects are better
right this is also the first answer on

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:15.390
right this is also the first answer on
 

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:18.710
right this is also the first answer on
four for advanced LIGO so we had really

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720
four for advanced LIGO so we had really
 

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.500
four for advanced LIGO so we had really
no idea what to expect it really took a

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:21.510
no idea what to expect it really took a
 

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:22.820
no idea what to expect it really took a
lot of effort to get to the point where

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:22.830
lot of effort to get to the point where
 

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:24.230
lot of effort to get to the point where
we understand it but this is not gonna

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240
we understand it but this is not gonna
 

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.900
we understand it but this is not gonna
be the case forever we're gonna do this

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:26.910
be the case forever we're gonna do this
 

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:30.560
be the case forever we're gonna do this
way faster on all sides so I expect much

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:30.570
way faster on all sides so I expect much
 

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.710
way faster on all sides so I expect much
less latency in this case definitely not

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720
less latency in this case definitely not
 

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:41.330
less latency in this case definitely not
before publication signals get even

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:41.340
before publication signals get even
 

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:45.110
before publication signals get even
bigger and really this one was so huge

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:45.120
bigger and really this one was so huge
 

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.140
bigger and really this one was so huge
that on the day of the event I mean yeah

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:48.150
that on the day of the event I mean yeah
 

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.840
that on the day of the event I mean yeah
NASA flying I really went online and I

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:50.850
NASA flying I really went online and I
 

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:52.400
NASA flying I really went online and I
was looking for the so-called Oh

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:52.410
was looking for the so-called Oh
 

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:55.790
was looking for the so-called Oh
micrograms and I've seen this okay this

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:55.800
micrograms and I've seen this okay this
 

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.440
micrograms and I've seen this okay this
may be a bit Polish in there it's paper

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:57.450
may be a bit Polish in there it's paper
 

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:59.510
may be a bit Polish in there it's paper
but I've seen it it was there and I said

00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520
but I've seen it it was there and I said
 

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:05.240
but I've seen it it was there and I said
wow this is it okay so it was there we

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:05.250
wow this is it okay so it was there we
 

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:09.020
wow this is it okay so it was there we
knew we had the infrastructure to send

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.030
knew we had the infrastructure to send
 

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:12.890
knew we had the infrastructure to send
things out and we are sending them out

01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900
things out and we are sending them out
 

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.970
things out and we are sending them out
to partners we were very slow on that

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:15.980
to partners we were very slow on that
 

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:19.790
to partners we were very slow on that
first event because they were not they

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:19.800
first event because they were not they
 

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.530
first event because they were not they
were not even expecting god it was the

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:24.540
were not even expecting god it was the
 

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:27.590
were not even expecting god it was the
engineer on so I I really think this can

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:27.600
engineer on so I I really think this can
 

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.470
engineer on so I I really think this can
be much faster and in terms of data

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480
be much faster and in terms of data
 

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.250
be much faster and in terms of data
analysis it's already there it's it's

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260
analysis it's already there it's it's
 

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.710
analysis it's already there it's it's
convincing you guys we are sending real

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720
convincing you guys we are sending real
 

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.380
convincing you guys we are sending real
data and the big bonds it's gonna be

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:39.390
data and the big bonds it's gonna be
 

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:42.710
data and the big bonds it's gonna be
quick don't tell me 30 seconds we are

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720
quick don't tell me 30 seconds we are
 

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.750
quick don't tell me 30 seconds we are
never gonna do that okay yeah I would

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760
never gonna do that okay yeah I would
 

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.370
never gonna do that okay yeah I would
argue with that but we'll see we'll see

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380
argue with that but we'll see we'll see
 

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.080
argue with that but we'll see we'll see
um but let me let me add that one of

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:48.090
um but let me let me add that one of
 

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:49.670
um but let me let me add that one of
them thousands of channels that we have

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680
them thousands of channels that we have
 

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.730
them thousands of channels that we have
with respect to seeing what happens is

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740
with respect to seeing what happens is
 

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:56.000
with respect to seeing what happens is
is Gmail so um if you look at what you

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.010
is Gmail so um if you look at what you
 

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.440
is Gmail so um if you look at what you
know even if you didn't look at this

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:57.450
know even if you didn't look at this
 

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.450
know even if you didn't look at this
these there's plots afterwards in the

01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460
these there's plots afterwards in the
 

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.000
these there's plots afterwards in the
last you know half a year it's there is

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.010
last you know half a year it's there is
 

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.259
last you know half a year it's there is
there has been some

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:03.269
there has been some
 

01:01:03.269 --> 01:01:05.209
there has been some
data there there has been some extra

01:01:05.209 --> 01:01:05.219
data there there has been some extra
 

01:01:05.219 --> 01:01:07.159
data there there has been some extra
signal there I had a colleague who's

01:01:07.159 --> 01:01:07.169
signal there I had a colleague who's
 

01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:09.559
signal there I had a colleague who's
complaining that his Department

01:01:09.559 --> 01:01:09.569
complaining that his Department
 

01:01:09.569 --> 01:01:11.059
complaining that his Department
contacted him because they thought he

01:01:11.059 --> 01:01:11.069
contacted him because they thought he
 

01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:12.889
contacted him because they thought he
had a virus because produced 50 percent

01:01:12.889 --> 01:01:12.899
had a virus because produced 50 percent
 

01:01:12.899 --> 01:01:15.739
had a virus because produced 50 percent
of the department's email influx so it

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:15.749
of the department's email influx so it
 

01:01:15.749 --> 01:01:18.399
of the department's email influx so it
was difficult thing just to delete

01:01:18.399 --> 01:01:18.409
was difficult thing just to delete
 

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:20.899
was difficult thing just to delete
whatever was not important so there you

01:01:20.899 --> 01:01:20.909
whatever was not important so there you
 

01:01:20.909 --> 01:01:22.639
whatever was not important so there you
know it was fairly clear that there had

01:01:22.639 --> 01:01:22.649
know it was fairly clear that there had
 

01:01:22.649 --> 01:01:24.380
know it was fairly clear that there had
to be something but in terms of you know

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.390
to be something but in terms of you know
 

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.209
to be something but in terms of you know
making this rigours there was a lot of

01:01:26.209 --> 01:01:26.219
making this rigours there was a lot of
 

01:01:26.219 --> 01:01:29.059
making this rigours there was a lot of
checks that we had to do let me also add

01:01:29.059 --> 01:01:29.069
checks that we had to do let me also add
 

01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:31.069
checks that we had to do let me also add
just because of the timing things so

01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079
just because of the timing things so
 

01:01:31.079 --> 01:01:32.149
just because of the timing things so
again we're talking about three minutes

01:01:32.149 --> 01:01:32.159
again we're talking about three minutes
 

01:01:32.159 --> 01:01:34.969
again we're talking about three minutes
but technically imagine you have this

01:01:34.969 --> 01:01:34.979
but technically imagine you have this
 

01:01:34.979 --> 01:01:36.229
but technically imagine you have this
kind of signal and you have something

01:01:36.229 --> 01:01:36.239
kind of signal and you have something
 

01:01:36.239 --> 01:01:38.239
kind of signal and you have something
with - if against this merger when you

01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:38.249
with - if against this merger when you
 

01:01:38.249 --> 01:01:41.269
with - if against this merger when you
enter fully the sensitivity BAM

01:01:41.269 --> 01:01:41.279
enter fully the sensitivity BAM
 

01:01:41.279 --> 01:01:44.299
enter fully the sensitivity BAM
here we started off at 35 first that was

01:01:44.299 --> 01:01:44.309
here we started off at 35 first that was
 

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:45.979
here we started off at 35 first that was
the lowest signal we could detect but

01:01:45.979 --> 01:01:45.989
the lowest signal we could detect but
 

01:01:45.989 --> 01:01:47.989
the lowest signal we could detect but
we'll go down to 10 Hertz eventually and

01:01:47.989 --> 01:01:47.999
we'll go down to 10 Hertz eventually and
 

01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:48.919
we'll go down to 10 Hertz eventually and
within this time frame

01:01:48.919 --> 01:01:48.929
within this time frame
 

01:01:48.929 --> 01:01:50.599
within this time frame
you really have minutes that attacker

01:01:50.599 --> 01:01:50.609
you really have minutes that attacker
 

01:01:50.609 --> 01:01:52.999
you really have minutes that attacker
spends or the the signal spends with in

01:01:52.999 --> 01:01:53.009
spends or the the signal spends with in
 

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:55.159
spends or the the signal spends with in
the detector sensitive bands and within

01:01:55.159 --> 01:01:55.169
the detector sensitive bands and within
 

01:01:55.169 --> 01:01:56.479
the detector sensitive bands and within
minutes if you have high enough

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:56.489
minutes if you have high enough
 

01:01:56.489 --> 01:01:58.909
minutes if you have high enough
sensitivity you can imprison tell that

01:01:58.909 --> 01:01:58.919
sensitivity you can imprison tell that
 

01:01:58.919 --> 01:02:00.349
sensitivity you can imprison tell that
there is a signal before it actually

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359
there is a signal before it actually
 

01:02:00.359 --> 01:02:02.630
there is a signal before it actually
emerged so there is a chance that we can

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640
emerged so there is a chance that we can
 

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.370
emerged so there is a chance that we can
actually not just go to you know 30

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380
actually not just go to you know 30
 

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.839
actually not just go to you know 30
seconds but actually go before and

01:02:05.839 --> 01:02:05.849
seconds but actually go before and
 

01:02:05.849 --> 01:02:07.969
seconds but actually go before and
predict that something will happen in a

01:02:07.969 --> 01:02:07.979
predict that something will happen in a
 

01:02:07.979 --> 01:02:10.789
predict that something will happen in a
minute or so again not currently but

01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799
minute or so again not currently but
 

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:12.289
minute or so again not currently but
this is something in a foreseeable

01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299
this is something in a foreseeable
 

01:02:12.299 --> 01:02:16.669
this is something in a foreseeable
future so the line of sight the

01:02:16.669 --> 01:02:16.679
future so the line of sight the
 

01:02:16.679 --> 01:02:18.889
future so the line of sight the
orientation with respect to the plane of

01:02:18.889 --> 01:02:18.899
orientation with respect to the plane of
 

01:02:18.899 --> 01:02:20.629
orientation with respect to the plane of
emerging black holes

01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:20.639
emerging black holes
 

01:02:20.639 --> 01:02:23.779
emerging black holes
how do you determine that yeah very good

01:02:23.779 --> 01:02:23.789
how do you determine that yeah very good
 

01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:26.359
how do you determine that yeah very good
so basically we have searched I can you

01:02:26.359 --> 01:02:26.369
so basically we have searched I can you
 

01:02:26.369 --> 01:02:27.079
so basically we have searched I can you
go to the yard

01:02:27.079 --> 01:02:27.089
go to the yard
 

01:02:27.089 --> 01:02:28.909
go to the yard
you're just light on this there's a

01:02:28.909 --> 01:02:28.919
you're just light on this there's a
 

01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:33.009
you're just light on this there's a
slide on on orientation versus distance

01:02:33.009 --> 01:02:33.019
slide on on orientation versus distance
 

01:02:33.019 --> 01:02:35.689
slide on on orientation versus distance
basically again of you have you have a

01:02:35.689 --> 01:02:35.699
basically again of you have you have a
 

01:02:35.699 --> 01:02:37.789
basically again of you have you have a
waveform information the the problem is

01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799
waveform information the the problem is
 

01:02:37.799 --> 01:02:40.729
waveform information the the problem is
that if you are really perpendicular the

01:02:40.729 --> 01:02:40.739
that if you are really perpendicular the
 

01:02:40.739 --> 01:02:42.919
that if you are really perpendicular the
the plane is perpendicular to the line

01:02:42.919 --> 01:02:42.929
the plane is perpendicular to the line
 

01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:44.509
the plane is perpendicular to the line
of sight then you know it's it's a

01:02:44.509 --> 01:02:44.519
of sight then you know it's it's a
 

01:02:44.519 --> 01:02:46.009
of sight then you know it's it's a
linear polarization you see there

01:02:46.009 --> 01:02:46.019
linear polarization you see there
 

01:02:46.019 --> 01:02:48.259
linear polarization you see there
directly but if there's any other angle

01:02:48.259 --> 01:02:48.269
directly but if there's any other angle
 

01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:50.329
directly but if there's any other angle
basically we have a really hard time

01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339
basically we have a really hard time
 

01:02:50.339 --> 01:02:53.179
basically we have a really hard time
saying if it's really on really faced on

01:02:53.179 --> 01:02:53.189
saying if it's really on really faced on
 

01:02:53.189 --> 01:02:55.699
saying if it's really on really faced on
it's really just close to that so that

01:02:55.699 --> 01:02:55.709
it's really just close to that so that
 

01:02:55.709 --> 01:02:58.370
it's really just close to that so that
extends yeah here so basically there's

01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380
extends yeah here so basically there's
 

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.099
extends yeah here so basically there's
this ambiguity between orientation on

01:03:01.099 --> 01:03:01.109
this ambiguity between orientation on
 

01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:03.649
this ambiguity between orientation on
the x axis here and Vista so basically

01:03:03.649 --> 01:03:03.659
the x axis here and Vista so basically
 

01:03:03.659 --> 01:03:06.769
the x axis here and Vista so basically
in if you are faced on you radiate

01:03:06.769 --> 01:03:06.779
in if you are faced on you radiate
 

01:03:06.779 --> 01:03:11.029
in if you are faced on you radiate
towards the earth and a case 50% more

01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039
towards the earth and a case 50% more
 

01:03:11.039 --> 01:03:12.889
towards the earth and a case 50% more
gravitational waves and if you are on

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:12.899
gravitational waves and if you are on
 

01:03:12.899 --> 01:03:13.499
gravitational waves and if you are on
some average

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:13.509
some average
 

01:03:13.509 --> 01:03:15.989
some average
a direction because again there's little

01:03:15.989 --> 01:03:15.999
a direction because again there's little
 

01:03:15.999 --> 01:03:18.299
a direction because again there's little
information in the polarization unless

01:03:18.299 --> 01:03:18.309
information in the polarization unless
 

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:21.149
information in the polarization unless
you're really perpendicular it's very

01:03:21.149 --> 01:03:21.159
you're really perpendicular it's very
 

01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:22.919
you're really perpendicular it's very
hard to decouple these these different

01:03:22.919 --> 01:03:22.929
hard to decouple these these different
 

01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:25.079
hard to decouple these these different
effects so as you see there is a huge

01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:25.089
effects so as you see there is a huge
 

01:03:25.089 --> 01:03:26.999
effects so as you see there is a huge
answer that's the biggest uncertainty in

01:03:26.999 --> 01:03:27.009
answer that's the biggest uncertainty in
 

01:03:27.009 --> 01:03:29.399
answer that's the biggest uncertainty in
our in our distance range if we have

01:03:29.399 --> 01:03:29.409
our in our distance range if we have
 

01:03:29.409 --> 01:03:30.749
our in our distance range if we have
something electromagnetic it would be

01:03:30.749 --> 01:03:30.759
something electromagnetic it would be
 

01:03:30.759 --> 01:03:32.819
something electromagnetic it would be
much simpler we didn't you know for

01:03:32.819 --> 01:03:32.829
much simpler we didn't you know for
 

01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:33.929
much simpler we didn't you know for
black holes that's not something you

01:03:33.929 --> 01:03:33.939
black holes that's not something you
 

01:03:33.939 --> 01:03:34.379
black holes that's not something you
expect

01:03:34.379 --> 01:03:34.389
expect
 

01:03:34.389 --> 01:03:36.329
expect
unfortunately so this will remain for

01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:36.339
unfortunately so this will remain for
 

01:03:36.339 --> 01:03:38.219
unfortunately so this will remain for
most parts again it's very hard to

01:03:38.219 --> 01:03:38.229
most parts again it's very hard to
 

01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:39.539
most parts again it's very hard to
resolve this if we'll have more

01:03:39.539 --> 01:03:39.549
resolve this if we'll have more
 

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.219
resolve this if we'll have more
detectors that can help as well but it's

01:03:41.219 --> 01:03:41.229
detectors that can help as well but it's
 

01:03:41.229 --> 01:03:42.629
detectors that can help as well but it's
it's that's one of the difficult

01:03:42.629 --> 01:03:42.639
it's that's one of the difficult
 

01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:45.209
it's that's one of the difficult
questions we face experimental you have

01:03:45.209 --> 01:03:45.219
questions we face experimental you have
 

01:03:45.219 --> 01:03:46.829
questions we face experimental you have
to be a couple these two things if you

01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839
to be a couple these two things if you
 

01:03:46.839 --> 01:03:53.399
to be a couple these two things if you
have a good very good

01:03:53.399 --> 01:03:53.409
 
 

01:03:53.409 --> 01:03:56.189
 
quick question to what extent will like

01:03:56.189 --> 01:03:56.199
quick question to what extent will like
 

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:58.349
quick question to what extent will like
I be able to constrain the number of

01:03:58.349 --> 01:03:58.359
I be able to constrain the number of
 

01:03:58.359 --> 01:04:01.999
I be able to constrain the number of
polarization modes that you see in these

01:04:01.999 --> 01:04:02.009
polarization modes that you see in these
 

01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:05.309
polarization modes that you see in these
will you be able to constrain the number

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:05.319
will you be able to constrain the number
 

01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:09.409
will you be able to constrain the number
of polarization modes in your signals

01:04:09.409 --> 01:04:09.419
 
 

01:04:09.419 --> 01:04:11.819
 
it's an excellent question and it would

01:04:11.819 --> 01:04:11.829
it's an excellent question and it would
 

01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:14.549
it's an excellent question and it would
be great to what to find that something

01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559
be great to what to find that something
 

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.919
be great to what to find that something
is very different the problem is for

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:16.929
is very different the problem is for
 

01:04:16.929 --> 01:04:18.779
is very different the problem is for
other polarization modes we are way less

01:04:18.779 --> 01:04:18.789
other polarization modes we are way less
 

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:21.449
other polarization modes we are way less
sensitive then for the mean one so if

01:04:21.449 --> 01:04:21.459
sensitive then for the mean one so if
 

01:04:21.459 --> 01:04:24.299
sensitive then for the mean one so if
there's anything slightly different than

01:04:24.299 --> 01:04:24.309
there's anything slightly different than
 

01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:27.059
there's anything slightly different than
what we expect additionally the signal

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:27.069
what we expect additionally the signal
 

01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:30.120
what we expect additionally the signal
that we expect from that will be will

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.130
that we expect from that will be will
 

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:34.709
that we expect from that will be will
have to be way stronger than what we did

01:04:34.709 --> 01:04:34.719
have to be way stronger than what we did
 

01:04:34.719 --> 01:04:36.809
have to be way stronger than what we did
that occur so in principle that's

01:04:36.809 --> 01:04:36.819
that occur so in principle that's
 

01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:38.519
that occur so in principle that's
possible in principle we can do many

01:04:38.519 --> 01:04:38.529
possible in principle we can do many
 

01:04:38.529 --> 01:04:40.439
possible in principle we can do many
things like that in practice is

01:04:40.439 --> 01:04:40.449
things like that in practice is
 

01:04:40.449 --> 01:04:41.939
things like that in practice is
extremely hard because we need much

01:04:41.939 --> 01:04:41.949
extremely hard because we need much
 

01:04:41.949 --> 01:04:43.889
extremely hard because we need much
higher signal-to-noise ratio than for

01:04:43.889 --> 01:04:43.899
higher signal-to-noise ratio than for
 

01:04:43.899 --> 01:04:45.569
higher signal-to-noise ratio than for
these events so I would say that the

01:04:45.569 --> 01:04:45.579
these events so I would say that the
 

01:04:45.579 --> 01:04:47.609
these events so I would say that the
main way we can test things beyond

01:04:47.609 --> 01:04:47.619
main way we can test things beyond
 

01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:49.829
main way we can test things beyond
general tivity is is a slightly

01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839
general tivity is is a slightly
 

01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:51.569
general tivity is is a slightly
different we can really and one of the

01:04:51.569 --> 01:04:51.579
different we can really and one of the
 

01:04:51.579 --> 01:04:53.549
different we can really and one of the
things there is a separate paper on this

01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559
things there is a separate paper on this
 

01:04:53.559 --> 01:04:55.979
things there is a separate paper on this
was one of the many papers how we can

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:55.989
was one of the many papers how we can
 

01:04:55.989 --> 01:04:57.899
was one of the many papers how we can
test the general relativity with what we

01:04:57.899 --> 01:04:57.909
test the general relativity with what we
 

01:04:57.909 --> 01:04:59.879
test the general relativity with what we
observed and what are the tests for

01:04:59.879 --> 01:04:59.889
observed and what are the tests for
 

01:04:59.889 --> 01:05:01.859
observed and what are the tests for
example that we had is to look at

01:05:01.859 --> 01:05:01.869
example that we had is to look at
 

01:05:01.869 --> 01:05:04.169
example that we had is to look at
different parts of the wafer can you go

01:05:04.169 --> 01:05:04.179
different parts of the wafer can you go
 

01:05:04.179 --> 01:05:06.569
different parts of the wafer can you go
back to the basically if you look at the

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:06.579
back to the basically if you look at the
 

01:05:06.579 --> 01:05:08.699
back to the basically if you look at the
the initial part is so-called in spiral

01:05:08.699 --> 01:05:08.709
the initial part is so-called in spiral
 

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:12.209
the initial part is so-called in spiral
part when you on when you see the two

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:12.219
part when you on when you see the two
 

01:05:12.219 --> 01:05:13.919
part when you on when you see the two
black holes still yeah the previous yeah

01:05:13.919 --> 01:05:13.929
black holes still yeah the previous yeah
 

01:05:13.929 --> 01:05:17.609
black holes still yeah the previous yeah
the feeder than previous one the two so

01:05:17.609 --> 01:05:17.619
the feeder than previous one the two so
 

01:05:17.619 --> 01:05:19.319
the feeder than previous one the two so
the left side of here when you see the

01:05:19.319 --> 01:05:19.329
the left side of here when you see the
 

01:05:19.329 --> 01:05:21.389
the left side of here when you see the
two black holes still separates coming

01:05:21.389 --> 01:05:21.399
two black holes still separates coming
 

01:05:21.399 --> 01:05:22.709
two black holes still separates coming
together you can use this information

01:05:22.709 --> 01:05:22.719
together you can use this information
 

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:24.390
together you can use this information
basically to

01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400
basically to
 

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.120
basically to
recover the the parameters the Blackwell

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:27.130
recover the the parameters the Blackwell
 

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.280
recover the the parameters the Blackwell
parameters for example the masses from

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:29.290
parameters for example the masses from
 

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:30.780
parameters for example the masses from
this you can predict what you expect at

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:30.790
this you can predict what you expect at
 

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:32.460
this you can predict what you expect at
the end and then separately you can

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:32.470
the end and then separately you can
 

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.440
the end and then separately you can
reconstruct what happened before from

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:34.450
reconstruct what happened before from
 

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.060
reconstruct what happened before from
the very last for the so-called ring

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:36.070
the very last for the so-called ring
 

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:37.680
the very last for the so-called ring
down Portland well Blackwell forms and

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:37.690
down Portland well Blackwell forms and
 

01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:39.360
down Portland well Blackwell forms and
it's physically losing energy

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:39.370
it's physically losing energy
 

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:41.520
it's physically losing energy
so from these two parts you can visit

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:41.530
so from these two parts you can visit
 

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.260
so from these two parts you can visit
the recover information about the two

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:43.270
the recover information about the two
 

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:45.030
the recover information about the two
black holes independently and then you

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:45.040
black holes independently and then you
 

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.350
black holes independently and then you
can compare these two measurements and

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:46.360
can compare these two measurements and
 

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.540
can compare these two measurements and
there's any sort of hair if there's any

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:48.550
there's any sort of hair if there's any
 

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:50.670
there's any sort of hair if there's any
problem with general relativity this is

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:50.680
problem with general relativity this is
 

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.160
problem with general relativity this is
one way to test the consistency this is

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:53.170
one way to test the consistency this is
 

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:55.170
one way to test the consistency this is
what we did fortunately or unfortunately

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:55.180
what we did fortunately or unfortunately
 

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.050
what we did fortunately or unfortunately
it's up to you we found no discrepancy

01:05:58.050 --> 01:05:58.060
it's up to you we found no discrepancy
 

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.030
it's up to you we found no discrepancy
from general activity so there are many

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:00.040
from general activity so there are many
 

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.620
from general activity so there are many
different tests for different

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:01.630
different tests for different
 

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:04.470
different tests for different
polarizations for extra most it's a

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480
polarizations for extra most it's a
 

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.730
polarizations for extra most it's a
little more difficult experimentally

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740
 
 

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.290
 
expect us for these that was it's

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:13.300
expect us for these that was it's
 

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.570
expect us for these that was it's
actually the sweet spot spot for the

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:15.580
actually the sweet spot spot for the
 

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:21.810
actually the sweet spot spot for the
detector expectancy range so this is

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:21.820
detector expectancy range so this is
 

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.880
detector expectancy range so this is
close to the the size the Blackwell

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:23.890
close to the the size the Blackwell
 

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:25.860
close to the the size the Blackwell
masses that we can see at the Fortis

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:25.870
masses that we can see at the Fortis
 

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:27.660
masses that we can see at the Fortis
distance so that's that's a lucky thing

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:27.670
distance so that's that's a lucky thing
 

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:29.880
distance so that's that's a lucky thing
actually for us that's what you expect

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:29.890
actually for us that's what you expect
 

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.590
actually for us that's what you expect
right you're gonna expect to see the

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:31.600
right you're gonna expect to see the
 

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.470
right you're gonna expect to see the
thing that you see the farthest um the

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480
thing that you see the farthest um the
 

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.780
thing that you see the farthest um the
question about the detector um you know

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:36.790
question about the detector um you know
 

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.250
question about the detector um you know
what configuration it was in when it

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:38.260
what configuration it was in when it
 

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.050
what configuration it was in when it
made the discovery dual recycling

01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:40.060
made the discovery dual recycling
 

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:44.720
made the discovery dual recycling
resinous I've an extraction broadband

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:44.730
 
 

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:48.180
 
what configuration detector was in when

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:48.190
what configuration detector was in when
 

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:49.910
what configuration detector was in when
we made a discovery

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920
we made a discovery
 

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.640
we made a discovery
these are getting ready for the first

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:53.650
these are getting ready for the first
 

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:57.060
these are getting ready for the first
science run operational run recorder in

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.070
science run operational run recorder in
 

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.030
science run operational run recorder in
advance I go so basically everything was

01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:00.040
advance I go so basically everything was
 

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.190
advance I go so basically everything was
ready but they were testing at that

01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200
ready but they were testing at that
 

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.730
ready but they were testing at that
point where some of the online code

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740
point where some of the online code
 

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:07.790
point where some of the online code
which would be used to send

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:07.800
which would be used to send
 

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.460
which would be used to send
for example signals we had one of the

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:10.470
for example signals we had one of the
 

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:12.800
for example signals we had one of the
online food running the first hood for

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:12.810
online food running the first hood for
 

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:15.950
online food running the first hood for
the CBC codes we only had a small mass

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960
the CBC codes we only had a small mass
 

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.410
the CBC codes we only had a small mass
code running they were waiting for the

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420
code running they were waiting for the
 

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.090
code running they were waiting for the
highness code and it was still not

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:20.100
highness code and it was still not
 

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.910
highness code and it was still not
approved it wasn't running so the first

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920
approved it wasn't running so the first
 

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.760
approved it wasn't running so the first
code detected the signal first and then

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:25.770
code detected the signal first and then
 

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.470
code detected the signal first and then
we had like two three weeks of waiting

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480
we had like two three weeks of waiting
 

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.980
we had like two three weeks of waiting
until they have the detector data at the

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:30.990
until they have the detector data at the
 

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:33.640
until they have the detector data at the
same configuration with which we froze

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:33.650
same configuration with which we froze
 

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:37.190
same configuration with which we froze
and then we had the Box opening event

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200
and then we had the Box opening event
 

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.440
and then we had the Box opening event
online with like only we're hoping for

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:39.450
online with like only we're hoping for
 

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:41.990
online with like only we're hoping for
that big spot which you can see on the

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000
that big spot which you can see on the
 

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
that big spot which you can see on the
resident right side top right side on

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.010
resident right side top right side on
 

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:45.470
resident right side top right side on
one of our figures at several of our

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480
one of our figures at several of our
 

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.980
one of our figures at several of our
figures in BC BC deep analysis so we

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:48.990
figures in BC BC deep analysis so we
 

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:51.710
figures in BC BC deep analysis so we
really froze the detector let me add one

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720
really froze the detector let me add one
 

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.330
really froze the detector let me add one
more point one thing which is very

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:53.340
more point one thing which is very
 

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.820
more point one thing which is very
important for the data analysis to have

01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:55.830
important for the data analysis to have
 

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.070
important for the data analysis to have
some sort of calibration already and we

01:07:58.070 --> 01:07:58.080
some sort of calibration already and we
 

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.720
some sort of calibration already and we
were actually doing pretty great at that

01:07:59.720 --> 01:07:59.730
were actually doing pretty great at that
 

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.060
were actually doing pretty great at that
phone we had a very good friend luminary

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:02.070
phone we had a very good friend luminary
 

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:05.720
phone we had a very good friend luminary
Commission so we understood what we are

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:05.730
Commission so we understood what we are
 

01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:08.480
Commission so we understood what we are
measuring what strain that is we had a

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:08.490
measuring what strain that is we had a
 

01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:10.100
measuring what strain that is we had a
very good understanding they were doing

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:10.110
very good understanding they were doing
 

01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:12.320
very good understanding they were doing
calibration runs quite before that time

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:12.330
calibration runs quite before that time
 

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:15.080
calibration runs quite before that time
and they beep already and it's very

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.090
and they beep already and it's very
 

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:18.710
and they beep already and it's very
important part and people really nearly

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:18.720
important part and people really nearly
 

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.630
important part and people really nearly
ready they were what they were doing is

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640
ready they were what they were doing is
 

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.970
ready they were what they were doing is
really just testing out the code so not

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980
really just testing out the code so not
 

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.829
really just testing out the code so not
much changed after we collected enough

01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839
much changed after we collected enough
 

01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:31.039
much changed after we collected enough
data which was published and we went

01:08:31.039 --> 01:08:31.049
data which was published and we went
 

01:08:31.049 --> 01:08:33.349
data which was published and we went
ahead with the rest of the science fund

01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359
ahead with the rest of the science fund
 

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.740
ahead with the rest of the science fund
the changes were totally minimal yeah I

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:36.750
the changes were totally minimal yeah I
 

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.329
the changes were totally minimal yeah I
would just add that small changes are

01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:38.339
would just add that small changes are
 

01:08:38.339 --> 01:08:40.130
would just add that small changes are
being made even though even throughout

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:40.140
being made even though even throughout
 

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.870
being made even though even throughout
science runs so it's not something

01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880
science runs so it's not something
 

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.920
science runs so it's not something
that's a hundred percent affects we

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:42.930
that's a hundred percent affects we
 

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:45.260
that's a hundred percent affects we
tweaked small things to account for

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:45.270
tweaked small things to account for
 

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:47.450
tweaked small things to account for
things we discover without really

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460
things we discover without really
 

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.640
things we discover without really
touching the details so so these kind of

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:49.650
touching the details so so these kind of
 

01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:50.720
touching the details so so these kind of
changes are completely normal

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:50.730
changes are completely normal
 

01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:53.090
changes are completely normal
even within science runs yes exactly I

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100
even within science runs yes exactly I
 

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.240
even within science runs yes exactly I
mean we can have a little seismic

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:55.250
mean we can have a little seismic
 

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:58.579
mean we can have a little seismic
problem and you know northway coming

01:08:58.579 --> 01:08:58.589
problem and you know northway coming
 

01:08:58.589 --> 01:09:00.950
problem and you know northway coming
which is a bit bigger and then something

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960
which is a bit bigger and then something
 

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.410
which is a bit bigger and then something
yet so what we have to put it back to

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420
yet so what we have to put it back to
 

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.450
yet so what we have to put it back to
lock it again we can have their windy

01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460
lock it again we can have their windy
 

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.300
lock it again we can have their windy
day so I mean configuration was the same

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:08.310
day so I mean configuration was the same
 

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:08.960
day so I mean configuration was the same
for

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:08.970
for
 

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:11.510
for
many weeks and we were looking very

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520
many weeks and we were looking very
 

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:17.000
many weeks and we were looking very
nicely most of the time we needed a long

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:17.010
nicely most of the time we needed a long
 

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:22.880
nicely most of the time we needed a long
long long stretch of data regulations on

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:22.890
long long stretch of data regulations on
 

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:26.660
long long stretch of data regulations on
the result if advanced further would

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:26.670
the result if advanced further would
 

01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:28.610
the result if advanced further would
have been running how much better would

01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620
have been running how much better would
 

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.040
have been running how much better would
the localization would have been and can

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.050
the localization would have been and can
 

01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:32.870
the localization would have been and can
you comment us on the status of or

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880
you comment us on the status of or
 

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.930
you comment us on the status of or
prospects for LIGO India yeah very good

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:35.940
prospects for LIGO India yeah very good
 

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:38.420
prospects for LIGO India yeah very good
so for advanced Virgo it's also

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:38.430
so for advanced Virgo it's also
 

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:41.870
so for advanced Virgo it's also
depending on on what stage you are in so

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880
depending on on what stage you are in so
 

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.610
depending on on what stage you are in so
if you look at how advanced Virgo will

01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620
if you look at how advanced Virgo will
 

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.850
if you look at how advanced Virgo will
advance throughout the next three or

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:46.860
advance throughout the next three or
 

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.560
advance throughout the next three or
four years while we get to design

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:48.570
four years while we get to design
 

01:09:48.570 --> 01:09:51.050
four years while we get to design
sensitivity it's gonna be again one year

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060
sensitivity it's gonna be again one year
 

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.190
sensitivity it's gonna be again one year
behind light was there's gonna be

01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:52.200
behind light was there's gonna be
 

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.570
behind light was there's gonna be
slightly less sense there so there are

01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580
slightly less sense there so there are
 

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.540
slightly less sense there so there are
aspects but if you just assume the first

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:56.550
aspects but if you just assume the first
 

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:57.920
aspects but if you just assume the first
year what what they're gonna have very

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:57.930
year what what they're gonna have very
 

01:09:57.930 --> 01:10:00.020
year what what they're gonna have very
soon there would be a huge improvement

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.030
soon there would be a huge improvement
 

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.000
soon there would be a huge improvement
so you're talking about the four factor

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:02.010
so you're talking about the four factor
 

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:03.920
so you're talking about the four factor
of ten or more it would it would make a

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:03.930
of ten or more it would it would make a
 

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:06.020
of ten or more it would it would make a
big difference to have a third detector

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:06.030
big difference to have a third detector
 

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:07.670
big difference to have a third detector
if you have four it's not an extra

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:07.680
if you have four it's not an extra
 

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.050
if you have four it's not an extra
factor of ten but it's still it's still

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060
factor of ten but it's still it's still
 

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:11.720
factor of ten but it's still it's still
meaningful again as you saw like India

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:11.730
meaningful again as you saw like India
 

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:14.030
meaningful again as you saw like India
at this point is plans so it's not under

01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040
at this point is plans so it's not under
 

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.070
at this point is plans so it's not under
construction but if it happens it's

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080
construction but if it happens it's
 

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.750
construction but if it happens it's
gonna be very nice let me add something

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760
gonna be very nice let me add something
 

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.110
gonna be very nice let me add something
about there go turning on and can we use

01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120
about there go turning on and can we use
 

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.050
about there go turning on and can we use
that yes you know it says that they said

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060
that yes you know it says that they said
 

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.750
that yes you know it says that they said
that it will not have sensitivity what

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760
that it will not have sensitivity what
 

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.980
that it will not have sensitivity what
we will have and but that's okay at the

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:30.990
we will have and but that's okay at the
 

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:32.900
we will have and but that's okay at the
beginning even at the beginning if we

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:32.910
beginning even at the beginning if we
 

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:36.050
beginning even at the beginning if we
have a few dropping signal which is huge

01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060
have a few dropping signal which is huge
 

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.610
have a few dropping signal which is huge
in like oh and they are not that that

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:37.620
in like oh and they are not that that
 

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.430
in like oh and they are not that that
sensitivity there they are likely to

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440
sensitivity there they are likely to
 

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.880
sensitivity there they are likely to
have it in there sort of very not very

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:43.890
have it in there sort of very not very
 

01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:46.520
have it in there sort of very not very
high as in our triggers and we can

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:46.530
high as in our triggers and we can
 

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:50.990
high as in our triggers and we can
definitely use their data to have a lot

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000
definitely use their data to have a lot
 

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.780
definitely use their data to have a lot
lot better on the on the direction of

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:53.790
lot better on the on the direction of
 

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:57.050
lot better on the on the direction of
the event it's gonna be really really

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060
the event it's gonna be really really
 

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.880
the event it's gonna be really really
great and we're gonna start joining us

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:58.890
great and we're gonna start joining us
 

01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:01.510
great and we're gonna start joining us
even if they are not there where we are

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520
even if they are not there where we are
 

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.460
even if they are not there where we are
the dates are really important for for

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:04.470
the dates are really important for for
 

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:07.979
the dates are really important for for
localization

01:11:07.979 --> 01:11:07.989
 
 

01:11:07.989 --> 01:11:12.780
 
I so it looks like looking back at the

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:12.790
I so it looks like looking back at the
 

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:15.479
I so it looks like looking back at the
binary black hole system itself the fits

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:15.489
binary black hole system itself the fits
 

01:11:15.489 --> 01:11:16.830
binary black hole system itself the fits
you have to the waveform are from a

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840
you have to the waveform are from a
 

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.320
you have to the waveform are from a
quasi circular orbit so are there any

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:19.330
quasi circular orbit so are there any
 

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:21.900
quasi circular orbit so are there any
limits on the SN tricity of the orbit

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:21.910
limits on the SN tricity of the orbit
 

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:24.780
limits on the SN tricity of the orbit
which I'm sorry which so of the binary

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:24.790
which I'm sorry which so of the binary
 

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:26.670
which I'm sorry which so of the binary
black hole orbit are there any limits

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:26.680
black hole orbit are there any limits
 

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.350
black hole orbit are there any limits
and what the Essen tricity of that well

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360
and what the Essen tricity of that well
 

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.810
and what the Essen tricity of that well
again that's an ambiguity right so it's

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:30.820
again that's an ambiguity right so it's
 

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.490
again that's an ambiguity right so it's
yes works decoupled so sorry what was

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:32.500
yes works decoupled so sorry what was
 

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.650
yes works decoupled so sorry what was
the under question whether we have

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:34.660
the under question whether we have
 

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:38.070
the under question whether we have
whether we test the like what the

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080
whether we test the like what the
 

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.979
whether we test the like what the
inclination is no I just wondered it

01:11:40.979 --> 01:11:40.989
inclination is no I just wondered it
 

01:11:40.989 --> 01:11:43.140
inclination is no I just wondered it
that's a orbital parameter of the system

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.150
that's a orbital parameter of the system
 

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:44.700
that's a orbital parameter of the system
the a centricity of the orbit and in

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:44.710
the a centricity of the orbit and in
 

01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:46.110
the a centricity of the orbit and in
spiral I just wondered if there's a

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120
spiral I just wondered if there's a
 

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.430
spiral I just wondered if there's a
limit on that cuz I don't see anything

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440
limit on that cuz I don't see anything
 

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.650
limit on that cuz I don't see anything
in there yeah if there was a limit on

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:49.660
in there yeah if there was a limit on
 

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.440
in there yeah if there was a limit on
the inclination right can you go to the

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:52.450
the inclination right can you go to the
 

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:55.290
the inclination right can you go to the
inclination there is a limit it's it's

01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:55.300
inclination there is a limit it's it's
 

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.030
inclination there is a limit it's it's
it's really hard to be couple that from

01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040
it's really hard to be couple that from
 

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.310
it's really hard to be couple that from
the distance right so the two are and

01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320
the distance right so the two are and
 

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.900
the distance right so the two are and
they give to the largest I'm not even a

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:00.910
they give to the largest I'm not even a
 

01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:03.030
they give to the largest I'm not even a
hundred percent no no each one just go

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040
hundred percent no no each one just go
 

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:10.040
hundred percent no no each one just go
forward no the one that's a clinician

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:10.050
 
 

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:17.810
 
degenerate as the previous one yeah

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820
degenerate as the previous one yeah
 

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.640
degenerate as the previous one yeah
thank you right orientation right so

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:20.650
thank you right orientation right so
 

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:22.920
thank you right orientation right so
it's a parameter but it's extremely hard

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:22.930
it's a parameter but it's extremely hard
 

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:24.240
it's a parameter but it's extremely hard
to be a couple that from the distance

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:24.250
to be a couple that from the distance
 

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:29.030
to be a couple that from the distance
okay so the two can have overlapping

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040
okay so the two can have overlapping
 

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:38.520
okay so the two can have overlapping
circulation of the orbit okay maybe

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:38.530
circulation of the orbit okay maybe
 

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:40.110
circulation of the orbit okay maybe
doesn't have a separate sorry okay

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120
doesn't have a separate sorry okay
 

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:40.920
doesn't have a separate sorry okay
misunderstood your question

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:40.930
misunderstood your question
 

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:42.620
misunderstood your question
we do have a limit on eccentricity yes

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:42.630
we do have a limit on eccentricity yes
 

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:45.510
we do have a limit on eccentricity yes
apparently it's like 0.1 or something

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520
apparently it's like 0.1 or something
 

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.700
apparently it's like 0.1 or something
it's a fairly strict limit so we know

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:47.710
it's a fairly strict limit so we know
 

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:50.580
it's a fairly strict limit so we know
it's not it was not a dynamical dynamic

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:50.590
it's not it was not a dynamical dynamic
 

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:53.850
it's not it was not a dynamical dynamic
so in that sense it's on it's a fairly

01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:53.860
so in that sense it's on it's a fairly
 

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.590
so in that sense it's on it's a fairly
good limit so it looks like it was a

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600
good limit so it looks like it was a
 

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.840
good limit so it looks like it was a
binary there for a long time yeah so

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:57.850
binary there for a long time yeah so
 

01:12:57.850 --> 01:12:59.190
binary there for a long time yeah so
that's definitely a parameter that's

01:12:59.190 --> 01:12:59.200
that's definitely a parameter that's
 

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.870
that's definitely a parameter that's
what we're looking for and again if

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880
what we're looking for and again if
 

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.330
what we're looking for and again if
there was a nest reduced even it would

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:03.340
there was a nest reduced even it would
 

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.740
there was a nest reduced even it would
be even more interesting unfortunately

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:04.750
be even more interesting unfortunately
 

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:05.910
be even more interesting unfortunately
so if there was a very highest in her

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920
so if there was a very highest in her
 

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.650
so if there was a very highest in her
City would it be would you be detecting

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:07.660
City would it be would you be detecting
 

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.360
City would it be would you be detecting
these systems that so we look for us to

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:09.370
these systems that so we look for us to
 

01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:11.280
these systems that so we look for us to
just be very important again that's one

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:11.290
just be very important again that's one
 

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:13.670
just be very important again that's one
of the differentiators between different

01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:13.680
of the differentiators between different
 

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.720
of the differentiators between different
evolutionary models so it's very

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:15.730
evolutionary models so it's very
 

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.760
evolutionary models so it's very
important for us to see that again many

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:17.770
important for us to see that again many
 

01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:20.370
important for us to see that again many
of us origin in dynamic

01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:20.380
of us origin in dynamic
 

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.680
of us origin in dynamic
mergers in different places so we would

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:22.690
mergers in different places so we would
 

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.500
mergers in different places so we would
be very happy with mr. Justine not this

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:25.510
be very happy with mr. Justine not this
 

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:42.360
be very happy with mr. Justine not this
time yeah yeah definitely so yeah yeah

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:42.370
time yeah yeah definitely so yeah yeah
 

01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:44.910
time yeah yeah definitely so yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah sure code by diverse

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920
yeah yeah yeah sure code by diverse
 

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:51.300

searching oh yeah huge yeah so for this

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:51.310
searching oh yeah huge yeah so for this
 

01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:52.680
searching oh yeah huge yeah so for this
specific scene that wouldn't matter if

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:52.690
specific scene that wouldn't matter if
 

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:54.750
specific scene that wouldn't matter if
it's not a too big exid really wouldn't

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760
it's not a too big exid really wouldn't
 

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.600
it's not a too big exid really wouldn't
matter um but we detect those things as

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:57.610
matter um but we detect those things as
 

01:13:57.610 --> 01:14:00.270
matter um but we detect those things as
well so long in this sense it's not an

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.280
well so long in this sense it's not an
 

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.820
well so long in this sense it's not an
issue of course if you have a mash

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:02.830
issue of course if you have a mash
 

01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:04.350
issue of course if you have a mash
filter that does not incorporate that in

01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360
filter that does not incorporate that in
 

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.689
filter that does not incorporate that in
the search but your sensitivity is

01:14:06.689 --> 01:14:06.699
the search but your sensitivity is
 

01:14:06.699 --> 01:14:09.000
the search but your sensitivity is
slightly less but it's not an issue we

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.010
slightly less but it's not an issue we
 

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:11.100
slightly less but it's not an issue we
would see those as well and again for

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:11.110
would see those as well and again for
 

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:12.990
would see those as well and again for
these things you can actually limit the

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000
these things you can actually limit the
 

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.840
these things you can actually limit the
eccentricity and maybe that to the fact

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:18.850
eccentricity and maybe that to the fact
 

01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:23.700
eccentricity and maybe that to the fact
sheet I guess I thought it funny yeah

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:23.710
sheet I guess I thought it funny yeah
 

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:26.310
sheet I guess I thought it funny yeah
somehow God wasn't there guess no more

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320
somehow God wasn't there guess no more
 

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.330
somehow God wasn't there guess no more
space okay well thank you very much guys

01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:30.340
space okay well thank you very much guys
 

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:55.169

go we made this bat urine half ago right

01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800
go we made this bat urine half ago right
 

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.810
go we made this bat urine half ago right
in the summer so thank you I'm so

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:04.820
in the summer so thank you I'm so
 

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.910
in the summer so thank you I'm so
delighted that I won the bad but I'm

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920
delighted that I won the bad but I'm
 

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.690
delighted that I won the bad but I'm
organized it about watch coming
