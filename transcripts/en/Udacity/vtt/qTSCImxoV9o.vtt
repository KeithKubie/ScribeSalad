Here's another problem with evaluating expressions. Notice that the y is an

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:08.016
exponent here, and then, you'd have multiplication between the 3, the x, and the

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:12.047
y squared, and the z. X, X is going to be equal to negative 2, y is going to be

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.224
equal to 2, and z is going to be equal to negative 3. All right.

00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:18.504
Good luck with this problem and you can portray the answer here.
