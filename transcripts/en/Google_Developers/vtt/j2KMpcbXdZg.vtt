[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN: On the
board is one point.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.330
In the hole is three.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.600
All right, I'm sitting here with
two gentlemen from the Android

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.350
Studio team.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.840
We've got Jamal and James.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.270
Jamal, would you start by
telling us all the latest stuff

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910
going on in Android Studio?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.910
JAMAL EASON: Absolutely.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.280
So I'm really excited about
a couple of new features.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.030
First of all, as you
heard at the keynote,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.340
we launched the
bundling in of Kotlin,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.130
which is a brand new
language that enables

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.800
you to develop apps on Android.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.110
The second cool feature is
around performance tools.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.610
We launched a whole
new set of tools

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.820
around CPU performance,
memory performance,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.951
and network performance.

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:44.700
So I'm really excited
about those as well.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.890
And thirdly, we added
the Google Play Store

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.479
to the Android
emulator that allows

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.770
you to have end-to-end testing.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010
So you can test out things
like in-app purchasing

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.930
or the download experience
and have updated Google Play

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.590
services.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.886
So these are the cool things
I'm looking forward to.

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:58.886
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.802
And I assume you've been
talking to developers

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:02.280
around the festival today.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.694
What's the reaction so far?

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:05.069
JAMAL EASON: Yeah,
the developers

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.361
are super excited about Kotlin.

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:08.319
The thing about Kotlin
is that it's been around

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:09.780
for about five or six years.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.370
And a lot of developers
have been actually using it

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.030
for Android.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.446
So they're really excited to
hear an official announcement

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:17.150
and endorsement from
Google about using it.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, we took a
look at the profiler earlier.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.340
And it's really exciting
to see that ability

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.610
of that level of debugging
live while the app is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.810
running on the simulator.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.435
What are some of the
cool things you've

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.460
been able to discover as you've
been testing that feature?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.600
JAMAL EASON: Yeah, I think
one of the cool things

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.130
is that a lot of
developers didn't realize

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.470
is that their app is using
a lot of background data,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.500
or a lot of active data.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.310
So having a visualization to
see what the traffic looks like

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.524
coming in and out and
understanding what's the packet

00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:45.690
size-- what's the latency
of those various packets--

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.065
to have a better understanding
of how to utilize network.

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:50.273
Because what we find is
actually turning on the radio

00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:51.910
is actually impacting
battery life.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.210
So having a better
performing networking stack

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.390
actually affects
better battery life.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.200
And James, what's
going on in your world?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.760
JAMES LAU: Well, with
Android Studio 3.0,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.540
we are also making
available for the first time

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.090
the tooling for Instant Apps.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.710
So we're really
excited about that

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.140
because as you've
heard in the keynote,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.790
Instant Apps is now GA.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.610
And any developer can now
go build in Instant App

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.430
and publish it on Play Store.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And the tooling
that you built into Android

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.371
Studio makes it really easy
for developers to get up

00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:27.870
and running with either a new
app or an existing app, right?

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.550
Can you tell me more about that?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.800
JAMES LAU: Yeah, that's right.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.880
If you have an existing
app with build tooling--

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.186
actually, we'll start by
talking about the build system.

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:37.810
From the ground up
in the build system,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.070
we've introduced a new
type of module, called

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.055
Feature Module to, allow you to
share code between your Instant

00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:45.450
App and your regular app.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.780
So that's sort of a key
foundation piece for you

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.240
to start refactoring
your existing app

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.980
and to build your Instant App.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.880
And then if you're building
a brand new application,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.930
we've also modified and enhanced
the built-in templates for you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.651
to easily include
Instant App support.

00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:04.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.356
So I'd like to ask a
general question, if I may.

00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:08.730
Android Studio's
been out awhile,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.064
but it hasn't been out forever.

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:13.230
But I think the advantages
that it gives the Android

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.435
developers are huge.

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:15.810
What are some of
the cool stories

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.894
you've heard since Android
Studio has been available?

00:03:18.894 --> 00:03:21.310
JAMAL EASON: Well, Android
Studio has been out for-- well,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.500
actually, version 3.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.954
We announced that today.

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:25.620
One thing we actually
launched last year

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.720
was the lay editor and
the new constraint layout.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.170
And a lot of developers really
loved [INAUDIBLE] XML files.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.720
And we introduced this--
we showed the new tool.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.970
And it took him about 15
minutes to do it the old way.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.795
And when we showed
him the new tool

00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:39.030
that we launched last year at
I/O, it took him five minutes.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.780
He was amazed.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.410
He's like, I
couldn't believe it.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.800
So we're really looking forward
to making developers more

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.410
efficient and developing apps.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.410
And this is some of the
things we're been doing.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.528
Have you heard any cool
stories from developers

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:51.957
around Android Studio?

00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:53.040
JAMES LAU: Yeah, actually.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.860
One of the cool things that
I've heard is in version 2.3,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.520
I think it was, when we
introduced the APK analyzer,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.800
we've heard stories
where developers,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.050
when they start using
the APK analyzer,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.720
they realize that they've
been bundling all these SO

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.400
files for different
architectures

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.110
that they really shouldn't be.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.810
So as a result, they were
able to reduce significantly,

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.440
their APK sizes, speeding up
download speed for their users,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.700
and just enhancing
performance in general.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.116
All right, guys,
is there anything

00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:26.400
else you want to tell
developers before we get going?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.215
JAMAL EASON: Download Android
Studio 3.0 and try it out.

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:30.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.360
Thanks, y'all.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.010
