00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.880
Guys, we are out here in the backyard

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.620
with our mega solar scorcher
on this beautiful sunny, warm day.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.410
And we want to find out
if we can use this solar scorcher

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.020
to cook a steak.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.180
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
[Music]

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.620
[Music]

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.020
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.900
We're going to try cooking the steak
in this pan in two different methods.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
The first will involve finding a spot

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.820
where the solar scorcher is hot
but not perfectly concentrated.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.860
So it will heat the whole steak at once.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.740
The second method will involve using
the solar scorcher to heat up the pan itself.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.620
And then using that
pans heat to cook the steak.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.120
Just to help out with the flavor,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.300
we've got a little bit of salt
and a little bit of butter.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.516
We'll start with this smaller
piece of steak in the pan,

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:45.400
and we need to find a point
of focus to our solar scorcher

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.460
where there is a lot of heat
but it's not so concentrated,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.960
that it's just going to burn the meat.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.280
To do that, I have an
instant-read thermometer,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.000
and I'm going to try
to hold this in the beam,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.380
and see if I can find a place

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.200
where it's putting out about
200 degrees Fahrenheit of heat.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.120
At the moment, the focal point is so hot

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.600
that it's actually melting
the paver stones down there.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380
And I don't want to cook
our steak on that high of a temperature.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.840
So let's find out
if there's a spot in the beam,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.460
where it registers on
the thermometer as being hot,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.340
but not so hot that
it's just going to burn things.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.200
I think that's leveling off.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.120
Right about there.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.220
So that's the height

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
that I need to get the steak and
the pan to get a nice even cook.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:39.740
[Music]

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.400
I think we're perfect right about there.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.120
It'll keep climbing just a little bit,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.540
but our pan is also
going to be a little bit higher,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.540
and then the steak is over an inch thick.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.960
That should raise it up.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.300
And mostly, I think
this is going to work out great.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.800
[Music]

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.680
Now, let's put this
into our focused beam of sunlight,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.259
and hope the temperature
of the steak slowly starts rising.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.709
It's not going to go very quickly.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.180
It'll probably take at least 10 minutes,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.760
may be considerably more,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.640
to get up to the temperature
we're going to be looking for,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.500
which is going to be
about 130 Fahrenheit.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:33.360
[Music]

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.760
It's interesting that our oven thermometer

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.400
says that it's about
150 degrees Fahrenheit where it is,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.780
but our instant thermometer
was telling us that it was over 200.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.879
I'm not sure which of our
pieces of equipment is incorrect.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.140
I think the oven thermometer
is just on the very edge of the light

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.600
and so it's not heating up quite as much
as the instant-read thermometer was.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.640
I prefer a steak that's
cooked just under medium.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.640
So I'm shooting for an internal 
temperature of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.900
And then it will finish off
cooking just a little bit more

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.960
as I try and sear the top and bottom.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.590
[Music]

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.060
I'm getting about
a 140 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.680
read anywhere I put that thermometer.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.120
So I think it's time
to start concentrating this beam,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.040
and see if we can get
a sear on the outside of this steak.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.340
To do that, we're going to have
to drop our pan a little bit lower.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.900
[Music]

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.200
That wood is now
burning almost instantly.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.560
So I think we've got a good
concentrated bit of sunlight there.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.560
Just have to keep this moving around.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.780
About when we want to
start adding some butter.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:47.100
[Music]

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.980
I think we still need to go lower,
to really get into that focal point of that beam.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.020
[Music]

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.040
There we go.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.980
That's the sizzle I'm hoping for.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:07.460
[Music]

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.980
Okay, I think this side is done.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.140
Let's try and flip it over.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.240
Give the other side a turn.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:28.400
[Music]

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.580
That's a steak.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.160
Question is,
is it a correctly cooked steak?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.340
[Music]

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.760
Oh, overcooked.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.120
[Music]

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.960
Well it appears that I have cooked
this steak a little bit more than is ideal.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.360
I like it to be a little bit
more pink in the center,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.260
but that doesn't mean
it's not going to taste good.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.800
[Music]

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.720
That is good.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.120
That's really good.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.020
Its very hot.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.740
It's a good steak.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.475
For the second part of the steak,

00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:06.060
we're going to try heating up
the pan directly in the sunlight,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.280
and then dropping
the steak into the hot pan

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.940
and see if that gives us
any better of a sear.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.460
Start out with just a
little bit of butter in there.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.520
We can see from the butter,
the pan is nice and hot.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.920
Which is what you want for steak.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.640
[Music]

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.520
Pretty good sizzling sound.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.280
I'm not sure if the pan
was as hot as I was hoping for.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:44.240
[Music]

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.540
Well we now have the focal
point on one part of the pan,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.880
which is supposed
to heat up the rest of the pan,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.360
but it doesn't look like it's getting
evenly heated all the way through.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.060
Looks like there's just one
little spot where the butter is sizzling,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.540
and the rest not so much.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.480
The inside of our steak is still
showing about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.220
I'm also concerned
because one side of our steak

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.740
looks like it's getting a lot of heat,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.940
and the other side looks like
it's just staying completely raw.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.940
[Music]

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.060
We've got a burn spot near
where the sun was hitting the pan,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.000
and now we're getting smoking,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.540
which means we're
approaching the flashpoint of the oil.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.160
And I do not want to start
a grease fire around the steak.

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.620
I'm afraid this method
just isn't going to work.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.120
So I think I'm going to try
going back to the first method of

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.780
heating the whole pan and steak at once,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.100
and see if we can get a slightly
better cook job than the last time.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:56.800
[Music]

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.340
Man, that is really good.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.900
[Music]

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.060
Confirmed:
you can cook a steak with sunlight.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.300
[Music]

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.120
Yeah video's over.
I'm just gonna eat steak now.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.960
This is gonna be the whole next video.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.600
Is just me eating steak.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.020
Guys, the fun doesn't have to end.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.540
There's still more for you to see.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.620
That little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.620
Go check it out.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.360
The box in the bottom
will show you what YouTube

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.780
think you should be watching next.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.540
And if you hit this
bomb here in the middle,
