00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.430
Mmmmm...bacon! Few of us can resist its temptation.
I mean, did you know that 43% of Canadians

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.180
would choose bacon over sex? At least that’s
what a 2010 survey found. Or did you know

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.630
that is was included in the first meal ever
consumed on the moon by Neil Armstrong and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.789
Buzz Aldrin?

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.310
This single strip of bacon alone is 43 calories.
In perspective, here is the same amount of

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.529
calories in apples and broccoli. It’s easy
to see which might fill you up more easily...but

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.879
then again, who just eats one piece of bacon?
Looking at this another way, 100 grams of

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:43.949
apple is around 50 calories, while 100 grams
of bacon is around...550 calories. 68% of

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.460
these calories come from fat, with almost
half being saturated.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.559
So it may...or maybe not surprise you that
the average American consumes nearly 18lbs

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.369
or 8 kg every year! That’s 44,000 calories
every year, making sliced bacon a 4 billion

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:05.570
dollar industry in the US alone.
Even 65% of Americans said they would support

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.890
bacon as their national food.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.620
But different countries around the world actually
use different cuts of a pig for bacon. For

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.860
example, Canadian Bacon is from the loin,
the British use shoulder and ham bacon, and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.140
Americans make belly bacon. Overall, around
11% of a pigs standard weight can be used

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.090
for bacon.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.880
So why are we so obsessed? Well when bacon
is heated, the fats melt and the sugars and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.170
amino acids have a very unique chemical reaction.
This specific reaction releases a medley of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.390
around 150 volatile organic compounds from
the bacon which float through the air and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.730
create the amazing smell, ultimately stimulating
your mouth-watering response. So it’s not

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.710
just the snack you desire, but the smell itself
is a perfect example of chemistry at work,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.710
stimulating your brain and body.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.040
Our modern culture loves bacon so much that
‘bacon mania’ is a classified movement!

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.700
From bacon toothpaste, to bacon air fresheners,
and even...bacon condoms, some people can’t

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.810
get enough of it!

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.900
But bacon isn’t all good. Not only are 4
strips of cooked bacon worth nearly half your

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.699
recommended daily intake for salt, but most
bacon - and other things like lunch meats

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:17.370
- are treating with a chemical called sodium
nitrite. This keeps the meat looking red and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.459
fresh, instead of turning its natural grey,
but has also been implicated in a lot of health

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.930
concerns. These nitrites react with amino
acids during cooking, forming nitrosamines,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.329
which are known carcinogens, increasing your
risk of developing cancer. A diet high in

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.639
sodium nitrites may also lead to a decrease
in your body’s ability to transport oxygen

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.540
properly in your red blood cells. On the other
hand, nitrites help to prevent bacterial growth

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.249
that can cause botulism.

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:47.489
Bottom line is, when you do pig out, keep
it in moderation - and a few antioxidant rich

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.730
fruits and vegetables to go along with it
won’t hurt either!

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.519

Special thanks to audible for supporting this
episode and giving you a free audiobook at

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.299
audible.com/asap. This week we wanted to recommend
the book ‘The Dorito Effect’ by Mark Schatzker,

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.389
because we’ll take any chance we can get
to read about science and chips at the same

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.579
time. But seriously, it’s an interesting
look at the link between nutrition and flavour

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.779
and how we’ve modified foods through the
years. You can get a free copy at audible.com/asap

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.139
or any others of your choice from a massive
selection!

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:27.459
