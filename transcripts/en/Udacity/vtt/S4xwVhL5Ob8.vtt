00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I think the best answer is is that we're doing system or validation testing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That is to say we're testing the whole system as a unit,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we're trying it on some small subset of our users

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to try to validate the fact that the changes we've made

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
are good and that they work and they're not going to cause any sort of major problems

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
when we roll it out for the entire user base.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're not doing random testing because there's no random element here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're not doing differential testing because we don't 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
have multiple implementations of anything.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We have a single system that we're looking at.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We're not doing integration testing because the character of the testing 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that we're doing here does not have the flavor of putting 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
multiple modules together that haven't been tested together previously.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Rather, we're rolling something out and seeing what happens.
