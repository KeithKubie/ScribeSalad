00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.342
Okay, so I've written down
a sort of flow chart here.

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:04.257
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:04.257 --> 00:00:06.084
&gt;&gt; An alternative for King Solomon,

00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:09.612
that I'm going to claim better than
what King Solomon actually did

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:12.810
in the story which is threaten
to cut the baby in half.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.805
&gt;&gt; It's certainly more complicated and
sort of.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:16.535
&gt;&gt; Well, you think it is but
maybe it's not.

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:18.040
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to read all this to you

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.490
and we'll just kind of go through it and
you'll see if you understand.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.790
Now, remember we're starting out
under the assumption that the value

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.140
of the baby to the real mother
is bigger than the value of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.130
the baby to the fake mother.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, now here's step 0.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.380
&gt;&gt; And again value here is
like willingness to pay.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.950
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.590
&gt;&gt; But we're just going to go with that.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going to go with that.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.670
So here's step 0.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.660
King Solomon is going to choose a fine.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We'll call it F.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.570
That's greater than 0 but
meant to be small.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180
Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, you know something like a dollar.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.230
Now what I mean by small?

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.940
I don't just mean something like
a dollar, I mean F needs to be

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.605
greater than zero, so there needs
to be some cost to this fine.

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:56.210
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; But it should be smaller than either

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.990
of the values v real or v fake.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.705
Okay so B real bigger than
be fake bigger than F.

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:03.539
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.569
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right, so

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.970
King Solomon picks the [INAUDIBLE] and
by the way tells the two women this

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.890
entire process that I'm I'm going
to another this is a surprise.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.329
They both know this is what they're
going to have to go through.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.080
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.590
&gt;&gt; So King Solomon pick some value F.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.680
Then in step one King Solomon
asks A is this your child?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.970
If they says no then B gets
the child if A says yes

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.410
then King Solomon then turns to B and
says Is this your child?

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.390
If B says no then a gets the child
if B says yes, then King Solomon.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.220
&gt;&gt; So somebody lying at that point
someone is lying King Solomon's not

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.010
having any of it and
tells a that a will pay F.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.751
&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:39.280
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.515
&gt;&gt; And then, requires that
be an ounce of the value v.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:46.156
Some number V that is
greater than F okay.

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:47.515
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Then the next step

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.930
King Solomon turns back to A and
he says.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.416
[LAUGH] How about now?

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:52.735
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
How about now?

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:53.825
Is this your child?

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:59.697
And if A says no it's not my child then
B gets the baby, but has to pay $V.

00:01:59.697 --> 00:02:01.655
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:05.400
&gt;&gt; If A says yes then
a gets to keep the baby.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.090
A have to pay V, and B has to pay F.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.759
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to claim

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.340
that this is better and then claim
here and then cut the baby in half.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.280
&gt;&gt; At least in the listening
true preferences.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.910
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.750
That make sense.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.030
&gt;&gt; It's intriguing.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.680
&gt;&gt; Well, so.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.500
&gt;&gt; I mean this still feels,
this feels weirdly asymmetrical.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.610
&gt;&gt; Well, it is in some sense

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.710
asymmetrical
&gt;&gt; But

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.880
that's because there are underlying
values are asymmetrical.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.570
&gt;&gt; No,
I mean the end of the day either A or

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.090
B got the baby with no fines
if somebody fessed up early.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.330
If they make it past the you
guys are arguing stage

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.430
three then one possibility
is a pays A fine.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.630
And B pays V and gets the baby the other
possibility is that A pays the fine.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.800
And A pays V, and
A gets the baby, and B pays F.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.100
&gt;&gt; Now after King Solomon tells
A they're going to pay the fine.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.230
If we get down to here,
A instead pays V and B pays F.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.280
So A doesn't pay F+V.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.805
One of them is going to pay half and
one of them's going to pay.

00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:09.020
&gt;&gt; Okay,k that feels more
symmetrical in short.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.020
Okay, good.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.920
Okay, so

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.940
how would you convince yourself of the
veracity of what I'm suggesting, that

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.060
this will do a better job of eliciting
true preferences of the mothers?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.240
&gt;&gt; I guess I would think through
what the different, I don't know,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.150
like, ways the game
can play out might be.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.650
So we're going to go
under the assumption so.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.480
Let's see one of these mothers is
really one of these mothers is fake.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.250
So I mean I suppose it's
possible that they're both fake.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.160
&gt;&gt; Let's not go.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's let's not go that's not
that's not allowed one of them is real

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.170
one of them is fake because this is King
Solomon and King and Knight shone like.
