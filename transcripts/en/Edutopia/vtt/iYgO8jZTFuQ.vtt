00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:12.766
&gt;&gt;We have schools because
we hope that someday

00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:15.346
when children have left schools
that they will still be able

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:17.326
to use what it is that
they've learned.

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:22.326
And there is now a massive amount of
evidence from all realms of science

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.996
that unless individuals take a
very active role in what it is

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:29.496
that they're studying, unless
they learn to ask questions,

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:33.636
to do things hands-on, to essentially
recreate things in their own mind

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:38.226
and then transform them as is
needed, the ideas just disappear.

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:40.436
The student may have a
good grade on the exam.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:42.756
We may think that he or
she is learning, but a year

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:45.776
or two later there's nothing left.

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:48.226
If, on the other hand, somebody has
carried out an experiment himself

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:52.706
or herself, analyzed the data, made
a prediction and saw whether it came

00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:55.266
out correctly; if somebody
is doing history

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.186
and actually does some interviewing
himself or herself, oral histories,

00:00:58.496 --> 00:01:00.216
then reads the documents,
listens to it,

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:03.056
go back and asks further
questions, writes up a paper--

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.896
that's the kind of thing
that's going to adhere,

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.786
where if you simply memorize a
bunch of names and a bunch of facts

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:10.746
and a bunch of-- even
a bunch of definitions,

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:12.126
there's nothing to hold onto.

00:01:13.276 --> 00:01:15.936
The idea of multiple intelligences
comes out of psychology.

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:20.976
It's a theory that was
developed to document the fact

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:24.216
that human beings have very different
kinds of intellectual strengths

00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:29.056
and that these strengths are very,
very important in how kids learn

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:32.426
and how people represent
things in their minds,

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.186
and then how people use them in order

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:36.116
to show what it is that
they've understood.

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:40.646
If we all had exactly the same kind
of mind and there was only one kind

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:43.306
of intelligence, then we could
teach everybody the same thing

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.726
in the same way and assess them in
the same way, and that would be fair.

00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:49.856
But once we realize that people
have very different kinds of minds,

00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:50.926
different kinds of strengths--

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.716
some people are good in thinking
spatially, some people are good

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:57.756
in thinking language, other people
are very logical, other people need

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.346
to do hands-on; they need
to actually explore actively

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:04.566
and to try things out-- once
we realize that, then education

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:08.026
which treats everybody the same way
is actually the most unfair education

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:09.976
because it picks out
one kind of mind,

00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:13.006
which I call the Law Professor
Mind, somebody who's very linguistic

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.116
and logical, and says, "If
you think like that, great.

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:17.856
If you don't think like that, there's
no room in the train for you."

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:22.096
If we know that one child
has a very spatial--

00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:25.896
a visual or spatial way of learning,
another child has a very hands-on way

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:29.636
of learning, a third child likes to
ask deep philosophical questions,

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:31.186
a fourth child likes stories,

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:33.116
we don't have to talk
very fast as a teacher.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:37.496
We can actually provide software,
we can provide materials,

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:41.666
we can provide resources which
present material to a child in a way

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:44.086
in which the child will find
interesting and will be able

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:48.716
to use his or her intelligences
productivity, and to the extent

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:52.096
that the technology is interactive,
the child will actually be able

00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:56.786
to show his or her understanding in a
way that's comfortable to the child.

00:02:57.286 --> 00:02:59.936
We have this myth that the only
way to learn something is read it

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:02.756
in a textbook or hear a lecture
on it, and the only way to show

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.686
that we've understood something
is to take a short-answer test

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.756
or maybe occasionally with
an essay question thrown in.

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:08.646
But that's nonsense.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:11.406
Everything can be taught
in more than one way,

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.676
and anything that's understood
can be shown in more than one way.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.026
I don't believe because there
are eight intelligences we have

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:18.226
to teach things eight ways.

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:18.976
I think that's silly.

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:21.286
But we always ought to
be asking to ourselves,

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:23.146
"Are we reaching every
child, and if not,

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:25.126
are there other ways
in which we can do it?"

00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:29.766
I think that we teach
way too many subjects

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:34.286
and we cover way too much
material, and the end result is

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:36.846
that students have a very
superficial knowledge--

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:40.566
as we often say, a mile
wide and an inch deep--

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:43.776
and then once they leave school,
almost everything's been forgotten.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:48.666
And I think that school needs to
change to have a few priorities

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:51.976
and to really go into those
priorities very deeply.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:53.926
So let's take the area of science.

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.836
I actually don't care if a child
studies physics or biology or geology

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:00.816
or astronomy before
he goes to college.

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:03.196
There's plenty of time to do
that kind of detailed work.

00:04:03.686 --> 00:04:05.626
I think what's really
important is to begin to learn

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:09.886
to think scientifically, to
understand what a hypothesis is,

00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:13.176
how to test it out and see
whether it's working or not;

00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:16.056
if it's not working, how to
revise your theory about things.

00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:17.246
That takes time.

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:21.376
There's no way you can present that
in a week or indeed even in a month.

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:25.166
You have to learn about it from doing
many different kinds of experiments,

00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:28.296
seeing when the results are
like what you predicted,

00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:30.006
seeing when they're
different, and so on.

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:35.786
But if you really focus on science in
that kind of way, by the time you go

00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:37.946
to college-- or, if you don't go
to college, by the time you go

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:40.156
to workplace-- you'll know the
difference between a statement

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:42.676
which is simply a matter
of opinion or prejudice,

00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:45.776
and one for which there's
solid evidence.

00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:49.426
The most important thing about
assessment is knowing what it is

00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:51.116
that you should be able to do.

00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:54.896
And the best way for me to think
about it is a child learning a sport

00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:57.506
or a child learning an
art form, because they're

00:04:57.506 --> 00:05:00.146
as completely un-mysterious-- what
you have to be to be a quarterback

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:02.186
or a figure skater
or a violin player.

00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:04.526
You see it, you try it
out, you're coached.

00:05:04.796 --> 00:05:05.806
You know when you're getting better.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.126
You know how you're doing
compared to other kids.

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:11.006
In school, assessment is mystifying.

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:12.936
Nobody knows what's
going to be on the test,

00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:14.946
and when the test results go back,

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:16.936
neither the teacher nor the
student knows what to do.

00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:21.706
So what I favor is highlighting
for kids from the day they walk

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:25.066
into school what are the performances
and what are the exhibitions

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:26.586
for which they're going
to be accountable.

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:28.806
Let's get real.

00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:32.146
Let's look at the kinds of things
that we really value in the world.

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:33.996
Let's be as explicit as we can.

00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:37.386
Let's provide feedback to kids
from as early as possible,

00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:39.196
and then let them internalize
the feedback

00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:42.966
so they themselves can say what's
going well, what's not going so well.

00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:46.496
I'm a writer, and initially I had to
have a lot of feedback from editors,

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:47.716
including a lot of rejections.

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:51.196
But over time, I learned what was
important, I learned to edit myself,

00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:54.556
and now the feedback from
editors is much less necessary.

00:05:54.556 --> 00:05:57.556
And I think anybody as an adult knows
that as you get to be more expert

00:05:57.556 --> 00:06:00.616
in things you don't have to do
so much external critiquing;

00:06:00.776 --> 00:06:02.786
you can do what we
call self-assessment.

00:06:03.086 --> 00:06:06.016
And in school, assessment shouldn't
be something that's done to you.

00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:08.576
It should be something where
you are the most active agent.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:13.886
I think for there to be longstanding
change in American education--

00:06:14.366 --> 00:06:18.176
that is widespread rather
than just on the margins--

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:21.126
first of all people have to see
examples of places which are

00:06:21.126 --> 00:06:25.546
like their own places where the
new kind of education really works,

00:06:26.246 --> 00:06:29.926
where students are learning deeply,

00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:32.736
where they can exhibit
their knowledge publicly,

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:34.916
and where everybody who
looks at the kids says,

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:36.506
"That's the kind of
kids I want to have."

00:06:36.506 --> 00:06:38.756
So we need to have
enough good examples.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:42.576
Second of all, we need to have
the individuals who are involved

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:46.456
in education, primarily teachers
and administrators, believe in this,

00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:50.326
really want to do it, and get the
kind of help that they need in order

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.776
to be able to switch, so to
speak, from a teacher-centered,

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:57.416
"Let's stuff it into the
kid's mind" kind of education,

00:06:57.636 --> 00:07:00.116
to one where the preparation
is behind the scenes

00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:03.566
and the child himself or herself
is at the center of learning.

00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:07.756
Third of all, I think we need
to have assessment schemes

00:07:07.986 --> 00:07:11.216
which really convince everybody that
this kind of education is working.

00:07:11.216 --> 00:07:13.236
It does no good to have
child-centered learning

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.556
and then have the same
old multiple choice tests

00:07:15.556 --> 00:07:17.736
which were used 50 or 100 years ago.

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:23.366
Finally, I think there has to be
a political commitment which says

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:27.016
that this is the kind of education
which we want to have in our country,

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:29.886
and maybe outside this country,
for the foreseeable future.

00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:34.966
And as long as people are busy
bashing teachers or saying

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:37.506
that we can't try anything
new because it might fail,

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:41.066
then reform will be stifled
as it has been in the past.

00:07:42.326 --> 00:07:44.466
