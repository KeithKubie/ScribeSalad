00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.040
I think we should do this one outside.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.540
This is better. This is beautiful.
Just, oh, of course... except for this.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.980
Litter - is a kind of pollution, but like
barely.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.880
Like, I would rather it not be here.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.570
It makes me kind of angry and it makes nature
less pretty,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.060
but environmentally, there's a pretty low
chance that this can,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
or even a million more like it is going to
have a significant negative impact on an ecosystem.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.460
The kind of pollution that we really have
to worry about is the kind that we don't see,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.000
either because it is invisible,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.540
or because it's being done in places that are way out of the way that we're less likely to encounter.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.270
That's by design, of course.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.250
Because when people actually see the impact
that their lifestyle can have on the world,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.789
they tend to sometimes change the way that
they live.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.589
And also the way that they buy, and we can't
have that!

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.609
So, it's time to get our hands dirty.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:01:00.109
[Theme Music]

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.039
Pollution is a kind of catch-all term for
any substance that's in the wrong place

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.300
or in the wrong concentrations in the environment.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.520
Trash in the environment, that's pollution.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.569
But chemicals, both naturally occurring and
synthetic, those are the real killers.

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.520
Now, we tend to think of pollution in terms
of weird synthetic chemicals

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.140
made in big chemical processing plants and
they're certainly a problem.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.560
But as we'll see in a bit you've got to understand
that natural compounds in the wrong concentrations

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.610
can do just as much damage as whatever petro-insecticides we're making.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
One of the main ways we're altering concentrations
of natural compounds is

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.360
by messing with the bio-geo-chemical cycles
that we talked about a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.739
You're probably tired of hearing about it, but the most obvious cycle that we're screwing up is the Carbon Cycle,

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.410
which shuffles carbon around the planet into
various reservoirs.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.110
The atmosphere, the oceans, rocks, the bodies
of living things.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.060
The cycle keeps going on thankfully.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.020
But we're overloading it by digging up all
that carbon-rich coal and oil and gas,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.070
and burning it to fuel our 21st century lifestyles.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.110
All of a sudden there's more carbon getting
released than the reservoirs can handle.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.860
Plants and animals are like "We're cool, we
got all the carbon we need"

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
And the oceans are like "Yeah, we're good
on carbon too!"

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770
And it can't just go back into the rock.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.250
So, it hangs around in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas, insulating our planet and changing the climate.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.270
We've also been tampering with the nitrogen
and phosphorus cycles to similar effect.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.800
Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients which
we, and other organisms, need,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.060
like, really need in order to grow and respire
and exist.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.060
But when we go and make , like, ludicrous amounts of these nutrients available, ecosystems get very confused.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.940
It's like the day in fifth grade when I realized
that I could spend my entire allowance

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.750
on Cadbury Creme Eggs at the After-Easter
candy sale at Walgreens.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.330
It was fun at first, then it was not.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.970
Phosphates and Nitrates are basically the
main ingredients in fertilizers.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.240
And phosphates are also found in some detergents.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.870
So when waste water from our houses or run
off from farms,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.370
washes those compounds into rivers and streams,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.300
it can cause huge algal blooms that choke out the rest of the plants and animals in the stream.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.040
It's totally gross-looking.
But that's not the end of it.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.330
When all the phosphorus and nitrogen are used
up, the algae die,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.670
and then bacteria gets started on decomposing
that dead algae.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.450
But of course, the decomposers need oxygen,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.310
which they take out of the water and then
the oxygen levels in the water plummet,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.450
killing all the fish and just about everything
else that needs oxygen.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.540
This is how phosphate and nitrogen pollution
causes dead-zones.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.340
The biggest example of this happening right
this very minute is in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.280
at the mouth of the Mississippi River.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.430
The Gulf of Mexico Dead-Zone covers 18,000
square kilometers of river delta and coast-line,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.630
and is basically a swathe of totally de-oxygenated
water

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.540
caused by all the fertilizers from the entire
Mississippi River basin

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.160
which drains 2.6 million square kilometers of land drained into this one point in the Gulf.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.230
The size of the dead-zone fluctuates seasonally,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.740
as it depends on how much fertilizer is being
used by pretty much half of the farms in America.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.240
So yeah, pollution isn't just synthetic compounds
with just like 17-syllable-long names,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.860
sometimes they're just imbalances of chemicals
that we need for our survival.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.660
However not all chemicals found in nature
are good for us.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.300
In fact, sweet, old Mother Earth comes up with some of the most toxic stuff that you've ever heard of.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.959
Take cyanide for instance.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.220
It's in a lot of stuff that we come in contact
with everyday,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.480
foods like almonds, spinach and Lima beans
contain cyanide,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.920
and so do the seeds of apples, which you have
heard, and the pits of peaches.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.740
Cyanide is useful to plants because it's a
primitive insecticide,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.700
causing a sort of molecular asphyxiation, preventing a bug's cells from being able to use oxygen.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.940
Now it takes a lot more cyanide than you'd find in an almond to finish off a human, but guess what?

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.480
We figured out how to collect a whole bunch of cyanide in one place because we really love gold.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.700
Gold! My precious!

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.120
Mining operations use cyanide in large quantities in order to separate gold, silver, and other precious metals from the ore.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.520
In the cyanide process of ore extraction,
ground up ore is sprayed with a cyanide solution,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.120
which dissolves the metal in the ore and draws
it out.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.290
The solution is then collected and the precious
metal is taken out.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.080
But the by-product of all of this is, of course,
a big pile of cyanide-laced rock powder,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.220
a.k.a. hazardous waste to deal with.
Or try to deal with anyway.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.220
Mines do all kinds of stuff to reduce the concentration of cyanide in these leftovers, called tailings.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.710
Or they try and convert the cyanide into less-toxic
cyanate, but the toxin is never totally eliminated.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.220
So then it can end up leaking into the groundwater
supply.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.500
Or it can just sit there and keep dissolving
other toxic metals out of the rock

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.770
that also end up in our water, like mercury.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.690
And mercury is another important pollutant,
it's a super-toxic,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.890
naturally-occurring metal found in coal, among
other places.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.800
And it's just fine when it's hanging out underground
in a coal seam,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.600
but when that coal is burned to make electricity,
the mercury is released into the air.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.040
And then the mercury falls on the land, where
it makes its way into groundwater,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.850
and eventually into the food chain, especially
into the marine food chain.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.320
As a result, only about 25% of the mercury
released by U.S. power plants and factories

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.810
actually ends up in the U.S.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.680
The rest enters the global cycle, which most
people end up ingesting by eating fish.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.780
And mercury acts as a powerful neurotoxin in animals, interfering with our brains and our nervous systems.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.160
Finally, two more naturally-occurring compounds that we keep pumping out are sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.740
The most common natural sources of these things
are volcanic eruptions,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.940
or the waste of some algae and bacteria.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:17.460
But we release millions of tons of these things into the environment every year by burning fossil fuels like coal.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.560
And when these compounds react with water
vapor in the atmosphere,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.990
they turn into sulfuric acid and nitric acid,
and then return to the surface as acid rain.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.680
In soils, these acids can cause the release
of natural, but toxic, elements like aluminum.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.920
In water, they can poison aquatic wildlife,
and on land,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.100
the acidity can cause animals' eggs to not
hatch and plants to lose nutrients.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.740
Now, things have gotten significantly better since a lot of countries put emissions controls into place,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.640
but for a while there, back in 1980, rain in much of North America had the same pH as tomato juice,

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.570
which, objectively speaking, is the grossest.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.020
So. That's how we're amping up the levels of naturally-occurring chemicals to toxic levels.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.200
But, of course, we're also synthesizing chemicals
that Mother Nature never even dreamed of,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.840
and they wreak their own special brand of
havoc.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.889
The problem here is choosing just one as an
example,

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.430
because there are so many chemicals out there,
doing so many different things.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.720
There's a whole class of chemicals called
endocrine disruptors,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.840
which we put in pharmaceuticals, pesticides
and plastics,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.419
but some of them are also just byproducts
of industry and agriculture.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.380
Endocrine disruptors, like bisphenol A or
BPA,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.940
which baby bottle manufacturers have been scrambling to take out of their products in recent years,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.400
hang out in plastics and leach into our drinks or are flushed off of agricultural fields and into rivers

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.620
or are just flushed down toilets when we pee them out because they're in some drug that we've been taking.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.760
The result is that they get into waterways,
sometimes in high concentrations,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.220
and the animals there, they just soak 'em
all in.

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.060
The endocrine system, basically just your hormones, controls a vast array of an organism's functions.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.540
And as concentrations of EDCs have increased,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.330
we've spotted male fish in rivers all over
the world with female reproductive tracts

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.140
or testes that make eggs.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.360
Those fish are living in the water, but we...we're
drinking it.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.240
People of all ages are susceptible to EDCs, but research suggests that those most at risk are fetuses and infants,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.780
because their organ and immune systems are
still forming.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.479
Scientists are still studying the developmental,
reproductive,

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:14.679
and neurological effects that these compounds
are having on us.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.040
And as far as I'm concerned they can't do
it fast enough.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.729
So, the chemicals we're making are affecting
us in ways that we could guess,

00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:23.110
and also probably ways that we've never even
dreamed of.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:28.550
At the same time, we're rearranging where and how much some naturally occurring compounds are showing up

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.490
and that adds to those 5 other impacts that
we're having on the biosphere.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.550
And yeah, the past two weeks have been a real
bummer.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.800
But hopefully an enlightening bummer.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.260
And this leads us to the next stage of ecology,
and the last lesson in this course:

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.040
conservation biology and restoration ecology,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.200
which together comprise the science of saving
our planet, and ourselves from...ourselves.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.500
