Kathy: from the United Nations foundation
and I want to talk about why it's important

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.690
for all of us to treat ourselves as global
citizens.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.139
And why if you are in the United States or
any other country you oughta think about using

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.550
international cooperation as a primary theme.
You know it doesn't work for any country to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.890
go it alone today and it doesn't work for
any citizen to go alone.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.560
We have to be a part of the larger system.
So when you think about a candidate, or when

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.859
you think about what issues you care about,
think about what we can do to collaborate.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.340
It's the most important tool we have.
Thanks very much YouTubers.
