well I think being raised during the

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690
well I think being raised during the
 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.280
well I think being raised during the
Depression is a very important thing in

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290
Depression is a very important thing in
 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.620
Depression is a very important thing in
my generation I think it it meant that I

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630
my generation I think it it meant that I
 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.790
my generation I think it it meant that I
had to learn very early how to work hard

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800
had to learn very early how to work hard
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.050
had to learn very early how to work hard
and how to be independent and so maybe

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060
and how to be independent and so maybe
 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.659
and how to be independent and so maybe
part of it is that you just learn that

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669
part of it is that you just learn that
 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.080
part of it is that you just learn that
you've got to be independent and that

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090
you've got to be independent and that
 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.389
you've got to be independent and that
the world isn't going to come to you

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399
the world isn't going to come to you
 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.850
the world isn't going to come to you
with all sorts of gifts

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.950
not very enthusiastic I my mother wasn't

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960
not very enthusiastic I my mother wasn't
 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.780
not very enthusiastic I my mother wasn't
even enthusiastic about according to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790
even enthusiastic about according to
 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:57.900
even enthusiastic about according to
college but I had good friends in

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910
college but I had good friends in
 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.940
college but I had good friends in
graduate school who were very very

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950
graduate school who were very very
 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.670
graduate school who were very very
encouraging and I still retain some of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680
encouraging and I still retain some of
 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.189
encouraging and I still retain some of
those colleagues through all the years

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199
those colleagues through all the years
 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.590
those colleagues through all the years
and they made a huge difference

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.030
early years it was a challenge to find a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040
early years it was a challenge to find a
 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.570
early years it was a challenge to find a
position so in the early years I think

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580
position so in the early years I think
 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.490
position so in the early years I think
being a woman was a big handicapped

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
being a woman was a big handicapped
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.350
being a woman was a big handicapped
pursuing the kind of work i have been

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360
pursuing the kind of work i have been
 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.230
pursuing the kind of work i have been
doing was not very much appreciated

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240
doing was not very much appreciated
 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.969
doing was not very much appreciated
across the social sciences so but i just

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979
across the social sciences so but i just
 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.770
across the social sciences so but i just
got fascinated with what i was doing and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780
got fascinated with what i was doing and
 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.139
got fascinated with what i was doing and
so being a stubborn son of a gun i just

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149
so being a stubborn son of a gun i just
 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.980
so being a stubborn son of a gun i just
kept going

well the trying to do really good field
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.719
well the trying to do really good field
work and then I was very fortunate I was

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
work and then I was very fortunate I was
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.300
work and then I was very fortunate I was
able after being graduate advisor during

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
able after being graduate advisor during
 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.760

and a fair administrative load I was

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
and a fair administrative load I was
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550
and a fair administrative load I was
able to teach my first graduate seminar

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
able to teach my first graduate seminar
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.090
able to teach my first graduate seminar
and I had outstanding graduate students

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
and I had outstanding graduate students
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.859
and I had outstanding graduate students
some of whom have become colleagues and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
some of whom have become colleagues and
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.810
some of whom have become colleagues and
I work with all I have worked with for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
I work with all I have worked with for
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.660
I work with all I have worked with for
many years and I then worked with

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
many years and I then worked with
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.509
many years and I then worked with
undergraduate students so that I was

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519
undergraduate students so that I was
 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.890
undergraduate students so that I was
able to blend research and teaching in a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
able to blend research and teaching in a
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.350
able to blend research and teaching in a
very active way in Indianapolis studying

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360
very active way in Indianapolis studying
 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.509
very active way in Indianapolis studying
policing in black communities in chicago

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519
policing in black communities in chicago
 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.800
policing in black communities in chicago
again studying and policing and that was

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
again studying and policing and that was
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.110
again studying and policing and that was
so interesting that i wasn't so

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
so interesting that i wasn't so
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000
so interesting that i wasn't so
concerned about what my colleagues

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
concerned about what my colleagues
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370
concerned about what my colleagues
thought I just got interested in what I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
thought I just got interested in what I
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.150
thought I just got interested in what I
was doing

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160
 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.770
it was a big controversy at UCLA in the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780
it was a big controversy at UCLA in the
 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.780
it was a big controversy at UCLA in the
political science department they'd not

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
political science department they'd not
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.620
political science department they'd not
had a woman in their program for many

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630
had a woman in their program for many
 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.840
had a woman in their program for many
years and there were four of us out of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850
years and there were four of us out of
 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.990
years and there were four of us out of
40 admitted in the year I was admitted

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
40 admitted in the year I was admitted
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.510
40 admitted in the year I was admitted
to a doctoral program and there were

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520
to a doctoral program and there were
 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.090
to a doctoral program and there were
many of the faculty who were extremely

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100
many of the faculty who were extremely
 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.590
many of the faculty who were extremely
upset but again I had many friends that

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600
upset but again I had many friends that
 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.309
upset but again I had many friends that
helped me through it

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319
 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:18.059
yes I don't think they are supporting

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069
yes I don't think they are supporting
 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.770
yes I don't think they are supporting
socialism as a top-down theory a lot of

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780
socialism as a top-down theory a lot of
 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.039
socialism as a top-down theory a lot of
socialist governments are very much

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049
socialist governments are very much
 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.740
socialist governments are very much
top-down and I think my theory does

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750
top-down and I think my theory does
 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.879
top-down and I think my theory does
challenge that any top-down government

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889
challenge that any top-down government
 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.190
challenge that any top-down government

whether on the right or the left is
unlikely to be able to solve many of the

unlikely to be able to solve many of the
 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.670
unlikely to be able to solve many of the
problems of resource sustainability in

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
problems of resource sustainability in
