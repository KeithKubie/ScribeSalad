00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.450
Alright, so say that we've determined the coefficients for a linear

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.740
model for our data using gradient descent, or even some other

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.760
method. Just because we're able to come up with some model

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.825
doesn't mean that it's a good one. The data could be distinctly

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.030
non-linear. Or, maybe the attributes that we've trained our model on

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.630
have little to no bearing on our output variable. We need

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.750
some way to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. One way

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.190
we can measure this is a quantity called the coefficient of determination,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.630
also referred to as R squared. If we have

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.590
a bunch of values, yi through yn. A bunch

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.550
of predictions, fi through fn and an average value

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.300
for our data, y bar. We can define the

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.475
coefficient of determination as R squared is equal to

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.809
1 minus the sum over n of yi minus

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.840
fi squared, over the sum over n of yi

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.300
minus y bar squared. The closer R squared is to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.380
one, the better our model. And the closer it is to zero, the poorer our model.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.480
The coefficient of determination gives us a pretty

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.550
effective way to evaluate how good our model is.
