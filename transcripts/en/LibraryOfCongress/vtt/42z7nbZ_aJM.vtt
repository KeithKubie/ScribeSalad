in the Hispanic Reading
room here at the library.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.730
It's my pleasure to introduce
today's event and to welcome you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.680
with the Embassy of Columbia.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.610
We love collaborating with
the embassy and today,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.610
we are going to picture
Claudia Isabel Nava a historian

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.150
from Columbia who will be talking
about Francisco de Miranda.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150 position:56%
Before we start though, I would like
to just make a few announcements

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.760
and also to tell you a little bit
about the Hispanic Reading Room.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.710
So I don't know if any of you
that there's a reading room

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.600
in the library devoted
to Hispanic collections,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.960
also [inaudible] Hispanic because
we include Portugal and Brazil.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.620
We are located on the second
floor of this building

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.300
and basically the history
of our division,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.610
we are the primary access point to
research related to the Caribbean,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.070
Latin America, Spain and Portugal

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.120
and also Latinos in
the United States.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.890
So I hope you all visit us.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.410
We're open from Mondays
to Friday from 8:30 to 5.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.610 position:56%
And just a few announcements as well
before we move onto the program.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.910
Make sure please that
you silent your phones

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.310
for the duration of the lecture.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.400
I also wanted to let you know
that this program is part

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.070
of our Hispanic Heritage Month
celebration here at the library

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.860
and we have had a lot of
very fun events already

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.770
and this is our last week
of events in the library.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.380
Tomorrow we have a lecture at
noon in the Mary Pickford Theater

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.690
which is across the street
in the other building.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.680
It's a book talk by Professor
Chrissy Arce from the University

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.420
of Miami and the title of the
lecture is "Mexico's nobodies.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.090
The culture legacy of the
soldadera and Afro-Mexican Women".

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.440
Now, it's my pleasure to
introduce Gladys San Miguel,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.130
Minister Counselor of
the Embassy of Counselor

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.490
who will introduce
our speaker today.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.790
Thank you.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.090
&gt;&gt; Gladys San Miguel:
Well, hello everyone.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.610
On behalf of the Embassy
of Columbia,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.750
I would like to thank
the Library of Congress

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.310
for this beautiful partnership
to celebrate the Hispanic Month

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.320
and it is my pleasure to
announce a great Columbian.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.390
It is an honor because she has
been working to leave the name

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.600
of our country, our
history and our culture,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.760
not only in the U.S.,
but also in Europe.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.230
She has a master degree in
Museum Studies from the Museum

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.090
of the Historia Natural in Paris, a
Art History degree in [inaudible],

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.770
the School of Art and Institute
of Chicago gave her a scholarship,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.970
which allowed her to continue
her art history studies

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.610
and what is beautiful about her
presentation today is she began her

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.400
career 20 years ago here in
Washington, D.C. She began

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.420
with an art work and with
videos about art history

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.240
and how rich is Columbia in
art, culture and bio-diversity.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.600 position:56%
During these 20 years, she went to
Europe and she continued her studies

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.760
and she has been working with the
mayors of Paris and the minister

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.430
of defense in Paris to talk
about our independence,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.890
and how these great Latin
Americans, as Francisco de Miranda,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.480 position:56%
contributed to the dream of freedom.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.720
She is talking today about a person

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.760
that not everybody
knows how special he is.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.710
He is Francisco de Miranda,
the only human being to fight

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.680 position:56%
in three different independent wars.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.540
He fought with the United
States along the French

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.070
and the Spanish Army
against the British.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.700
Then he fought as a general
in the French Revolution.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.480
He is the only Latin America the
degree of general and then he came

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.260 position:56%
to America to fight for the dream
of freedom, but I won't say anymore.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.780
I will just leave this
great Columbia.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.870
Thank you Library of Congress for
opening this space for our country

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.670
and thank you, Claudia
for leaving the name

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.070
of Columbia in the highest remarks.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.510
You are a true Columbian,
a great Columbian.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.060
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.030
&gt;&gt; Claudia Isabel Navas:
Thank you for being here.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.510
Thank you all.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.860
I would like to thank the Minister
counselor, Gladys San Miguel,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.040
for this kind invitation, his
excellency embassy Camilo Reyes.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.110
I would also like to thank very
much Georgette Rum [phonetic]

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.710
and her staff, and especially
Catalina Gomez for having carried

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.200
through this project
that begun a year ago.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.790
A year ago in 2016,
we celebrated all

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.380
over the world the
bicentennial 200th anniversary

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.030
of Francisco de Miranda death.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:03.050
He died in prison in
Spain the 14th of July.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.660
As you all may know, the 14th of
July is the Day of the Bastis,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.110
[phonetic] which is
actually right now passing.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:18.830 position:56%
So most biographers of Francisco de
Miranda say he had the revolutionary

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.350
elegance of passing away
on the 14th of July.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:32.360
I have selected a series of images
that would let me kind of get

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:40.110
into the subject as it is a
very, very large subject matter.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.570
As you will find out Francisco
de Miranda had probably 10 lives

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:53.610
in his 66 years of life actually.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.130
As Gladys San Miguel
said, he was the only man

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.000
who fought in three revolutions.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.930
So he was here in the U.S. in 1781.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.030
He belonged to the Spanish
Crown Army and he fought

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.390
with the Spaniards to the
Port of Pensacola Fort.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:26.300
That was 1781 and then he went
to France and he became general

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.570
of the Army in 1792 and
he made a first expedition

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.120
to South America in 1806.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.400
So this is really early timing.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.480
He came alone to South America
with a flag and he tried

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:55.960
to free South America with two
boats and not too many men.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.900
Obviously, it was a
very, very big defeat.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:07.750
He lost that attempt, but it gave
people the idea of a possible way

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:15.900
of freeing the South America
part of America, South America.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:23.260
So let me just maybe
begin with who --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.430
introduce a little
bit my own background.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.730
I am art historian.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:34.720
So many people may ask why is an
art historian working on military

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:43.190
and political men and actually I
came about Francisco de Miranda

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:50.350 position:56%
through my art history studies
because Francisco de Miranda was one

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:56.150
of the first men as well to
define what human heritage

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.610
and human legacy was.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:06.770
This happened when French General
Napoleon Bonaparte started taking

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.970
the art work from Italy into
his museum, the Napoleon Museum,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.900
which later became [inaudible]
Louvre and the Museum of Louvre.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:26.060
So at the time, Miranda in 1795, he
starts writing political pamphlets

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.670
and denouncing the
expatriation of cultural heritage.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.180
So that's how, as an art
historian, I came about working

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.600
with Francisco de Miranda and then
it became a much larger project

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:48.550
when Columbian ambassador
in Paris requested a project

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.830
on Francisco de Miranda
because we were going

00:09:51.830 --> 00:10:01.110 position:56%
to commemorate the 200th anniversary
of independence in South America.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:07.530
So Francisco de Miranda was the
person who represented this aspect

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.490
for France in any case
and I think for the U.S.,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.240
it's a person who was seen as a one

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:24.140
of the most knowledgeable
people and man of his time.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.430
John Adams wrote in his
memories that if anybody knew

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.410
of American independence,
U.S. independence,

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:40.190 position:56%
the man who knew the best in history
was actually Francisco de Miranda.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:46.170
He was a very, very well
educated and curious person.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:52.330
So let me comment on these few
images I have selected for you

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.110
to introduce Francisco de Miranda.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.320
Francisco de Miranda
has this portrait

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.900
in the Chateau de Versailles.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:09.410
He was remembered as one
of the generals of the Army

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.710
of the north [inaudible].

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.270 position:56%
He has his name [inaudible] as well.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:21.270
He was there in 1789 actually
right before La Bastis [phonetic]

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:27.420
and then he came back in 1792 and
the frontiers were closed in Paris

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.060
at that time and so he
couldn't leave and the generals

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.000
of the French Army
asked him to stay.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.530
Here are his peers.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.970
You can see Lafayette.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:43.440
[Inaudible] was his -- [inaudible],
the third name of the left column,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.780
was the general in
chief and here on down.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.970
So if you ever go to
Paris, you'll see his name.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.290
he's the only Hispanic-American
found in that.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:59.240
This portrait is a portrait
that was made of him in 1788

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.270
and was started a physiognomist
called Lavatar

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.890
and when he saw this pencil
drawing -- portrait --

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:14.770
he wrote a very comparing
psychological description

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.980
of who Francisco de Miranda was.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.940
And he said, "You are man that
has very many men inside of you.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.110
You have a world inside you.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.940
All the experiences you have
will carry you on through life."

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.880
Actually, it did.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.120
This is probably Miranda
here, probably he's 45.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.840
This is 1788.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:47.810
He was born in 1750, so he's
38 years old at this time,

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:57.630
but Miranda when he left Caracas,
he was 21 years old and he started

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:02.450
to be very curious and the
[inaudible] sort of literature log.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:08.010
He read [inaudible] and he started
to think about the possibility

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.290
of independence for the colony.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:18.990
So when he came to Madrid,
he became the king's soldier

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:36.280
and he left the Army in 1782,
so at age 32, at 1782 or 1783

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.040
and he started to travel and
this where in the United States,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.140
this is where he gets to New Bern.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.650
He starts traveling
through the east coast.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.200
At that time, he's going to
meet all of the founding fathers

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.990
of the United States of
America and he's going

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:58.130
to start writing a project
for South America colonist,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.330
thinking that if the British
colonists have been able

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.040
to emancipate themselves
and rule themselves,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.070
so could the Spanish
colony in America.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:17.150
So they he moved to Europe, where
he gets into the whole movement

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.590
of the French Revolution and
here he thinks that if he --

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.230
I like this portrait because
you could see Miranda.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.870
This is him right here.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:35.200
You can see in the background --

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.870
you can see in the
background South America

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:47.350
and that really means he's
always writing for the continent

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.200
and he's always about Columbia.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.780
So what is Columbia to
Francisco de Miranda?

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.990
This is the flag that as
been attributed to Miranda.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.090
It dates from 1810.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.550
It represents Columbia.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:11.900
Columbia was, at that time,
was the figure of America,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.780
like America the continent.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.220
At that time, when
people said "America,"

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.270
it was mostly Hispanic America.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.140
It was not the United States.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.590
America I mean was the
largest empire at the time

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:30.360
and so the United States
seemed very small compared

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.750
to the rest of the continent.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:37.940
So a person that would be America,
that wouldn't exist at that time.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:43.090
It was actually Miranda
who first registered --

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:48.750
so in 1785, he goes to Germany
and he goes to the Library

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.610
of [inaudible], where he's
going to -- right here.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:16:03.580
This is 1785 and he gets
this registered, right?

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.660
We see the date and then
we can his name right here,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:14.920
Colonel Francisco de Miranda and
they had to write where they came

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.670
from and so he writes "America."

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.500
So this is pretty interesting
because it dates 1785.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.800
This means Miranda is already
thinking of himself not

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.860
as a Spanish subject because people
who were born in South America,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.460
the colonists were Spanish
subjects, but he thought

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.570
of himself as an American.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.360
"I am an American."

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.530
William Smith, he writes
North America.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:54.180 position:56%
William Smith, he is the son-in-law,
the in-law of [inaudible]

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:58.200
and William Smith is going to be
the friend of Francisco de Miranda.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.750
They're going to travel
together for four years.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.850
They're going to visit most
of the courts of Europe,

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.110
most of the collections, scientific
collections, art collections.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.680
They are going to study
all the military strategies

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.050
of the greatest rulers of
Europe including Yekaterina ,

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.520
Catherine the Great
and they're going

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.650 position:56%
to have this friendship that's
going to last for a long, long time.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.480
So we're going to see
later on when I get

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:37.160
into the project how Miranda is
related to Smith, but I wanted just

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:44.550
to point out in this introductory
phase how it is to be able

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:55.280
to call oneself as something and he
defines himself before the hour --

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.190
10 years before, even 12 years
before that actually independence

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:07.000
of this continent in South America,
he defines himself as an American,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.440 position:56%
which is pretty, pretty
interesting as a concept of identity

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.000
like how he starts to
identify this whole issue.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.860
I put a picture of
Jefferson, who he also met.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:29.330
He was an ambassador of the United
States in France at the time

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:35.420
of [inaudible] and Francisco de
Miranda in the Army consulate

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.470 position:56%
of the French people and he is
called "General [foreign language],"

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:47.330 position:56%
he was called at the time [foreign
language] Francisco de Miranda also.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:53.730
I wanted to get you a little bit
into the scope of what his life was

00:18:53.730 --> 00:19:00.300
and I imagine already
have been sensing how deep

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:07.400
or profound his existence and
how interesting for a country

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.900
like Columbia that can be
because he is also the first one

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.040
who will call himself "Columbiano."

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.860
So not only would he use the
name to define America Columbia

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.380
or to define himself an
Americano coming from America

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:34.860
but he will the use the [inaudible]
Columbiano to attract Columbians.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:41.140
So here is the first document that
he's going to post in the church --

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.570
in the Cathedral of Coro -- in his
adventure of 1806 when he tried

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.040
to come and liberate by
himself the continent.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.340
He arrives.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.800
He puts on the flag
that he imagined --

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.800
so a flag for his country
that he created in his mind

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:04.300
and he claims himself to be the
comandante general del ejercito

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:12.720
Columbiano, the chief commander or
chief general of the Columbian Army

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.320
and he's talking to the people,

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.830
los pueblos habitantes del
continente Americo Columbiano.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:25.780
It is really interesting
because has [inaudible].

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.660
I mean these are still
Spanish Empire.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:35.040
These territories are
part of the Spanish Empire

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.990
and nobody has claimed them
to be an independent nation.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.660
Nobody has even claimed that
they can be called Columbiano

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.190
or Columbo Americano.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:52.480
So it is a pure invention
of Francisco de Miranda.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.410
Francisco de Miranda is
a very interesting person

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:07.860
because he created this imaginary
land, this imaginary constitution.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:15.680
He is the first person to write
a constitution or constitutions

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.470
for a government of
transition between the Monarchy

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.290
and whatever government
is meant to follow.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.000
Of course, the type of government

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.250
that Francisco de Miranda is
thinking is very much like the ones

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.300
that he has helped put in place.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.720
So that is the Republic
of the United States

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.780
and the Republic of France.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.320
And he -- based on his
personal life experiences,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:55.830
is going to start creating
a constitution and some laws

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:00.160
for this human's territories
that was America

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.440
and a continente Columbo America.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.810
I sometimes wonder where
the name Columbia came.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:17.480
I think Columbia was a term that
he heard here in the United States

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.530
when he came to New York.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.540
Columbia was the image of Columbia
and it was an Indian woman,

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.480
the iconography like
Asia or Africa or Europe.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:37.220
Each kingdom in Europe has
their imagery and iconography.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:44.910
So, for instance, Kings College in
New York became Columbia University

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.910
and the district of
Washington is Columbia.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.960
I mean we hear about
Columbia, Columbia,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.150
so Miranda must have
been very much influenced

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.580
because if we see the
flag, we see that America

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:05.030
and Columbia are represented
as a native American women

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:11.230
which was actually the iconography
that went along with Columbia

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.800 position:56%
and then maybe the U.S. changed -- -

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.200
Columbia stopped needing
America and just became America.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.890
So there has been several
transitions between that word.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:31.730
The fact of the matter is that we,
in Columbia, are called Columbianos

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:37.460
and that was something that
Miranda very much defended.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:45.570
Miranda said in his constitution of
the 1800, said, "The people living

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.610
in Columbia should be called
Columbianos and not Columbinos

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:55.630
because Columbianos is much more
elegant and it sounds prettier."

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.440
So this is how Francisco
de Miranda works.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:08.870
He's not -- he's a diplomat because
obviously he is going to meet most

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:14.500
of the rulers of the
late 18th century.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.460
He's going to meet everyone.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:21.730
He's going to read every book,
every single book he can get.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:27.880
He's going to visit every
single library he can visit,

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.070
scientific collections, private
collections, art collections.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.960
He is one of the most
knowledgeable persons of his time.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.680
He knows about law and that's going
to cause him a lot of problems,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.600
but aside of that -- aside of
all this knowledge he's got,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:53.250 position:56%
he's got the wisdom and then he has
the power of creating and imagining.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:58.540
All of what he imagined was then
carried out by people like Bolivar

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:04.330
and [inaudible] and peers like
St. Martin, but, above all,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.620
he's got the power of
imagining a new nation.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:15.060
Back to the project, this was the
project that we created in 2010.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:20.920
It was shown at UNESCO in 2012
[inaudible] and we've traveled

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.380
with the exhibition throughout
these cities of the world.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:31.630 position:56%
It was a project that had many, many
partnerships, Columbian government,

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.360
Venezuela government, French
government and Spanish government.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:44.120
So that's very interesting
because it allowed us to talk

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.150
about a singular period of our
history through one person.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:54.900
I just wrote a quote that I
saw in the building in one

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.980
of the beautiful mosaics that
are upstairs and it says,

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.150
"The history of the world is
the biography of great men."

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.500
I think that's quite interesting
when we're talking about Miranda

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:13.820
because his memories are kept in
the Archive General de la Nación

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.020
in Caracas because
that was his will.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:24.520
Caracas was the city where he was
born and although his homeland,

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.680
for him, was America, was Columbia,
the big Columbia was his project

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:36.750
but Caracas is his homeland and
in his testament, in his Will,

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.490
he lends the memories that he had.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:45.130
Sixty-three volumes that were kept
for 100 years away from public

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:49.600
because it contained
so much confidential

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.170 position:56%
and high-level information that none

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.180
of it could ever be
seen to the public eye.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:04.970
So we had access to those memories
in 1927 and they're now online.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.030
They're digital tools.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:13.160
We found these memories -- a
project that you can download

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.580
from the internet and you can
visit, see, discover the life

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:24.370
of this great man,
who was [inaudible].

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.010
So we've divided.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:35.660
We speak in plural because
this project was made

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.940
with a highly scientific committee
from Germany, France, Columbia,

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.440
Mexico and Spain and Venezuela.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:52.940
So all content of the internet and
the content of the different panels

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:59.110
that we show, different exhibitions
all are a collective work.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:11.430
So what I what I wanted to show
you is a little bit of how he came

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:16.700 position:56%
to arrive to the United States,
which is the core of our talk today,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:25.050
Francisco de Miranda
and the United States.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.390
Miranda left Caracas in 1771.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.180
You can find all of this
in the internet if you want

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.090
to read carefully and learn more
about his life but he arrived

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:45.990 position:56%
to Paris, where he's going to end up
living in this house, Cuatro Torres.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.510
He's a young man.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:52.590
he's 21 years old and what
is interesting about his name

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:56.650
as well is that it is the name of
the prison where he's going to die.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:01.700
He's going to die in the Arsenal
del los Cuatro Torres 10 km away

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.000
from Cadíz.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.930
So he arrives in Cadíz and he
comes back at age 62 to die there.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:15.370
It would be nice to
mention those things.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:26.700
This is the army that he's going to
join is the Army of Princess and so

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:33.720
at that time, he's looking
to serve the Spanish king

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:39.960
and he will then be
promoted at colonel.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:45.740
He then went to Melilla in
Morocco where he defended the fort.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.270
I just want to show this fort.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:55.030
He was a great a drawer, so he
would draw perfectly the forts --

00:29:55.030 --> 00:30:00.910
all the Spanish forts and this
is why his memories were kept

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.080
for so long because he had so
much confidential information

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.480
of Spanish forts, fights
and military points.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.770
These are his drawings and he
would always have a map or a card

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.390
with him to know where he was.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.900
He would always analyze
the political,

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.320 position:56%
the economic situation and so forth.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:29.550
So this is a drawing by Francisco
de Miranda at age 28 of the fort

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:34.730 position:56%
that he helped to define in Melilla.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.620
Then he's going to go to -- this
is what gets him into problems.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.300
That was the sort of
literature I showed you before.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.790
This is going to be the first
time he is going to be imprisoned

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:51.920
because he was reading books that
were forbidden by the inquisition.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:31:00.140
So, at that time, he really starts
developing a very radical idea

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.190
of what should be allowed and not
allowed and he starts thinking

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.530
that inquisition is not
something very fair.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:17.660 position:56%
It's a system of oppression and that
it's a system that is helping people

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:22.240
from the American continent
to develop.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.680
I mean he believes that
ignorance is the worst enemy

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:34.060
of a culture unless you want
to keep people under control.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:40.020
So this is the prison where he
was first imprisoned in 1879

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.640
and then colonel from America
[inaudible] is the government

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.520
who is going to take him, who
becomes later the government

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.020
of Cuba, is going to enroll in the
battalion, the battalion de Aragon

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.330
and that's where Miranda
is going to get a lot

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.230
of attention military-wise.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:06.420
He was the aide Bernando de Gálvez,
who was the governor of Louisiana.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.960
He spoke many languages.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.260
He spoke English.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.560
He spoke French.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.860
He spoke Spanish.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.350
He read Greek and Latin
and he's better prepared

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:22.060
than any other Spanish
soldier but he is a criollo.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.560
He was born in America so
that is a problematic issue

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.930
for the [inaudible]
monarchy within the Army.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:36.200
So the uncle of Bernando de
Gálvez, who is the Jose de Gálvez,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:42.600
was the president of El Consejo de
Indias [phonetic], starts looking

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:49.890
after Miranda and getting
very jealous of this person,

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.600
who is getting so much
recognition and so much "power."

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.280
He's not a powerful man.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.580
Miranda is not very powerful.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.330
He just gets some merits and
he negotiates [inaudible]

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.050
for the English and
he wants to providence

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:09.380
and fought some great battles
and brought a lot of drawings

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.060
and military strategies
but he is a Caraqueño,

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.790
we were Hispano-American.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:24.320
So [inaudible] begin a chase and
actually when he comes to the U.S.,

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.680
he goes to Salem and kind
of makes some comparisons

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:34.630
about the inquisition in the
Spanish crown how they are chasing

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:42.690
as if he was sort of witch
or something like that.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.200
So that's what happens.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:51.430
He gets all these accusations of
which he is going only be able

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:57.330
to claim his name 10 years later
in 1793, but by that point,

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:03.060
Miranda has already left the
Army because he knows if he goes

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:09.260
to prison at that time, he knows
perfectly that he will not be able

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:15.500
to carry on his project for
independence for South America.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:24.160
So he will be commissioned
in the secret complicity

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:30.400
of the [inaudible], leaves Cuba
to come to the United States

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.900 position:56%
and he comes with some very elegant
letters from, el gobernador de Cuba,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:41.040
the Cuba government and was
able to introduce himself still

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:47.830
as a Spanish Army colonel.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:52.740
That was really the strategy
that [inaudible] Miranda used was

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.710
to gain some time because
they were ahead of time.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:00.010
When the news came that
Miranda had left the Army,

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.440
people already opened
the doors to Miranda.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:07.790
People had already received
as a Spanish colonel.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:13.700
So he was playing a little
bit with the issue of time

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:20.240
of consuming his own destiny,
which, at that time in 1783,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.870
had already been chosen by him.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:31.210
He already chose to free
America from oppression yet,

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.750
he still wanted to serve the king.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.400
So Miranda had this duality in him.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:48.370
He can't make this radical --
this radical rupture with Spain.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:51.910
Spain is still the
mother, la madre patria

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:56.250
and the king is still la patria.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:03.570
So there are a lot of concepts that
you may see that I'm presenting

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:11.720
to you that are defining what
the patria, the homeland,

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:16.080
was and who to serve
and why to serve.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.950
Miranda is always going through
these dualistic, very complex,

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:26.580
reflection and very
contradictory as well.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.760
He is a revolutionist but he
is after the French Revolution,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.280
he becomes against revolution.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:40.350
So his soldier of Spain, serving
the king, but then he wants

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:45.270
to be a soldier of America and
then for him, it's almost natural

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:54.630
that the king of Spain that the
colonists are able to manage

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.930
and to [inaudible] themselves.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.420
He thinks it's natural.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.720
I mean it's natural.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.410
We've come to a certain maturity.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.710
We have so many wealth.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:06.150
We have so much education
in us, we can rule ourselves

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:10.120
and he thinks he is going
to convince the king.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.990
So he keeps asking
[inaudible] to the king.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.640
He sends this letter to Florida
Blanca, who was his minister.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.350
He sends letters to
all of ambassadors,

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:23.240
the Spanish [inaudible], "please
allow me to explain my plan.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:30.440
Please, let me tell how this will
be the greatest plan for America."

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:39.550
So he's always between this fine
line of betraying what, for him,

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:48.840
was his homeland and his king and
yet serving this new territory

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:55.390
that he sees can be so rich
and so full of treasures

00:37:55.390 --> 00:38:02.460
and beautiful things for
the rest of the world.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.220
So this is when he leaves.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.610
Now, we see a portrait
of young Miranda

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:13.500 position:56%
and he arrives in Baltimore in 1782.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:19.800 position:56%
At that age is when his real mission
begins, as a savior of America.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:31.290
So when he comes to the U.S., this
is the trip he's going to make --

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:36.440
this is a very nice quote.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.020
He attends a bar-b-que.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.520
This is a light concept, bar-b-que.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.820
He writes it.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.280
he writes where the
word comes, "bar-b-que."

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.640
He says, "To end the
party at around 1:00 p.m.,

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.090
they prepare a bar-b-que."

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:54.390
He defines it.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.010
"That is grilled pork with rum,

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:03.370
which was shared normally among the
magistrates and the well educated

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.540
and the poorest people of
the country, shaking hands

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.700
and drinking from the same glass.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:13.050
It is impossible to conceive
without having witnessed it,

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:16.670
a truly democratic
assembly and which comes

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:20.640
to complete the many reunions
that were told and described

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.090
by the great poets and historians
and which took place in some

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.720
of the free villages of
Greece of their own time."

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.890
So here we find evidence

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:37.890
of Francisco de Miranda's
intellectual formation

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.230
and education.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.230
He's a classical man.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:48.610
He believes that Greece is the
most beautiful model of democracy.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.990
Greece is the only place where
he is going to purchase a house.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:58.710
For him, democracy is the system
to go for and it is the system

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.840
that could be put in
place in South America.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:07.320
What he witnesses here is
something that he, later on,

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.620
he quotes this the same day.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:14.940
He's going to say, "I will never be
able to see these in South America

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:21.430
because they're such a colonel
monarchy that it will be impossible

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.620
to see the magistrate having coffee

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:32.860
or drinking tea or
wine with a pagan."

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:39.060
So he is very propelled by
this society and he starts --

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:44.160
obviously, he visits the Congress
in Philadelphia and, as I said,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.990
he went to New York and he
also admired Fort [inaudible]

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:54.270
where Washington led his battles.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:41:00.430
He met George Washington.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:05.710
He met him and he made a
quote, which is a commentary,

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.290
which is kind of interesting.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.230
"He complimented much.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.760
He is continuous, he's
careful, rather silent

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.930
and not very expressive, although
his kind manners make him a

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.280
terrible mind."

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:25.890
That is the sort of comments,
every single person he met,

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.790
he wrote something about.

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.170
He met everyone.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:36.220 position:56%
I met Washington, Hamilton, Sam
Addams, John Adams, Jefferson, Knox.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.650
He was friends with
Knox, with Monroe.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.810
He was friends with --
he traveled with Smith.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:44.400
He met the king of Prussia --

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:50.020
William Pitt, the father of the
Lee Young, all the ambassadors

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:55.790
and every time, he would
leave something about it.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:42:02.700
When Catherine the Great took
him through him her collections

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.060
of [inaudible], she opened it just
for him and before he left Russia,

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:11.090
she gave a dinner for him
and she gave him a passport.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.590
She said, "Here's your passport.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.740
Go and travel through Scandinavia.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.040 position:56%
He went and traveled form embassy to
embassy, Russian Embassy; otherwise,

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.850
the Spanish crown would
have imprisoned

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.620
because the Spanish
crown already knew

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.890
that he had this project
to liberate America.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.260
So he was very much protected.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:43.050
In this photo, you will
find 50 biographies of 50

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:48.940
of the most important he met.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:57.510
It's very educational and all the
libraries that he has followed.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:16.460
So when he comes to England, there
is an article that is published

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:27.760
at that time -- again, we are
in 1783 when he gets to London

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.750
and this is something that
says about the Spanish America.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:39.950
A portrait -- It's a translation
from English to the French.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:45.190
It's a portrait of Miranda and
it says already that there is one

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:51.670
of the most cultivated man in
London, trying to negotiate

00:43:51.670 --> 00:44:00.500
to liberate the America to
the South American colony.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.790
Everybody knows that is
what he is trying to do

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:10.010
because he's not very discreet.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.230
He is a person who
arrives to the dinners

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:18.870
and to all these great
glamourous parties

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.980
and he will start talking
about politics.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.050
He would start talking about
the importance of freedom

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:27.430
and then he would start talking

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:34.290
about how people should
go with him and for him.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:37.830
So that's pretty much it.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:43.740
as far as the life of Miranda, you
can find it on this application.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.920
I'm just going to show -- the
French Revolution is very,

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:56.390
very dense because he obviously
played a great role in France.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:45:03.960
He represented for two
years the greatest general

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.140
because he always stood for freedom

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:14.700
and he would always say
aloud the French [inaudible],

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.290
which the [foreign
language] "until death,"

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:30.650 position:56%
and that was what people believed at
that time for freedom and Miranda,

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:36.220
in any society whether it was
the United States or the Spanish,

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:42.610
or some very compelling letters
from his enemies like people

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:46.010
in the Spanish crown at the
ministers or the ambassadors

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:50.190
who were looking after him
that would also define Miranda

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:56.080
on the greatest and they would
say, "It's too bad we lost him."

00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:04.240 position:56%
And they would say just a man like
him could go and start the movement.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:10.060
They knew it was like a domino
effect and that's why Miranda,

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:15.910
in spite of the protection that
he had from Catherine the Great,

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.320
that's why he joined the French
Revolution because he knew

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:25.320
that if the French would come
to barracks in the Peninsula,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:31.320
that then the colonies
would be left on their own

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:37.170
and they would have some space
to start emancipating themselves,

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.360
and that's actually what happened
and that's actually what he's going

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.000
to write in his journal,
"El Columbiano."

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:55.220
He's going to tell -- this is
published in 1810 and he's going

00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:03.640
to actually say all that is going
on in Spain and so, again, 1810,

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.280
his journal is called,
"El Columbiano."

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:12.580
His journal was published
thanks to the support

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:16.960
of a very wealthy Spanish
family [inaudible]

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:24.120
and they financed his published --

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:31.150
his publication as well as
his translation of the letters

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:39.180
to the Americanos -- of the South
Americanos, [inaudible] Guzman.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:49.750
He was a Peruvian Jesuit that
Miranda will very much use

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:55.260
as a means of trying
to justify his actions.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:02.020
So he will always looking into
writings or some authors prior

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:13.850
to him in order to find some
intellectual basis for his actions.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:24.690
This is how all the
Muslims of the frontiers

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:29.640
and how America started
switching and changing.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:35.690
This is when he got back
here to the Americas.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.340
He was already 60 years old.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:42.730
This is the first constitution
signed

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:54.710
and so he was part
of that too, 1811.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:58.250
This is when he is captured.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:04.040
He was captured -- his last
writings, a complaining letter

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:11.050 position:56%
to the king again in 1813 asking him
to complying with the capitalization

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:16.470
that had been made -- la
capitulación de San Mateo,

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:25.200
which was not respected and he was
yet imprisoned and sent to jail

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.570 position:56%
without the right to defend himself.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:32.300
So that is his last letter.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:38.610
His last document is in 1813.

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.040
This is the place --
this is the prison,

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:49.210
la prison de las Cuatro Torres
and Arsenal de las Caracas.

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:55.380
This is where he died.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.490
And he is now buried

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:20.020
in this cemetery right
here in a common grave.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:25.230
Arsenal de las Caracas
in San Fernando,

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.630
which is like 10 km from Cadíz.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:34.510
[Inaudible] But he
got imprisoned there.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:45.870
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:52.390
No, they haven't found --
his body hasn't been found

00:50:52.390 --> 00:51:03.010
and they found ADN test but, no,
there is no trace of his remains.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:08.640
So he is still buried
there and his -- yeah.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.730
His grave is empty.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:20.510
There is no grave of him anywhere.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:25.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:34.760
It is. It is but I mean what
happened was he had his own grave

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:40.160
in the cemetery of the arsenal
but, at one point in the middle

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.290
of 19th century, they had
to relocate the cemetery

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:49.750
and they sent a notice for the
family to come and take the bodies

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.590
or [inaudible] but
nobody answered for him.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.610
So all the bodies that
were not reclaimed were put

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:59.290
in a common grave.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.590
Nobody --

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.900
I think they are -- actually he had
two boys, Alejandro and Francisco.

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.820
Alejandro died very young
as a general as well.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.710
He is buried in la
Pere Lachaise in France

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:20.870
and Francisco is the second one,
he married a Columbian woman

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:25.770
and he also died in the
war, the Independence War.

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:37.480
So I think I'm going
to stop right now.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.770
I think I've said enough
about Francisco de Miranda.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:45.390
I would be glad to answer
to some of your questions

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:51.210
or to share some of your thoughts.

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:54.010
&gt;&gt; Was he ever trialed?

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:56.060
&gt;&gt; Claudia Isabel Navas: Trial
-- like did he go to trial?

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.050
&gt;&gt; Claudia Isabel Navas:
After the San Mateo rendition?

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:12.700
No. It was -- legally, it was a
transgression of the rendition.

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.260
It was absolutely a transgression

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.480
and he was a military
of very high rank.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:25.540
He was treated as a criminal
-- as a street criminal.

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.070
He was chained.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:33.090
He was left in the prison in
Caracas with other criminals

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.890 position:56%
and then he was sent to Puerto Rico.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:40.500
The governor of Puerto Rico
admired Miranda, as I said,

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.960
even his enemies admired him.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.260
I mean they respected him.

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:47.860 position:56%
They knew what kind of man he was --
all the battles that he had been to,

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:53.590
so he really advocated for a better
treatment of General Miranda.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:59.780
That's why he asked the crown
to send him to the arsenal

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:04.760
but the crown obviously the tower
-- I don't know if you saw that --

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:14.180 position:56%
At the tower, there's no possibility
of escaping or -- it's right here.

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:22.960 position:56%
It's surrounded by water, so there's
no way of escaping and he writes

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:31.560
in 1814 when Ferdinand the
VII comes back to the throne,

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:40.140
he liberates all political
prisoners except Miranda --

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.870
except Miranda and Miranda writes a
letter again to the courts of Spain

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:49.080
and said, "Listen, give me at
least a chance to defend myself"

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.410 position:56%
because he was a very good lawyer --
empirical lawyer but a good lawyer.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:57.920
He had defended himself
against the French Revolution

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.070
in [inaudible] and he had won.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:05.720
People in France had taken out
of the court and he had said

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.640
"Viva la regime de Miranda.

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.590
Viva la republique."

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:16.190
So Miranda was a very good
spokesman, so he requested

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:21.520
and he knew he had the legal
right to defend himself

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.990
and the courts answered
to him saying

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:31.740
that they had lost his expedient.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.560
Losing the expedient of Francisco
de Miranda was very difficult

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.170
because it wasn't this thin.

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:44.670
I mean Francisco de Miranda had
so many warnings to be arrested

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:47.470
and so many letters that they sent

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:56.510
that his expedient must have been
one of the most thick of all.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:56:25.540
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.470
It's very interesting
because Miranda,

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:30.940
after the French Revolution -- I'm
going to go back a little here --

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:37.410 position:56%
after the French Revolution, he went
to England because -- obviously --

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:41.390
I say obviously because
Napoleon Bonaparte didn't

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:44.690
like to have any rivals around him.

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:50.990
So obviously that excluded
of the French Army

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:56.290
and the French government, Miranda
didn't see any fit for his stance

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:59.050
with the French government,
although he had fought for France

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.510
and he believed it was
his second homeland.

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:03.380
He decides to go back to England

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:07.030
because he knew William
Pitt de Young.

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:14.000
So he gets back to London and in
London, he had a very good friend,

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.040
which is Turnwell [phonetic].

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.480
Turnwell is a banker.

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.770
He's always is going
to finance Miranda.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.940
When Miranda is in this prison
in the Arsenal de la Caracas,

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:27.170
Turnwell is the person who
is going to still believe

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:30.820
in helping Miranda
escape from the prison.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:32.820
I mean he's 65 years old.

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.640
So Turnwell -- they had
this plan -- I don't know.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:39.170
They were going to escape
through a window or whatever

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:42.900
and Miranda died before
the plan got to fit

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:47.440
but Turnwell helped
Miranda go back to England

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.980
and Miranda knows Ambassador
Rufus King,

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:56.070
who is their English ambassador
in France and so he goes back

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:57.370
with great letters again.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:01.490
He always manages even
after revolutions --

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.350
he always managed to get a
good recommendation letter

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:09.850
and he goes back and sets
a house with all his books.

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.790
He's got more than 5000
books and opens his house

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:18.030 position:56%
to all his fellow Americans -- young
Hispanic Americans were looking

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:22.530
to fight for independence
of the colonies

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:27.710
and so there come Simon
Bolivar, Palacios, [inaudible],

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:38.250
Pedro Fermín de Vargas,
Bernando Higgins, San Martin came

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:44.770
when Miranda had already left
with Bolivar, Andres Bello,

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:48.690
[inaudible] -- I mean there are all
these young generation, you know,

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:54.070
that come from the Americas
and even from Mexico that stay

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:57.360
with Miranda in Miranda's house.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.210
So, yeah, the relationship
with Bolivar is very close.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:07.430
The father of Bolivar had
called upon Miranda in 1797

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:12.640
and they were trying to make him
work for this independence plan.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.480
So the Bolivar family and
Miranda knew each other already

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.590
and that's how they
came to work together.

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:29.490
Bolivar and Higgins are the
biggest disciples of Miranda.

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:37.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:42.630
Miranda? Okay, he was
in London in 1791 first.

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:46.750
He met there a great man from
France called Telihon [phonetic],

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:54.230
who was a very, very wise and very,
tricky, tricky bullet politician --

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:57.090
he told Miranda -- he heard
Miranda in one of these dinners

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:59.350
because Miranda had
a very mundane life.

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.630
He went to theaters and he went to
dinners, and he saw so many women

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:07.370
and had such a social life,
very, very eclectic social life

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:11.620
and Telihon heard him talk about
his plans to emancipate America

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.920
and he said, "You know what?

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.860
You should go to plans
because there are some plans."

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.700
Telihon obviously knew
everything that was going

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:26.750
in the clubs during the
revolutionary area and so he goes

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:32.030
from London to Paris and
he's trying to go to Russia

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:38.780
to see Catherine the Great
and he arrives to Paris

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:45.690 position:56%
with recommendation letters from
Telihon to meet with the mayor, who,

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:48.550
at that time, [inaudible]
was [foreign language].

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:55.430
They're going to be fascinated
by the personality of Miranda,

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:57.870 position:56%
by his experience, by his knowledge,

01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:03.650
the fact that he won here some
battles, that he was protected

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:08.920
by Catherine the Great,
and this is spring 1792.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:17.620
He spends all the summer there
and the destiny made it happen

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:27.140
that the Duke of Brunswick
threatens the French

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:35.340
and the French people react,
and there's the famous speech

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.190
of [inaudible] who is going to
say the armies [foreign language]

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:44.310
"Our patriot is in danger," and so
it's the call of the [inaudible].

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:50.850
It's the moment where the king, the
queen and the royal family is going

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:55.950
to be imprisoned, all the frontiers
are closed, and Miranda is there

01:01:55.950 --> 01:02:02.590
by chance, by an accident of
life, by his revolutionary life,

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:05.510
destiny that he had
inscribed in his.

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:15.110
[ Inaudible ]

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:19.830
Exactly. Exactly, absolutely.

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:27.120
This is why it's so interesting
we're celebrating Columbus Day

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.940
and actually Miranda will admire
very much Christopher Columbus,

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:37.810
although he will criticize
the level of conquest,

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:40.100
the privilege of the
right of conquest.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.780
So this is the ambivalence
of Miranda.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.790
He will write so much based
on the [foreign language].

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:48.520
That's his bible.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.480
Vatel [phonetic] is his bible.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:58.920
It's like he knows every single
civilization to be or not

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.880
to be conquered and he
will criticize of conquest

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.580
but he will admire
Christopher Columbus

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.600
and he will never ever
revoke him the fact

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.960
of having created this America.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.540
It's very beautiful.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.100
In a way, again, it's part
of his imaginary of trying

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:26.400
to develop a new homeland.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.440
It's also something
that is in the air --

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.160
like everything that was in his
life, something that he will pick

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.600
that he will pick on and then he
will put onto paper and, as I said,

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.900
Columbia was already used in
New York to change the name

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:45.470
of Kings College, so
it's Columbia University,

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:51.510
so Miranda might have
just gotten inspired.

01:03:51.510 --> 01:04:41.360
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.650
What's particular about
all of this is

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:50.470
that Christopher Columbus was
also buried somewhere else and at

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:55.500
that time had been
somewhat forgotten.

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:04.510
