00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:03.283
- What I want to do in this
video is understand two words

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:06.767
that you might hear
associated with parabolas.

00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:10.367
And that is, that is a focus.

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:15.200
That is a focus of a parabola, focus.

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:17.233
And a directrix.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.301
Directrix.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.133
Directrix.

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:24.820
Directrix, right over there.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.867
So what are these things?

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:29.783
Well, a parabola can be defined as

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:31.050
the set of all points,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.517
let me draw arbitrary
axes right over here.

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:39.200
So that's my y axis, this is my x axis.

00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:42.400
This is my x axis.

00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:44.450
And so a parabola can be defined

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.350
as the set of all points
that are equidistant

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.100
to a point and a line.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:53.317
And that point is the
focus of that parabola,

00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:56.135
and that line is the
directrix of the parabola.

00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:57.833
So what am I talking about?

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.183
So let's give ourselves a point.

00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:03.785
So let's say this point right over here,

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:05.484
and we can even say that that is the point

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:08.817
let's say that's the point,
let's say the x coordinate is a,

00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:12.567
and the y coordinate is b right over here.

00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:15.683
So that is the point (a, b).

00:01:15.683 --> 00:01:18.750
And then let's give ourselves
a line for the directrix.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.117
And actually I'm going to
do this in a different color

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:22.451
instead of just white, cos I
did the coordinates in white.

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:24.651
So I will do it in this magenta color.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.984
So that's (a,b) is the focus.

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:30.867
And let's say y=c is the directrix.

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:34.385
So this right over here is the line,

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:38.766
this right over here is
the line y is equal to c.

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:42.284
So this on the y axis right
over there, that is c,

00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:45.967
this is the line y=c.

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:49.318
So a parabola, what does it mean to be

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.117
the set of all points that are equidistant

00:01:51.117 --> 00:01:53.717
between a point and this line?

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:55.217
Let's think about what
those points might be.

00:01:55.217 --> 00:01:58.350
Well, this point right
over here would be halfway

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.083
between, between this
point, between the focus

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:03.584
and the directrix.

00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:06.717
And then as we move away from x=a,

00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:10.434
you're going to get points
anywhere along this curve.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.701
Which is a parabola.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.317
And you might be saying,
wait, I don't get this,

00:02:15.317 --> 00:02:18.551
I don't get why points along this curve

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:20.084
are going to be equidistant.

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:22.917
Well, let's just eyeball the distances.

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:25.383
So this one, this distance,

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:26.850
and obviously I'm drawing it by hand

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.817
so it's not going to
be completely precise,

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.917
that distance needs to be
equal to that distance.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.451
Well, that seems believable.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.184
Now this, if we take this point

00:02:34.184 --> 00:02:35.817
right over here of the parabola,

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:39.484
this distance needs to be
the same as that distance.

00:02:39.484 --> 00:02:40.950
Well, that seems believable.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.218
If you take this point on the parabola,

00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:46.650
this distance, this distance needs to be

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.134
the same as this distance.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.017
So hopefully you get
what I'm talking about

00:02:51.017 --> 00:02:53.683
when I say that the parabola
is a set of all points

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:57.250
that are equidistant to this
focus and this directrix.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.217
So any point along this parabola,

00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:02.640
this point right over here,
this point right over here,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.217
the distance to the focus,
the distance to the focus,

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:10.883
should be the same as the
distance, as the distance

00:03:11.383 --> 00:03:12.750
to the directrix.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.550
Now, what you might realize
is when you're taking

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.914
the distance between a point and a point,

00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:20.117
the distance can, it'll be
at, I guess you could say

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:21.350
it could be at an angle.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.483
This one's straight up and down,

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:25.057
this one is going from the
top left to the bottom right.

00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:27.217
But when you take the distance
from a point to a line,

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:29.517
you essentially drop a perpendicular,

00:03:29.517 --> 00:03:31.417
you essentially go straight down.

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:32.817
Or if the parabola was down here, you'd go

00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:35.017
straight up to find that distance.

00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:37.584
These are all, these are all right angles

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.717
right over here.

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:41.252
So that's all a focus and a directrix is.

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:45.317
And every parabola is going to
have a focus and a directrix,

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:47.684
because every parabola
is the set of all points

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:49.884
that are equidistant to some focus

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:52.150
and some directrix.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.583
So that's what they are.

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:55.750
In future videos we'll try to think about,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.551
how do you relate these points,

00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:00.378
the focus and directrix, to the actual,

00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:03.317
to the actual equation,
or the actual equation

00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:04.967
for a parabola.
