00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.879
We humans understand borders and border walls.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.720
Animals, however, do not.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.950
Animals stand to possibly be the most affected
by the proposal to build a wall along the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.020
U.S.-Mexico border.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.290
There are dozens of species that have moved
freely across that border for centuries.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.350
They do so because the natural environment
around the U.S. and Mexico border isn’t

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.680
all that different.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.060
The only thing that differentiates those two
pieces of land, is that humans have divided

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.849
it with an invisible line.

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.610
So, not understanding our social and political
structures, animals cross unknowingly back

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.270
and forth over the line in search of food
or water or mates, or whatever.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.750
But when former president George W. Bush passed
the Secure Fence Act in 2006, 670 miles of

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.760
walls and fences were actually built.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.980
And this gave scientists a glimpse into what
happens when animals are confronted with human

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.980
walls.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.320
They discovered that animals become confused
when they approached the wall, unsure about

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.920
what to do next.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.900
Researchers documented mountain lions, ocelots
and deer as having their natural movements

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.110
disrupted.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.250
Some bison have even tried to climb over the
barbed wire fence to get to water supplies.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.000
This phenomenon is not unique to the United
States..

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
Europe is witnessing an intense proliferation
of border walls due to the ongoing refugee

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.370
crisis there, and animals are dying as a consequence.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.550
Some individual animals are getting physically
caught in the fences.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.870
But then there are entire species, like the
brown bear and eurasian lynx, that are having

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.190
their ranges simply cut off from them.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.190
Back in the U.S., scientists are now most
concerned with what an even longer wall might

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.500
do to species whose populations are dwindling.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.560
Cutting off populations on either side of
the border could mean further harming already

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.030
threatened species.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.240
There are about 111 endangered or at-risk
of being endangered species along the border,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.030
including the last known jaguar left in all
of the United States.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.299
The only chance at rebuilding that population
would be if the jaguars that live in Mexico’s

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.880
Sierra Madre Occidental forests would find
their way up to the U.S. and mate with that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.450
last remaining jaguar.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.220
A wall would make that nearly impossible.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.000
Same goes for the gray wolf.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.980
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act stipulates
that any construction project that involves

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.690
the federal government must be reviewed by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for any

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.650
endangered populations who might be impacted
by the construction.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.950
So far, the federal government has not filed
such a review for the newly proposed wall.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.250
Humans have many options when crossing borders.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.830
Sure, a wall makes things more difficult,
but people can find ways over, under, and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.420
around tall structures.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.320
It takes animals a lot longer to adapt to
major changes in their environment like these,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.540
and for some species, it might take them long
enough so that they become extinct.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.380
