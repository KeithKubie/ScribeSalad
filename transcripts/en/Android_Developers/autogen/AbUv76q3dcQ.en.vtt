don't wanna say only two schools of

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
don't wanna say only two schools of
 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.250
don't wanna say only two schools of
thought but i guess to two potential

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
thought but i guess to two potential
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.559
thought but i guess to two potential
schools of thought in indesign and

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
schools of thought in indesign and
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.179
schools of thought in indesign and
you know one is let's make everything

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189
you know one is let's make everything
 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.920
you know one is let's make everything
look like real live objects and have

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930
look like real live objects and have
 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.449
look like real live objects and have
wood in the background and real kind of

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459
wood in the background and real kind of
 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.699
wood in the background and real kind of
you know crumply paper effects and

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709
you know crumply paper effects and
 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.289
you know crumply paper effects and
things like that and the other is let's

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299
things like that and the other is let's
 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.190
things like that and the other is let's
go for a more kind of like simple you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200
go for a more kind of like simple you
 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.789
go for a more kind of like simple you
know not want to say utilitarian but

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799
know not want to say utilitarian but
 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.220
know not want to say utilitarian but
more minimalist style and these aren't

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230
more minimalist style and these aren't
 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.890
more minimalist style and these aren't
of course the only two but if you were

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
of course the only two but if you were
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.589
of course the only two but if you were
to compare something like hollow versus

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599
to compare something like hollow versus
 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.199
to compare something like hollow versus
something like you know the design the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
something like you know the design the
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.599
something like you know the design the
beautiful notes evokes they are

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609
beautiful notes evokes they are
 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.030
beautiful notes evokes they are
different and so there's you know it's

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
different and so there's you know it's
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.679
different and so there's you know it's
it's definitely a design decision it's

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689
it's definitely a design decision it's
 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.050
it's definitely a design decision it's
there's no saying that one is a hundred

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060
there's no saying that one is a hundred
 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.860
there's no saying that one is a hundred
percent correct and the other is wrong

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870
percent correct and the other is wrong
 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.569
percent correct and the other is wrong
but you know I think on Android we

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
but you know I think on Android we
 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.110
but you know I think on Android we
generally prefer the the latter kind of

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120
generally prefer the the latter kind of
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.550
generally prefer the the latter kind of
more the the minimal the more kind of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560
more the the minimal the more kind of
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.649
more the the minimal the more kind of
hollow style and you know we have you

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659
hollow style and you know we have you
 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.209
hollow style and you know we have you
know we have Android design that talks

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219
know we have Android design that talks
 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.860
know we have Android design that talks
about all the design philosophy behind

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870
about all the design philosophy behind
 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.439
about all the design philosophy behind
it and why it makes sense and things

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449
it and why it makes sense and things
 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.030
it and why it makes sense and things
like that but we at the end of the day

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
like that but we at the end of the day
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.429
like that but we at the end of the day
is I think the most important thing is

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439
is I think the most important thing is
 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.470
is I think the most important thing is
the users get it the users understand it

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480
the users get it the users understand it
 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.499
the users get it the users understand it
and is it fast and I think that the more

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509
and is it fast and I think that the more
 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.960
and is it fast and I think that the more
visual complexity you add to a nap in

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
visual complexity you add to a nap in
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.529
visual complexity you add to a nap in
general the the slower it gets the

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539
general the the slower it gets the
 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.170
general the the slower it gets the
potentially more confusing it gets and

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
potentially more confusing it gets and
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.430
potentially more confusing it gets and
so that's just one thing to watch out

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440
so that's just one thing to watch out
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.490
so that's just one thing to watch out
for in general when I looked at this app

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500
for in general when I looked at this app
 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.180
for in general when I looked at this app
on a tablet on a phone the the big

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190
on a tablet on a phone the the big
 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.610
on a tablet on a phone the the big
problem wasn't so much with the visual

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620
problem wasn't so much with the visual
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.740
problem wasn't so much with the visual
effects in styling the big problem with

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750
effects in styling the big problem with
 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.290
effects in styling the big problem with
me was the perceived latency for example

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300
me was the perceived latency for example
 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.810
me was the perceived latency for example
one of my pieces of feedback was when

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820
one of my pieces of feedback was when
 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.149
one of my pieces of feedback was when
you rotate the tablet from portrait into

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159
you rotate the tablet from portrait into
 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.070
you rotate the tablet from portrait into
landscape there's this kind of long

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080
landscape there's this kind of long
 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.399
landscape there's this kind of long
animation that takes place that kind of

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409
animation that takes place that kind of
 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.010
animation that takes place that kind of
takes me out of my contacts I don't know

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020
takes me out of my contacts I don't know
 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.450
takes me out of my contacts I don't know
if you'll see it on a phone yeah you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460
if you'll see it on a phone yeah you
 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.839
if you'll see it on a phone yeah you
will so it kind of its it takes a little

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849
will so it kind of its it takes a little
 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.110
will so it kind of its it takes a little
too long for me I think and you know I'd

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120
too long for me I think and you know I'd
 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.110
too long for me I think and you know I'd
rather the developer I'd say spent more

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120
rather the developer I'd say spent more
 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.659
rather the developer I'd say spent more
time on ensuring that for example like

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669
time on ensuring that for example like
 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.700
time on ensuring that for example like
the currently selected note was still

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710
the currently selected note was still
 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.589
the currently selected note was still
highlighted across orientation changes

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599
highlighted across orientation changes
 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.149
highlighted across orientation changes
rather than having this kind of big

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159
rather than having this kind of big
 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.249
rather than having this kind of big
animation so I think in general does

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259
animation so I think in general does
 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.189
animation so I think in general does
nothing I guess wrong with the styling

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199
nothing I guess wrong with the styling
 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.390
nothing I guess wrong with the styling
but I think that it can add the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400
but I think that it can add the
 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.769
but I think that it can add the
perceived latency add the visual

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779
perceived latency add the visual
 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.300
perceived latency add the visual
complexity that slows

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310
complexity that slows
 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.250
complexity that slows
down the app so that's kind of my

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260
down the app so that's kind of my
 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.290
down the app so that's kind of my
overall feelings yeah I felt the same

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300
overall feelings yeah I felt the same
 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.060
overall feelings yeah I felt the same
way that was the the biggest sort of

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070
way that was the the biggest sort of
 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.830
way that was the the biggest sort of
general piece of feedback i heard the

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840
general piece of feedback i heard the
 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.200
general piece of feedback i heard the
developers of this was that it seems

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210
developers of this was that it seems
 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.990
developers of this was that it seems
really slow that rotational latency is a

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000
really slow that rotational latency is a
 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.970
really slow that rotational latency is a
great example because it's probably

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980
great example because it's probably
 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.980
great example because it's probably
about five seconds from when you turn it

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990
about five seconds from when you turn it
 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.230
about five seconds from when you turn it
around so I'll show you here when you

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240
around so I'll show you here when you
 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.650
around so I'll show you here when you
turn it it's a two three or five six

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660
turn it it's a two three or five six
 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.800
turn it it's a two three or five six
seven it's like seven seconds before you

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810
seven it's like seven seconds before you
 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.660
seven it's like seven seconds before you
get from where we where you work for

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670
get from where we where you work for
 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.030
get from where we where you work for
exactly the same place in the UI we you

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040
exactly the same place in the UI we you
 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.930
exactly the same place in the UI we you
know you're ready here to tap something

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940
know you're ready here to tap something
 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.070
know you're ready here to tap something
not seasick we can go through and you

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080
not seasick we can go through and you
 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050
not seasick we can go through and you
see the same sort of thing so and

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060
see the same sort of thing so and
 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.550
see the same sort of thing so and
similarly as well I found that when i

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560
similarly as well I found that when i
 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.740
similarly as well I found that when i
was doing this rotation it was sort of

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750
was doing this rotation it was sort of
 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.170
was doing this rotation it was sort of
losing state till you don't go back to

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180
losing state till you don't go back to
 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.970
losing state till you don't go back to
where you were so i don't know if you

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980
where you were so i don't know if you
 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.500
where you were so i don't know if you
sort of saw the workflow i was doing

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510
sort of saw the workflow i was doing
 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.700
sort of saw the workflow i was doing
there but i had already started to

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710
there but i had already started to
 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.680
there but i had already started to
create a new note and simply by rotating

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690
create a new note and simply by rotating
 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.330
create a new note and simply by rotating
the screen through landscape back to

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340
the screen through landscape back to
 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.250
the screen through landscape back to
portrait it's gone back to the beginning

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260
portrait it's gone back to the beginning
 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.860
portrait it's gone back to the beginning
so the big thing you want to do is you

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870
so the big thing you want to do is you
 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.530
so the big thing you want to do is you
always want to be maintaining state for

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540
always want to be maintaining state for
 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.270
always want to be maintaining state for
your application why where people switch

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280
your application why where people switch
 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.860
your application why where people switch
in and out of it but that's particularly

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870
in and out of it but that's particularly
 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.150
in and out of it but that's particularly
the case when you're doing rotations

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160
the case when you're doing rotations
 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.490
the case when you're doing rotations
there shouldn't be a difference between

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500
there shouldn't be a difference between
 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.960
there shouldn't be a difference between
yeah we're talking with virtual sugar

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970
yeah we're talking with virtual sugar
 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.100
yeah we're talking with virtual sugar
cause you know this state you shouldn't

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110
cause you know this state you shouldn't
 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.300
cause you know this state you shouldn't
have to start again from what you were

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310
have to start again from what you were
 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.130
have to start again from what you were
so that's a sort of key piece of

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140
so that's a sort of key piece of
 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.680
so that's a sort of key piece of
feedback is there's one more thing I

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690
feedback is there's one more thing I
 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.290
feedback is there's one more thing I
want to add around the styling so on a

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300
want to add around the styling so on a
 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.060
want to add around the styling so on a
tablet and I can't really show here but

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070
tablet and I can't really show here but
 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.370
tablet and I can't really show here but
the the styling I feel like is also

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380
the the styling I feel like is also
 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.610
the the styling I feel like is also
incomplete you know they're most of the

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620
incomplete you know they're most of the
 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.680
incomplete you know they're most of the
app has this kind of like a faux wood

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690
app has this kind of like a faux wood
 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.840
app has this kind of like a faux wood
effect and the the paper stacks in the

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850
effect and the the paper stacks in the
 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.640
effect and the the paper stacks in the
background but then there's parts of it

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650
background but then there's parts of it
 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.260
background but then there's parts of it
that are that are kind of completely

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270
that are that are kind of completely
 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.690
that are that are kind of completely
unstyled like for example so I the

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700
unstyled like for example so I the
 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.970
unstyled like for example so I the
core part of the experience of writing

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980
core part of the experience of writing
 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.360
core part of the experience of writing
notes and taking notes is the note view

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370
notes and taking notes is the note view
 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.790
notes and taking notes is the note view
in the note edit text box itself and

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800
in the note edit text box itself and
 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.920
in the note edit text box itself and
that was pretty much not really given

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930
that was pretty much not really given
 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.650
that was pretty much not really given
any love it's using the default font

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660
any love it's using the default font
 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.810
any love it's using the default font
which was fine but things like line

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820
which was fine but things like line
 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.640
which was fine but things like line
spacing things like padding things like

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650
spacing things like padding things like
 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.430
spacing things like padding things like
font size those are fundamental in any

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440
font size those are fundamental in any
 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.740
font size those are fundamental in any
note app and I feel like that was

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750
note app and I feel like that was
 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.140
note app and I feel like that was
something that wasn't really touched on

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150
something that wasn't really touched on

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640
those icons are also designed for hollow
 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.870
those icons are also designed for hollow
so the iconography in the styling you

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880
so the iconography in the styling you
 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.310
so the iconography in the styling you
know those are two separate things so in

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.320
know those are two separate things so in
 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.480
know those are two separate things so in
this app what I would recommend is

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490
this app what I would recommend is
 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.820
this app what I would recommend is
keeping the core shapes of the icons

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:55.830
keeping the core shapes of the icons
 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.240
keeping the core shapes of the icons
like for example share should still be

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.250
like for example share should still be
 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.550
like for example share should still be
you know those three circles but apply

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560
you know those three circles but apply
 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.820
you know those three circles but apply
the styling that fits in with your app

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:03.830
the styling that fits in with your app
 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.500
the styling that fits in with your app
you know it's it feels kind of two

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:06.510
you know it's it feels kind of two
 

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.480
you know it's it feels kind of two
disparate those two separate kind of

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.490
disparate those two separate kind of
 

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.790
disparate those two separate kind of
styles between the app and those icon so

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800
styles between the app and those icon so
 

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.080
styles between the app and those icon so
it's another point of view that's it

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.090
it's another point of view that's it
 

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.990
it's another point of view that's it
that's a good point so we've got the app

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000
that's a good point so we've got the app
 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.930
that's a good point so we've got the app
up on it on a tablet here at the moment

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:16.940
up on it on a tablet here at the moment
 

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.890
up on it on a tablet here at the moment
so this is where you're referring to

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900
so this is where you're referring to
 

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.200
so this is where you're referring to
here obviously you can see the icons on

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.210
here obviously you can see the icons on
 

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.680
here obviously you can see the icons on
the on the side here yes you say look

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:24.690
the on the side here yes you say look
 

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.020
the on the side here yes you say look
good but you know shouldn't be exactly

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.030
good but you know shouldn't be exactly
 

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.390
good but you know shouldn't be exactly
the same ones and it was this the bit

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400
the same ones and it was this the bit
 

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.890
the same ones and it was this the bit
what you talked about which we needed

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900
what you talked about which we needed
 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.660
what you talked about which we needed
more wealth so the the actual text

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:32.670
more wealth so the the actual text
 

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.970
more wealth so the the actual text
editor for each night yeah exactly so if

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:34.980
editor for each night yeah exactly so if
 

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.500
editor for each night yeah exactly so if
you if you have multiple lines of text

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.510
you if you have multiple lines of text
 

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.780
you if you have multiple lines of text
here you'll notice that there's I think

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:38.790
here you'll notice that there's I think
 

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.760
here you'll notice that there's I think
it's like a 1 point 0 or 1 point 1 or

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:40.770
it's like a 1 point 0 or 1 point 1 or
 

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.030
it's like a 1 point 0 or 1 point 1 or
something line spacing so I mean if you

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.040
something line spacing so I mean if you
 

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.500
something line spacing so I mean if you
have like a really long line it starts

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:45.510
have like a really long line it starts
 

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.670
have like a really long line it starts
rapping it just doesn't it feels a bit I

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680
rapping it just doesn't it feels a bit I
 

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.490
rapping it just doesn't it feels a bit I
don't want to say unprofessional but it

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500
don't want to say unprofessional but it
 

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.230
don't want to say unprofessional but it
feels like more love should have been

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240
feels like more love should have been
 

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.510
feels like more love should have been
given here clearly you know the design

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:56.520
given here clearly you know the design
 

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.850
given here clearly you know the design
team for this app put a lot of effort

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860
team for this app put a lot of effort
 

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.800
team for this app put a lot of effort
into you know kind of the the chrome

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:00.810
into you know kind of the the chrome
 

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.620
into you know kind of the the chrome
around this this fundamental kind of

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:03.630
around this this fundamental kind of
 

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.620
around this this fundamental kind of
centerpiece but I think that more love

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:06.630
centerpiece but I think that more love
 

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.820
centerpiece but I think that more love
should be given to the actual

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:07.830
should be given to the actual
 

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.190
should be given to the actual
note-taking experience yeah that's a

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200
note-taking experience yeah that's a
 

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.070
note-taking experience yeah that's a
that's a fair call yeah good comment the

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080
that's a fair call yeah good comment the
 

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.390
that's a fair call yeah good comment the
other thing that I noticed as well if we

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:14.400
other thing that I noticed as well if we
 

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.880
other thing that I noticed as well if we
switch back to the phone I'm not sure if

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:16.890
switch back to the phone I'm not sure if
 

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.100
switch back to the phone I'm not sure if
you'll be able to see this very well but

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.110
you'll be able to see this very well but
 

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.160

if you compare that the tablet the

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740
if you compare that the tablet the
 

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.220
if you compare that the tablet the
tablet actually has the right higher res

grainy here also the I've made a note

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:54.590
grainy here also the I've made a note
 

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.760
grainy here also the I've made a note
here that the the action bar appears

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:56.770
here that the the action bar appears
 

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.740
here that the the action bar appears
inconsistent so I'm not entirely sure

00:09:59.740 --> 00:09:59.750
inconsistent so I'm not entirely sure
 

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.960
inconsistent so I'm not entirely sure
what I meant by that so that that looks

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:01.970
what I meant by that so that that looks
 

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.610
what I meant by that so that that looks
fine let's see but I guess it's little

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:06.620
fine let's see but I guess it's little
 

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.590
fine let's see but I guess it's little
things like what I would expect to see

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600
things like what I would expect to see
 

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.450
things like what I would expect to see
on this screen is is a way to get back

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:10.460
on this screen is is a way to get back
 

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.090
on this screen is is a way to get back
to the previous screen and they manual

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:13.100
to the previous screen and they manual
 

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.560
to the previous screen and they manual
to the home screen something like that

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:14.570
to the home screen something like that
 

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.690
to the home screen something like that
and I don't have anything on the action

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:16.700
and I don't have anything on the action
 

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.210
and I don't have anything on the action
bar to help me do that pretty sure if I

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.220
bar to help me do that pretty sure if I
 

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.990
bar to help me do that pretty sure if I
hit back no back exits um so that's

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000
hit back no back exits um so that's
 

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.730
hit back no back exits um so that's
that's a little bit confusing so I don't

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:24.740
that's a little bit confusing so I don't
 

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.890
that's a little bit confusing so I don't
know how to get from sort of a new note

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:26.900
know how to get from sort of a new note
 

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.230
know how to get from sort of a new note
that I've just edited back to the to the

think what I'm supposedly is here so you

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720
think what I'm supposedly is here so you
 

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.790
think what I'm supposedly is here so you
look in that fragment transaction

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800
look in that fragment transaction
 

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.620
look in that fragment transaction
they're missing an ad two backs that

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:38.630
they're missing an ad two backs that
 

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.270
they're missing an ad two backs that
call and not updating the action bar

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:40.280
call and not updating the action bar
 

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.580
call and not updating the action bar
according you look so high yeah I think

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:42.590
according you look so high yeah I think
 

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.660
according you look so high yeah I think
I need to save an iso on posner and

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:46.670
I need to save an iso on posner and
 

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.780
I need to save an iso on posner and
sending it to email nice yeah so I think

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:49.790
sending it to email nice yeah so I think
 

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.760
sending it to email nice yeah so I think
in some cases it will work but than in

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:51.770
in some cases it will work but than in
 

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:52.960
in some cases it will work but than in
others it doesn't that's definitely

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:52.970
others it doesn't that's definitely
 

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.700
others it doesn't that's definitely
confusing you want the action but I have

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:54.710
confusing you want the action but I have
 

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.560
confusing you want the action but I have

Jesus surgery I'll put that into your

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:25.330
Jesus surgery I'll put that into your
 

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.170
Jesus surgery I'll put that into your
action bar yeah so then you can you can

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:28.180
action bar yeah so then you can you can
 

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.460
action bar yeah so then you can you can
effectively do that so rather than

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.470
effectively do that so rather than
 

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.530
effectively do that so rather than
having this search you would end up with

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:31.540
having this search you would end up with
 

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.660
having this search you would end up with
a search view which would come along on

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:33.670
a search view which would come along on
 

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.900
a search view which would come along on
the top so yeah that's that's probably a

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:36.910
the top so yeah that's that's probably a
 

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.610
the top so yeah that's that's probably a
good idea where to try and make it more

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:38.620

be a bit of a learning experience for us

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:50.650
be a bit of a learning experience for us
 

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.430
be a bit of a learning experience for us
as well as we go through this but let's

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440
as well as we go through this but let's
 

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.030
as well as we go through this but let's
have a look at G apps launcher so let's

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040
have a look at G apps launcher so let's
 

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.610
have a look at G apps launcher so let's
see if I download this and an open it up

00:13:59.610 --> 00:13:59.620
see if I download this and an open it up
 

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.150
see if I download this and an open it up
first thing I get is this a big screen

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160
first thing I get is this a big screen
 

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.090
first thing I get is this a big screen
of text which I believe tells me what

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:06.100
of text which I believe tells me what
 

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.800
of text which I believe tells me what
the app is and how I'm supposed to use

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:07.810
the app is and how I'm supposed to use
 

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.020
the app is and how I'm supposed to use
it so gf's launcher is in fact a widget

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.030
it so gf's launcher is in fact a widget
 

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.210
it so gf's launcher is in fact a widget
at home screen widget and this is the

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.220
at home screen widget and this is the
 

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.319
at home screen widget and this is the
the way that they've gone

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:13.329
the way that they've gone
 

00:14:13.329 --> 00:14:15.720
the way that they've gone
to try and explain what it is and how it

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:15.730
to try and explain what it is and how it
 

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.369
to try and explain what it is and how it
works so it says an interesting approach

00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:19.379
works so it says an interesting approach
 

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:22.049
works so it says an interesting approach

and tell you to install the widget it's
 

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.809
and tell you to install the widget it's
not necessarily a bad approach though I

00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:30.819
not necessarily a bad approach though I
 

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:33.359
not necessarily a bad approach though I
would probably not have gone a partial

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:33.369
would probably not have gone a partial
 

00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:35.069
would probably not have gone a partial

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:01.119
screen activity here for configuration
 

00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:03.569
screen activity here for configuration
interfaces that usually seems to work

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:03.579
interfaces that usually seems to work
 

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:11.669
interfaces that usually seems to work
best actually from here and it might

00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:11.679
best actually from here and it might
 

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:13.229
best actually from here and it might
also be a good idea to know that's

00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:13.239
also be a good idea to know that's
 

00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:15.210
also be a good idea to know that's
technically possible to guide users

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:15.220
technically possible to guide users
 

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.979
technically possible to guide users
directly to the place where widgets

00:15:19.979 --> 00:15:19.989
directly to the place where widgets
 

00:15:19.989 --> 00:15:22.139
directly to the place where widgets
actually start and the all apps folder

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:22.149
actually start and the all apps folder
 

00:15:22.149 --> 00:15:26.519
actually start and the all apps folder
because I noticed that the text is

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:26.529
because I noticed that the text is
 

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:28.889
because I noticed that the text is
actually a little bit incorrect at least

00:15:28.889 --> 00:15:28.899
actually a little bit incorrect at least
 

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:31.619
actually a little bit incorrect at least
for as far as I CSS concerned I get the

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:31.629
for as far as I CSS concerned I get the
 

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:33.780
for as far as I CSS concerned I get the
wrong instruction yeah you can really

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:33.790
wrong instruction yeah you can really
 

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.159
wrong instruction yeah you can really
say a long press on the home screen home

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:38.169
say a long press on the home screen home
 

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:40.199
say a long press on the home screen home
panels anymore in order to access

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:40.209
panels anymore in order to access
 

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:42.629
panels anymore in order to access
widgets so that might be something you

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639
widgets so that might be something you
 

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:44.639
widgets so that might be something you
won't fix yeah so and that's something

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:44.649
won't fix yeah so and that's something
 

00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:45.840
won't fix yeah so and that's something
to consider as well I mean you can just

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:45.850
to consider as well I mean you can just
 

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.970
to consider as well I mean you can just
go as simple as just changing the text

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:47.980
go as simple as just changing the text
 

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.669
go as simple as just changing the text
for different versions or perhaps you

00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:50.679
for different versions or perhaps you
 

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:51.989
for different versions or perhaps you
know it's a slightly riskier approach

00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:51.999
know it's a slightly riskier approach
 

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:53.519
know it's a slightly riskier approach
but assuming that people who have

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:53.529
but assuming that people who have
 

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:55.079
but assuming that people who have
downloaded it know how to install

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:55.089
downloaded it know how to install
 

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:57.090
downloaded it know how to install
widgets for their phone and sort of just

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:57.100

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.220
widgets for their phone and sort of just
say this is a widget this is how you go

00:15:59.220 --> 00:15:59.230
say this is a widget this is how you go
 

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.579
say this is a widget this is how you go
and install it rather than sort of

trying to give the detailed instructions
for someone who perhaps this is the

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:05.230
for someone who perhaps this is the
 

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.720
for someone who perhaps this is the
first time you've installed the widget

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:06.730
first time you've installed the widget
 

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.819
first time you've installed the widget
if so it seems less like whether they

00:16:08.819 --> 00:16:08.829
if so it seems less like whether they
 

00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:10.079
if so it seems less like whether they
would have installed your app to begin

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:10.089

is the right way of doing this I believe

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:09.550
is the right way of doing this I believe

it's going to show us a preview of what

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:11.080
it's going to show us a preview of what
 

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.210
it's going to show us a preview of what
it's going to look like along the top

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:12.220
it's going to look like along the top
 

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.610
it's going to look like along the top
and then down here it's providing us

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:14.620
and then down here it's providing us
 

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.120
and then down here it's providing us
with all the difference I guess Google

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:18.130
with all the difference I guess Google
 

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.470

applications which you can have and

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480
applications which you can have and
 

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.060
applications which you can have and
decide whether it opens the app or a web

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.070
decide whether it opens the app or a web
 

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.300
decide whether it opens the app or a web
page and which ones displays it can use

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:24.310
page and which ones displays it can use
 

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.490
page and which ones displays it can use
to that you can see that they're the

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:26.500
to that you can see that they're the

the different apps which it's providing
 

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.980
the different apps which it's providing
so I guess this is going to provide us

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:31.990
so I guess this is going to provide us
 

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.500
so I guess this is going to provide us

just Andy now I would say that the

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:38.830
just Andy now I would say that the
 

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.830
just Andy now I would say that the
workflow here is a little bit confused

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840
workflow here is a little bit confused
 

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.450
workflow here is a little bit confused
so you've got the preview at the top

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:42.460
so you've got the preview at the top
 

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.660
so you've got the preview at the top
then you've got an options button so

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:45.670
then you've got an options button so
 

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.010
then you've got an options button so
transparent is going to decide whether

transparent is going to decide whether
it has a background and we put it on the

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:53.890
I guess either bought creating the
 

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.280
I guess either bought creating the
widget or to create a widget and then

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:56.290
widget or to create a widget and then
 

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.720
widget or to create a widget and then
underneath you've got the configuration

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:57.730
underneath you've got the configuration
 

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.330
underneath you've got the configuration
to select which ones they are now from a

work perspective it's kind of back to

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:02.890
work perspective it's kind of back to
 

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.980
work perspective it's kind of back to
front upside down and you know you're

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:04.990
front upside down and you know you're
 

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.420
front upside down and you know you're
kind of starting at the bottom and then

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:06.430
kind of starting at the bottom and then
 

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.070
kind of starting at the bottom and then
going back up into the middle and

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080
going back up into the middle and
 

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.960
going back up into the middle and
referring to the top so it all kind of

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:09.970
referring to the top so it all kind of
 

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.820
referring to the top so it all kind of
seems a little bit confused to me yeah

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:11.830
seems a little bit confused to me yeah
 

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.500
seems a little bit confused to me yeah
3x perspective what would you say would

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:13.510
3x perspective what would you say would
 

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.720
3x perspective what would you say would
be the right order and put the stuff

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:15.730
be the right order and put the stuff
 

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:24.750
be the right order and put the stuff
together um I would say that the safe

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760
together um I would say that the safe
 

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.120
together um I would say that the safe
cancel probably should be at the bottom

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.130
cancel probably should be at the bottom
 

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.490
cancel probably should be at the bottom

scroll hours because you have a

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.700
relatively lengthy configuration
a number of apps in here that can that

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:41.710
a number of apps in here that can that
 

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.880
a number of apps in here that can that
you can configure under on to the panel

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:43.890
you can configure under on to the panel
 

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.710
you can configure under on to the panel
so probably at the bottom makes sense if

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720
so probably at the bottom makes sense if
 

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.380
so probably at the bottom makes sense if
you have a regular action bar at the top

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:49.390
you have a regular action bar at the top
 

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.200
you have a regular action bar at the top
here you might as well also use save

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.210
here you might as well also use save
 

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.120
here you might as well also use save
cancel in the action button to do that

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.130
cancel in the action button to do that
 

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.970
cancel in the action button to do that
in a couple of places so for example if

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:56.980
in a couple of places so for example if
 

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.130
in a couple of places so for example if
you create a new contact you can observe

00:18:59.130 --> 00:18:59.140
you create a new contact you can observe
 

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.220
you create a new contact you can observe
that you know accepting you contact or

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:02.230
that you know accepting you contact or
 

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.410
that you know accepting you contact or
cancelling all of it is accessible to

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:04.420
cancelling all of it is accessible to
 

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.590
cancelling all of it is accessible to
the action bar so that's another space

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600
the action bar so that's another space
 

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.430
the action bar so that's another space
efficient and consistent place of

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440
efficient and consistent place of
 

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.440
efficient and consistent place of
displaying that functionality yeah that

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:16.450
displaying that functionality yeah that
 

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.970
displaying that functionality yeah that
seems very soon I mean you know you're

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:17.980
seems very soon I mean you know you're
 

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.530
seems very soon I mean you know you're
actually using up any extra space right

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:19.540
actually using up any extra space right
 

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.090
actually using up any extra space right

you're gaining space and if you are

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:22.900
you're gaining space and if you are
 

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.710
you're gaining space and if you are
putting on underneath it's just lived

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720
putting on underneath it's just lived
 

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.730
putting on underneath it's just lived
the other thing I'll point out as well

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:26.740
the other thing I'll point out as well
 

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.670
the other thing I'll point out as well
it's like it's really nice styling but

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:29.680
it's like it's really nice styling but
 

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.860
it's like it's really nice styling but
we're not using holo styling here which

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:31.870
we're not using holo styling here which
 

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.540
we're not using holo styling here which
is unfortunate it would be nice to see

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:33.550
is unfortunate it would be nice to see
 

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.320
is unfortunate it would be nice to see
this its menu button go away it's got an

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:37.330
this its menu button go away it's got an
 

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.540
this its menu button go away it's got an

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:39.550
about which I guess brings up the same
 

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.640
about which I guess brings up the same
thing at the beginning you know that

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:41.650
thing at the beginning you know that
 

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.110
thing at the beginning you know that
would be better as an action bar item if

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120
would be better as an action bar item if
 

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.490
would be better as an action bar item if
you're going to have it in there but you

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:44.500
you're going to have it in there but you
 

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.900
you're going to have it in there but you
definitely don't want the the menu

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:45.910
definitely don't want the the menu
 

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.330
definitely don't want the the menu

if you had all this holo theme and these

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:49.990
if you had all this holo theme and these
 

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.570
if you had all this holo theme and these
buttons would look a lot nicer as well

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:51.580
buttons would look a lot nicer as well
 

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.820
buttons would look a lot nicer as well
and we just sort of feel like a one

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:53.830
and we just sort of feel like a one
 

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.330
and we just sort of feel like a one

it's safe and it's going to create our
 

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.950
it's safe and it's going to create our
home screen widget but the other thing I

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960
home screen widget but the other thing I
 

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.410
home screen widget but the other thing I
wanted to mention one missed opportunity

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:04.420
wanted to mention one missed opportunity
 

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.570
wanted to mention one missed opportunity
may be here is in the configuration

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:06.580
may be here is in the configuration
 

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.430

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:12.790
opportunity to shuffle the the icons
 

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.910
opportunity to shuffle the the icons
around so that then an order that they

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:14.920
around so that then an order that they
 

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.130
around so that then an order that they
prefer that doesn't seem to be possible

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.140
prefer that doesn't seem to be possible
 

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.470
prefer that doesn't seem to be possible
yeah you're right I think that there is

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480
yeah you're right I think that there is
 

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.660
yeah you're right I think that there is
a way unless it's defined by the order

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:21.670
a way unless it's defined by the order
 

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.520
a way unless it's defined by the order
in which you add them I don't think so i

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:23.530
in which you add them I don't think so i
 

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.870
in which you add them I don't think so i
think it's just a simple to say yeah

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880
think it's just a simple to say yeah
 

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.130
think it's just a simple to say yeah
that would be really nice to be able to

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.140
that would be really nice to be able to
 

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.710
that would be really nice to be able to
change the order of the items we got in

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720
change the order of the items we got in
 

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.510
change the order of the items we got in
there because when i put this together I

you know activated some then deactivated

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:34.060
you know activated some then deactivated
 

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.600
you know activated some then deactivated
them and that's seemed to determine the

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:36.610
them and that's seemed to determine the
 

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.420
them and that's seemed to determine the
order as you said but it's nice you know

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:39.430
order as you said but it's nice you know
 

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.490
order as you said but it's nice you know
once you're done then to do a final task

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.500
once you're done then to do a final task
 

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.070
once you're done then to do a final task
know how exactly should look like very

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080
know how exactly should look like very
 

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.310
know how exactly should look like very
cool okay so perfect so now we have the

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320
cool okay so perfect so now we have the
 

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.660
cool okay so perfect so now we have the
widget so we're going to go back to the

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:48.670
widget so we're going to go back to the
 

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.610
widget so we're going to go back to the
home screen here and you can see how

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:50.620
home screen here and you can see how
 

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.139
home screen here and you can see how
it's all

00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:51.149
it's all
 

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:53.060
it's all
laid out now the first thing that I

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.070
laid out now the first thing that I
 

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.879
laid out now the first thing that I
would comment on so this obviously is

00:20:55.879 --> 00:20:55.889
would comment on so this obviously is
 

00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:57.649
would comment on so this obviously is
for google apps if you were doing

00:20:57.649 --> 00:20:57.659
for google apps if you were doing
 

00:20:57.659 --> 00:20:59.560
for google apps if you were doing
something similar for any other company

00:20:59.560 --> 00:20:59.570
something similar for any other company
 

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.549
something similar for any other company
I'd be really cautious about using

00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559
I'd be really cautious about using
 

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:04.279
I'd be really cautious about using
people's trade box so you've got logos

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:04.289
people's trade box so you've got logos
 

00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:06.049
people's trade box so you've got logos
and icons which in this case are all

00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059
and icons which in this case are all
 

00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:09.680
and icons which in this case are all
Google properties yeah I'm not sure

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:09.690
Google properties yeah I'm not sure
 

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.389
Google properties yeah I'm not sure
whether that breaks any terms of service

00:21:11.389 --> 00:21:11.399
whether that breaks any terms of service
 

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:13.430
whether that breaks any terms of service
but I definitely be you know I'd be

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440
but I definitely be you know I'd be
 

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.769
but I definitely be you know I'd be
reluctant about about doing that sort of

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:15.779
reluctant about about doing that sort of
 

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:17.629
reluctant about about doing that sort of
thing so it'd be very careful before you

00:21:17.629 --> 00:21:17.639
thing so it'd be very careful before you
 

00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:19.579
thing so it'd be very careful before you
using sort of names and logos of things

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:19.589
using sort of names and logos of things
 

00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:21.339
using sort of names and logos of things
which belong to other companies

00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:21.349
which belong to other companies
 

00:21:21.349 --> 00:21:24.320
which belong to other companies
generally speaking it's poor practice to

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:24.330
generally speaking it's poor practice to
 

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.209
generally speaking it's poor practice to
do anything in google play or anything

00:21:26.209 --> 00:21:26.219
do anything in google play or anything
 

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:29.389
do anything in google play or anything
like this where you're relying a lot of

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:29.399
like this where you're relying a lot of
 

00:21:29.399 --> 00:21:30.799
like this where you're relying a lot of
people's brains to sort of promote your

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:30.809
people's brains to sort of promote your
 

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:32.930
people's brains to sort of promote your
product obviously in this case you're

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940
product obviously in this case you're
 

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.399
product obviously in this case you're
doing so to make it easier for people to

00:21:34.399 --> 00:21:34.409
doing so to make it easier for people to
 

00:21:34.409 --> 00:21:36.169
doing so to make it easier for people to
get access to these which which seems

00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179
get access to these which which seems
 

00:21:36.179 --> 00:21:39.320
get access to these which which seems
reasonable enough but yet just a word of

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:39.330
reasonable enough but yet just a word of
 

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.359
reasonable enough but yet just a word of
caution I think whenever using someone

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:41.369
caution I think whenever using someone
 

00:21:41.369 --> 00:21:43.519
caution I think whenever using someone

a bit of overlap in the other two by two

00:21:59.539 --> 00:21:59.549
a bit of overlap in the other two by two
 

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:01.609
a bit of overlap in the other two by two
some of the icon seem a little bit close

00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:01.619
some of the icon seem a little bit close
 

00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:04.759
some of the icon seem a little bit close
together that's what I was thinking that

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:04.769
together that's what I was thinking that
 

00:22:04.769 --> 00:22:07.039
together that's what I was thinking that
they're a little bit tightly packed and

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:07.049
they're a little bit tightly packed and
 

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:09.709
they're a little bit tightly packed and
I think this this app would be a good

00:22:09.709 --> 00:22:09.719
I think this this app would be a good
 

00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:11.269
I think this this app would be a good
opportunity of actually having the

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279
opportunity of actually having the
 

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:13.909
opportunity of actually having the
sizeable widgets as well absolutely that

00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919
sizeable widgets as well absolutely that
 

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:17.119
sizeable widgets as well absolutely that
you can space the widgets a little bit

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:17.129
you can space the widgets a little bit
 

00:22:17.129 --> 00:22:19.549
you can space the widgets a little bit
better and adjust them you know to the

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559
better and adjust them you know to the
 

00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:22.190
better and adjust them you know to the
size of your home screen as you look at

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200
size of your home screen as you look at
 

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.839
size of your home screen as you look at
it in the context of your home screen

00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:23.849
it in the context of your home screen
 

00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:25.700
it in the context of your home screen
hmm yeah definitely I mean this is a

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:25.710
hmm yeah definitely I mean this is a
 

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.190
hmm yeah definitely I mean this is a
like ancestry perfect example to be able

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200
like ancestry perfect example to be able
 

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.680
like ancestry perfect example to be able
to do the the resourceful home screen

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:30.690
to do the the resourceful home screen
 

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.209
to do the the resourceful home screen
widget so that they just whip it up in

00:22:32.209 --> 00:22:32.219
widget so that they just whip it up in
 

00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:33.499
widget so that they just whip it up in
theoretically then you could add more

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:33.509
theoretically then you could add more
 

00:22:33.509 --> 00:22:37.159
theoretically then you could add more
things to it too yeah as it expands and

00:22:37.159 --> 00:22:37.169
things to it too yeah as it expands and
 

00:22:37.169 --> 00:22:39.320
things to it too yeah as it expands and
gets bigger there's a little

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:39.330
gets bigger there's a little
 

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.259
gets bigger there's a little
configuration icon you can maybe just

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:42.269
configuration icon you can maybe just
 

00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:46.119
configuration icon you can maybe just
make out which is impossible to touch

00:22:46.119 --> 00:22:46.129
make out which is impossible to touch
 

00:22:46.129 --> 00:22:52.729
make out which is impossible to touch
right yes yeah so once you touch that

00:22:52.729 --> 00:22:52.739
right yes yeah so once you touch that
 

00:22:52.739 --> 00:22:54.200
right yes yeah so once you touch that
you get back in and you can configure

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.210
you get back in and you can configure
 

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.570
you get back in and you can configure
but it's really hard to touch that so

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580
but it's really hard to touch that so
 

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.749
but it's really hard to touch that so
I'd consider trying to make that a more

00:22:59.749 --> 00:22:59.759
I'd consider trying to make that a more
 

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:01.639
I'd consider trying to make that a more
easily touchable touch target you know

00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:01.649
easily touchable touch target you know
 

00:23:01.649 --> 00:23:04.090
easily touchable touch target you know
each other it's a direct effect of how

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.100
each other it's a direct effect of how
 

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.789
each other it's a direct effect of how
we packed everything is so if you space

00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799
we packed everything is so if you space
 

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:09.340
we packed everything is so if you space
it a little bit more evenly than you

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:09.350
it a little bit more evenly than you
 

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:14.799
it a little bit more evenly than you
also have a little bit more more if the

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:14.809
also have a little bit more more if the
 

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:17.860
also have a little bit more more if the
is a developer for 50 laps launcher

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:17.870
is a developer for 50 laps launcher
 

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.640
is a developer for 50 laps launcher
online learning chance ok just saw that

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:21.650
online learning chance ok just saw that
 

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.500
online learning chance ok just saw that
should i check before you i'm going on

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:23.510
should i check before you i'm going on
 

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.270
should i check before you i'm going on
but yeah so that's I think that's the

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280
but yeah so that's I think that's the
 

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.600
but yeah so that's I think that's the
main point of feedback add some some

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:28.610
main point of feedback add some some
 

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.010
main point of feedback add some some
suggestions as well you got some

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:30.020
suggestions as well you got some
 

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.330
suggestions as well you got some
comments perfect yeah and they're very

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:31.340
comments perfect yeah and they're very
 

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.880
comments perfect yeah and they're very
quick but they very much fall in line

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:33.890
quick but they very much fall in line
 

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.860
quick but they very much fall in line
with what you guys are saying but just

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:35.870
with what you guys are saying but just
 

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.260
with what you guys are saying but just
here's kind of a good idea of how this

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:38.270
here's kind of a good idea of how this
 

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.990
here's kind of a good idea of how this
can work in an Android through point O

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000
can work in an Android through point O
 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.990
can work in an Android through point O
in later world basically you have just

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000
in later world basically you have just
 

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.940
in later world basically you have just
one widget right you don't have the 2 x

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:45.950
one widget right you don't have the 2 x
 

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.090
one widget right you don't have the 2 x
24 x 12 x 1 whatever you just have one

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:49.100
24 x 12 x 1 whatever you just have one
 

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.279
24 x 12 x 1 whatever you just have one
widget and in the configuration you

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:51.289
widget and in the configuration you
 

00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:54.549
widget and in the configuration you
specify what size it is how many rows of

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559
specify what size it is how many rows of
 

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:57.330
specify what size it is how many rows of
icons how many columns of icons it is

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:57.340
icons how many columns of icons it is
 

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.470
icons how many columns of icons it is
and then basically it fits that kind of

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480
and then basically it fits that kind of
 

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.700
and then basically it fits that kind of
nested linear layout or whatever into

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:03.710
nested linear layout or whatever into
 

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.299
nested linear layout or whatever into
whatever size the user determines so you

00:24:07.299 --> 00:24:07.309
whatever size the user determines so you
 

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:09.279
whatever size the user determines so you
could potentially have a four by four in

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:09.289
could potentially have a four by four in
 

00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:11.980
could potentially have a four by four in
a five by five or two by two and a four

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:11.990
a five by five or two by two and a four
 

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.409
a five by five or two by two and a four
by four whatever you want right and

00:24:14.409 --> 00:24:14.419
by four whatever you want right and
 

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:16.810
by four whatever you want right and
basically once you specify in that setup

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:16.820
basically once you specify in that setup
 

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.390
basically once you specify in that setup
wizard that configuration stuff how many

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400
wizard that configuration stuff how many
 

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.399
wizard that configuration stuff how many
rows and columns of icons you want you

00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:21.409
rows and columns of icons you want you
 

00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:23.440
rows and columns of icons you want you
can then you should then be able to drag

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:23.450
can then you should then be able to drag
 

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.890
can then you should then be able to drag
and drop from kind of a list of items at

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:26.900
and drop from kind of a list of items at
 

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.680
and drop from kind of a list of items at
the bottom right into the cell that you

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:29.690
the bottom right into the cell that you
 

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.919
the bottom right into the cell that you
want and then right now it has things

00:24:32.919 --> 00:24:32.929
want and then right now it has things
 

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:34.659
want and then right now it has things
like application web page so you can

00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:34.669
like application web page so you can
 

00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:35.860
like application web page so you can
have like Google Search application

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:35.870
have like Google Search application
 

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.169
have like Google Search application
google search web page those should

00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:38.179
google search web page those should
 

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:39.640
google search web page those should
really just be two separate icons that

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:39.650
really just be two separate icons that
 

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.529
really just be two separate icons that
you can drag in there so you can drag in

00:24:41.529 --> 00:24:41.539
you can drag in there so you can drag in
 

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:44.289
you can drag in there so you can drag in
the Google Search application into one

00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:44.299
the Google Search application into one
 

00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:47.620
the Google Search application into one
of the cells and then the google google

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:47.630
of the cells and then the google google
 

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.289
of the cells and then the google google
search google com applicate or web page

00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:50.299
search google com applicate or web page
 

00:24:50.299 --> 00:24:52.299
search google com applicate or web page
into one of the cells so it becomes kind

00:24:52.299 --> 00:24:52.309
into one of the cells so it becomes kind
 

00:24:52.309 --> 00:24:53.860
into one of the cells so it becomes kind
of much easier and much simpler I think

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:53.870
of much easier and much simpler I think
 

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.299
of much easier and much simpler I think
that interface would be a little more

00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:55.309
that interface would be a little more
 

00:24:55.309 --> 00:24:57.190
that interface would be a little more
interactive a little more easy to

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200
interactive a little more easy to
 

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.799
interactive a little more easy to
maintain easy to manage and just a

00:24:59.799 --> 00:24:59.809
maintain easy to manage and just a
 

00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:04.450
maintain easy to manage and just a
little more intuitive cool nice yeah I

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:04.460
little more intuitive cool nice yeah I
 

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.399
little more intuitive cool nice yeah I
think that's some great feedback so

00:25:06.399 --> 00:25:06.409
think that's some great feedback so
 

00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:08.080
think that's some great feedback so
we'll definitely hopefully the the

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.090
we'll definitely hopefully the the
 

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.340
we'll definitely hopefully the the
creator of the app is watching and you

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:09.350
creator of the app is watching and you
 

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.450
creator of the app is watching and you
can sort of take some of that into

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:10.460
can sort of take some of that into
 

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.310
can sort of take some of that into
account and we'll try and share share

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320
account and we'll try and share share
 

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.899
account and we'll try and share share
this with you athletes as well but um

00:25:13.899 --> 00:25:13.909
this with you athletes as well but um
 

00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:17.960
this with you athletes as well but um
generally it's a nice idea

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:17.970
 

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.830
alright let's have a look so we've got

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840
alright let's have a look so we've got
 

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.810
alright let's have a look so we've got
the developer we got Michael from them

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:21.820
the developer we got Michael from them
 

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.389
the developer we got Michael from them
how do you pronounce the the app it's

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399

settings so what I would probably do is

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:27.180
settings so what I would probably do is
 

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.750
settings so what I would probably do is
this initial setting screen I would bake

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760
this initial setting screen I would bake
 

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.240
this initial setting screen I would bake
in the individual pieces like the

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.250
in the individual pieces like the
 

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.180
in the individual pieces like the
sorting I think the sorting and there's

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:35.190
sorting I think the sorting and there's
 

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.820
sorting I think the sorting and there's
there's one other thing in there um one

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:37.830
there's one other thing in there um one
 

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.910
there's one other thing in there um one
second this morning those actions I

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:40.920
second this morning those actions I
 

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.490
second this morning those actions I
baked those into the like something like

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500
baked those into the like something like
 

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.830
baked those into the like something like
an action bar um you know for sorting

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840
an action bar um you know for sorting
 

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.540

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:34.450
would it take for like how hard would it
 

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.840
would it take for like how hard would it
be to just add an action bar I think

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:36.850
be to just add an action bar I think
 

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.090
be to just add an action bar I think
basically I mean that that microphone

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:39.100
basically I mean that that microphone
 

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.460
basically I mean that that microphone
button that microphone button can

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:41.470
button that microphone button can
 

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.780
button that microphone button can
probably just go into the text

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:43.790
probably just go into the text
 

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.430
probably just go into the text
box I don't like what we do with search

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440
box I don't like what we do with search
 

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.580
box I don't like what we do with search
view and you know in the top left you

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:48.590
view and you know in the top left you
 

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:49.900
view and you know in the top left you
could probably have that icon right but

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:49.910
could probably have that icon right but
 

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:53.050
could probably have that icon right but
just purely from styling the action bar

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:53.060
just purely from styling the action bar
 

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.660
just purely from styling the action bar
doesn't have to look like a separate bar

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:55.670
doesn't have to look like a separate bar
 

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.030
doesn't have to look like a separate bar
right you can set the background to

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040
right you can set the background to
 

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.740
right you can set the background to
something like transparent you can set

00:40:59.740 --> 00:40:59.750
something like transparent you can set
 

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.770
something like transparent you can set
the the windows content overlay which is

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:02.780
the the windows content overlay which is
 

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.750
the the windows content overlay which is
the shadow underneath the action bar to

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760
the shadow underneath the action bar to
 

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.820
the shadow underneath the action bar to
know and so the action bar basically

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:06.830
know and so the action bar basically
 

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.160
know and so the action bar basically
becomes kind of this floating thing and

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:09.170
becomes kind of this floating thing and
 

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.550
becomes kind of this floating thing and
so it can take on the same appearance

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560
so it can take on the same appearance
 

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.890
so it can take on the same appearance
basically as what you see here but but

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:14.900
basically as what you see here but but
 

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.380
basically as what you see here but but
kind of feel more correct navigation and

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:17.390
kind of feel more correct navigation and
 

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.240
kind of feel more correct navigation and
interaction Lee and then you

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:19.250
interaction Lee and then you
 

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.650
interaction Lee and then you
automatically get that action overflow

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:20.660
automatically get that action overflow
 

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.140
automatically get that action overflow
on the top right so I think that you

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:23.150
on the top right so I think that you
 

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.850
on the top right so I think that you
know it wouldn't require too much extra

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:24.860
know it wouldn't require too much extra
 

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.010
know it wouldn't require too much extra
work to to make this an actual action

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:27.020
work to to make this an actual action
 

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.510
work to to make this an actual action
bar but you know just in case you don't

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520
bar but you know just in case you don't
 

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.180
bar but you know just in case you don't
do that for sure make sure the top left

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:31.190
do that for sure make sure the top left
 

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.940
do that for sure make sure the top left
is reserved for things like navigation

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:32.950
is reserved for things like navigation
 

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.560
is reserved for things like navigation
and top right for actions and that

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:35.570
and top right for actions and that
 

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.270
and top right for actions and that
overflow so that's the last point I want

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280
overflow so that's the last point I want
 

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.300
overflow so that's the last point I want
to make them an actual bullet cool

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:39.310
to make them an actual bullet cool
 

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:42.010
to make them an actual bullet cool
