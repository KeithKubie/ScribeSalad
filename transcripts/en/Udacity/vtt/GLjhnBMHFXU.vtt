00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now let's get a little trickier. What angle has a sine equal to 0.62?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Or put in other way, the sine of some angle--I'm not sure which one yet--is equal to 0.62.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What is that angle in degrees?

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can enter here and again, just round to two decimal places.
