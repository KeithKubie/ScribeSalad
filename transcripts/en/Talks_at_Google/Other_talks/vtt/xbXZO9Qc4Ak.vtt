KAREN: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.010
Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.100
I'm here to welcome Ellen

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.170
Ellen teaches creative writing
both in private classes and

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.430
through Stanford Continuing
Studies.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.210
She has two daughters, and
lives with her husband in

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.460
northern California.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.270
ELLEN SUSSMAN: Thank you, Karen,
for inviting me here,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.360
and introducing me.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.340
And thank you guys all for
coming, and whoever else is

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.100
out there listening in for
listening in today.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.320
I'm really pleased to be here.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.140
It's also my first visit
to the Google

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.950
Campus, so I was wowed.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.600
It's been-- and lunch
was really yummy.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.500
So today I'm going to talk about
my latest novel, which

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.910
just came out at the
end of March.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.310
So kind of hot off
the shelves.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.880
And it's called, "The Paradise
Guest House."

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.140
And I think that what I will do
first is tell you how this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.460
novel came to be.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.660
It's very different from
my other novels.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.560
And then, I'll read a little bit
from it, and then it's up

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.360
to you guys, because I would
love your questions.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.960
That's always, to me, the most
interesting part of these

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.920
discussions, because it tends
to make it more new for me.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.180
And we can go in all kinds
of different directions.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.490
But I'll start with where
the idea came from.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.090
Do you all remember
the terrorist

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.430
attacks in Bali in 2002?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.220
Yes?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.675
I'm getting mixed responses
to that when I've--

00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:57.470
I've just finished
a book tour.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.270
And I remember it as
such a big deal.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.170
And I think a lot of people
kind of missed it.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.710
It might be that it was a year
after 9/11, and we were still

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.340
absorbed with our own healing.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.270
But it was an absolutely
horrific terrorist attack.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.310
Bombs were set off at two
nightclubs in Bali, killing

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.810
over 200 young people--
as in 20-somethings--

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.150
mostly Westerners.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.670
A great majority were
Australian kids.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.560
And it devastated Bali,
as you can imagine.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.130
Anyone here been to Bali?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.800
So I had always wanted
to go to Bali.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.750
And after those terrorist
attacks, that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.190
went on the back burner.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.080
I wasn't going to
go for a while.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.100
And a few years went past, and
my husband and I started

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.230
talking about let's go back,
let's plan that trip.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.130
His father had been to Bali
years before, and talked about

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.540
it as paradise, which we've
always heard Bali as talked

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.800
about a kind of paradise.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.630
So we-- in 2005, we
planned a trip.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.820
And three weeks before we were
set to leave, there was a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.410
second set of terrorist
attacks.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.480
And these were smaller.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.080
They only--

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.470
only--

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.630
20 people were killed.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.980
But they were set up in
the same sort of way.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.030
They were at tourist restaurants
and cafes.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.860
And they had the same sort of
effect, which was to send to

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.720
the tourist industry--

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.830
to destroy the tourist industry,
and to crush the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.460
Balinese people in
substantial ways.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.800
Neal and I decided not to cancel
that trip, and I'm not

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.760
quite sure why.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.040
But we felt very strongly
that we should go.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.090
And when we went, our experience
in Bali was so

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.310
unusual, we did not see one
tourist in two weeks.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.870
Not one Westerner.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.680
So hotels were completely
empty.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.640
Beaches were empty.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.730
Restaurants were empty.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.040
The Balinese tend to eat in
different restaurants than the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.620
tourists eat in.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.860
So this fabulously gorgeous
country was kind unmarred by

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.960
ugly tourists.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.350
And it also gave us a wonderful
chance to talk to

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.400
the Balinese people.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.940
And I'm not sure we would have
had that same opportunity.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.530
We got their stories on what had
happened in 2002, and what

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.940
happened just three
weeks before, and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.460
how they were affected.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.110
And for some reason--

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.360
I've never written a novel that
is based on a historical

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.810
event before--

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.290
but for some reason, this kind
of got under my skin, and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.560
affected me in a very
profound way.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.850
And as I started to think about
it, I think there are a

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.490
couple of things that
were going on.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.560
One is that Bali is paradise.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.400
I mean, you can't imagine
a more gorgeous island.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.180
It's got those white, pristine
beaches, and crystal blue

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.620
waters, and lush mountains,
and terraced rice paddies.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.780
It's heaven.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.650
And the idea of these terrorist
attacks in paradise

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.750
just didn't make sense--

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.650
not that we could make great
sense out of the World Trade

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.600
Centers, but at least you could
kind of figure out why

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.980
that would happen, right?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.880
And the other thing that made
no sense to me was the

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.910
Balinese people are the most
peaceful, loving, religious--

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.390
their religion is Balinese
Hinduism.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.920
The rest of Indonesia is Muslim,
so Bali stands out as

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.690
a very separate part of
Indonesia, which might have

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.150
had to do with the terrorist
attacks.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.180
But I couldn't make a connection
between the

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.150
Balinese people being a target
of these attacks.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.865
And as--

00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:52.440
I have one writing student
here-- as my writing students

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.450
always hear me talk about,
I tend to write to learn

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.310
something, rather than
to spout out

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.190
everything I already know.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.040
So I think I wrote this book
to try to understand those

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.160
disconnects that didn't
make sense to me.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.685
And the end of the--

00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:14.110
I should throw in here-- one
of the reasons why I think

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.990
that works very well, especially
for fiction, is it

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.800
means that I am writing with
a driving need to discover

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.020
something, and that will kind
of push the forward momentum

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.850
of the book.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.690
I'm trying to learn something.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.280
So my reader will also have
that sense of needing to

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.050
discover, needing to learn.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.760
Whereas, I think if a writer
knows everything about their

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.230
subject, knows everything that
they're going to tell in the

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.260
story that they're setting forth
to write, there will be

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.540
a kind of dryness or a lack
of energy in those pages.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.080
So I actually loved the idea
that I don't understand

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.350
something, and that I create a
fictional world in order to

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.760
understand it.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.920
So by the end of the two weeks
that we were there, I had this

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.410
idea that I would write about
a young woman who is in Bali

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.620
on business--

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.070
a young American woman--

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.800
and she gets caught
in the terrorist

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.420
attacks, and is injured.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.040
And a year later, she returns
to Bali for a one year

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.410
anniversary healing ceremony,
and also she is looking for

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.280
the man who saved her
when she was there.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.190
And that was sort of the
germ of the idea.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.120
I didn't know how I was
going to go about it.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.840
I'll tell you quick
side story.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.230
I called my agent
at that time--

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.070
I still have the same agent--

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.220
and I told her this
idea all excited.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.740
And she said, no, no, no, no,
do not write that novel.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.080
I said, why not?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.290
And she said, Americans do
not care about Bali.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.590
And I said, really?

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.540
She said, no, you can't write
about foreign countries.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.030
Americans don't care about
foreign countries.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.320
So this was in 2005.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.490
Two things, I think, have
changed, and changed--

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.570
I didn't come back to
writing this novel

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.210
till five years later.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.210
And I think two major
things changed.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.160
The biggest one-- does anyone
know why Bali--

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.450
"Eat, Pray, Love."

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.040
So "Eat, Pray, Love" came out
in 2006, proving my agent

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.670
completely wrong.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.220
And suddenly, Americans are
wildly interested in Bali--

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.260
so much so that when
I went back--

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.370
I went back in 2010 to spend
a month to do much

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.570
more serious research--

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.790
and now the island is filled
with tour buses of young

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.660
30-something women looking for
spiritual enlightenment, or

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.320
Javier Bardem.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.780
And it's kind of awful.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:05.200
I still love Bali, but you
have to avoid the EPL

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.730
syndrome, is what they call it,
and how much this fairly

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:15.820
untouched piece of paradise has
been changed by tourism.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.060
And the other thing that I think
did change is that I

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.000
think Americans finally kind of
got outside of themselves a

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.820
little bit, and started to think
about what's happening

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.050
in other countries finally.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.790
So I had put this book
on the back burner.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.990
A real quick aside--

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.750
I came up with another
idea for a novel.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.530
I had lived in Paris for five
years some years ago, and I

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.680
had an idea for a novel.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.070
I called my agent, and I said,
here's a new idea.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:51.850
It's three Americans in Paris
on one day all each walking

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:57.210
the streets of Paris with their
own French tutor talking

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.800
about love and loss and Paris,
and all kinds of things.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.180
And I said, it's three novellas
connected that way.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.890
And she said, no, no, no,
don't write that novel.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.820
And I said, why not?

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.060
And she said, I can't
sell novellas.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.980
not--

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.190
will not work.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.150
So that one did not
let go of me.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.970
And I just thought, until I come
up with the next idea, I

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.550
might as well just write this
one, and ignore her, even if

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.060
I'm just twiddling my
thumbs and keeping

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.060
myself out of trouble.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.910
So I wrote that novel,
and by the time I was

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.650
finished, I loved it.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.090
I was really happy with the
world that I had created.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.690
And I sent it to her, and I
said, here's my novel about

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.670
three Americans in Paris.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.020
And I never used the
word novella.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.340
She had completely
forgotten the

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.170
conversation that we had had.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.290
And she read it, and loved it.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.490
A writer's dream is what's
called an auction.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.030
So when an agent goes out with
a book, they go to many

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.140
publishers.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.260
And our more realistic dream
is that maybe one publisher

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.420
will make a bid on your book.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.330
And with "French Lessons," nine
publishers were bidding

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.510
on the book, so it
went to auction.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.200
And in the end, the two
publishers that were still

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.450
fighting for it--

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.890
a day later, I decided to
sweeten the offer by making it

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.390
a two-book deal.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.450
So my agent called
me up, and she

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.880
said, this is so exciting--

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.970
quick, do you have an idea
for a second novel?

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:31.155
And I said, yes, how about a
young woman who goes to Bali

00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:33.960
and gets caught in the
terrorist attack?

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.290
She said, that is brilliant.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.050
No recollection.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.760
So that became part of the
two-book deal, and I finally

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.940
got to write my Bali novel.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.210
After I read from it, I'll tell
you a little bit about

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.420
the research that
went into it.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.200
Again, as I said, I've
never done--

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.190
written a novel that has so
much research involved.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.520
But it so much depended upon
what actually happened in Bali

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.440
at that time, and an
understanding of Balinese

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.820
culture and religion, and all of
those things that I knew so

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.500
little about.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.880
So we'll get to that part.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.480
I'm going to read from the--

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.370
it's actually the second
scene in the novel.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.980
Jamie, the young woman,
has just arrived--

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.190
the first scene is she's on the
plane landing in Bali with

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.100
all of her fears and
reservations.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.765
And in this next scene--

00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:35.050
well, you'll see what follows.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.550
"When the taxi jolts to a stop,
Jamie's eyes fly open,

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.440
and for a startled second
she catches a glimpse

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.790
of Gabe in her dream.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.610
No, it's something more
tactile than visual.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.420
His fingers drawing circles
on her hip.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.110
The smell of the sea
and his hair.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.480
She clears her mind
with a shake.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.930
'This is the street,' the
taxi driver says,

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.200
patiently waiting for her.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.920
Jamie had been wide awake at
the start of the hour-long

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.080
taxi ride Ubud.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.200
She watched the hordes of
motorbikes fill the streets,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.440
rolling down the windows to let
in thick, tropical air.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.840
And then sleep kicked in--

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.980
hours on international flights,
and she couldn't doze

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.190
for a minute.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.340
10 minutes in a beaten
up jalopy without air

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.440
conditioning, and she
was comatose.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.160
'Lady,' the taxi driver says.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.910
He is young, and smells
of ginger.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.480
On the dashboard are prayer
offerings, probably to the

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.590
gods of pothole roads with
too many motorbikes.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.060
'Thank you,' Jamie says, paying
the man, and hauling

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.450
her suitcase out of the car.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.410
She stands on the sidewalk
and looks around.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.550
She hadn't visited
Ubud a year ago.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.040
She'd stayed in Seminyak for the
first few days, and then

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.840
she spent three days in a beach
cottage somewhere until

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.520
she could flee the country.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.460
But Ubud is the home of Nyoman,
her host for this trip

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.230
down memory lane.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.560
The foundation that organized
the one-year memorial event

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.940
sent her a packet with his
name, his address, and an

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.950
itinerary of events leading up
to the ceremony on Sunday.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.060
She'd also received
a plane ticket--

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.430
a gift from the government
of Bali.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.180
She'd been promised
a new Bali.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.500
Jamie looks around.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.290
People swarmed the streets, and
she feels the immediate

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.060
exhilaration that always
marks her first

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.890
day in a new country.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.140
But it's mixed with something
else, something that chills

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.960
her skin despite
the damp heat.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.150
I can do this, she tells
herself, in the same way she

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.490
has argued with her
mother for weeks.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.660
I have to do this.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.580
She reads the name of
inn on the piece of

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.280
paper in her hand--

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.590
the Paradise Guest House.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.280
She walks by a series of modest
cottages, some of them

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.010
with stone gates and elaborate
carved entrances, none of them

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.520
with names.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.440
She feels someone's
eyes on her, and

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.570
glances across the street.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.280
A young boy sits on the
dusty curb with a dog.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.280
The boy is mangy, the
dog is mangier.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.480
The boy boldly keeps his eyes
on her, and after a moment,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.430
his lips curl into a grin.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.940
Jamie offers him a weak
smile in return, but

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.460
thinks, leave me alone.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.090
The boy stands, and within a
second, the dog stands, too.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.850
The boy is probably 12, Jamie
guesses, and wily.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.020
He looks smart and vigilant, and
she suspects that he's a

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.210
street kid.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.620
Or maybe all kids in Bali
look like this.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.460
She has no idea.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.370
She doesn't know this country.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.140
She doesn't want to
know this country.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.240
But isn't that why she's here?

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.850
'I help you,' he calls from
across the street.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.250
'No thank you,' Jamie
calls back.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.860
She hurries down the road,
pulling her small suitcase

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.260
behind here.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.590
But in a quick moment, he's
beside her, offering to take

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.120
the suitcase, his
hand on hers.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.720
She pulls away." "'I'm
fine,' Jamie insists.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.280
'You want nice hotel?'
he says.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.980
Do kids speak English here?

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.340
Is it possible that last time,
in one whole week, she never

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.140
saw a kid in Bali.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.080
She saw the inside of her hotel
room, beach-side bars, a

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.500
mountain trail.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.290
She saw Gabe standing in a
garden, his feet lost in a sea

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.770
of orchids and gardenias.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.350
'I don't need help,' Jamie
tells him, her

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.990
voice a little sharp.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.290
'Everyone need help,' the
boy says smiling.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.710
In fact he has not
stopped smiling.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.950
He is tall, and he smells
like earth and rain.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.790
His dog walks at his
side like a shadow.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.310
It's a skinny pup, some handsome
mix of black lab and

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.240
border collie.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.710
Jamie sees a sign
outside a gate--

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.330
'The Paradise Guest House.' The
sign is painted gold with

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.730
black letters.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.720
She turns abruptly down the
path, hoping to lose the boy.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.770
But he's quick, and again
reaches for the suitcase.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.930
He must be looking for a tip.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.720
'I've got it,' she
says testily.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.470
'Good-bye.'

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.550
'You are tired',
the boys says.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.770
'Tomorrow, you will be nicer.'
She nods, unsure

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.329
how to answer him.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.020
He opens the gate for her, and
lets her pass through.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.240
'I see you tomorrow,
miss,' he says.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.240
As he closes the gate, she
takes a deep breath--

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.640
jasmine.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.680
The gate shuts out the noise
from the street, the boy and

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.260
his dog, the hot
sun, the dust.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.280
Her eyes adjust to the cool
darkness, and a tropical

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.010
garden emerges thick
with banana

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.930
trees, ferns, and hibiscus.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.160
She follows a path through the
dense foliage to a small stone

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.750
cottage with a carved wooden
door, where she lifts a

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.280
knocker in the shape of a
monkey and lets it fall.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.810
A hollow, booming sound
interrupts the silence.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.940
She waits.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.890
After a moment, she knocks
again, louder this time.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.255
Finally, in slow motion,
the door creeks open.

00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:11.370
A man stands there, his hair
tousled, his clothes rumpled.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.620
Did she wake him?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.010
He blinks at her, and runs
this hand over the

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.690
front of his shirt.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.870
'Can I help you?' he asks.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.260
His accent is better
than the boy's.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.330
He adjusts his crooked glasses
and peers at her.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.930
'I'm looking for Nyoman.'

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.900
'You've have found him.'

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.560
'I'm Jamie Hyde.' He
stares at her.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.780
'I received a letter from the
organization that--' Jamie

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.320
pulls open her small backpack,
and rummages in it to find the

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:43.750
letter.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.530
'Yes,' he says, even before
she finds it.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.620
A smile breaks through the
creases of his face.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.200
'Welcome.'

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.170
'Were you're expecting me?'

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.360
'The man is silent
for a moment.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.920
His hand goes to his head, and
he rubs it vigorously.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.630
When he's done, his hair swirls
on his head, making him

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.700
look a little crazy.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.850
I should leave, Jamie thinks.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.240
But oddly, she takes a
step closer to him.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.810
'Tomorrow, you are coming,'
he finally says.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.980
'I'm sorry, I thought
it was--'

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.090
'You are welcome in my house.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.600
I'm often confused.' His smile
transformed his face.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.470
He's probably around
40, Jamie guesses.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.010
And though he's badly in need
of some grooming, he's a

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.360
handsome man.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.190
'I can find some place else
to stay tonight.' Jamie

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.310
unconsciously touches the scar
on her face, and then she

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.670
tucks her hand in her pocket.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.950
Nyoman reaches for
her suitcase.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.660
'Follow me.'

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.100
He walks past her and
out the door.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.040
But instead of passing through
the gate, and delivering her

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.040
back onto the unfamiliar streets
of Abud, he walks

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.580
around the house and toward
a series of small cottages

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.490
behind his own.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.250
Two young boys stand in front
of one of the cottages, both

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.840
with toy trucks in
their hands.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.710
They stare at Jamie
open-mouthed, and then turn

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.290
and run, screeching as they
disappear into the trees.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.530
'Nephews,' Nyoman says.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.900
'One is loud, and the other is
louder.' He is still walking

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.010
past one cottage, and
then another.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.750
A very old woman, her skin brown
and wizened, sits on the

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.890
ground in front of one door.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.030
She smiles a toothless
grin at Jamie.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.970
'Grandmother,' Nyoman
tells Jamie.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.160
He says some quick words in
Balinese to the old woman, and

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.550
she giggles like a young girl.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.200
At the fourth cottage,
he stops.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.190
Wisteria spills over the front
of the house, it's pale violet

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.650
blossoms filling the air
with a pungent scent.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.030
The ground in front of the
wooden door is covered with

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:57.410
petals from the flowers,
a blanket of color

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.330
as a welcome mat.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.280
'Your home,' he says.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.110
Jamie feels something unwind
inside her, something that had

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.570
been knotted tight since she
agreed to this trip.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.120
'Thank you,' she tells him.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.350
'Now you rest.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.930
The flights are very long.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.720
I come to get you when it is
time for your dinner.' He

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.750
pushes open the door,
and light pours

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.500
into the single room.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.450
Jamie can see a four-poster
bed with mosquito netting

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.240
draped over the top.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.410
A wooden bureau with
a mirror above it

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.280
sits next to the wall.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.130
The room is simple and clean.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.160
She takes a step inside.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.830
When she turns around,
Nyoman is gone.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.270
Standing in the doorway, she
gazes out at the garden.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.800
There are lights in
every cottage.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.090
His family, she assumes.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.280
She smells incense and she
hears a rooster crowing.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.400
It is as if she stepped behind
the wall of Ubud and found a

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.400
different country.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.530
My home, she thinks.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.940
Her real home in Berkeley is a
room in a ramshackle Victorian

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.210
house that she shares with three
other adventure guides,

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.420
all of them usually somewhere
else in the world.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.210
And her mother had just moved
out of the Palo Alto home

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.080
Jamie grew up in.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.090
'I don't want all those memories
of life with your

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.730
father,' Rose said, when Jamie
begged her to keep the house.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.840
'I was there, too,' Jamie said,
like a pouting child.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.230
She's 32.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.850
It shouldn't matter where
her mother lives.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.890
Maybe it's her homelessness that
makes her pine for that

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.660
childhood bedroom.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.520
Or maybe it's a yearning
for all those dreams

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.700
only a kid can have--

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.370
parents who stay together for
a lifetime, boyfriends who

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:50.080
don't die, night clubs
that don't explode.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.860
She hears the sound of
someone singing.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.370
It's a woman's voice,
high and sweet.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.210
The words must be Balinese
or Indonesian--

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.410
Jamie can't really tell the
difference between the two

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.750
languages--

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.360
but she hears something so
haunting in the song that she

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.510
feels herself back away
from the door.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.650
The woman's heart is
broken, she thinks.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:18.830
She closes the door, and
the sound stops."

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:23.970
So I think I'll take your
questions, and then we'll see

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.130
where that leads us.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.530
Pressure's on you now, guys.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.330
AUDIENCE: Is this--

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.660
first of all, thanks
for coming.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.100
I thought it was really
interesting how you were

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.660
talking about your interaction
with your agent and the

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.820
auction, and how just saying
that one sentence of an idea

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.880
could give a yes/no
or a book deal.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.260
And I was wondering how that
was different from when you

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.470
first started writing, and just
getting out there in the

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.960
first place.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.030
ELLEN SUSSMAN: That's
a good question.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.970
In the beginning, when you're
first trying to sell a novel,

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.930
you can't do anything
unless you have the

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.160
entire novel written.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.110
Nobody will buy a book
idea for fiction.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.220
For nonfiction, I've sold
two nonfiction--

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.320
I've published to nonfiction
books, and those were both

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.420
sold on proposals.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.770
So you come up with the idea,
you write an introduction, you

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.490
write a table of contents,
you come up

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.100
with a marketing plan--

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.850
which is mostly made
up, or a dream.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.250
And then your agent sends that
off, and you actually get your

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:27.970
advance based on a 25-page
proposal, and you haven't

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:28.900
written the book yet.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.430
But with fiction, until you've

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.320
established a name for yourself--

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.080
and oftentimes, even
after that point--

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.790
you have to write the novel
basically on spec, and then

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.040
see if you can sell it.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.080
So I have at least two novels
that never sold--

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.310
probably three.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:53.700
It's a grueling business that
you have to be completely

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.510
dedicated to for some
crazy reason.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.950
And I say crazy, because
it's very hard to make

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.860
a living as a writer.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.570
It's very hard to sort of fit it
in to real life in terms of

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:12.540
jobs, and a regular
career path.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.830
I'm now making a living
as a writer,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.210
but I started writing--

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:21.260
I decided at age six I wanted
to be a writer, and was sort

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.980
of singularly pursuing that, and
then dedicating my life to

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.040
it from age 21 on.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.050
But I didn't start making a
living as a writer until I was

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.360
48 years old.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.760
And then I'm really lucky.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.980
I mean, I have lots of writer
friends who can't support

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.400
themselves on their writing.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.620
So to get back to your question,
you spend this crazy

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.130
amount of time writing this
novel because you somehow

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.150
believe that you've got
a novel in you.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:54.160
Then you have to find an agent
based on that novel, and then

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.880
the novel--

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.210
then the agent goes out
to sell the novel.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.450
So in the first novel that
I published, that was the

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.110
process that I went through.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:07.550
Once I published that novel and
developed a relationship

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.980
with my agent, I can now
run ideas by buy her.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.320
As you can tell, I don't
listen to her.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.150
And she kind of doesn't
listen to herself.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.400
I catch her in one mood,
and it changes

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.160
to a different mood.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.650
I am now finishing the
novel that will be

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.890
published a year from now--

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.900
it will be published
a year from August.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.010
And in that novel, we sold it
based on the first hundred

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.640
pages, and that's the first
time I've done that.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.080
So "Paradise Guest House"
was not written at all.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.690
It was sold based on that one
line, because it was a

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:42.980
two-book deal.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.170
For the next novel, I wrote a
hundred pages, and then my

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.190
agent went out to sell it.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:53.230
So I feel like I'm very lucky
that I can have that sort of

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.860
vote of confidence in advance.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.330
Although, of course now I'm
worried that I'm not going to

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.480
deliver the novel they think
that they bought.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.010
We writers worry about a lot
of things all the time.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.770
But it is a crazy business.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.460
And it's a really risky
business, as a fiction writer

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.460
especially, because
the big idea does

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.840
not translate, right?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.070
That when I said "French Lesson"
was a three novellas.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.880
It is no different than the book
that I finally produced,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.020
that hit the "New York Times"
best-seller list.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.960
But the description of that
book is nothing--

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.940
three Americans walk the streets
of Paris with three

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.320
French tutors, right?

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.510
That doesn't tell
you anything.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:38.110
Nobody would buy that book
based on a pitch.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.380
So that only works in the
execution, of the writing of

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.100
the novel, and whatever happens
in the storytelling.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.410
Whereas in nonfiction, you can
pitch, I'm going to write a

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.900
book that explores this, that,
or the other thing, and the

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.190
publisher will have a fairly
good idea of what it is

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.880
they're going to receive.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.850
Fiction, just-- we don't have
that luxury usually.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:06.970
AUDIENCE: So in this book,
you were going explore--

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.160
you wanted to learn, right?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.170
So at the beginning, did you
know how the book was going to

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.250
go and what happened?

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.550
ELLEN SUSSMAN: No.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.320
Was the mic on?

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.460
Did you hear that?

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.140
OK, great.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.770
I don't write with an outline,
and it's for very much the

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.810
same sort of reason that
I write to discover.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:30.370
Because I think if I know
everywhere that I'm headed,

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.340
the juice is gone.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.080
I want that sort of desperate
need to know.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.050
So the book that I just sold to
my publisher that's coming

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:45.200
out next year, page 100 ended
with a kidnapping.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.170
And I was very scared that my
editor, or the publishers,

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.940
were going to say,
so what happens?

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.670
And I would not have been
able to answer,

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.120
because I had no idea.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.190
And I had no idea until page
300, really, what would

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.760
happen, which kind of kept
me going in that way.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.070
So with "Paradise Guest House,"
I knew that I wanted

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.660
this woman to--

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.400
who is very damaged.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.550
I set her up, as you could tell
from that reading, as an

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.730
adventure guide.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:22.320
She's very gutsy, independent,
worldly 32-year-old.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.080
And I did that so that
this trauma would

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.940
affect her that severely.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.660
You take somebody who is out
in the world, and makes her

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:37.980
living being out in the world,
and make her scared to step

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.850
out of her house, and that
is big trauma, right?

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.750
And big drama.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.510
So I set her up as an
adventure guide.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:50.360
I have her traumatized by
the terrorist attack.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.310
And I then want her
to deal with it.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:58.030
So she's got to go back to Bali
to struggle through this

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.760
to move forward in life.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.940
And something had happened there
with this American man

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.410
expat who saved her.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:10.890
And I knew that I wanted them to
reconnect to find out what

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.700
that was all about.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.040
And I didn't know what would
happen when they did.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.790
And I didn't know how
she would deal with

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.670
being back in Bali.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:24.290
So those are mysteries to me
that I follow with the same

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.480
sort of curiosity that
I hope the reader

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.980
brings to it, right?

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.740
And then, by trusting the story
that I'm creating, and

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.880
the characters that I've put
on the page, I kind of let

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.380
them lead to me--

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.390
doesn't it sound sort
of woo-woo?

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:45.720
But I'm trusting them to lead me
to where the right place is

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.910
for them then to go.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.440
So one of the things that
I did need to do--

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.620
I mentioned the research trip.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.210
Sounds like a tough job
for a writer, right?

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.920
Got to go to Bali for a month.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.460
And it was fabulous, but it
was also really hard work.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:07.240
I knew that I needed to get the
taste, sounds, smells of

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.120
Bali, right?

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.602
To fill the book with Bali.

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:14.270
I also needed to talk to as
many Balinese people--

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.430
expats--

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.690
to find out about daily
life in Bali.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.510
Gabe, the man she's looking
for, is an expat.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.950
I needed to understand why
expats move to Bali, what

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:27.180
their concept of paradise
is all about.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.980
So those are the kind of
easier things to get.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.010
The harder things
for me were to

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.910
understand Balinese Hinduism.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.430
The Balinese believe
in reincarnation.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.170
So if you believe in
reincarnation, do you grieve

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.550
the loss of a loved one in the
same way that if you don't

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.030
believe in reincarnation?

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.870
And I don't know.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.610
I don't understand that.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:56.440
So I really needed to learn a
lot more about that to be able

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.760
to include that as part
of the novel.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.530
And Bali was desperately
trying to heal.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.760
Bali as an island was
desperately trying to heal

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.640
from the terrorist attacks.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:17.210
And to do so, their religious
life affects their daily life

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:19.190
in every possible way.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:23.560
So I needed to understand the
culture, the religion, and the

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.730
family life.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:29.850
And that meant doing some book
reading and internet research,

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:34.920
but it meant more talking to
the people who I met there.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.070
And then lastly, the most
interesting part of the

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.130
research that I did
when I was there--

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.900
I met a woman from Berkeley
who moved to Bali 25 years

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.860
ago, and married a Balinese
prince, and has been doing all

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.970
kinds of good work.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:57.380
She runs an organization now
that started in 2002 for the

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.130
survivors of the terrorist
attack, and the families of

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.270
the victims.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.960
And its to help them heal, and
to educate the kids, and to

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.340
get money for the-- the Balinese
who were injured in

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.330
the terrorist attacks were
mostly the people

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:13.560
working in the clubs.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.710
In fact, one of the clubs that
was bombed didn't even allow

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.740
Balinese people into the club.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.080
It was just for Westerners.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.330
So the people who--

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.660
the Balinese who are injured
in the attacks tended to be

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.120
poor, hard-working, struggling
Balinese, and

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.530
people on the streets.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.750
When the attacks happened, and
everyone was rushed off to

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.730
Sanglah, which is the
one major hospital.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:44.170
First of all, there's no burn
unit at any hospital in Bali,

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.440
and the hospital was completely
inundated and

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.490
overwhelmed.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:53.630
So they immediately flew out
all the Westerners to

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.200
Singapore and to Australia.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.630
And the Balinese were left
with these inadequate

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.530
conditions for healing
in Bali.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:08.260
So the woman I met suggested
that I might want to talk to

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.239
some of the survivors and
the families of victims.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:15.570
So my last three days in Bali,
she set me up with a driver

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.510
and an interpreter, and we drove
all round Bali to the

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.350
worst part of the inner
city, to these

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.699
very remote poor villages.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:31.290
And I met with a woman who's
just covered with scars from

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.710
all the burns and the skin
grafts that she's had.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.030
And while we talked, she had
her baby climbing all over

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.550
her, and this huge smile
on her face.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.880
And she told me her horrific
story, and I had tears

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.710
streaming down my face.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:53.020
And another woman who lost her
husband in the bombing--

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:58.310
he was just riding by
on his motorbike at

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.700
the time of the bombing.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.120
And she told the story about
waiting for him to come home

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.440
from work that night.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.670
And she could no longer
talk after a while.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.400
And her daughter who was in
high school came up on her

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.410
motorbike, and joined us
and took over, and told

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.250
the story for her.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.270
And ended up by saying, and
now she's studying to be a

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.320
doctor to make sure there are
doctors on the island who can

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.640
take care of the Balinese.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.920
These were amazing stories.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.280
They didn't go into the book,
but they informed everything

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.150
that I put in the book, because
I was learning about

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.150
the Balinese spirit.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.320
I was learning about the truth
of what happened, and how--

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.750
I just got a fan email.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:43.610
And truly, fan emails-- like,
you write a book, and you give

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.610
it to your friends and your
family members, and they have

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.330
to say they love it, and you
don't believe anyone.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.620
But if someone who lives in
Oklahoma takes the time to

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.020
send you an email, and you don't
know this person, and

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.550
they just finished reading the
book, and they thought they'd

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.360
write you--

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.500
that is amazing.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.050
So my fan email is like my
highlight of every day.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:09.940
And I got one last week from a
woman in Oklahoma who had been

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:16.590
a first responder at the bombing
in Oklahoma City at

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.190
the courthouse.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.450
And she said that I got the
description of the bombing

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.080
absolutely right.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.230
And I was so pleased.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.690
That was something I was
very scared about.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.530
I've never been in a bombing
before, and the two main

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:38.060
characters race into the
nightclubs when it happens.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.680
So I really needed to spend time
describing all of that.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.860
So I think that it was a
mixture of all of those

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.810
stories that I heard, and the
time that I spent trying to

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.000
get the human story, more
than anything else.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.480
It's not about--

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.900
in fact, at its core, this is
probably a love story, but

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.030
it's a love story with terrorism
as a backdrop,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.390
because it has everything to do
with how people heal, and

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.810
how people find each
other when they are

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.560
going through trauma.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.960
So I needed to understand
all of that in a way.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.520
I could not make the love story
work, I could not make

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.130
Jamie's process towards healing
work, unless I really

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.090
understood what it was that
they went through.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.280
We have time for another
question or two.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.200
Someone else?

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.550
Yeah.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.320
AUDIENCE: In your research,
did you find that the

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.500
Westerners healed differently
or processed it differently

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.460
than the Balinese?

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.120
ELLEN SUSSMAN: It was
one of my burning

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.560
questions the whole time.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:43.530
Knowing that reincarnation is
such a strongly held belief--

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.760
core belief--

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:50.950
for the Balinese, I really
needed to get that.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:55.650
And it's so hard for us as
Westerners to understand that.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:00.800
So there's a line in the book
where it turns out that

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.530
Nyoman, the owner of the
guest house, lost

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.220
his wife in the bombing.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.380
I'm not giving much away.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.930
That comes-- we learn
that fairly early.

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:16.110
And he talks to Jamie a lot
about his experience.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.720
And he keeps explaining to
her that his wife will be

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.840
reincarnated probably
as his child, which

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.035
is what they believe.

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.510
Isn't that amazing?

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.300
So he has to have children
so that she

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:32.330
has a chance to return.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:35.910
And I talked to somebody
there who--

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.290
they absolutely--

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.206
they had a baby.

00:38:40.206 --> 00:38:43.810
A healer came and told
them that the soul of

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.650
the baby was the--

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:50.470
I think it was the mother or the
grandmother who had been

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.890
killed in the bombing.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.090
So they feel this
very strongly.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.350
On the other hand-- so Nyoman
says at some point, but I

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.870
still have a hole in my heart.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:05.070
It doesn't mean that the
loss disappears.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.110
There are still grieving for
someone who was central to

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.620
them, and whom they loved.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:18.040
But I think it gives a much
stronger sense of continuity

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.240
of healing that that person
will come back, that the

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.875
circle continues that we
don't necessarily have.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:31.620
And yet, I don't think
it relieves you

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.610
of the pain of loss.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.740
And there's something--

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.660
one of the things that I have
only figured out, kind of in

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.870
retrospect.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:45.160
Now that I've published three
novels, and I can look back on

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.040
those novels, I see that
there are themes.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.190
There are issues--

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:56.040
let's call them obsessions in
my life that I will write

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.620
about over and over again.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.770
And loss is the big
one for me.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.470
I lost both my parents
at a young age.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:08.010
And no matter what I'm writing
about, loss comes in.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.120
And it comes in kind of
through the back door.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.980
If I were to sit down and say,
I want to write a book about

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.390
loss, I don't think I could
create the human story.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:23.140
But because of the fact that I
am always kind of confronting

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:27.020
my own feeling about loss, and
how do you move on when you've

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.550
lost a loved one?

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.830
When my characters are
struggling with loss,

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:35.520
everything I know about that
pours into the book, right?

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:42.250
It informs my characters'
reactions, their experiences.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.515
And I think that is kind of
the way it has to work in

00:40:45.515 --> 00:40:50.240
fiction, that we can't
do it as consciously.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.110
We have to do it sort
of subconsciously.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:59.270
And then it will feel more
organic, and less

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.850
manipulated, right?

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.740
It's not like we're the puppets
pulling the strings.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.470
We're creating real characters
who have human emotions, but

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.690
those human emotions will
often come from our own

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:15.050
obsessions, our own
life issues.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.970
And loss is that one for me.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.220
So I'm always surprised.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.620
I'm at the point with the new
novel that I'm writing now--

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.220
that I just finished
a first draft--

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.560
and it's after I finished a
first draft that I look at it

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.910
and say, what's that
all about, what

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.440
am I writing about?

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.180
And once I can identify what I'm
writing about, I can dig

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.020
deeper, and I can try
to explore it more.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.250
But on that first time through,
I don't go there,

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.660
because I want it to be coming
not from here, not from my

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.470
mind, my intellect, but coming
from my heart and

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:50.050
soul somehow instead.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.140
AUDIENCE: What's the
best advice you've

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.236
ever gotten for writing?

00:41:54.236 --> 00:41:55.560
I'm asking selfishly.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.340
ELLEN SUSSMAN: Well,
I'd say two things.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.130
I am one of the most disciplined
writers I know.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:06.540
So I think the best advice is
to stick your butt in that

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.430
chair every damn day.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:12.320
I mean, it is so hard,
especially through the years

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.690
when you're not succeeding.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:18.400
And I had plenty
of those years.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.070
And you're filled with
self-doubt, and everybody else

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.020
in the world--

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.000
we were talking earlier.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.940
I moved to Silicon Valley 20
years ago, and everybody I

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.980
knew was in the hi-tech
industry, and I would talk

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.760
about writing and people
were like, what

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.260
are you talking about?

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.780
What is that all about?

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.820
So you feel lonely.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.790
You feel isolated.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:38.330
You feel crazy.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.210
Nobody--

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.520
especially if you've been
successful through school and

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.330
grad school, and you won all the
awards, you then think, OK

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.920
world, here I am.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.990
My 20s were such a shocking
revelation to me that the

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.630
world was not waiting
for Ellen Sussman.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:02.040
And I couldn't figure out what
the hell happened if I was

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.420
supposed to be a superstar, and
instead I could barely get

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.960
a story published.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:13.280
So suddenly, all of that noise
in your head is what it takes

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.330
up-- that's what takes up all
the space in your head.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:20.340
And somehow or another, you
have to sit down and work

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.790
every day, and push that noise
out of your head so you're not

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:27.750
living with self-doubt, or
you're not living with the

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:32.390
voice of your mother saying,
go be a lawyer.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:37.070
All of those things, and you
somehow have this ridiculously

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:41.860
cocky, irrational belief that
you have the right to tell

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.930
this story, and you should
write that book.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.690
So that's probably the most
important thing, is to make

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:55.320
the space for writing the book,
is to create your life

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.000
in such a way that
you can write as

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.460
close to daily as possible.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.890
And then the other thing that
I almost always advise

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:09.100
everybody is to get a day job,
because it just is so hard,

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.640
and it takes so long, and it
puts so much pressure on you.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.870
If you can figure out a way to
do a day job that doesn't take

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:22.250
away all of the time and energy
for fiction writing.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:25.300
But the most important
is just sitting

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.700
your butt in the chair.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.890
Thank you all so much.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:34.450
[APPLAUSE]
