00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.920
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.660
Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast ad out.

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.500
Uh, yes.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.410
Checking on you just chicken in on Ya dumb officially out of ways to say that.

5
00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:21.280
That is a hole in this. A hole in the wall in this fucking room.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.430
These guys fixed the pipes because it was galvanized piping in here and uh,

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.750
I never got this hole fixed.

8
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.050
Just fucking realize that that's how fucked up my house is.

9
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:35.950
You know what I realize I talk about my house so much that there's somebody

10
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:36.880
sitting there going like,

11
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.800
eventually he's gonna run out of money probably right when the house is 98%

12
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:43.750
fixed and I'm going to swoop in and buy it.

13
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.600
And he's gone in and redone everything,

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.920
redid everything I'm speaking of which I got the epoxy floor put in on my gym.

15
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.710
I went downstairs to look at it. I was like, oh boy. Oh boy.

16
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.200
What'd you look at? Dead floor. You can't eat. Oh boy. Oh boy.

17
00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:03.040
And I went in there,

18
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.330
Popo Beerbohm [inaudible] it was bubbles.

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.070
So they got out another layer because you know,

20
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.820
my floor is not level it all his fucking shed,

21
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:15.630
which get a float the floor and it's going to cost y'all this money. Me,

22
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.840
we did fill in the crack, but

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.170
now the grand out the window say I don't even care anymore.

24
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.120
I just laugh now. When contractors come up to me, I want, what do you,

25
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.043
what do you want? What do you want?

26
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.940
It's like that old Robin Williams story that if you just walked up to them at

27
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:33.100
some point you said, hey man, uh, Robin, I'm a comedian.

28
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:37.210
He would just write you a check for 100 bucks. They, sorry. Sorry.

29
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.550
If I riffed on some of your shit, my apologies.

30
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.910
This is what I do now with contractors show up. Yeah. I A,

31
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.510
I know how much this time can I just go into my pocket or do I need the

32
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:50.980
checkbook? Do I got to write numbers on a piece of paper? Just never ends.

33
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.620
It never ends in meanwhile,

34
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.000
meanwhile is I wait for the gym to be made. I am sitting in the writer's room,

35
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.390
uh, doing efforts for family and two things have happened. I'm,

36
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.650
I'm putting on writer's room weight. My gym isn't fucking made and uh,

37
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.690
you know, I'm fucking, uh, I, I feel like the last,

38
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:13.600
I don't know if I'm talking to you guys both made my fucking left leg,

39
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.270
my hamstrings like tightened up. You know,

40
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:19.030
you ever see the guy run down the first base line and I'll say, hey,

41
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.940
that's fucking happen. Or that guy in the Celtics and game one,

42
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.200
you're running up to court, he just fucking collapses. I was like, I'm done.

43
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:30.470
I did. I literally pull your hamstring doing stand up.

44
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.000
Cause God knows I haven't been working out. And um,

45
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.000
and you know what? I ended up figuring it out. What it was is, ah,

46
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.030
it's from sitting down in the fucking writer's room.

47
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:43.270
Like I guess sitting is not healthy.

48
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.370
It's one of the most unhealthy things she could do.

49
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:48.940
I guess your body's not designed the way that we sit,

50
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.750
the way that we've made chairs. Just plop your ass down, whatever it is,

51
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:54.700
blood flow. I don't know what the fuck it is.

52
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.200
So all fucking Billy butt cheeks here now. I've got a problem.

53
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.860
My fucking cyanic nerve on my left side.

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.580
So I literally had to have my lovely wife buy one of those foam rollers,

55
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.290
right? It's is how all layer is from Siddiq.

56
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.440
Alright. And you, you literally,

57
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.010
I looked up some lady on the fucking Internet who had like,

58
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.460
I looked up the proper way to do it before I did it because I know that you can

59
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:25.420
fuck your body up.

60
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.720
Like people get these things and they just start rolling around on them and I

61
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:31.150
immediately learned first thing you don't want to roll over joints.

62
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.010
There's all this shit and there's all this proper form.

63
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.160
So I went through about two or three videos till I got to somebody who all the

64
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:38.920
comments were like, oh my God, your forms perfect and all that.

65
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.570
So I was always watching this woman.

66
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So basically what I do is I sit down on the thing and then cross my legs is she

67
00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:51.710
says cowboy style, not lady like cowboy style,

68
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.510
which is basically like if I was wearing a skirt, my balls would be hanging out.

69
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.320
Right. Sorry for the visual. Um,

70
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.100
you sit like that and then you sort of puts your weight on one side and you,

71
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.390
and I get to tell you, dude,

72
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.400
the fucking right pain that I was in.

73
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.400
It isn't like a a, it isn't like a, like a severe pain.

74
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:18.210
It was like if you had an older brother and you know when he would be fucking

75
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:21.690
with you and sort of start twisting your arm, you'd be like, ah,

76
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.580
like that, that type of a fucking pain. And um,

77
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.630
I gotta tell you that the, the foam roller is a Goddamn game changer.

78
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.990
But if I didn't have to go and, but the thing is,

79
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:36.690
I kind of work it out and it's fine. Hey, we're good out. You know,

80
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.180
but then I go and I, I'm in a writer's room all day,

81
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:41.220
so I keep trying to stand up in that type of shit. I'm,

82
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:44.100
I'm feeling like it's two steps forward and one step back,

83
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.150
but I'm at least moving in the right direction, so I just put that out there.

84
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.910
If you do, um, have any of those types of problems, uh,

85
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.880
get one of those, this has been working for me. I should say.

86
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.710
I'm not a doctor and I don't play one on TV, but this has been working for me.

87
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.320
And if you're young, uh,

88
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.200
I would start doing yoga is soon as you can't, it's, I'm, I'm telling you, I,

89
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:11.120
I've known this forever, but I, I just get bored with Shit.

90
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.450
I'll do yoga and be like, I'm just going to do Joel. Good luck. Yeah,

91
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.480
we spoke today and then I just get it out and then I'm like, you know what?

92
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:20.520
Fuck Yoga. You know,

93
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.540
I get mad at yoga rather than myself for being totally fucking obsessed with

94
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:28.110
shit for like 10 days until I just, you know,

95
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.230
I did that with chipolte lay a long time ago when I lived in New York City.

96
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.550
You know, if you have a moved to New York City, which I hope you do,

97
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:38.070
everybody should try and fucking live there. It's great. You know,

98
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.990
until you get into your thirties and it's like, oh,

99
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:42.420
am I going to be one of those cat people? I get to get Outta here, right?

100
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.370
I want some space, you know? Um, but when you live there,

101
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.270
you know, you start ordering out, this is how it works. You move there,

102
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.390
you're fucking terrified. Like, how the fuck am I going to afford to live here?

103
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.320
And you fucking eat spaghetti every fucking night, right?

104
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.260
And then you start making a little more money and every once in a while you take

105
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.680
a cab and you're like, oh my God, I'm taking a cab.

106
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.390
This is fucking amazing.

107
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.450
And then you get back to your apartment and you have all this guilt because you

108
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.670
blew all that money and you could've just spent, you know,

109
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.430
whatever the fuck it was back in the day was like a dollar 25 to take the

110
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.220
subway. Yeah, I know. That's how old I am. Um,

111
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.790
and then you start making it a little more money.

112
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.700
Then all of a sudden you start ordering out, right? You start ordering out,

113
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:25.310
you start to get to know all the restaurants and all that type of shit.

114
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.380
And then when she had the money to order out,

115
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:30.980
what immediately happens is it's just a radius within which that they'll

116
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.670
deliver.

117
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.900
And you burn out every fucking restaurant around you and then you become,

118
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.560
then you're officially in New Yorker when you're living in Manhattan and you're

119
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.020
bitching that there's no good restaurants in your neighborhood.

120
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.920
There's no good Italian. You can't get go to town. I don't understand why.

121
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.860
I mean, there's so many people here. It'd be the foot traffic. Alo.

122
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:51.410
Why don't they put in an Italian fucking restaurant?

123
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.540
You start flipping out like whatever your favorite food is,

124
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.870
you're bitching that it's not there. Um, so whatever.

125
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.790
So this chipotle ends up opening up after I tried every fucking restaurant 15

126
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:05.960
times at my little fucking three block radius. And I went to that fucking thing.

127
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.930
Like I swear to God, I went there like, I don't know,

128
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.880
maybe 11 days in a month. I, and I'll never forget how I felt that last time.

129
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.200
I felt like I was at the end of like a food eating contest where you were just

130
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.770
telling your jaw to keep moving up and down with the rest of your body was like,

131
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.240
can we just, uh, puke now? And um, I don't think I've ever,

132
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:30.020
I don't think I've been there since Chipola and Thai food.

133
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.560
It was a Thai food restaurant down the street.

134
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:35.540
And I remember I ordered it and it was delicious.

135
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.330
And then it sat in my fridge for two, three days and I said, hey,

136
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:39.820
you know what I think I do. I'll do,

137
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.530
I'm going to eat that three day old Thai food, see how that does.

138
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.130
And I got food poisoning and I'm rather than being the mature person and taking

139
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:53.870
the responsibility on my end, I blame Thai food. I was like, Fuck Thai food.

140
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.620
I'm never eating Thai food again. I didn't eat that for like 10 years. And then,

141
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.010
uh, you know, eventually became back. We were, uh,

142
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.690
we were able to smooth things over, you know, like guns and roses,

143
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.910
you know what I mean? It was exact same thing,

144
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.560
exact same trajectory I had with Thai food, um,

145
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.890
band members and guns and roses head with axl rose and now they're all back

146
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.610
together. And evidently the fucking shows have been great. Um,

147
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.030
they played in Mexico City the other night and a,

148
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.730
I would have loved to have gone down to that. Gone to that show,

149
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.130
had a great time, then get kidnapped, you know, that'd be great.

150
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.460
Mexico City scares the shit out of me. Any Mexico people, Mexicans,

151
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.220
real wants real ones. I don't mean the ones here at la, I mean,

152
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:41.120
the real fucking deal. You're in Mexico, you know what I mean? Like, I'm German,

153
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:44.420
Irish, but I don't live in Deutschland or fucking the, the emerald dial.

154
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.460
You know what I mean? I lived in Massachusetts, I went to friendlies. You know,

155
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.450
I'm not a Kraut, right? So let me,

156
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.010
let me ask you this, because it's there.

157
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.900
It's fucking a quick plane ride away. There's all these beautiful places to go.

158
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:02.910
And then there's all these other fucked up places to go.

159
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.050
I don't know where to go. I don't know where to go. Um,

160
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.290
and uh, you know,

161
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:15.291
all they show about you guys is the fucking drug cartels peeling people's faces

162
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.590
back in all. And I know there's no fucking way all of Mexico,

163
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.830
everybody's just walking around, peeling off each other's faces.

164
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.710
I know there's no fucking way that that's happening. I know there's this,

165
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:26.544
like here,

166
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.150
I bet people outside of this country think everybody walks down the street with

167
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:33.930
a fucking gun on their hip. You know, when they don't have money for a toll,

168
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:37.260
they shoot the guy in the toll booth. And then some stage coach comes in.

169
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:39.510
I don't know what the fuck they think, right? Or the world yet.

170
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.480
And we're all 300 pounds and we're on fucking meth.

171
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.363
<v 1>Right.</v>

172
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.520
<v 0>We don't know where England is.</v>

173
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.970
I'll let shell like that's snobby European shit where they just think they're so

174
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:52.790
fucking cultured. You know what I mean?

175
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.550
With their little ass fucking countries over there that's driving [inaudible].

176
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.080
I go over to fucking Europe. I love when they say shit like that. You know,

177
00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:02.450
you guys don't know about the fucking world. It's like neither do you.

178
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.690
You don't know what the fuck's going on over in Asia.

179
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.260
<v 0>You know what's going on right in your little fucking area.</v>

181
00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:12.260
But your little area for me would just be the east coast.

182
00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:14.900
But for you it's like 15 different fucking countries.

183
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.553
<v 1>Wow.</v>

184
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.210
<v 0>Belgium and fucking Luxenberg. I mean, you can walk through those two countries,</v>

185
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:22.044
you can sleep,

186
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.800
walk through those two countries from fucking Amsterdam and end up in France and

187
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:27.090
be like, Whoa, what happened? I'll have shit.

188
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:31.050
I gotta go to work and then job back. Um,

189
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.160
now having said that, I'd love to go to both places. Oh,

190
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:37.110
the big phony covered his fucking tracks.

191
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.780
Oh is gonna go to your show in Belgium?

192
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.980
But after you talked about how small we were, no, I'm not going,

193
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.180
um, controversial social media today when one person in Belgium took offense.

194
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.620
Um, so anyways, they redoing the fucking floors again.

195
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:59.120
So I ended up getting bubbles. B is four bubbles.

196
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.780
Remember that? Sesame street bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.

197
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.620
He paid for probably who part you saw him and that was at fucking guy with the

198
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:08.720
puberty voice harmonizing.

199
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.930
I think it was supposed to sound like a beach boy type thing, but it didn't,

200
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:14.840
it was just fucking, it used to make me like angry when I was a kid.

201
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.320
See if I can find that for you guys and I'll start playing it. Um, so anyways,

202
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.180
as always,

203
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.950
I never let myself get too out of shape and I need to drop about 10 pounds. So,

204
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.070
um, oh fucking, uh,

205
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.880
freckles here despite the fact that the gym isn't made yet.

206
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:34.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

207
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.180
<v 0>And I got to go to work every day.</v>

208
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:40.140
I'm going to try to lose two pounds a week back up to one 80.

209
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.530
Everybody and I been eating well the last couple of days and always the first

210
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:46.800
couple of days, the fact that if you just eat well you drop a couple.

211
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:48.050
So I got on the scale yesterday,

212
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.200
said one 77 so I must've ate like a fucking tuberous shit the night before when

213
00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:52.960
I got on at one 80,

214
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.320
something about one 78 so I'm just going to go back down to one 68, um,

215
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.480
a right around the time for my birthday and uh, you know,

216
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.940
two pounds. That's easy, right? Couple of pushups, you know what I mean?

217
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.300
I go on my stupid foam roller. Oh my God. I, I, you know what,

218
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.020
I'm so fucking old. I think I have to bring it to work.

219
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

220
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.910
<v 0>How fucking hilarious is that? I'm going to walk in with that thing at work and,</v>

221
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.990
and I'm going to walk in to a room full of comedy writers.

222
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:25.110
Do you understand the pounding that I'm going to fucking take?

223
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.050
I want to get tea that's going to actually fuck up our work for today cause

224
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.980
they're going to spend the first two hours trashing me. Um,

225
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.970
and what am I gonna do other than fucking take it? That's it.

226
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.350
There's nothing I can fucking do. Oh, by the way, by the way,

227
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.500
as I'm all over the fucking map here. Did you fucking see that?

228
00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:45.810
Shameless fucking Hillary Clinton.

229
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

230
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.670
<v 0>Trying to pander to get the African American vote. She's on some radio show.</v>

231
00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:55.070
I just watched a clip. I had to shut it off. Forgive me.

232
00:12:55.071 --> 00:12:58.130
I don't know what radio show it is, but she's sitting there.

233
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.130
She goes and she's trying to get the black vote and she,

234
00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:04.640
they asked you what's something you always carry around with you? And she said,

235
00:13:04.641 --> 00:13:05.780
hot sauce.

236
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.180
What a fuck they, the Clintons are the fucking, I swear to God.

237
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.180
Can't you just see both of them on a used car lot?

238
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.940
Do one of those cheesy local commercials? Do they are the fucking devil?

239
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

240
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.970
<v 0>I remember when Hillary Clinton ran for fucking, uh,</v>

241
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.040
Senate after eight years of being in the White House,

242
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:33.940
the fucking Yankees had won four world series. She never showed up,

243
00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:35.230
never said a fucking thing.

244
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:39.520
And then all of a sudden she's running for fucking a Senate in New York,

245
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.840
shows up with a brand new Yaggie hat and goes I valleys,

246
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.840
very Yankee Fan, and had this big grin.

247
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:51.430
Like I said it now they're going to like me. This is how out of touch she is.

248
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.370
She literally thinks that she just has to say, I carry around hot sauce

249
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.770
and I'll all black people gonna be like, Oh shit. Oh, I can relate to that.

250
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.970
What's she going to do next? She got to go to fucking Chinatown,

251
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.850
which I always carry around soy sauce.

252
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.783
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

253
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.900
<v 0>we can go down south. You know, I love guns in my cousins. Sorry,</v>

254
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.040
sorry, I should've said that. Um, hot rides.

255
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.830
I've always liked hot rods. Fucking shameless.

256
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.130
This is the thing about like when you're at her level of fucking wealth,

257
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:34.570
which is really, I don't know how you explain it. You know, when her husband,

258
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:34.961
you know,

259
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:39.670
had the highest office in a public office and you only his president,

260
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.590
you only make four, 500 grand a year. Somehow they,

261
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.450
through their daughter a $3 million wedding. I mean,

262
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.600
how does the math work there? They are the fucking,

263
00:14:47.601 --> 00:14:51.680
she is the fucking devil. I'm telling you. You know?

264
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.740
Oh my God, what a fucking selection this year.

265
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.550
Can you fucking believe this shit? A reality show star.

266
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.120
You know who sitting there with that fucking,

267
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.700
I didn't know what the other guy's name is and they're talking about the size of

268
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:09.380
their hands. They haven't had that Sisay addict debate running for office.

269
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.360
You got Hillary. You fucking write it. I'll say it. She doesn't give a fuck.

270
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.600
This is why I gotta be honest with you.

271
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:19.460
Why I like Republicans better than Democrats,

272
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:23.480
because Republicans at least have the decency to, to just show,

273
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:27.200
to openly show you that they don't give a fuck about you and Democrats.

274
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.040
They actually try to act like they give a fuck of people about people who work

275
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.890
for a fucking living. They don't. They're the same fucking people.

276
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.920
They just lie about it. You know? I swear to God,

277
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.970
if Bernie Sanders would just fucking go the whole way,

278
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.620
you know what I mean? Don't stop and Kuwait,

279
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.850
you got to go all the way to Baghdad with these fucking bankers. Okay?

280
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.930
That's what you gotta do.

281
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.500
You gotta tip over this statue and you gotta have all those top level bankers

282
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.290
swinging at the end of a rope. That's the only way to stay.

283
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.490
You gotta start over again.

284
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.100
That's my candidate. None of them are saying that,

285
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:06.710
so it's over and I know you're thinking bill,

286
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.100
you don't know shit and you read conspiracy theory and you know what I say to

287
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:14.540
that? You're absolutely right. Okay. All right,

288
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:17.180
let's move on. That was a, that was a,

289
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.330
that was political comedy right there. If you,

290
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:24.410
if you're wondering what that was supposed to be, she goes to little Italy.

291
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.820
What do you always have in your purse? A jar of Marinara sauce.

292
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.000
Who's your favorite singer? Dean Martin.

293
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.630
Oh my God. Did you see the house? She looked like she rolled her eyes.

294
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:41.630
I don't want to put like shit on her that that's what she fucking did.

295
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.180
That's how out of touch she is. Hillary Clinton thinks black.

296
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.270
All black people walk around with hot sauce in their purse because white people

297
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:53.050
don't know how to season food. Um,

298
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.420
I'm not saying there aren't some black people did do that, you know what I mean?

299
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.283
But you know,

300
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.710
that would also be people who aren't white who look at white people and think

301
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.370
we're all in the upper 1% standing on a yacht shooting the shit with one of the

302
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.660
Kennedys and they're fucking weird in Brent inbred dentition,

303
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.710
I noticed that the Kennedys, I, they, they're from like the nose up.

304
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.680
They're really good looking people, great hair, you know,

305
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:20.390
nice fucking big five head, you know, it looks great on TV,

306
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.330
decent eyes, you know, and then you just get to that fee. You get to those,

307
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.560
those, I mean, it was kidding who they look like from the nose down.

308
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:29.870
They look like Clint Howard. I don't know what it is.

309
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.230
There's something going on with that family. You can't, uh,

310
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:40.010
you know what it is, is they still look ethnic. If you look at, um,

311
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.740
if you look at like, like white people from like,

312
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.550
like look at Joe Dimaggio, you, he's probably considered a good looking guy.

313
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.130
That guy is fucking deck.

314
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.180
I Dunno what happened once everybody got all mixed up,

315
00:17:56.181 --> 00:17:58.850
like all the fucking national, I was getting mixed up like, you know,

316
00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.530
started streamlining the looks and people are way better looking now.

317
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.560
Don't you think then when you look back in the day, I mean, Jesus Christ,

318
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.940
Babe Ruth every once Lou Gehrig was a good looking guy, you know what I mean?

319
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.140
But Babe Ruth like I was a mess. Joe Dimaggio mess.

320
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.890
I could say what aren't bad looking? I don't know.

321
00:18:18.891 --> 00:18:20.870
I'm just saying when you look at the shit back then,

322
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.030
like an Italian guy looked a hundred percent fucking attempt. I don't want it.

323
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.410
You know something. And when I went to Italy,

324
00:18:27.411 --> 00:18:29.810
they will better look in the back then, I don't know what the fuck it was.

325
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.280
We allegedly had better food back then. People were shorter.

326
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.231
I Dunno what it was.

327
00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:38.750
Did you ever notice that when you look back and when you really look at those

328
00:18:38.751 --> 00:18:39.440
old pictures?

329
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.560
I love looking at old pictures and it's like that George Carlin bit,

330
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:43.790
when you look at it on picture and you're like,

331
00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:47.360
everybody in that picture is dead. And for some reason in a morbid way,

332
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:50.920
it's like fascinating. When I look at those old pictures, I just,

333
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.440
that's what I think. Like God damn it. It was some fucking ugly ass people,

334
00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.060
you know? And you know, it was a game changer. It was a three things. Polio,

335
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.860
vaccine, penicillin and braces.

336
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.970
Those three fucking things could just hide so many fucking imperfections.

337
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.503
You know what I mean?

338
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:15.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

339
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.130
<v 0>And once you get braces, Jesus Christ,</v>

340
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:21.240
if you just brush your fucking teeth and remotely keep yourself in shape,

341
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.760
you know, you throw on some nice clothes.

342
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:25.680
People have no idea where you came from.

343
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:27.703
<v 1>You know,</v>

344
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.900
<v 0>back in the day, people, they saw it on you,</v>

345
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.420
your teeth told the whole fucking story. You just smile and be like, hi,

346
00:19:34.421 --> 00:19:37.840
I can see you're going to have tuberculosis.

347
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.560
You live in a damp Dag fucking apartment with no fucking windows.

348
00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:45.090
You saw it in their fucking teeth, right? I don't know about,

349
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.930
I heard what's his face? JP Morgan had like rosacea though.

350
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.330
Is that how you say it all over his face? He was just all fucking angry.

351
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.790
Those old school rich guys, you know,

352
00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.190
used to walk around with top hats like the Penguin Horn,

353
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:02.050
right when I walking down the street, um, is this a podcast anymore?

354
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.490
And I don't even, what the fuck I'm talking about? Let me,

355
00:20:03.491 --> 00:20:05.650
let me do some advertising here and then I'll, uh,

356
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.800
I'll get to more babbling here in a moment. All right.

357
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.030
Hot Sauce. Oh, shameless fucking shameless. She looks in,

358
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.360
bred her fucking teeth. There's something going on with her on the,

359
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.320
some go with you see how Bill Clinton claps now. It's like he's a,

360
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.590
like a marionette puppet. He has his mouth open.

361
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.250
That's how he made it. But that smiling with his mouth open. Oh,

362
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:36.070
I've got to fix it. I don't fix everything. How you doing? Call me later. Oh,

363
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.780
I'm all right on it.

364
00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:42.250
Everybody audit this company the Great Joe Rogan.

365
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.880
This is his company here. Speaking of getting into shape,

366
00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.930
a lot of people when they in shape, what do they do? They do set ups, right?

367
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:54.760
They do fucking, they do a pull ups. They do push ups.

368
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:57.640
They do all the upper body stuff and they walk around their fucking chicken

369
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:01.390
legs. But still you're always working on the outside of your body.

370
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:04.420
What about the inside man? Well, thank God this on it.

371
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.570

mix that helps support memory, focus and processing speed.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.900

374
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:23.020
effectiveness. That's pretty impressive, Huh?

383
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.220

386
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:02.290

395
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.460
I'm worried that that would fuck up everything. That makes me funny. You know,

396
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.400
we knew his kid knew. Most of the reason why you laugh,

it makes them a fucking dope. But what if I just take it?

398
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:47.260
I'm smart for a few weeks and then you guys see that it works and then I just

399
00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.390
stop taking it. I go back to being stupid again.

400
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.160
Then you guys could send me emails like, hey bill,

407

434
00:24:33.961 --> 00:24:38.460
that the fucking 40% of the tickets go on sold. So like when the Patriots,

435
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.680
everybody wants to patriots to you tell me 40% of those tickets go and sold. I,

436
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.200
I really don't understand that part of it.

470
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.130
Let's go back to here. Um, the fucking,

471
00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:42.880
how about the St Louis Blues may be in St Louis.

472
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.600
Meet me at the fair. Um, I miss game three.

473
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.680
I was convinced that a, once they blew game two that that was fucking it.

474
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.140
Um, but I was actually able to watch game four and um,

475
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.390
oh wait, when I turn, I actually turn it on mid second, mid second period.

476
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.800
And um, I,

477
00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.540
I I gotta tell you these are not your fucking dad's St Louis Blues.

478
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.870
You know, they would down, they came back, they went ahead. They just,

479
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.890
they just, it's actually you watching Chicago losing their composure,

480
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.150
Chicago trying to draw them into fights and stuff like that. It's unbelievable.

481
00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:27.700
Now I'm not counting, I kind of am cotton Chicago.

482
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.530
I don't think that they're going to come back from this one.

483
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.420
I think a St Louis Blues are a got their eye on the prize or whatever.

484
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.520
I think they got this series and um, just the way they're playing,

485
00:27:39.521 --> 00:27:40.480
just all the shit that they,

486
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.780
I've seen them go through all these years and never answered the bell and just

487
00:27:43.781 --> 00:27:48.280
fucking implode and lose the fucking series there. This team does not do that.

488
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.980
And a, it's fucking great to see,

489
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.050
but it's also great watching the Blackhawks too. Like,

490
00:27:53.051 --> 00:27:56.320
you know what I love about them is you can see like their, their um,

491
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.890
like Patrick King and you could just see the guy gives a fuck.

492
00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.940
That's the ego wouldn't one championship and that'd be like, yeah, you know,

493
00:28:03.941 --> 00:28:04.571
fucking whatever.

494
00:28:04.571 --> 00:28:08.740
But the s the guys who give a fuck and they want to win as many as they can,

495
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.420
he can't put a price on those guys.

496
00:28:10.421 --> 00:28:14.620
So as much as it's kind of bizarre watching Chicago be it down three to one

497
00:28:14.621 --> 00:28:16.840
after this success over the last five, six years,

498
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.880
I'm watching how much they give a fuck. Who is that? Like,

499
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.760
I'm so bad with the names down. So out of a fucking loop. Who's The guy? Uh,

500
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.310
not Patrick Sharp. You get fucking traded.

501
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.980
Who was the guy who was fucking crosscheck and everybody at the end of the game

502
00:28:29.981 --> 00:28:32.440
and it was like, oh, that guy's a dirty piece of shit. It's like, no, he isn't.

503
00:28:32.441 --> 00:28:37.180
He gives a fuck. He gives a fuck, you know, going into the penalty box.

504
00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:41.650
He's fucking screaming at people dropping theF bomb. I loved every second of it.

505
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.583
Um,

506
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.120
<v 1>okay.</v>

507
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.200
<v 0>Oh Man. You know I, you know what?</v>

508
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.790
I shouldn't even say the Blackhawks around the keys.

509
00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:50.330
You know the fucking Blackhawks right now. I like this no fucking way.

510
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.790
These guys are gonna beat this next game. You know that.

511
00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:54.920
That's what they're saying. Fuck this shit.

512
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.850
All we need to do is when this next one get it back into our building and then

513
00:28:58.851 --> 00:29:03.440
the pressure will be on them. That all fuck up. We don't, we don't win this one.

514
00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:07.340
Then. Now we're looking at a game seven. That's how fucked up three to one is.

515
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.050
You always think like, aw man was, we're sitting pretty and it's just like, no,

516
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.760
we're not. We're not. We have to win this next game. If we lose this next game,

517
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.050
then all of a sudden all of the fucking pressure is dumped on us for the next,

518
00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:25.220
for the rest of the series. Um, it's, I dunno,

519
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.880
it's fucking a, I dunno,

520
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.190
I actually believe it or not as bad as I am at math,

521
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.760
like seven game series numbers like fascinate me. Like if you go down,

522
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.200
oh to like the Boston Celtics and it's this weird thing where if you just think,

523
00:29:39.201 --> 00:29:42.400
look, we're just down two games to none, it doesn't seem that bad.

524
00:29:42.401 --> 00:29:45.100
A hole to crawl out of. But when you do the math and be like,

525
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.430
we have to win four of the remaining five games,

526
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.570
you're like what the fuck? How the fuck do you do that?

527
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.600
And you know when I say the 86 mets,

528
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:03.810
cause I remember that we won the first two games in New York City and I was just

529
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:07.540
like, oh my God, all we gotta do is when two, one of the next four,

530
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:10.420
they got to win four out of the next, I'm sorry,

531
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.340
we've got to went two out of the next five. That's all we had to do.

532
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.940
All we had to do was with two out of the next five they had to win four out of

533
00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:19.290
five and they fuck,

534
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.100
they came back and they won game three and four in Fenway,

535
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.590
if I remember this correctly, the first two games wasn't a down there.

536
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.720
I don't, you know what? I can't remember that.

537
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:37.390
I just remember we won the first two games and I want to say they came here

538
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.780
and then what that would do if they were here. Then we went down there.

539
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.310
No game six and seven were down there. Game six certainly was and seven was,

540
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.910
wait, wait, hold on. A fucks to go. It goes home. Home away away.

541
00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.410
Oh my way home. No, maybe it was this three in a row in Boston.

542
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.620
Maybe it was three in a row and bought in. They might have gone to three, two.

543
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.940
Oh God. What a shit show. We won game five we're like,

544
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.480
finally we had game six when we blew that and then we blew up three nothing game

545
00:31:12.481 --> 00:31:14.370
seven. It can be. It can be all, but just like fucking that.

546
00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:15.780
So I really shouldn't say this is over.

547
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.470
All I'm saying is you've got to watch game five and you watch half the fucking

548
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.350
Blackhawks come up. And I know that they lost a lot of guys,

549
00:31:22.351 --> 00:31:23.610
but they still got tapes.

550
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.660
They still got a fucking Doug aid k day still Gad fuck.

551
00:31:27.661 --> 00:31:32.190
And the other guy and the other fucking guy already got enough guys left that

552
00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:34.590
are like, we're not losing this fucking game. Um,

553
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.983
<v 1>okay.</v>

554
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.410
<v 0>Blues. You know what this is?</v>

555
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.770
I think it's a must win after me just saying this is how fucking wishy washy I

556
00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:45.350
am after. I just say, I think the blues got this one.

557
00:31:45.351 --> 00:31:47.690
I'm not thinking like thank God they got to close them out.

558
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.640
They got to close them out. Jesus Christ,

559
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:55.060
I hoped in Newt Gingrich looking coach fucking gives him that speech I'm

560
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.820
speaking of Which? The Boston Celtics. I'm calling it right now.

561
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.890
Hotlanta before you get to fucking excited,

562
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.370
I'm going Joe Willy Nemeth right now. I guaran fucking tee you.

563
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.610
The Boston Celtics. You're going to go into the garden.

564
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.540
There's going to be all those championship banners hanging from the fucking

565
00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:13.950
rafters, right?

566
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.860
All of a sudden you're not going to have that cool breeze blown over your head

567
00:32:16.861 --> 00:32:18.630
like you feel down in your Omni Center.

568
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:23.160
Whatever the fuck the hawks play right from your lack of God damn championships

569
00:32:23.161 --> 00:32:27.420
down there. Um, the Boston Celtics,

570
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:32.460
I am me. Who doesn't play hoop? Who isn't a professional athlete

571
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.040
who cannot read out loud his Guaran fucking team.

572
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.580
The Boston Celtics are gonna win game. I'm calling it right fucking now.

573
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.880
If I don't understand why you have to wait until fucking Friday.

574
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:45.920
I'm actually going to be on the road where you're going to be bill,

575
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.330
I'm going to be in St Louis, the original home of the Atlanta Hawks,

576
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.100
the St Louis Hawks and who beat him in 1958 for the NBA Championship.

577
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.870
The Boston Celtics.

578
00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:58.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.850
<v 0>You like dead. The synergies all going to be there.</v>

580
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:05.590
They're going back to Boston where all those championship banners are old Billy

581
00:33:05.591 --> 00:33:07.600
red faces going to be in St Louis,

582
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.930
the original home of the hawks where he beat him in 1958 and I'm telling you

583
00:33:10.931 --> 00:33:15.130
right now, you take all your money, you steal from your mother,

584
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.990
you put it on the Celtics,

585
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.620
and I guarantee you you're going to come away a winner. And if you lose,

586
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.220
I don't want to hear your crying to me because I take no responsibility for

587
00:33:24.221 --> 00:33:25.750
this. All right?

588
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.380
You're responsible for your own fucking actions are the most fucked up thought.

589
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.413
<v 1>Okay,</v>

590
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.440
<v 0>I the most fucking fucked up thought the other night and I,</v>

591
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.340
you have to have like a fucked up thought. And then you do,

592
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.830
you go to Google it and you thinking like a bunch of people going to agree with

593
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:46.430
you and then you're just like, no, you know what? I'm just a fucking moron.

594
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.660
You know that postpartum depression, you know,

595
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.630
women have a baby and then they just fucking have this unbelievable level of

596
00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:57.410
depression. Um, I whatever,

597
00:33:57.411 --> 00:34:01.580
for whatever reason was hearing a story about it and I was listening and

598
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:06.380
listening and I was thinking like, you know what? As much as that is a thing,

599
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.680
uh, I bet 17%, I dunno why I came to that number, but in my head,

600
00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:17.450
17% of women that get postpartum depression, that just selfish.

601
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.240
That's what I was thinking.

602
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.380
Like it's a real thing for 83% of them,

603
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:29.381
but 17% of them are just mad now that they have a kid and they can't go out and

604
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:31.970
go do Jello shots whenever they want to.

605
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:34.400
And then it just been a bunch of fucking babies about it.

606
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.630
That's what all not Dr Burger here was taken.

607
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:44.110
And then I looked it up and there was all this fucking shit about dumb men like

608
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:46.130
me that thinks shit like that.

609
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:52.150
So you know what's great is I only thought that thought for about three minutes

610
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.790
and then I went, I looked it up and I was like, oh, all right, I'm a moron.

611
00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.710
I'm a moron. I wonder if there's any male, if there's male,

612
00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:06.770
if male can males have that shit? Did they even bother doing studies?

613
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.770
They don't give a fuck about us. They just, they, we don't,

614
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.100
we die eight years before women on average and they, nobody really cares. They,

615
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.410
why does this keep happening? They don't give a fuck. Yeah. It's a guy.

616
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.460
They'll make another one. Alright. A male post

617
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:28.820
partum. Oh my God. There is this facts about men depression.

618
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.850
Oh, give me a fucking break.

619
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:34.400
You didn't go through any fucking sort of physical thing.

620
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.030
The kid has guys who watch the game anymore. Um,

621
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.160
men's depression research has only beginning to understand man's unique

622
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:47.640
experiences of depression. Yeah. Why, why do you think that is?

623
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:53.400
Because we've told to shut the fuck up and plow through it. Uh, blah, blah,

624
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:57.750
blah, blah, blah. Research is lagging even further as for p, p, and, d,

625
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:01.860
whatever that is. I don't know what that is.

626
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.910
Postpartum Notre Dame, I don't have no idea. Um,

627
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.140
in terms of depression in general, if you're a man,

628
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.580
you're more likely than a woman to try and hide your depression or to withdraw

629
00:36:11.581 --> 00:36:16.410
from others. This only worsens your system. Oh, paternal posts,

630
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.210
postnatal depression. Oh my God.

631
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:24.060
Used to see the pictures of these fucking people. This guy's sitting there.

632
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.060
He's clearly an actor and he's just looking down, holding his,

633
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.770
like pinching his nose between his eyes. Okay? In this picture,

634
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:35.670
we want you to look depressed. All right? You know that statue, the thinker.

635
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.250
Okay. I want you to do the same pose,

636
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:41.820
but don't think I want you to pinch the top of your nose. That's it. That's it.

637
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.530
Close your eyes. Think of something painful and all right,

638
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:48.630
that's it. Here's 50 bucks. Go get yourself some donuts.

639
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.090
Classic symptoms of depression, depressed, sad mood. All right, let's,

640
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:57.750
I'm going to take this test. Uh, depressed, sad mood.

641
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.080
Ah, no. I don't have that.

642
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.150
Loss of interest or pleasure and I don't have that either. Significant ways.

643
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:10.080
Loss or gain. Fuck, I'm putting on weight. I have this shit.

644
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.040
Trouble sleeping and oversleeping. Oh No, I thought it was the booze.

645
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.200
Restless feeling and inability to sit still or slow down.

646
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.170
You know, I definitely got that fatigue. Loss of energy. Tired,

647
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:25.550
tired all the time. Absolutely. I thought that was cause I drink every night.

648
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:30.090
And you only get four hours sleep, worthless or guilty. Feelings check. Uh,

649
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.540
impaired concentration and difficulty making decisions.

650
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.430
I got half of that. Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

651
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:40.830
Yep. Um,

652
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.820
the suicide options always right there, right? It's such an easy one.

653
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:52.020
You dislike, you know, or I could just kill myself, eh, but then you know what?

654
00:37:52.021 --> 00:37:55.080
If, uh, one of the Bruins rebuild it, I miss it.

655
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.410
You know what I think I'll stick around. I'm all right. Let me, uh,

656
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.390
let me read a little more of this. The uh, the advertising here.

657

No gracefully get the fuck out of here for him to grow. The F can read it.

658

664
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.170
got a baby crib and you want a booze every time you see that kid,

665
00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:30.170
no matter how much you fucking love it, you still want to booze.

666
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.880
Thank God your fucking balls are dry. We really made it. All right, me,

667
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.300
these, whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

668
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.140
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear,

669
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.820
but instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

670
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:48.520
clothes, your underwear is probably boring.

732
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:52.030
Like there's something funny to me of a bunch of Germans in public,

733
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:56.200
in a stadium, you know, singing along and shit that, no, there's no way.

734
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:58.090
That's never not going to be creepy anymore.

735
00:42:58.091 --> 00:42:59.650
So there's just something hilarious about it.

736
00:42:59.651 --> 00:43:03.340
So I always root for you guys to get to the later rounds, you know,

737
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.170
and as you like when Germany and whatever they're playing like Brazil,

738
00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:13.290
it's impossible to not picture the ghost of fucking Adolf Hitler sitting up

739
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:18.130
there hoping for a do over. Remember when Jesse Owens embarrassed him

740
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:24.040
and you know, you think he's not up there. Best two out of three. Um,

741
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:25.463
all right,

742
00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.140
please enjoy this music and we're going to start plugging and play some greatest

743
00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:33.010
hits from a Monday morning podcast gone. Bye. Thank you everybody.

744
00:43:33.011 --> 00:43:36.540
You have a great weekend. You con and uh, once again, thank you everybody.

745
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.320
You out who's been watching emphasis for family.

746
00:43:38.321 --> 00:43:39.760
We are having a great time writing these things.

747
00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:43.990
And last night we had a great event with Netflix, a Netflix.

748
00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.130
Keep it weird. They did this thing, they hijacked that hippy fucking thing.

749
00:43:48.131 --> 00:43:49.510
Yeah, their corporation. You know what I mean?

750
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.220
They do want Hillary Clinton does. You know,

751
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.030
what's the one thing you have on you at all times? Netflix. Oh,

752
00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:58.960
I always have a bag of weed in my purse, man. Everybody's running for office.

753
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.870
All right, that's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you on Monday.

754
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.790
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible] hello. What's going on Monday morning party.</v>

755
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.670
<v 4>And as you can tell by the sound of my voice, uh,</v>

756
00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.160
I've got about two hours sleep last night.

757
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:04.580
I am sitting in the continental terminal in Newark Airport.

758
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:06.770
I just had an Omelet,

759
00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:13.730
fucking three cheese in a god damn piece of toast and a,

760
00:45:13.731 --> 00:45:16.790
I was trying not to get mad at the guy making the fucking ex,

761
00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:21.610
but I did order toast with it. You know, and a,

762
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.180
I don't know if this has been your experience,

763
00:45:23.181 --> 00:45:26.660
but my experience is when I go into a breakfast establishment,

764
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:32.360
every time you order something, hang on a second, I go,

765
00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:39.330
okay. Got It. Got It. Got It. Cabin that. I got it out of that.

766
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.850
We know, we know. We know we have to get on the airplane. Got Up,

767
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:48.200
uh, uh, please,

768
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:55.970
uh, all old people who have a lamp and get on first. We know how it was.

769
00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:00.320
Shut up. Okay. Anyways, so when I order, uh,

770
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.310
anytime I go out to a breakfast place right now, I ordered toast.

771
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.220
You got to get toast with your eggs. You know, if you don't,

772
00:46:07.221 --> 00:46:10.310
you're a fucking communist. Okay? I go for some fucking reason.

773
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.960
They always make the goddamn eggs first. And then they go, oh shit,

774
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.980
I didn't make the toast.

775
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:21.140
So then either they give you the eggs and you eat the fucking eggs without the

776
00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:21.974
toast,

777
00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:27.200
which once again is on American eat the toast with the fucking eggs is supposed

778
00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.210
to arrive at the same time. Okay.

779
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.570
So even just give you the goddamn eggs and eat the fucking eggs.

780
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.960
And then they go, oh, by the way, here's your toast. You know?

781
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.960
That'd be like if you ordered like a hot fudge Sundae and they gave you the

782
00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:41.810
fucking ice cream. And then once you're done eating the ice cream,

783
00:46:41.811 --> 00:46:45.140
then they came over with the, with the fuck, with a shot of a hot fudge,

784
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:46.191
you know,

785
00:46:46.191 --> 00:46:48.980
and you hold your nose and you gotta fucking throw it down like Diego Muster,

786
00:46:48.981 --> 00:46:52.640
you know? So this fucking douchebag makes the goddamn eggs.

787
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.320
All right. And then realize, oh, you had toast with that? Yeah,

788
00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.010
you had toast with that. If you read the next line on the fucking worst lip,

789
00:47:01.011 --> 00:47:04.220
you would have seen it. You know, it's not like it's, it's,

790
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.410
it's a lot of reading. It's not war and peace.

791
00:47:06.411 --> 00:47:11.240
It says three cheese omelet and underneath it it said white toast. Right.

792
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.680
So what does this guy do?

793
00:47:12.681 --> 00:47:17.681
He ops to keep the fucking eggs with him while he waits for the toast to be done

794
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.860
and he's making some sort of Turkey sandwich. And needless to say,

795
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.800
I get, I get the egg. No,

796
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.450
it was this loud fucking going to be screaming on a cell phone near me.

797
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:33.130
You know,

798
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.790
I tried to pick up fucking part of the airport where no one would come.

799
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.710
Okay. She got on a tracks. It's got 11 old person in a tracksuit.

800
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:48.520
Um, you know what I mean? What are they doing? A reunion at the 1940 Olympics?

801
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.780
Uh, anyways, yes. That's what this fucking guy does, right? He gives me my

802
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.860
long story short, I get my eggs, my eggs are fucking cold,

803
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.030
and now my post is hot as hell. And uh, you know,

804
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.060
that's an omen. You know what I mean?

805
00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.780
To God damn home when the public fucking day's gonna go, you know,

806
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:10.390
when you can't get your breakfast to coincide on a temperature,

807
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.330
it's just really annoying. Um,

808
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.750
<v 5>but you know, oh Jesus Christ.</v>

809
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:27.030
[inaudible] speaking on passenger's side. If

810
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.550
you give me one of the two, raising

811
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.280
<v 4>two people with really foreign sounding names,</v>

812
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.010
I like how she said that last name too.

813
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:40.330
If there's another guy named Barack Obama in the fucking airport,

814
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.100
um, oh Jesus, I'm going to mood.

815
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:46.800
Oh God.

816
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.380
It's not a special announcement when you have an announcement every three

817
00:48:50.381 --> 00:48:54.700
seconds. Oh, should I keep my bag with me? Oh,

818
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:56.560
I was gonna leave it down the fucking street.

819
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.860
You cannot take a pistol onto the plane. Even if you're in first class.

820
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.720
What? I can't spare these fucking announcements,

821
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.630
like I'm some kind of damn child every five seconds.

822
00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:14.970
Tell me what I can and can't do. No, just tell me what I can't do.

823
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.950
That's when I don't like that little hot students sitting there with their

824
00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:24.120
Sodoku trying to attract a man. Show the cheese,

825
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:28.480
the classy flight attendant. She's not a Sky Horn and she's in the puzzles.

826
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.930
Probably means she doesn't drink. But you'd be surprised.

827
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.490
And then she gives a good blow job. Oh look at me. Give doing a little sex joke.

828
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.530
I usually stay away from that material cause it's too easy to get a laugh.

829
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.970
Aren't you chuckling in your cubicle right now people? Um, all right.

830
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:50.460
Your collective cubicle. Anyways, that's my fucking three cheese on with,

831
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.630
with the, uh,

832
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:56.590
delayed white toast story slash Tourette's over the fucking announcements.

833
00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.300
Um, if you're doing on my page,

834
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.130
this is the Monday morning podcast hosted by me.

835
00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.420
Next week I'll have a guest host, I'll be sick and uh,

836
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.230
let some feature,

837
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:12.240
I call up his myself and he'll complain about the Bagel he bought. Um,

838
00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.280
so anyways, I do one of these every week. I, uh,

839
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.670
answer questions and I, uh, you know,

840
00:50:18.671 --> 00:50:22.690
people send me questions and Oh, speaking of that, um,

841
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.560
I want to apologize to the person that I trashed last week for asking me where

842
00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:29.840
exactly they send the questions to.

843
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:34.370
Evidently somebody hacked my account and got rid of the place where it says add

844
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:35.630
friends, send the message.

845
00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:39.770
So I imagine that would be confusing even though he did still send me an email,

846
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:44.560
but I want to thank a the two or three people who gave me the heads up. Um,

847
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:49.130
I'm trying to think who the fuck would hack my account so I couldn't add

848
00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:53.870
friends. Um, shortlist would probably be other comedians.

849
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:58.440
Uh, um, hang on a second. Hang down.

850
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.380
Now they're telling them the Asian people what they can and can't do when they

851
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:08.050
get on the, on the fly. Uh, no shopping, chopstick allowed and uh,

852
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:12.440
the common area, um, you know, there was not only racist,

853
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.480
it was also hacky chopsticks bill.

854
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:19.481
You couldn't come up with a more original fucking artifact from the Orient.

855
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:25.190
You know, and I can't, I'm actually at a loss. I got chopsticks.

856
00:51:25.191 --> 00:51:28.610
These are these, these are the hacky references. I am from the Far East. Uh,

857
00:51:28.611 --> 00:51:33.020
chopsticks Sushi. But you're kind of the same thing. They go hand in hand.

858
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.520
Uh, Kabuki. Um,

859
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:40.760
and then that one guy who stood in front of that tank at Tiananmen Square,

860
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.700
um, oh,

861
00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:48.670
Buddhist monks protesting whatever the fuck it is China's doing too.

862
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.020
You know what China is doing to Tibet?

863
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.100
They're doing the same thing with these fucking people in the air.

864
00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.950
They are 40 doing over the announcements.

865
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:56.840
That's what it's like living at the bet.

866
00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:02.350
Constant announcements over your head on a no playing on no Tibetan monk.

867
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:08.330
No Grigorian chant from 1230 to one 30.

868
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:12.420
All right. Was that a sense of enough? I hope so. Okay. Uh, anyways,

869
00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:16.060
so people send me, uh, whatever. They send me a questions and I,

870
00:52:16.061 --> 00:52:19.550
and I answered them to the best of my ability. People send me conspiracy theory.

871
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.880
Uh, somebody sent me a great link, but I'm sitting here in the airport and uh,

872
00:52:24.881 --> 00:52:28.190
I can't open that shit without having to pay for fucking Internet, which is,

873
00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:30.080
I refuse to do cause I'm already doing it.

874
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:36.660
I'm already doing it on my God damn fucking place out in California,

875
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.630
but whoever it was that sent me that thing,

876
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:40.030
I really wish I could stay in and do that.

877
00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:44.510
That that conspiracy theory thing was hilarious and all this stuff about nine 11

878
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.690
Hitler. And uh,

879
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.120
what I loved about it was the usual,

880
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.540
the usual categories of conspiracy theory,

881
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:58.541
but somehow everything came back to a blaming Jewish people literally to the

882
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:04.871
point that this website was actually trying to suggest that Jewish people were

883
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:08.840
actually financially backing Hitler and his whole movement.

884
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.960
I mean, I dunno, it was just fucking, it was hilarious.

885
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.840
Oh Shit. Another announcement.

886
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.320
How do people get lost in the airport? You know what I mean?

887
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:29.150
How do you get separated so you don't like this place is on fire and everybody's

888
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.110
fucking running. Everybody has cell phones.

889
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.140
I don't understand the need to still paid somebody's

890
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:39.090
engine in the car and Kuwait and Philip Rivers.

891
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.980
Fuck is Philip. Oh, he's the quarterback for fucking San Diego. I forget that.

892
00:53:43.981 --> 00:53:45.270
I can't even come up with a fake name.

893
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:48.600
I said Phillips thinking that was a good fake name.

894
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:51.950
And then I panicked and I went with rivers. Philip Rivers,

895
00:53:51.951 --> 00:53:55.140
the a hotheaded quarterback. Oh, no, no, no.

896
00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:57.800
That's not the hot red headed quarterback. That's his, uh,

897
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.140
that's the braggadocious one. Who was the original?

898
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.250
Who was that fucking quarterback for the charges?

899
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.450
We screaming at that reporter. Fuck was his name,

900
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:14.010
number one draft Ryan Leaf. We taste them.

901
00:54:14.011 --> 00:54:18.420
Any you broads out there who listened to this podcast and you're not into a

902
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.010
sports, you still should go on Google. Google Ryan Leaf.

903
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:27.570
R. Y. A. N. L. E a. F. I'll wait Google it.

904
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.700
And uh, you know, if you thought your husband was an asshole and I had a chip,

905
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:33.420
you know, and soda would berate you.

906
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:37.230
You've got to see when he yells at this reporter, it's awesome.

907
00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:41.880
No one gave off the date rape vibe better than Ryan Lee. Um,

908
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.860
one of the great characters, one of the great busts in NFL history. Huh?

909
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:51.450
Anybody else knows Tony Manda rich that his fucking name?

910
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.040
Who's the guy be incredible?

911
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:57.360
Woke that 400 pound guy on roids the package picked up.

912
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:01.820
He showed up with his muscles in his acne. And, uh,

913
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.980
I don't know what happened next.

914
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.510
Amandla gave him an uppercut and just ended his career. I don't know.

915
00:55:07.511 --> 00:55:10.740
He never really did shit. Oh wait. Okay.

916
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.710
Todd Marinovich that's the other guy. That's the guy.

917
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.920
Don't get confused with the guy from USC whose dad was making them run four

918
00:55:19.381 --> 00:55:23.580
forties as a toddler. I was at least timing them in the 40. Um,

919
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.630
I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about at this point. I'm half asleep. Um,

920
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:31.200
so anyways, let's get on with the podcast questions. Oh, but before I do,

921
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:36.990
I'm fans of my radio show that I do with that Joe to Rosa, um,

922
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:42.000
who's in my top, uh, 46 on my space. If you look, he's the second one over.

923
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:46.890
We do a radio show on XM two oh two once a month. It comes out on a Saturday.

924
00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.700
Uh, the next one we have is going to be on Saturday, may the 24th.

925
00:55:50.701 --> 00:55:54.280
We just prerecorded it. Uh, we had a great show. Uh,

926
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.380
me and Joe both have incredible tempers and we scream at each other and that's

927
00:55:58.381 --> 00:56:01.310
the show. And, uh, actually this show is guests.

928
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:06.350
We had an anger management therapist come on to analyze our anger and try to

929
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:09.150
figure out why. We're a couple of psychos and a, I gotta admit man,

930
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:12.660
she got right around by defenses. She got in real close.

931
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.870
She was like right in my grill emotionally. And uh,

932
00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:19.930
it was fucking uncomfortable, but I think it may put some good radio. Um,

933
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:25.000
so please check that out. And uh, what else I'm going to be at, uh,

934
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:29.860
xannies in Chicago on May 14th through that Sunday.

935
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.100
I think I don't have my calendar in front of me. It's going to be real sketchy.

936
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.720
Um, but the date should be right there. You can click on it and uh,

937
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.100
find out where I'm gonna be.

938
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.750
Case you don't understand how fucking computers work. All right. What else?

939
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:48.160
I got a Caroline's Caroline's comedy club in, uh, New York City.

940
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:53.310
I'm to be there from May 29th to June 1st and Joe de Rosa will be featuring and

941
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:59.320
uh, in June I'm going to be in a, the fuck am I at good nights,

942
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:01.840
comedy clubs, Raleigh, North Carolina.

943
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:06.900
And I'll be at the punchline in Atlanta and Georgia hotline as the Brothers

944
00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.370
College. Um,

945
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.680
when the hell am I going to be there? I'm like fucking June 19th or something.

946
00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:18.490
I Dunno. I don't have the stuff in front of me. Okay. All right.

947
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:21.280
I'm in a bad mood or right aid, cold eggs and fucking hot toast.

948
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.670
It's enough to make anybody fucking irritable. Um,

949
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.200
God, I can't wait to get old and dressed like that. Look at has fucking mess.

950
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:33.640
Stand on a pink Hoodie with lime green slacks,

951
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:38.700
Capri slacks that a cover all the varicose veins down to her calves and no

952
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:43.630
socks. And then some sort of Michael Jackson, the loafers,

953
00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:49.900
other guy. He looks like he murdered his wife.

954
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:51.521
You know,

955
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:54.320
he's probably got a bottle of peroxide even though somebody murders I wife,

956
00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.650
they would go with the peroxide that I talked about that last week.

957
00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.680
You know what I mean? Like that's going to help you fucking blend in.

958
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.570
Lady over here with the pants suit. You know, I should talk right now,

959
00:58:04.571 --> 00:58:07.630
I have on track sneakers, tracks, sneakers.

960
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.450
Is that actually a fucking brand of sneakers? I don't know what it is.

961
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.930
They're rust silver with a red Nike swoosh.

962
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:18.880
It was probably sewn on by a fucking three year old and Bangladesh. And uh,

963
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.620
I am on jeans and a suede leather coat.

964
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:27.480
Um, yeah, I guess I'm looking like an asshole to it,

965
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.750
but there's another person sitting here,

966
00:58:28.751 --> 00:58:31.660
some of them coming comedian doing a podcast and they're actually making fun of

967
00:58:31.661 --> 00:58:35.410
me. One, look at that fucking area. Look in psycho over there.

968
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:40.120
Why would you wear a fucking suede jacket with some tracks? Sneakers,

969
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.710
unless you stole the jacket and you had to get the fuck out of there quickly.

970
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.290
But enough about theories. All right,

971
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:51.430
let's get on with the podcast questions of the week. Um, okay.

972
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.020
So you said you love shit that is not meant to be funny,

973
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.820
but you find it to be that way. Uh,

974
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:04.950
let me try to read that sentence in a pace that'll actually make sense and had

975
00:59:05.111 --> 00:59:07.810
really awkward pauses in it. You know what I mean? Like,

976
00:59:07.811 --> 00:59:12.250
if you take the most basic sentence and you pause in a weird area,

977
00:59:12.251 --> 00:59:14.170
people don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.

978
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.920
And I think I just start to read it and an even tempo.

979
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.500
Wong t won't t I bill you said you said you love shit that is not meant to be

980
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:30.020
funny, but you find it to be that way. Say now made sense.

981
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.490
Even made sense to me. I got lost the first time I read it. Just why not read?

982
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:39.080
Because I just get confused and it just really holds a mirror up to my stupidity

983
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:43.940
and if I'm alone, it's a very scary moment. Um, okay.

984
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.300
So what is your favorite movie that you find funny that is not meant to be

985
00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:52.040
funny? Um, there's so much shit I can't even start.

986
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:54.500
You know what? This is really the little stewardess haven over here.

987
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:57.410
Now there's three stewards just sitting there.

988
00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.470
This looks like the beginning of a porno, you know,

989
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.860
like all I need to do is just walk into frame and next thing you know what's

990
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.470
going to be on baby. I'm okay.

991
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:10.080
What is my favorite movie that I find funny that's not meant to be funny. Um,

992
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.600
there's too many of them. You know, roadhouse. If you'd never seen row house,

993
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:19.190
some of you caught youngsters out there. You got to see stars. Patrick Swayze,

994
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.400
I believe. That's why I have his picture there. Um,

995
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:27.960
roadhouse is basically about a fuck.

996
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.490
Fuck my cell phone's gonna die, get dammit. Let me get quickly here.

997
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:36.910
Roadhouses about a rough and tumble bar and they can't seem to get a control

998
01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:41.930
over it. So they hire this bouncer from,

999
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.860
I don't know where,

1000
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:47.180
but he basically has a reputation on the bouncer circuit.

1001
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.290
That's what I love about it. Like this, this bouncer circuit like Comedians,

1002
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:55.030
you know what I mean? Like people out there like going out.

1003
01:00:55.031 --> 01:00:59.720
Did you hear Chris Rock's new hour and 45 like there's like the Chris rock of

1004
01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:03.620
bouncers out there, you know, like who's your favorite bouncer?

1005
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.070
Like up and coming bouncers have a favorite fucking bouncer, funny way.

1006
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.860
And they bring in, they bring in Patrick Swayze,

1007
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:14.861
all 138 pounds of him with this feathered mullet to come in and clean this

1008
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.460
fucking bar up and tickle.

1009
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.930
My favorite scenes in there is when after he gets hired,

1010
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:24.770
he gets into his Mercedes Benz and they're playing this music. And then,

1011
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:29.690
and then, and the show, I'm like, I'm putting on the ray bon glasses for shit.

1012
01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:34.520
At one point he slides it cassette tape it like that with some fucking amazing,

1013
01:01:34.521 --> 01:01:37.400
I guess it wasn't amazing option at that point. And, uh,

1014
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.180
there's that moment and the moment when he leans against the bar and this really

1015
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:45.830
bad white blues music is playing and he's doing this weird sort of fucking head

1016
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:50.570
nod to the music that's supposed to imply that he's tough. Um, I don't know.

1017
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.020
My cell phone's gonna die, can't explain it, but a Roadhouse,

1018
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:57.570
any movie that has Clint Howard in it. And, uh,

1019
01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.370
I find Fox News to be fucking absolutely hilarious.

1020
01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:05.570
Just the fact that people actually look at it like it's an actual news and these

1021
01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:08.870
people are journalists and uh, and you know,

1022
01:02:08.871 --> 01:02:11.930
Bill O'Reilly's always fucking hilarious screaming at people and uh,

1023
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:17.060
and then just making over the top comments like the second amendment is the most

1024
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:18.410
important amendment out there,

1025
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:22.980
the right to bear arms if anything taught us that it was hurricane Katrina.

1026
01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.900
He actually fucking said that.

1027
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:32.730
And then a nice drum and then started talking about hula against the kind of

1028
01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:37.170
cover his tracks, but he got the message out there. All right,

1029
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.640
let me answer this next question really quickly to fall my cell phone down. Uh,

1030
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:45.630
I was wondering if you're into comic books or how you fucking whore,

1031
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.350
nobody cares. Your announcement, right.

1032
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.240
Answer on the conquest. [inaudible] okay. Why don't you repeat it a third time.

1033
01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.540
All right. Uh,

1034
01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.940
I was wondering if you were in comic books and if you were at all, uh, blah,

1035
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:05.150
blah, blah, blah, blah. Who are your favorite ones? Um,

1036
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:08.460
I was in the Spiderman and um,

1037
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.440
it was actually one of my favorite comic books as a kid.

1038
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:14.570
There was a comic book was Spiderman and this Guy Power man, uh,

1039
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.260
this black a, this black superhero and he had a, you know,

1040
01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:22.530
the yellow shirt, you know, they always dressed very flamboyantly.

1041
01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:27.090
Somehow there was a fire in a building and he saved the fire, the firemen.

1042
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:30.550
So it was just a really cool one and a five.

1043
01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.890
Like the movies they make about uh, comics and it's, no,

1044
01:03:34.891 --> 01:03:38.400
I don't because most of them ended up being a chick flicks.

1045
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:40.321
You know what?

1046
01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:43.350
You should ask that question to Keith Robinson cause he's the one who really

1047
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:47.640
fucking called that uh oh, it's not special.

1048
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:52.690
Not a special announcement. Every five fucking seconds. Even all the time.

1049
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.860
No one's going to abandon that luggage. Okay. All right.

1050
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.540
It's time to wrap this fucking podcast up. Alright,

1051

1052
