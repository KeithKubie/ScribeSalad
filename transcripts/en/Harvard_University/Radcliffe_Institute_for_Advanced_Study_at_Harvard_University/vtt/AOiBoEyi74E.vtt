[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:13.350
- So, our first panel is
on tattoos and perfume,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.030
and it will be
introduced and moderated

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.330
by our beloved Professor
Diana Sorensen.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.810
Our colleagues
here know her well.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.140
But again is James
Rothenberg Professor

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.720
of Romance Languages and
Literatures and Professor

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.870
of Comparative
Literature at Harvard

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.210
and until recently--
and, of course,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.650
a very distinguished scholar
of Latin American literature.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.090
Until recently, she was dean
of the humanities at Harvard,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.210
and I would say probably in
my 30 years of experience

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.930
in universities, probably the
most beloved administrator

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.850
I've ever encountered.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.232
So, Professor Sorensen.

00:00:56.232 --> 00:00:59.058
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.690
- Thank you, Hisa.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.440
I remember very fondly the
beginning of our conversations

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.390
about this
conference, and I want

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.240
to say that seeing what you
did with those early thoughts,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.660
which were aspirational
and somewhat messy--

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.850
seeing what it's turned into
is a very real pleasure.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.230
Our panel this morning
is focused on two areas

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.120
that the Academy needs to pursue
more consistently and more

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.690
deeply.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.790
So I trust that our conversation
this morning will give us

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.430
a full sense of
what work could be

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.910
done furthering
our understanding

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.770
of both tattoos and scent.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.740
And as Professor Peters just
marvelously stated just now,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.520
I want to have us
think about the extent

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.289
to which every medium
reorganizes embodiment.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.180
And here, we're looking at skin.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.980
Skin will be the
medium through which

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.180
scent and tattoos are inscribed,
if one could use that word.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.990
That comes from my own
textual background.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.880
So you have the
speakers' bios, so I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.060
don't want to take
time away from hearing

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.410
their presentations.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.710
I simply want to say they
will be relatively brief.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.010
Then we'll have a
short conversation,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.590
and then there will be time
for questions and answers

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.380
from all of you.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.530
About Chandler Burr,
I want to just point

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.910
to two really fascinating
and important books--

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.330
one of 2003, The
Emperor of Scent,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.460
about the whole mystery of
the obsession with perfume,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.680
and one of 2008 that's
called The Perfect Scent.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:23.072
And it deals with the industry
in both New York and in Paris.

00:03:23.072 --> 00:03:26.140
Afterwards, we will
hear the presentation

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.200
of Dominique Holmes, who is
a London-based artist, who's

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.460
got one important book of
2013 called The Painted Lady:

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.880
the art of tattooing
the female body.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.530
And I'm eagerly
awaiting a book that's

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.020
expected for 2020 with the
preliminary title, Painted

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.460
Ones.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.370
And it includes, as
well, an exhibition.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.350
So I would like to invite
Dominique and Chandler to join

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.525
me up here.

00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:10.405
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.930
- Am I here?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.000
- You're there.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.714
- I was told I'm somewhere.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.813
- So, I believe you--

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:24.730
- Do I launch into it?

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.340
- Please.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.130
- OK, so, ready, guys?

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.700
OK.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.360
So, what's interesting,
I was the--

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.850
I met this guy in the
Gare du Nord in 1998.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.810
I'm a journalist.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.230
I actually have a background
in Japanese political economy

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.240
and Asian studies.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.030
And I was doing some
work-- you can go, yeah.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.440
Hand them out.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.520
Thank you.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.660
Now, this is the first work
that we're going to smell, OK?

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.690
I got into this, and I
really sort of fell into it.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.150
I met this guy in
the Gare du Nord.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.570
He is an expert of perfume, and
he was absolutely brilliant.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.820
And I wound up writing
a book about him.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.560
He's a scientist, and he was
working on a biophysical theory

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.310
of how we smell, because
we don't actually

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.420
know how we smell.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.180
We don't understand
how it works.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.820
But at the same time, the
reason he was working on it is--

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.487
don't you have-- oh,
you have a blotter.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.195
We don't think about
the art form that it--

00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:34.430
scent as a medium.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.820
Scent is one of the
most important mediums,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.740
artistic mediums, in the world.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.450
And it is unrecognized.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.400
And it's extraordinary, I
would posit to you that scent

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.760
is a medium that is right now
in the stage of recognition

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.950
by the Academy, gallerists,
museums, the public,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.130
as photography was in
the 1950s and '60s.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.480
Photography was viewed
as being this craft,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.810
this interesting thing
that, basically, you

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.120
had a photograph,
you had some reality,

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.550
and it was about as artistic
as looking in the mirror

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.970
or seeing somebody else
reflected in a glass.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.640
It was just not recognized
as artistic at all.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.250
And then we came to
understand that, actually,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.810
every photograph is a lie,
the lie in the best sense.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.622
Cindy Sherman-- there was this
wonderful biography of her,

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:32.080
and she was asked
why-- because she

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.070
used to be a painter, and
then she started photography.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.505
And she was asked, well,
why did you switch?

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:38.880
And she sort of
thought about it,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.830
and she said, um,
I don't know, I

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.360
guess it was easier to
lie with the camera.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.440
And all art is artificial,
in the best sense.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.152
It has to be.

00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:52.750
It has to be.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.790
Because it has to
have a mind behind it

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.940
that has a point of
view that has a desire

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.030
to create a reality
to present something

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.000
to you, to force you to
perceive the world in the way

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.190
that it wants you to.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.910
All right?

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.790
Now, this is one of the
most extraordinary works

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.050
of olfactory art in the
past 20 years or even more.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.380
This is a neo-romanticist
work by an artist

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.230
named Pierre [? Nugrin, ?]
who is brilliant, brilliant.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.445
And it is a--

00:07:31.445 --> 00:07:33.570
it's a relatively recent
work, as a matter of fact.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.530
I should know the--

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.947
I'm forgetting the
year right now.

00:07:35.947 --> 00:07:40.740
But it came out, and it
was, I think, something--

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.530
I think that this
is the greatest--

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.350
an extraordinary
masterpiece in several ways.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.920
First of all, as with
everything, paint--

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.450
by the way, scent is the
equal of paint and clay

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.240
and music and
architecture and film.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.160
It is absolutely
the equal of those.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.670
And it is also understood
in this highly-developed

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.210
vocabulary that we have for art.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.840
It fits in my purpose.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.010
I created the Department
of Olfactory Art

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.130
at the Museum of Arts
and Design in New York.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.210
Before that, I was the
New York Times art critic,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.750
and this was the medium that
works created in this, OK?

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.290
So I think that we
really need to understand

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.550
this is as a work.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:32.610
It fits into the schools of
art as we understand them.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.250
Do you smell how--

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.080
if you know anything
about romanticism,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.360
everything the
Romanticists believed,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.617
both in literature and music
and the other mediums--

00:08:41.617 --> 00:08:43.200
and those are very
different mediums--

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.660
but romanticism is
represented in them.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.630
Not every school is
represented in every medium.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:54.470
In this case, it was mostly
literature and music.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.700
But this is a work
of romanticism.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.560
Romanticists rejected
rationality emphatically.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.915
They rejected thought as the
source of logic and rationale

00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:12.570
and these other sorts of
things as a way to find truth.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.540
And this, I find,
is non-structured.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.700
It is not abstract
expressionist,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.575
because it has very, very
specific real-world references.

00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:25.050
Do you smell the certain things?

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.820
There is a-- and I hate--

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.140
and we apply such
a poor vocabulary

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.680
to this medium, this
artistic medium,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.620
because it is not
recognized as such yet.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.010
And we reduce it
to "notes" and sort

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.360
of stupid things like that.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.640
It's a moronic-- well,
what are the notes?

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.160
Well, I mean, Jesus,
look at a Rembrandt.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.510
Well, what are the colors?

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.250
Oh, here's black,
and here's red.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.600
Oh, there's a little yellow.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.010
Who gives a damn?

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.390
It's a Rembrandt.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.180
You don't wear the color--
you don't look at the colors,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.230
you look at the painting.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.160
You look at the work.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.060
You do not wear the notes or--

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.810
and this is the correct way
to say it-- raw materials.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.150
OK?

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.950
You wear the work of art,
and you wear it on skin.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.970
And it's made for skin.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.290
As a matter of fact,
we were talking,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.582
and this is something that's
very interesting, that I'm

00:10:12.582 --> 00:10:15.840
paired with Dominique, because
this is the only other art

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.850
medium that is created to be
worn on an extraordinarily

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.458
weird canvas, human skin.

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:25.770
OK?

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.650
Now, this is wonderful.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.020
Gender-- I read
about this a lot.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.100
Look, gender is very, very
specific in this medium.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.530
Said art was never gendered.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.840
It is ridiculous.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.720
Perfumers-- olfactory artists--

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.770
hate it.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.580
They hate it.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.530
They're not allowed to
talk about it overtly,

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.060
because they basically
work for corporations

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.380
who want to sell this--

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.770
scent is a medium that
is hugely colonized by--

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.770
damn it, how much
time do I have?

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.180
- You have-- I can tell you.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.030
You're left with
five and a half.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.780
- Five and a half.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.330
OK, thank you.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.020
Well, keep me honest.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.687
So I'm just going to
say this, and we're

00:11:08.687 --> 00:11:11.460
going to do the next one.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.610
They hate it-- you know, as
one of the greatest olfactory

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.220
artists, Jean-Claude
Ellena, said to me--

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.380
in private, but
now I'll out him--

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.960
he said, what about music?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.040
He said, is Bartok for men
and Beethoven for women?

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.340
Is Radiohead for women
and the Beatles for men?

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.882
I mean, it would-- it's
ridiculous on its face.

00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:35.090
So why do we do it with this?

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.090
For one very, very
specific reason--

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.930
post-war, one of the things
that American companies wanted

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.950
to do--

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.350
perfume is one of the greatest
ways-- along with film,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.560
by the way.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.518
Film is another medium
that's usually colonized

00:11:47.518 --> 00:11:49.640
by corporate interests.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.600
Warner Brothers, Paramount,
Fox, 20th Century Fox, so what?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.230
Disney.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.280
And that's fine.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.130
That's fine, and there are great
works of art that are actually

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.590
made by these companies.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.050
Toy Story made a billion,
two billion dollars,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.160
whatever it is.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.883
It's the most commercial
film, in a way,

00:12:05.883 --> 00:12:06.800
that you've ever seen.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.280
It is a work of art.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.180
It's extraordinary
at the same time, OK?

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.500
This was made to make money.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.400
All art is created
to make money, OK?

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.650
Let's be clear about that.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.480
But this, this is gorgeous.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.930
After the war, you
wanted to make money.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.680
It's an incredibly commercial--
lucrative, sorry, lucrative

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.640
medium.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.440
The only reason that you had--

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.170
suddenly perfume was
gendered is that they wanted

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.160
to sell perfume to a culture,
to men in a culture that

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.970
had no cultural history of
scent as an art, which is,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.320
of course, American culture.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.160
And so what they did
was they divided it

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.990
into masculines and feminines.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.690
And they were
basically-- if it said

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.550
"for him," that is only
giving heterosexual men

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.700
psycho-emotional
permission to wear scent.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.200
It's the only reason it exists.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.680
Next one?

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.530
OK, so this is--

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.500
notice I don't want
to get into the--

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.490
I'm going to tell you
later, but I don't

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.850
want to get into it right now.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.950
I don't want to talk
about the brand.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.158
I don't want to talk about
the creative director, who

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:14.480
in this case is actually
very, very important, OK?

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.680
Please keep these separate.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.270
Remember that you're
smelling the second one.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.370
Put the first one in your
pocket or somewhere else.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.480
You're welcome to
keep it, but I just

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.688
don't want you to confuse it.

00:13:21.688 --> 00:13:26.660
OK, now this-- do you
sense how different this

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.880
is as a work of art?

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:38.160
We have gone from Rachmaninoff
to, if you will, Philip Glass.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.040
- Yes.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.970
- This is a work of minimalism.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.560
It presents as a whole.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.330
The other-- the work of
romanticism, it's huge.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:49.910
You saw.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.710
It was going in every
single direction.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.940
It was speaking loudly.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.580
It was singing.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.560
There was texture to it.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.360
It was absolutely extraordinary.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.050
OK?

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:05.300
This is something-- minimalism
as a philosophy really

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.180
was not just simplicity.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.270
Simplicity was part of it.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.090
But minimalism,
philosophically, really

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.250
was an effort-- how
much time do I have?

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.780
- Two and a half.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.160
- OK, we're fine.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.710
So, minimalism was a way of
presenting just the material

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.840
and the beauty of the material.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.970
And this is a
combination of both.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.173
This is a presentation
of the materials,

00:14:28.173 --> 00:14:29.840
which, again, I'm not
going to get into,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.923
because it doesn't matter.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.530
Maybe it does matter.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.330
One of the materials
in this case--

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.040
maybe it's legitimate now.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.790
I just hate it so much that I
want to get away from it, OK?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.140
So I'm being extremist.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.640
I'm taking an
extremist position.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.830
If you look at a work of
architecture, Renzo Piano's--

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.903
the New York Times, for
example, where I worked.

00:14:50.903 --> 00:14:53.320
I mean, it's very interesting,
the materials that he used.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.280
And you could talk
about the materials,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.980
but only in the service of
understanding the overall work

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.820
of architecture.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.918
So to understand this,
there's a molecule in here

00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:00.960
that is very interesting.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.000
They're called-- they're
like, three benzyl, four

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.920
hexyl, whatever the hell it is.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.850
Sorry about that.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:11.020
But you know, they're
called lactones--

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.200
lactic acid milk.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.484
Do you smell that?

00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:18.030
Do you smell the milky quality?

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.520
It's a very, very interesting
presentation of it.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.430
I think that it's also
sort of-- there's sort

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.530
of a wood aspect to it.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.340
One minute.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.190
Let's go out with the last one.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:35.130
But it is as if you were
playing one note. (SINGING) La.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.460
And maybe there's
some more to it.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.730
Is the first work masculine,
the second work feminine?

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.000
Again, ridiculous,
absolutely ridiculous.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.920
It makes no sense, and
it denigrates the medium

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.170
to think of it in those terms.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.440
Now, this is one
of my favorite--

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:57.940
- Yes!

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.065
- --works of olfactory art.

00:15:59.065 --> 00:16:02.910
Isn't this freaking great?

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.960
Becky told me I
can't use the F-word.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.960
But it's freaking great.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.120
Isn't that amazing?

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.020
- It's glorious.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.600
- So, this is truly--

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.330
this is interesting, because
this is a work of neo,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.065
if you will--

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:27.940
no, I think it's best understood
as a work of hyperrealism.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.790
It is a realist portraiture.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.360
And I'm actually going to
ask you, what is this in--

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.900
this is an olfactory photograph.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.420
What is it a photograph of?

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.100
Lilac, exactly.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.170
Yeah.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.380
The artist is-- oh
my gosh, I forgot.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.730
The artist of the
Dries van Noten--

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.870
who the hell?

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.850
Now I can't remember
the perfumer, who is--

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.188
aw, Frederick let us down.

00:16:54.188 --> 00:16:55.730
He didn't put the
name of the artist.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.510
Now I can't remember.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.190
I think-- I'm going
to go out on a limb.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.748
I think it was Bruno
Jovanovic, I think.

00:17:00.748 --> 00:17:01.790
God help me if I'm wrong.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.170
Bruno is very, very interesting.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.970
He's a relatively young artist.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.800
But this is just extraordinary.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.380
And this artist is one of
the great, great olfactory

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.530
artists of the late 20th,
early 21st centuries.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:20.300
Her name is Olivia
Giacobetti, and she

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.950
has created here a work
of hyperrealism-- realism

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.440
because you can tell
that it's lilac.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.040
But the way that it's
presented is in, again,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.130
a way that a
hyperrealist painter

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.340
would present that visually,
or a hyperrealist photograph.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.270
You think of Mapplethorpe's--
oh, how much time do I have?

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.790
Am I over?

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.290
- Yes.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:42.600
- OK.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.100
I'm over.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.230
So, last comment--

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.910
Mapplethorpe's flowers,
those are not just flowers.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.960
You see a flower.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.960
You see so much more,
the symbolism of this.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.000
This is extraordinary.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.410
It is not just real.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.820
It is not just immediate.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.070
It is hyperreal.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.460
It is something that's
over-- it is an experience

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.690
of the object-- the very
specific object in this case,

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.820
which the others were not--

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:16.280
that forces you to reconceive
reality, like all art should.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.360
- Thank you.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.050
Thank you so much.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.810
Can you make these last all day?

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.020
- The length of time that
a work of olfactory art

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.470
lasts, it depends on its
composition, its construction--

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.790
and the technical
mastery of the artist.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.080
- Well, thank you again
so much, Chandler.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.725
And now let me turn it over to
Dominique Holmes and tattoos.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.720
- When modern tattooing
started to emerge

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.800
in the Western culture
in the late 19th century,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.220
it was predominantly men
who were getting tattooed.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.950
But this was pretty much just
down to the greater autonomy

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.630
they were afforded.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.020
But the early 20th
century saw women

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.340
such as Jesse Knight and Maud
Stevens breaking the mold

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.238
and becoming very much respected
collectors and tattooers

00:19:20.238 --> 00:19:21.030
in their own right.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:29.110
The 1920s signified the
first significant shift

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.260
in the demographic of
the tattooed individual,

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.320
but also, significantly,
the first example of

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.850
tattoos being used as
a political statement.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.140
The rise of the
suffragette movement

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.440
saw many society women
seeking out tattoos

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.180
as a way to symbolize
their crusade.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.780
And they would wear them
very proudly as a mark

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.420
of their rebellion and
their independence.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.480
And this impact that they
had led to tattoos becoming

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.700
much more popular
amongst both men

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.030
and women of all
social backgrounds,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:13.460
especially as tattoos
develop these very

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.530
romantic and
patriotic connotations

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.830
throughout the war.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:25.100
However, the 1960s saw
a very dramatic shift

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.600
in the attitudes
towards tattoos.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.570
The growing association
of tattooing

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.930
with gang culture in
the criminal underworld

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.375
led to an extreme
masculinization

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:41.600
of the aesthetic.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.550
And around the same time, an
alarming hepatitis outbreak

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.500
combined with this
and really sent

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.910
tattooing underground,
where it became synonymous

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.385
with the misfits of society.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.730
But then, what we see
again, the emergence

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:09.220
of the sexual revolution and
the women's liberation movement

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:14.350
led to nonconformist women
of all social and political

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:20.440
backgrounds looking
for ways to dismantle

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.210
the preconceived
ideas of femininity.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.820
And what better
way to do this than

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.430
by marking your
body with something

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.540
which had come to represent the
height of extreme masculinity?

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.330
In 1970, Janis
Joplin very publicly

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.410
declared that the tattoo
she wears on her wrist

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.160
was a mark of
women's liberation.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.770
Now, her artist, Lyle Tuttle,
who's very, very well-known,

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.040
well-respected
tattooer, he later

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.380
went on to describe
how the number of women

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.590
he tattooed following
on from Joplin

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.760
increased so dramatically
that he actually credited her

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.480
with the shift in the
acceptance of tattoos

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.810
within mainstream culture.

00:22:21.995 --> 00:22:24.370
I'm going to start to introduce
you to some of my clients

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.230
as we go, as well.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:33.660
The anti-feminist backlash
that arose in the '80s

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.880
saw the media start to promote
a very demure, submissive,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:46.140
and passive appearance
and expression for women.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.470
And this very
hyperfeminine appearance

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.940
became the
aspirational aesthetic.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:23:01.470
And alongside this, the
rebellious nature of tattooing

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:06.210
and the connotations that it
had with these revolutionary,

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.990
strong, rebellious
women saw it really

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:16.200
become the antithesis of
this expected behavior.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.090
And what we've
seen is this stigma

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.280
it was given has been
very hard to shift,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.690
even all these years later.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.710
As we entered the
21st century, the rise

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:34.260
in the mainstream appreciation,
I suppose, of tattooing

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.000
has seen it become more popular
than it's ever been before.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.590
A study conducted by the Dalia
Research Center in Germany

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:48.240
last year has found
that more than a third

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.780
of adults across the world are
now believed to be tattooed.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.800
And, interestingly,
for the first time,

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.240
women actually outnumber men.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.880
But the study also found
that women are almost twice

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:12.360
as likely to feel and to
receive judgmental and negative

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.090
comments and attitudes about
their tattoos than men.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:28.220
These lists are examples of
words used to describe tattoos,

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.050
either for men or for women, on
a very basic internet search.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.570
Now, these extreme contrasts
depict the gendering

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.720
of tattoo and tattoo
imagery that we've

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.980
seen emerge alongside
its surge in popularity.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:53.050
But the words are also
very much synonymous

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:57.490
with our society's
expectations on the behaviors

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.005
of the two binary genders.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.290
When we think about the
toughness and the strength

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:11.580
and the rebellion that are
associated with tattooing,

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.800
these are also things
that are associated

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.610
with aspirational male behavior.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.980
And so, as we've
seen, tattoos have

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.780
been a very welcomed part of
male culture for generations.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.250
But these words and
these ideas very much

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:36.340
oppose expected standards of
behavior projected onto women.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:42.250
And so what we see is
for women, every tattoo

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:47.120
acts as a political statement,
whether intentional or not.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.770
And this is why they've
become so embraced as a way

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.190
to reject these gendered
expectations projected

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.690
onto them.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.140
Now I'm going to take you
back to the 1990s for a moment

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.635
and back to the growing trend
amongst women for lower back

00:26:06.635 --> 00:26:07.135
tattoos.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.010
Now, it's unknown exactly when
the phrase was first coined,

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.680
but this style of
tattooing would go on

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.690
to be better-known
as the tramp stamp.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:26.390
Now, this offensive term and
the many other equally sexist

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.180
and derogatory alternatives
that you can see-- this

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.780
is a list from Urban Thesaurus.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.400
And I've actually
had to cut it down,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.010
because there were so
many, and some of them

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:43.280
were actually, I felt, too
offensive to put up there.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.010
But this is an example of the
slut shaming and the misogyny

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:54.230
that is directed towards women
who choose to be tattooed.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:59.480
Two separate studies
carried out in 2004 and 2013

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.840
both found that tattooed
women are perceived

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.500
to be more sexually promiscuous
than their untattooed

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.400
counterparts.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:18.670
This imbalance in the social
perceptions and acceptance

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.900
of men and women with tattoos
runs very much parallel

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.420
with the way that our
patriarchal culture

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.780
treats the two binary genders.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.870
As we've seen,
historically, tattooed women

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.320
represent the rebellious
and the revolutionary.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.500
And for the patriarchy,
there's nothing

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.520
that they fear more than
an angry, strong woman.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.820
As women are constantly battling
with the beauty standards that

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:53.800
are imposed upon them by
the media and by society,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.240
we're starting to see
tattoos as a tool that

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.100
can be used to redefine these
conventional ideals and a way

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.710
to form our own visions
and definitions of what

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.195
it means to be female.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.830
For myself and for many
female-identifying and

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.310
female-presenting individuals
in the queer community,

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.000
tattoos have become an important
part of our appearance, which

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.170
we formulate and we utilize
to deconstruct the beauty

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.620
standards that have been
conditioned, really,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.680
by and for the male gaze.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:46.500
And in doing so, we can
form new definitions,

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.840
I suppose, away from the
heteronormative ideals

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.660
of femininity.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.110
But equally, women
are increasingly

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.220
utilizing the political and
the masculine connotations

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.930
associated with
tattoos, but doing so

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.820
without necessarily
losing their femininity

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.700
and losing their
female appearance.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.590
Many of my clients choose
traditionally feminine designs

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.160
and wear them almost
like a kind of jewelry

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.550
as a way to enhance
their female form.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.380
And this is actually reminiscent
of the ancient Egyptians,

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.020
for whom the women
would adorn their skin

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.080
with decorative patterns very
reminiscent of the jewelry

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.130
they wore.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.693
And it was very much
considered a sign of beauty

00:29:40.693 --> 00:29:41.360
and of strength.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.430
But either way,
what we're seeing

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:51.680
is, it's actually the rebellious
act of tattooing in itself

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:58.970
which women are using
to really break down

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.900
these outdated
ideas of femininity.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:12.230
People often assume that I
tattoo more women than men.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.830
And it's quite a lazy
assumption based, primarily,

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.380
on the aesthetic
of my work, which

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:23.510
is considered delicate and
intricate and traditionally

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.340
feminine.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:30.200
But actually, my client base
covers all gender identities

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.140
fairly evenly.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.480
And so what this
demonstrates in itself

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.190
is that it's also quite
possible to subvert this idea

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.990
that a tattoo must be a
masculine accessory just

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.410
through the choice of
design that is worn.

00:30:51.152 --> 00:30:53.610
I know I'm running out of time,
so I'm going to try and get

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.550
through this quickly.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.180
My client James finds
that his tattoos

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.130
are referred to as
feminine and girly simply

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.820
because of the subject
matter of the tattoos.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.800
But to him, they're
actually a true reflection

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.120
of his own perceived
gender identity, which

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.680
is that of a young
man who connects

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.880
very much with the feminine
aspects of life just as much

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.620
as the masculine.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.380
Now, you've all been given--

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:34.900
or will be given-- a temporary
tattoo to take away with you.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.960
So even those of you who
don't have permanent ink

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.720
can experience what it's
like to be perceived

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.780
as a tattooed individual.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.160
And these designs are based on
actual tattoos that I've done.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.890
And I wanted to pick
these in particular

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.470
because I feel like as
much as you might want

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:58.690
to try to categorize them
according to, say, the lists

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.900
that we looked at or according
to ideas of what tattoos

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:07.420
for men or women
would be, I think

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.290
you'd be hard-pressed to assign
a gender to these designs.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.570
I'm just going to finish with
this, one of my favorite--

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.230
one of my favorite pictures,
one of my favorite clients.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.270
And I just want to finish--
sorry, I'm so over--

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:31.140
by saying that tattoos
represent such an important way

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.130
to portray a greater spectrum
of gender identities,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.950
because we can use imagery
that would not usually

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:41.790
be associated with
our perceived gender

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.620
and wear it in a way that
really projects onto the world

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.280
our identity and how we
want people to see it.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:57.750
And the permanence of a
tattoo, the symbolic nature

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.270
of the permanence, is
something which says,

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.290
this is not a phase.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.400
This is not temporary.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.740
This is a true
expression of who I am

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.210
and how I want you to see me.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:10.710
Thank you.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.610
- Thank you both.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.080
It was wonderful and intriguing.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.510
And the connections with
gender that you finished with,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:37.160
Dominique, made me think
about that and the permanence

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:43.370
of tattoos, given the
fact that we think

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.120
about ways to undermine
that permanence

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.840
and that there could
be shifts in our sense

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.470
of our own identity.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.940
So I wanted to ask you a little
bit how, in your thinking

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.230
and in your practice, you deal
with people who suddenly feel

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:04.340
that a tattoo they had is
something they want to distance

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.190
themselves from,
the way they might

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.219
about any other
form of embodiment

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:14.179
that they felt was
fixed and anchored?

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.429
Of course, I know
you can just go

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.350
through the process
of removing them,

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:23.179
but is that part
of your experience?

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:28.100
Or are they stable, and people
say, this is me, like my--

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.469
- I think there's a way of--

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:36.070
obviously, certain changes
that we go through in life,

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:40.300
we might like things less
as we get older, especially

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.219
the aesthetics of a tattoo.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:45.370
We might change our mind
about what we like to look at

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.960
or, yeah, what
something might mean.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.870
But I think there's
an important lesson

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.760
that you can learn
from a tattoo, which

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.560
is to maybe just accept and
let go a bit-- like, let

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.450
go of the negative
association that you

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.300
might have with something
you no longer want.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.780
And just learn to see it
as something that happened,

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.600
something you did, and
just kind of let it be.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.010
- Traces of your life.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.990
- Yeah.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.580
You know, we can't--

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.640
as much as we might want to
erase certain parts of our life

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.840
that maybe weren't the best, we
can't do that, even if we try.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.400
And yeah, if you have a
tattoo of whatever that

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.648
was, I think it can help you
just learn to move on from it,

00:35:29.648 --> 00:35:30.440
see it differently.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.870
- It comes from
memory, I suppose.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.270
- Yeah.

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.160
- Back to gender--

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:43.510
Chandler, I have to confess that
I have been effectively made

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.110
to associate scent with gender.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.050
So the first one for me was
like walking in a forest.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:57.390
I loved it, but I could imagine
wearing it, but also smelling

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.270
it in a male body.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:07.510
Second one, to me, was female.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.900
And does that mean my
connection with my brain

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:15.250
has been definitively
colonized by--

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.960
- Marketing.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.215
And so, the first one
for you was masculine.

00:36:20.215 --> 00:36:21.520
The second one was feminine.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:21.760
How about the third--

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.380
- No, the second
I could barely--

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.463
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:36:24.463 --> 00:36:26.590
The first was feminine,
the second was masculine--

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.852
that's what you said, right?

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:28.435
And the third?

00:36:28.435 --> 00:36:33.370
- The third-- no, the second
I had a hard time identifying.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.270
I couldn't smell it.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:38.920
It was so-- it was, indeed,
like minimalist music.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.170
- You couldn't smell
it, or you didn't--

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.550
- No, I had a hard--

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.460
I mean, this is my sensorium.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.770
I'm sure that I have
some smelling handicaps.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:56.140
But the third one, to
me, had a very gendered--

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.880
- Which gender?

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.690
- Female.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:36:59.190
- Female.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.085
OK, the first one?

00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:03.970
- Mm, both, but
more male, perhaps.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:05.490
- More male, OK.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.480
And the second one, you
just couldn't perceive.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.008
- Very, very lightly.

00:37:10.008 --> 00:37:11.050
- That's interesting, OK.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.540
- And so what happens,
I find, with smell,

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.960
of course, as Proust has
taught us and many others,

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.500
is that it has profound
and direct evocations.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.070
- Right.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:23.690
- So.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.490
- So, this is-- so, fascinating.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.990
OK.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:29.560
So, first of all, the first
one, which you perceived as more

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.150
masculine, is Black Orchid.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.840
It was creative
directed by Tom Ford.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.220
And Tom is one of the
great creative directors.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.850
And that fashion has
colonized, also, perfume.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.940
Perfume was never associated
with fashion until--

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.070
oh, God, what was her name?

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.620
Coco Chanel was second
and is more famous,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.770
but there was a designer
before, who was a woman.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:57.130
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:57.713
- What's that?

00:37:57.713 --> 00:37:59.170
- Paul [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:00.970
- No, he was a perfumer.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.040
This was--

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.700
- Thinking of a fashion--

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.950
- Oh, yes, Poiret.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:09.340
Paul Parquet was his perfumer.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:18.050
Yes, but he was not the
first, I don't think.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.643
Fougere Royale was him?

00:38:20.643 --> 00:38:21.810
My god, I'm forgetting this.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:25.112
Anyway, I'm forgetting
these things.

00:38:25.112 --> 00:38:26.820
So the first one was
created by Tom Ford.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.070
Black Orchid was launched--

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:34.580
its marketing was absolutely
the quintessence of feminism--

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.740
femininity.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.860
So it's supposed to
be a feminine perfume.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.260
But this is what's interesting--

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.622
again, you never had this.

00:38:41.622 --> 00:38:43.080
And you know what
culture has never

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.570
been touched by this marketing?

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.680
Arab culture.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.610
And they sell in Arab countries.

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.530
It is exactly 50/50.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.310
- That's great.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.120
- And what's interesting,
though, that even in the West,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.040
and with this aggressive--

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.888
this woman who was
a friend of Tom's,

00:38:59.888 --> 00:39:01.680
and he had her resemble
this sort of thing,

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.160
and she wore this thick
lipstick and very much

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.320
sort of 1930s film goddess.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.880
It still-- they sell a huge
amount to men, which really is,

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.030
I think, a triumph
of the actual work

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.860
over the packaging, the
marketing, the presentation.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:19.500
OK?

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.710
The second one, which
you couldn't smell--

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.540
it's one that was
creative directed

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.470
by Dries van Noten, the
designer, and Frederic Malle.

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:34.410
Beautiful, minimalist-- thank
god Frederic does not gender.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.940
It's one of the geniuses.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.730
I mean, he's an extraordinary,
extraordinary creative

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:39.600
director.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.600
The concept of the works
that he commissions

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.320
as the patron of this art
from these great artists,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.490
he has never gendered.

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.470
It's extraordinary.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.900
And good for him, OK?

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.430
I think that it
has been perceived

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:55.080
as being more masculine.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.430
Again, it's ridiculous.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.240
I don't know.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.740
I'm very interested.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.410
What percentage of you perceived
it as masculine and feminine?

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.870
Masculine?

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.520
Feminine?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.030
OK.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.980
Now-- yeah.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.440
So fewer people feminine,
and there's definite--

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.260
it definitely skews masculine.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.260
You do understand that--
everybody in this room,

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.220
I'm sure, understands-- that
that is something that has been

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.190
imposed on us, in that
you wouldn't look--

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.810
I don't know, like Rembrandt--

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:26.310
not Rembrandt, Renoir seems
to be very, very feminine,

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.575
incredibly feminine.

00:40:27.575 --> 00:40:29.510
- The bodies he
painted, certainly.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.010
- Yeah.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.520
I mean, I don't know.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.700
But is that legitimate?

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.970
Is he really for women,
and what does that mean?

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.083
The third one, En Passant.

00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:38.870
- Ah.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:39.810
- Yes.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:40.800
So, this one.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.250
And it skews--
you said feminine.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.060
It's not marketed as--

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:47.910
- One or the other?

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:50.910
- It's again Frederic
Malle's collection.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:53.730
So we had a Frederic
Malle, we had a Tom Ford--

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.760
sorry, we had a Tom
Ford Black Orchid,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.710
and then we had a
Frederic Malle minimalist,

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.608
and then we had this,
which was the hyperrealist.

00:41:01.608 --> 00:41:02.150
I don't know.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.170
Lilac, do you think--

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.042
I understand why, because
people associate flowers.

00:41:07.042 --> 00:41:09.000
It's associated with
femininity, traditionally,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.917
in this sort of thing.

00:41:09.917 --> 00:41:13.030
It smells like-- I
wear it all the time.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.960
It just smells great on a guy.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.730
- Well, now I guess
I see hands going up.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.510
May I ask anybody
who asks a question

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.800
to line up and stand in
front of the microphone?

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.180
And please identify yourselves.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.800
And if I may, given the
interest, ask brief questions.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.610
Please go ahead.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.530
- Hi, my name is Zakira.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:41.450
I wanted to address the
scent as an art work idea.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.015
I think that's
important, because scent

00:41:44.015 --> 00:41:46.790
is one of the-- probably the
strongest sensory things.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.315
We remember things of scent
going way back to our childhood

00:41:50.315 --> 00:41:51.200
and stuff.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.420
I'm actually
allergic to perfume,

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.510
so for me, it's almost
like getting hit

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.540
in the nose with a sledgehammer.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:03.560
So this analogy to, like,
music is interesting to me,

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.230
because I wonder if
someone listens to the Sex

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.500
Pistols and gets that
same visceral illness

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.650
that I sort of feel.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.380
But you would think
I'd be anti-scent.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.590
It's actually contrary.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.610
I think it's-- it's something
I think about a lot.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.610
And I'm just wondering if there
are scent artists out there

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:26.930
that do things that are more
subtle, because for me, it's

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.770
like someone carrying around a
boombox at, like, 110 decibels.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:31.280
- Right.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.428
- It's sometimes offensive.

00:42:32.428 --> 00:42:34.220
- But how did you
proceed the second scent,

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.015
the minimalist scent?

00:42:36.015 --> 00:42:36.890
- I didn't actually--

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.610
I was scared, so I
actually moved to the back.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:41.570
- Well, try it.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.640
I mean, it's extremely quiet.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.840
It's very, very quiet.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.858
It's like one of the
gymnopedie by Satie.

00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:50.900
Don't-- I mean, do you
understand why I would say

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.200
that?

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.040
I mean, it's just--

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.060
I think it's much quieter.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.945
Black Orchid is--

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:03.410
I hate to use the word
violent, but it's just--

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.120
- Intense.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:04.980
- Huge.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.480
- Yeah.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.355
- I don't think int--

00:43:06.355 --> 00:43:07.707
yeah, but I mean, it's--

00:43:07.707 --> 00:43:08.540
- That's number one?

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.623
- Sort of, but it's just--

00:43:09.623 --> 00:43:12.830
yeah, the romanticists'
work is gigantic.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.050
There's a reason I
say Rachmaninoff.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.240
So it covers you.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.580
It overwhelms you on purpose.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.960
That's the style.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.965
Try the second one.

00:43:21.965 --> 00:43:22.700
- OK.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.530
- Try the Dries van Noten.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.870
- Thank you.

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.160
- My name's Ari.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.200
My question is for Dominique.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.640
I'm pretty heavily tattooed.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.190
Most of them have
been done by men,

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.790
and they've been
great experiences.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:40.100
But the act of getting a
tattoo is super vulnerable.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.200
It's also really transactional.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.880
And so I'm curious
if you could speak

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.410
to what you feel the ethical
obligations of tattoo artists

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.320
are to their clients.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.670
- Well, that's quite
an interesting topic.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.780
There's actually-- within
the tattoo community,

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.930
there's been very
much a movement,

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.060
similar to the MeToo
movement that's

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.630
happening, where a
lot of women have been

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:11.300
coming forward and having
had quite awful experiences

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.770
with male tattooers.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.950
And people are starting
to really call out

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:19.130
this behavior, because I think
there has always been quite

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:24.320
an imbalance due to the real
masculinization of tattooing

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.670
and that the men
behind tattoos, they

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:32.570
see it as something that is
very strong and very, very

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:33.260
masculine.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.070
And so they kind of play
on that quite a bit.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:41.720
And the experiences
that a lot of people

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.640
have-- and I'm not just
talking about the more

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:49.730
extreme and quite
offensive experiences--

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.610
but even just being
in that environment,

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.680
it can be quite an
oppressive and quite scary

00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:02.290
environment because of this
sort of toxic masculinity

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:03.800
that arises quite often in it.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.780
And I think what we are
seeing these days with,

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:12.170
definitely, the rise of the
number of female tattooers

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.570
and prominent women within
the tattoo community,

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.700
is that is shifting now.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:22.580
And it's becoming much more of
a experiential process, where

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.860
I think people understand
that, like you say,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.410
it's a very vulnerable position
you're putting yourself in.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:30.530
There's a lot of
trust from both sides.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:36.560
And I think this realization
that the trust has to be there

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.120
and the experience has to be a
positive one is really changing

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.830
the way that tattoos are being
done and tattooers are working

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.890
and people are getting
tattooed, I think.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.230
Did that answer your question?

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.810
I think I rambled, sorry.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.760
- Thank you.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.120
- Hello, my name is Susan.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.470
I'm from the public and greatly
appreciate the Institute

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.540
and being able to be here.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.930
So I'm inviting a
reflective comment.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:06.980
I had an experience here.

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.570
And so I wanted to share that.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.240
I kind of deconstructed
it inside myself.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:19.220
So it relates to shared
space of speaker and listener

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:24.920
as it relates to communication,
both nonverbal and verbal,

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.790
as it relates to gender, as it
relates to embodied response.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.070
OK.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.680
This relates to Mr. Burr.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.680
Speaker, listener,
and activation.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.220
OK.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.700
So when the speaker
jumped onto the stage,

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.040
I was like, oh my god.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:43.790
I'm engaged.

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:44.840
I'm anticipating.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.610
I'm there.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.640
Then the speaker
says, ready guys?

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:57.920
And my embodied response is
an immediate abrupt split.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.550
In that split, I knew
I was not invited

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.880
into the space as a listener.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:11.260
So with that split, I
slightly removed myself.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.720
I slightly put a
layer of defense.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.390
Yet I could listen
through the defense,

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:19.880
but I knew I couldn't
fully engage.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.350
- And now I have to maybe
create more distance

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:27.090
by just minding the time.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.850
But thank you.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:30.860
Thank you.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.790
- Hi, my name is Mathis Dupont.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.360
I'm a master's student
at Simmons University.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.350
So for me, part of what
I'm coming up here is--

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.450
I'm a trans person, and
both tattoos and perfume

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.000
have been a huge part
of my experience.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.820
And so what I'm
curious for you is

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.740
the way that both
of these mediums

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.640
are able to queer the body
and transform the body

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.270
and how that happens--

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:01.230
and if you had anything to
say about the destabilization

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.520
of the natural in
your art forms.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.300
- I--

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.350
- Yes, I would say
maybe we have time

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.360
for one answer and
one more question,

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.980
and then I think
we have to close.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.480
- OK.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.450
Do you mind if I answer
this one instead of--

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:14.130
- No, go ahead.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:16.200
- There's-- I will
say one thing.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.790
When I would go to Fire Island--

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.290
I lived in New York
for a long time.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.300
We're in LA now, but
for a long time, when

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.633
I was going out to Fire Island.

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:25.050
And of course there are tons
of drag queens on Fire Island

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.050
and everybody does drag.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:26.850
It's really fun.

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:30.630
And my friends-- I was
at the Times at the time.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.940
And I would meet
these drag queens

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.010
who were friends of mine,
people I didn't know.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.900
I would say, well, how--

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.220
you're totally incomplete.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.460
What perfume are you wearing?

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.880
And they would sort of
go, [GASPS] oh, my god,

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.790
I never even thought of this,
because it is so obvious when

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:45.630
you think about it.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.360
And then there was what perfume,
you know, should I wear?

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.130
Obviously, Organza for you.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:52.482
I had one of them wear--

00:48:52.482 --> 00:48:54.360
I mean, I can't even
remember them right now.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.570
But they all felt-- they all
started wearing their perfume.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.450
Because drag queens tend to have
a personality that they create.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:04.128
They would get one, and it would
be part of their presentation.

00:49:04.128 --> 00:49:05.670
And they came to
see it as absolutely

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:09.930
essential to the
presentation of the feminine

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.240
as it is both represented--

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.265
- Coded, yeah.

00:49:12.265 --> 00:49:14.140
- And it is subverted
and this sort of thing.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.190
But it became part of that
that was integral to them,

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.070
and I loved being part of that.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.990
- Last question, I'm afraid.

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.450
- I have a question.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:27.510
I have a question about
words used as tattoos

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.970
and whether there are some
differences between men

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:30.780
and women.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.720
When we talked last night,
I told you about that tattoo

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.870
at the Kinsey Institute
over a man's penis that said

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:38.410
[SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.950
Very homophobic--
"only for the ladies."

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.260
And I wonder what
kind of words do you

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:48.010
see people choosing to
tattoo on their bodies?

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:48.510
- Thank you.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.602
- What sort of words?

00:49:53.602 --> 00:49:54.560
Oh, that's interesting.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.100
- A lot of times
it's characters.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.800
They're taking them from
Chinese or Japanese.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.300
- Yeah.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.790
Yeah.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:05.740
I think, actually--
yeah, the trend

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:11.920
in the late '90s, early 2000s
for, especially, Japanese kanji

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.550
and things like that.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:17.830
Yeah, there was a real split,
a definite split and a very

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.090
predictable one, I think.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:27.190
Men would be getting "strong"
and very powerful kind

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.530
of words, whereas
yeah, for women it

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.965
would have been things
that really represented,

00:50:32.965 --> 00:50:37.250
I don't know, beauty or
their appearance in that way.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:42.040
But I think that that trend
has very much been and gone.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.350
I don't think it really--

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:47.020
I think these days with the
words that people get tattooed,

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.130
it just tends to be
very aspirational stuff.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.505
You know, people
want things that

00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:56.230
represent their family or
their strength-- in terms

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:59.500
of their personality, rather
than aesthetically speaking.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.840
I think it-- yeah, there
has been a real shift.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.980
And I suppose it's become a
bit more neutral in that sense.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.960
- That's very interesting.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.920
I just realized
when you were saying

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.330
that-- if I were ever
going to get a tattoo,

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.320
I would get words.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.480
I would never get an image.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.620
- But you would--

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.990
- I had never thought about
that until this moment.

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.210
I would absolutely get words.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.173
- Yeah.

00:51:21.173 --> 00:51:21.840
- Remember that.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:22.110
- Interesting.

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:22.902
I'll remember that.

00:51:22.902 --> 00:51:24.010
- All right.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:27.300
- I want to thank
Dominique and Chandler.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.150
Very good.
