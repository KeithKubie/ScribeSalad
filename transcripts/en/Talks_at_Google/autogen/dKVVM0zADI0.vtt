JONATHAN: Well, good
morning and welcome to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.680
Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.790
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce the great Jean

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.170
Lightman.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.970
Jean is one Boston's most
exceptional representational

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.840
artists and teachers.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.460
As a teacher, she passes on
the knowledge and techniques

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.300
she has received as one
in the line of Boston

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.450
School of painters that has been
unbroken for over a century.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.540
This is a remarkable
lineage that I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.030
believe is unique in the
American art community.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.600
She can describe it
far better than I can,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.820
and I'll leave it
to her to do so.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.600
Jean holds a Distinguished
Artist Membership

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.330
at the Concord Art Association
and became a Copley Artist

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.500
Member of the Copley
Society, Boston in 2004.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.730
In 1989, she was elected a
Member of the prestigious Guild

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.920
of Boston Artists, where
she currently serves

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.960
as Vice President of
the Board of Managers,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.940
and curated a major historical
exhibition-- "A Woman's

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.790
Perspective: Founding
and Early Women

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.220
Members of the Guild of
Boston Artists 1914 to 1945."

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.750
Please join me in
welcoming Jane Lightman.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.131
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.190
JEAN LIGHTMAN: Thank you,
Jonathan, and thank you

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.050
all for coming today.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.660
It's an honor to
be here at Google

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.430
and have the opportunity
to talk with you about art,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.770
and in particular, the
art of the Boston School--

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.650
which is not a physical school.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.810
As Jonathan explained,
it's a painting tradition

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.290
that's been handed down from
teacher to student for over 100

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.830
years.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.300
And in my talk
today, I'll introduce

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.700
the Boston School
painters, the founders,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.730
show you the work
of the founders,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.560
and also the European
masters who influenced them,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.230
as well as their successors.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.270
I'll also show you
images of my own work,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.160
and explain how I include
the essential elements

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.990
of the Boston School
into my painting.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.400
So the Boston School
painters are essentially

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.620
Impressionists in
the sense that they

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.840
paint what the eye sees,
with particular attention

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.285
to the lights and the
shadows and the colors.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.470
Because they paint what
their eye actually sees,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.810
some areas are more distinct
and others are more diffused.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.900
So they are sometimes
called optical realists.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.740
And this should be distinguished
from photorealists,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.965
where in photorealism painting,
every square inch of the canvas

00:02:56.965 --> 00:03:00.280
is painted in precise
detail-- everything

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.370
in the exact same focus.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.280
But the way that we actually see
is some areas are more defined

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.820
and others are more diffused.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.290
And so that's the way the Boston
School painters like to paint.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.890
As you can see, they
don't all paint alike,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.320
but they're all interested
in how the light falls

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.360
across their subject.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.340
And the most important trademark
of the Boston School painters

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.770
is that all of the parts
must relate to the whole,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.890
giving the paintings
unity or breadth.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.920
Probably the earliest
Impressionist painter

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.040
was Velasquez,
Diego Velasquez, who

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.530
painted this beautiful
scene, "Las Meninas."

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.760
And you can see
how he has captured

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.030
the light and the
relationships of the light

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.600
as they fall on the scene,
And pay close attention

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.564
to the dwarf and the dog in
the lower right-hand corner,

00:03:58.564 --> 00:03:59.980
because they're
beautiful examples

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.560
of Impressionist seeing.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.850
Vermeer was another
Impressionist in the way

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.700
that we're using this term.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.830
He was fascinated by how
light fell across the scene.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.520
And his paintings have a
truth, or the look of Nature.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.329
You feel like you're in
the room with the subject.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.420
He's arranged the
model next the window.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.765
And he's described how the
light falls across her arm

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.320
and across the top of her
head covering, the back wall,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.630
and onto the table.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.020
And he's painted
relational color.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.350
He's one of the first
painters, and really

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.720
the only Dutch
painter, to understand

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.220
that there's color in
the half tones, which

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.970
is the area between the
lights in the shadows.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.210
And here he's painted
this beautiful blue note

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.700
in the top of her head covering.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.610
And he's looking at
relational color,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.110
so rather than painting
this brass pitcher and bowl

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.450
yellow, as it would
be in life, he's

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.570
showing you that it's reflecting
all the colors around it.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.566
So this is relational color
versus absolute color.

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.190
And you'll see this
over and over again

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.730
in the Boston School paintings.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.760
Chardin also influenced
the Boston School painters.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.520
And he painted beautifully
composed still lifes

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.800
using simple kitchen objects.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.220
And note how he paints
these beautiful abstractions

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.620
of lights and shadows as
they move across the canvas.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.400
In the late 19th century,
Americans flocked to Europe

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.730
to study in the
academies, particularly

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.260
in France and Germany.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.440
And they learned there the
essentials of painting,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.250
and it in particular design,
which was the key element-- so

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.290
important in academic painting.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.680
And this painting,
by Jean Leon Gerome,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.660
called "Grey Eminence" hangs
in the Museum of Fine Arts.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.760
It's a wonderful example
of academic painting.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.140
And I learned from
a Google search

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.020
that "Grey Eminence" refers to
the power behind the throne.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.280
In this case, this monk
standing on the stairs, who

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.020
was the power behind the throne
in the court of King Louis

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.170
XIII, and Cardinal Richelieu.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.360
Edmund Tarbell is considered the
founder of the Boston School.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.790
In fact, the early painters
were called Tarbellites.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.550
He traveled to France as a
young art student in 1883

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.640
and studied in the
Academy Julian.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.270
There he learned
the fundamentals

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.370
of drawing and
design and painting.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.120
But he and the other early
Boston School painters--

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.300
and I'll show you their
work in a minute--

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.940
were influenced also by
the color and the light

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.260
of the French Impressionists.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.980
And they incorporated those
two-- the color and light,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.510
and the drawing and design.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.720
And they brought
those back to Boston,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.930
and taught in what became known
as the Boston School tradition.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.580
And note here-- and you
should blur your eyes, which

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.890
is the way to look at a
lot of these paintings--

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.080
with a blurred eye, you
can see the abstractions

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.390
of dark silhouettes
cut into the light

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.480
starting on the bottom
left corner of the canvas,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.460
and traveling up and
down and up until he

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.500
gets to the upper right corner.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.020
Beautiful abstractions,
and like Vermeer, he's

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.680
fascinated with the play of
light across the model's neck

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.030
and also across the wall
throughout the whole scene.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:34.390
This is also by Tarbell, and
a wonderful portrait, again

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.790
abstracted seeing of
lights that are silhouetted

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.060
against a dark background.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.040
The painter here shows us
the beautiful form and colors

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.860
in her face and her arms,
and also in her dress.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.940
And he's seeking
something here that

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.050
is, unique, I think, to a lot
of the Boston School painters--

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.740
trying to find the beauty, the
whole harmony, and the round

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.120
forms that you see when
you look at this scene.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.290
It's reminiscent of John
Singer Sargent's portraits.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.170
And people often ask me if
Sargent was a Boston School

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.490
painter, but he was not.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.570
He painted in Europe,
studied in Europe

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.790
like the Boston painters.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.440
But his paintings are
a little bit different,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.994
and as you can see, the
model is-- he's a genius,

00:08:21.994 --> 00:08:23.910
and I'm not taking
anything away from Sargent.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.260
He was an absolutely
superb, phenomenal painter

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.840
in a number of different
genres, not just portrait.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.530
But he's not seeking out
the subtle color tones

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.770
in the round form, in the
face, in the neck, in the arms,

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.190
which I think you can see here.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:45.730
He's painting sort of a
lively, painterly ensemble

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.060
of lights and darks.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.830
Frank Benson was another
early Boston School painter.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.630
And he, like Tarbell, studied
at the Academy Julian in Paris.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.660
His outdoor paintings
glow with sunlight.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.050
As you can see here,
he's also fascinated

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.410
by the colors-- the
relational colors-- the blues

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.090
and the yellows on her dress,
also on the inside of the boat,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.830
and on his son's shirt.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.050
These are his children here.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.000
The whole painting is
a wonderful ensemble

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.080
of blues and yellows,
with a little hint of reds

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.235
in here for some interest.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.850
Benson was also an
avid outdoorsman.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:34.090
And he also did beautiful
etchings and paintings

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.900
of wildlife.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.640
And notice here his
wonderful designs--

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.200
what's called
negative shapes here

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.370
of the inside of the
wings of the Canada geese,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.890
and how he's spaced them.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.680
He sort of has a
wonderful rhythm here

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.070
that's played out from
here to here to here.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.750
It's a really beautiful example
of design-- very simple design.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.830
And Benson was a master at that.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.220
Another early Boston
School painter

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:09.620
was Joseph DeCamp, who studied
with Frank Duveneck in Germany.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.550
Notice here, this is
also a wonderful example

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.640
of what's essential to
the Boston School, which

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.630
is lost and found.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:25.630
So a found edge is where
the light and the shadow

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.540
are contrasted.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.720
And so this would be a
found edge here-- the shadow

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.580
against the background.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.240
Also you have to look
closely, but her chin

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.010
here against the
background is a found edge.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.490
This is a lost edge
under her neck.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.350
So this just dissolves
into the background.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.070
The same thing with
the back of her hair

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.090
that dissolves into the back
of her neck and shoulder,

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.320
and then all the way
down into the apron.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.320
And now look at how her apron
dissolves into the tabletop--

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.080
the shadows on the tabletop.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.960
And then this wonderful still
life here of porcelain objects

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.530
is a great example
of lost and found.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.940
So this is a found edge
here, which is sharp here

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.950
against the black of her apron.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.910
This would be a lost
edge, where the other side

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.970
of this porcelain dissolves
into the background.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.220
So you'll see lost and found
repeated in a lot of the Boston

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:21.950
School work.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.830
William Paxton studied
with Joseph DeCamp,

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.210
our previous painter.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.880
And Paxton excelled at
interiors, very much influenced

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.230
by Vermeer.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.700
This is a painting at the
Museum of Fine Arts called

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.980
"The New Necklace."

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.170
This is another wonderful
painting by Paxton,

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.250
also at the Museum of Fine
Arts, and another great example

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.130
of lost and found, and also
beautiful impressionist color.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.230
So you see here some
lost edges here.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.940
And very simple,
not highly defined,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.960
lights and shadows in
the face which dissolve

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.560
into the back of the neck.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.450
But you really have to see
this painting at the museum

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.360
to appreciate the
absolutely gorgeous colors

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.020
that the artist puts into
her back and also her arm.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.175
And notice the
beautiful form on both.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.540
His wife, Elizabeth Paxton,
was also a wonderful painter.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.730
And she excelled at
still-life paintings.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:34.410
Here she makes this terrific
ensemble of a mess of objects.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.470
It's called "The
Breakfast Tray."

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.910
And she has a variety of
edges here and angles.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.250
So here's a sharp angle
here around a sharp edge

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.740
on the edge of the
cup-- beautiful variety

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.310
of edges in the napkin, and
also wonderful color ensembles.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.750
These yellows and blues
harmonize beautifully.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.190
And then she has a little
note of red here for interest.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.900
William Paxton's
student, Ives Gammell,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.310
was responsible for
carrying the tradition

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.230
on through the 20th century.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:15.240
He taught a number of students
in the '40s, '50s, '60s,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.450
and '70s, when this tradition
was very much out of favor

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.920
with the art establishment and
the art schools of the day.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.170
Gammell loved painting these
sort of allegorical paintings.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.480
But again, note the beautiful,
harmonious color relationships.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.800
I love the blues and the
yellows in this painting.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.140
And then he has also
some notes of red.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.060
The Boston School tradition
would have surely died out

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.120
if it hadn't been for Gammell.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.670
And a number of his students
have gone on to teach,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.680
including my teacher.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.810
One of his early students
was Robert Douglas Hunter.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.640
You might be familiar
with his still lifes.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.850
He was a very well known
still-life painter,

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.800
and also noted for his
harmonious compositions.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.840
He painted what he said,
all Nature in one glance.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.990
And it does feel like
this classical still life

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.372
has a beautiful harmony
or unity about it.

00:14:17.372 --> 00:14:19.080
Gammell's student--
one of his students--

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.850
was Paul Ingbretson,
who was my teacher.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.700
And Paul excelled
at-- he's also gone on

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.700
to teach dozens of painters
over the last 30 years,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.770
and now in Manchester, New
Hampshire has an atelier.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.140
Paul excels at portraits, still
lifes, interiors, figures.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.460
And this is a beautiful
portrait of a dancer,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.990
one of my favorites of his.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.130
And he uses the full
use of relational color,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.510
beautiful color transitions
between the warm notes

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.740
on her cheek, across the
first round form on her cheek,

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.250
to the cooler blue notes at
the edge of her jaw-- also

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.720
beautiful, soft, round
edge at the edge of her jaw

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.950
and across her neck.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:08.610
And more than that-- more than
the technical accomplishments

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.900
of this painting-- he's
infused the portrait

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.075
with expression and life.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.630
This is Paul Ingbretson's
atelier in New Hampshire.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.440
And this is one of his
cast drawing students.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.210
When the student begins to study
in the Boston School tradition,

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.240
the first thing you do is
you do charcoal drawings

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.320
of these white plaster casts.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.750
And that's what this
student is doing here.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.310
And that's what I did when
I first started studying

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.790
in the late '80s with Paul.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.240
So this is my cast drawing.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.440
And it's the perfect
teaching tool.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.230
It's the opportunity
for the teacher

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.990
to what's called "true
the eye" of the student

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.700
to recognize values
and proportions.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.960
Everything is seen relationally.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.090
So I learned to see the height
in relation to the width.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.840
I learned to see how my
values-- how dark my shadows had

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.650
to be in order to make
my lights pop out,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.160
and get what's called a
light effect, which is

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.850
so important in this painting.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.880
And I also learned to
distinguish a variety of edges,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.320
as I've already pointed out.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.650
So there are sharp edges
where the value contrasts

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.840
are the highest.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.270
And then in order to
describe the form,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.840
I had to learn to
understand softer edges,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.310
and how to make
things look round.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.940
And of course, in
Socrates' beard here,

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.590
I had infinite
opportunity to do that.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.740
This is Paul's
teaching studio and

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.620
where I studied in
Roxbury back in the '80s.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.240
And a few things to point
out about the studios

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.700
for these Boston School
painters-- first of all,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.450
you notice that the wall
color is a middle value.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.280
It's not white.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.830
We never use white
walls, because the light

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.960
bounces all over white walls.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.030
And so it's hard to see what the
light is doing on your set up.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.850
This is the set up here.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.390
Also, we have high north light,
because north light is steady.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:12.690
There's no sun shining
through to change the shadows,

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.579
so the shadows are fairly
consistent throughout the day.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.920
Another thing I want to
point out is in our painting,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.599
we actually have to stand back
from the setup and the easel

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:28.140
at least three times the
height of the painting

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.660
so that you can see the
whole thing at once.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.540
Because obviously, you're
trying to get harmony or unity.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.440
So you have to be
able to see all

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.480
of the relationships--
the values

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.160
and the colors and
the proportions-- all,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.720
as Robert Hunter
said, in one glance.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.770
So you stand back.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.790
And then you look at the
painting and the setup.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.570
And then you actually walk
up and paint from memory.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.710
So I'm not looking
at the set up when

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:59.400
I'm painting this painting--
just an interesting note.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.320
So I studied with Paul
for almost 10 years,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.790
and finally cut the umbilical
cord in the early '90s,

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.050
and started painting
on my own in a studio

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.950
in Concord, Massachusetts.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.220
And I enjoy doing portraits
of kids-- children.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.470
I've also-- because they
have nice, round forms

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.410
in their faces, and I love that.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.200
I also like doing landscapes.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.756
This is a painting of the
Minuteman statue with the North

00:18:24.756 --> 00:18:25.505
Bridge in Concord.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.390
But my passion is flowers,
and in particular peonies.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.500
What I love about them
are the round shapes.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.990
And just like the figures
with the white dresses

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.380
in the earlier
paintings that you saw,

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.150
I get very excited
by all of the colors

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.630
that I see in the half-tones
between the lights

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.770
and the shadows.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.660
So these white peonies
have an infinite variety

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.000
of color in those half-tones.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.680
I also love the variety
of shapes in the peonies,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.350
and colors, and sizes.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.340
And here I also am
painting hydrangeas.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.370
Those are also fun to paint.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.560
And most of all, for me
peonies have a real life force

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.060
about them.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.430
I entitled this painting
"Chi" because the challenge

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:24.210
for me is to get the life,
the essence of these peonies.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.490
And so this is "Chi"
for that reason.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.670
So I want to explain to, show
you, how I actually set up

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:44.370
a design, make an
arrangement, and then decide--

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.380
until I'm satisfied with it.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.630
Because as Benson said,
design makes the picture.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.460
Good painting can
never save a picture

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.510
if the composition is bad.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.630
So in this setup, I was
interested in getting what's

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.110
called a chiaroscuro effect.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.720
I was interested in a
very dark background

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:08.410
with bright flowers shining out
with a lot of light on them.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.480
The problem with this,
though, as I sat with it

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.320
for a few days, was
that there really

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.746
wasn't a good, powerful
center of interest.

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.370
Everything was pretty
similar, so there

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.690
are a lot of little
flecks here, and not

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.600
particularly eye-catching.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.740
So I added in some white
peonies for interest,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.590
and started playing
around with these.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.150
But the problem here was
that they were too spotty.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.800
So I've got one here,
one here, one here.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.729
And I'm not really interested
in sort of individual peonies.

00:20:37.729 --> 00:20:40.270
I'm interested in massing them
together, and seeing what they

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.690
do as a big, abstract shape.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.380
So I started doing
that and trying

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.210
to get something interesting.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.070
And notice also that I'm
starting to play around

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:55.400
with the background flowers--
make those harmonize

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.300
with the center of
interest, because you

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.070
want your background
to accentuate it.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.690
But you don't want
it to take away

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.530
from the center of interest.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.000
As Paul used to say you
don't want something

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.270
on the backstage to be
jumping out saying look at me.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.250
Look at me.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.399
So you're interested in a
center of interest that's

00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:14.690
complemented by the background.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.010
So I'm continuing
for a few days.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:25.890
This was interesting, but it was
a little too symmetrical here.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.185
Now I'm getting a
little bit closer.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.030
And finally, this is
the finished painting

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.422
that I was happy
with in the design.

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.130
There's some interesting
negative shapes.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.680
There's an interesting
mass of light here.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.100
A movement or gesture
among the flowers that's

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.350
accentuated by the background,
and then also, notes of red

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.170
and-- it's predominantly a
yellow and blue painting.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.430
And I consider the green to
be part of the yellow family.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.730
And then I've added
some, for interest,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.370
some coral notes here.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.340
So now I'll show you start
to finish how I actually

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.570
do a painting.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.150
And this is another
setup in my studio.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.180
And the canvas, as you
can see, is side by side.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.490
And I'm standing fairly
far back in order

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.640
to see the whole thing at once.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.910
So these would be
my first marks.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.980
Really this is maybe the
first 20 minutes of working,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.900
with a very large brush
and a very blurred eye,

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.120
because I'm looking to see
the big abstractions of light

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.190
as it falls across this setup.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.750
And also the
biggest color values

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:43.580
that I can find-- so this is
sort of the approximate color

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.160
and value of the lightest area,
which would be the peonies.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.910
And then this is
the background--

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.476
the dark notes around it.

00:22:50.476 --> 00:22:51.850
Actually, this is
the background.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.590
This is the dark shadow.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.140
So I'm trying to get them in
approximately the right place.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.310
This is now I'm getting more
of the lay-in, it's called.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.880
So this would be the
first, probably 30 minutes

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.360
or one hour of doing
this painting-- again,

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.880
big abstractions of
light and shadows.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.550
I'm not painting objects.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.380
I'm painting masses of light.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.750
So for that reason, you
can see that there's

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.440
along one edge on one
side of the flower

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.080
that I'm starting to delineate.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.290
And what I'm
interested in here is

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.540
how that edge dissolves into
the dark shadow along the vase,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.700
and where that is in
approximate relation

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.580
to the edge of the canvas.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.110
So I'm continuing to
search for my light masses.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.880
I'm letting tones dissolve
into the background that

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.660
are called half-tones.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.250
I'm looking for
the leading edge.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.790
These would be the
arabesque, it's called.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.800
There are no lines in Nature, so
I don't paint around anything.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.610
I'm just painting edges
and the variety of edges

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.320
that my eye sees.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.350
And also, you might
notice that I've only

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.140
painted the left
side of this vase,

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.820
because for compositional
reasons, that

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.460
was very important to me.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.320
For one thing, the shadow
dissolves into this shadow.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.080
But also, the arm here
has a relationship

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.080
to the arc of this flower up
here and through this shadow.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.920
This was very important
to me in the design.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.450
And I want to make
sure that I've

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.614
got this fairly well
delineated at an early stage

00:24:28.614 --> 00:24:29.280
of the painting.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.370
And then there's sort of a
secondary line or movement

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.540
here.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.330
So-- and this would
be what's called

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.030
this the big look or the start.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.770
At this point, I've got
everything going pretty well.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.990
I've got the visual
order, so the areas

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.840
that jump out at your eye
when you blur your eyes

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.820
also come forth or come
forward on the canvas.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.370
And areas that dissolve
recede on the canvas.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:07.820
So this is what my eye
sees when I blur it

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.460
with a very blurred eye.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.370
I'm also looking for
shifts-- shifts of value

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.060
and also shifts of color.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.690
So I'm looking for where
my yellows dissolve

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:23.840
into blue notes and just
color shifts all over here.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.610
Also, it has the appearance
of images coming out

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.510
of a fog, which is also
that lost and found look.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.360
So the rest will be refinements.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.880
So I'll go area by area
now, and start painting

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.430
the top left here was one area.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.020
So again, I'm not
painting objects.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.510
I'm painting areas
of light and shadow

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.350
and where they dissolve
into one another.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:58.690
This is also-- when I'm
working area by area,

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.150
I'm working in a way
that we call painting

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.700
from the back straggler.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.620
So if you can imagine a shepherd
who's herding a flock of sheep

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.960
from one pasture to the next,
he moves that big flock of sheep

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.890
along, but he might
have a small group

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.290
that's sort of lagging behind.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.706
And those are his
back stragglers.

00:26:16.706 --> 00:26:19.260
So he goes and he pulls
those flock of sheep forward.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.870
And then another flock
of sheep will lag behind.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.520
So we're painting from
the back straggler here.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.070
And in this case, you're trying
to get the whole ensemble

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.044
moving pretty much at once.

00:26:31.044 --> 00:26:32.960
But obviously, you have
to paint area by area.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.340
You can't paint the whole
painting all at one time.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.190
So the back straggler
for me would

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.791
be this bottom right-hand area.

00:26:38.791 --> 00:26:40.290
And that's what I
would have painted

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.650
in probably the next--
after I painted this area,

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.550
I would've gone and
painted in this area.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.490
So I'm also pushing
the light effect here,

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.640
looking for big color shifts.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.980
And at this point, everything
is pretty well defined.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.390
And I'm fairly happy
with it, but it

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:06.460
doesn't have the harmony
or the unity of the setup,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.070
of the concept that
I'm looking for.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.350
And it's important to understand
we're not copying, simply

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.710
blindly copying, Nature.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.420
We're looking for something
bigger-- that breadth

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.710
that I was talking
about earlier.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.020
So I'm working day
to day, pulling back,

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.990
looking for the
biggest relationships

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.700
I can see, with the big, blurred
eye with these hydrangeas

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.050
and how they relate
to the whole ensemble.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.970
I often use a mirror, which
I look at upside down,

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.480
because it reverses everything
backwards and upside down.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.820
And it helps me see
with a very fresh eye.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.810
So this was my
finished painting.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.630
And I couldn't find any
more back stragglers here.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:53.890
It has the harmony that I was
looking for, and the big look.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:58.570
It also has the vibrancy in
the lights and the shadows.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:05.550
And unity-- strong light effect,
magical color relationships--

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.060
all very important
in this painting.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:15.310
So I wanted to just
tell you a little bit

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.350
about-- you can see a lot of the
early Boston School paintings

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.360
at the Museum of Fine Arts.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.520
And contemporary Boston
School painters-- a number

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.830
of us are Members of the
Guild of Boston Artists, which

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.990
was founded by
Tarbell and Benson

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.440
and DeCamp and the early
Boston School painters.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.400
It's a nonprofit gallery
on Newbury Street,

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.170
and continues today.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.000
We just celebrated
our 100th anniversary.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.900
So this is actually a photo
of the gallery in 1914

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.240
for the inaugural exhibition.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.640
And the gallery is still there.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.420
This mantle is still there.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.240
And now they're paintings of
contemporary Boston School,

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.020
and also other wonderful
painters painting

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.530
in different
traditions-- tonalists,

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.300
Hudson River School--
some fabulous painters.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.870
So I encourage you to take
a look at the gallery,

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.730
and see these
paintings for yourself.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.160
Some of the-- just a
few of those painters

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.280
are Mary Minifie, who's a
wonderful portrait painter

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.410
and also does beautiful still
lifes, David Curtis, who's

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:18.020
also a student of Ives
Gammell, like my teacher.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:24.050
And he paints wonderful
landscapes on the North Shore,

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.030
Anita Johnson, who paints
all kinds of figurative work

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.700
as well as still life,
and Pamela Pindell, who

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:36.380
was a student of Robert
Hunter's, and does

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.150
a number of different
paintings as well as

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:44.170
sculpture and beautiful
drawings, as you can see here.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.370
So thank you very much.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.640
Also, I appreciate being able
to use the images from the Art

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.150
Renewal Center.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.199
And so I'll take any
questions that you have.

00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:55.240
JONATHAN: That was great.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.360
Thank you.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.660
I'm curious-- given the
longevity of the Boston School,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.290
is there any obligation
on the part of you

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.460
as a student or other students
to go out and become teachers

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.860
on your own?

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.270
JEAN LIGHTMAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.680
I'm deeply appreciative
of Paul Ingbretson,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.250
because he is passing this on.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.420
And there are other teachers,
other people teaching this,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.950
actually throughout the country.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.660
But I think we, as students,
do have an obligation

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.580
to pass it on.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.960
And I do some teaching myself.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.710
Mary Minifie also teaches.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:33.770
David Curtis teaches.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:38.040
So there are a number of
us who are endeavoring

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.730
to pass this very
valuable painting

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.950
traditional on to
the next generation.

00:30:46.734 --> 00:30:48.150
So if there are
no more questions,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.710
I thank you all
for coming today.
