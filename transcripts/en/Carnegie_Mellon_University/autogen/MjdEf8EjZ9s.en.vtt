data and utilities and when we started

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:20.260
data and utilities and when we started
 

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.810
data and utilities and when we started
to conceptualize this I think one of the

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:21.820
to conceptualize this I think one of the
 

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.120
to conceptualize this I think one of the
things that really became one of the

hallmarks of the conversation was the
 

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.630
hallmarks of the conversation was the
need for partnerships and the need for

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.640
need for partnerships and the need for
 

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.330
need for partnerships and the need for
dialogue and as I just you know kind of

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.340
dialogue and as I just you know kind of
 

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.620

look down the line and one of the things
 

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.570
look down the line and one of the things
is I've had the pleasure of meeting each

in the city of Pittsburgh and and it
 

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.730
in the city of Pittsburgh and and it
really starts me off kind of the the

between cities and utilities and
 

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.010
between cities and utilities and
universities and and the reason I think

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:02.020
universities and and the reason I think
 

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.540
universities and and the reason I think
is because there's there's big

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:03.550
is because there's there's big
 

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.040

taking the viewpoint we have three

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:04.950
taking the viewpoint we have three
 

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.320
taking the viewpoint we have three
objectives that we want to accomplish

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.330
objectives that we want to accomplish
 

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.240
objectives that we want to accomplish
much like the utility has these same

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.250
much like the utility has these same
 

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:13.600
much like the utility has these same
objectives we want reliability we want

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:13.610
objectives we want reliability we want
 

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.850
objectives we want reliability we want
efficiency or affordability and we want

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860
efficiency or affordability and we want
 

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.490
efficiency or affordability and we want
to improve sustainability so those are

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500
to improve sustainability so those are
 

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.950
to improve sustainability so those are
the three areas that are driving a lot

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960
the three areas that are driving a lot
 

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.890
the three areas that are driving a lot
of the need to collaborate and to use

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900
of the need to collaborate and to use

the data is very unstructured we get

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:30.390
the data is very unstructured we get
 

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.680
the data is very unstructured we get
reams of data as a utility but we don't

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:33.690
reams of data as a utility but we don't
 

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.050
reams of data as a utility but we don't
structure that data I haven't even

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:36.060

spoken about monitors and sensors that

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.130
spoken about monitors and sensors that
 

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.460
spoken about monitors and sensors that
are throughout the utility system as we

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:40.470
are throughout the utility system as we
 

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.740
are throughout the utility system as we
begin to convert our substation so those

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:42.750
begin to convert our substation so those
 

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.810

substations are much smarter more

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820
substations are much smarter more
 

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.320
substations are much smarter more
analytic and more data-driven so we're

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:48.330
analytic and more data-driven so we're
 

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.570
analytic and more data-driven so we're
moving into a society where technology

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580
moving into a society where technology
 

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.180
moving into a society where technology
is producing data and we need to have a

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:53.190
is producing data and we need to have a
 

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.100
is producing data and we need to have a
way that we are able to structure that

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.110
way that we are able to structure that
 

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.010
way that we are able to structure that
data and make that data much more useful

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020
data and make that data much more useful
 

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.260
data and make that data much more useful
that's why collaboration is essential so

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:03.270
that's why collaboration is essential so
 

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.580
that's why collaboration is essential so
I'll approach it a little bit

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:04.590
I'll approach it a little bit
 

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.490
I'll approach it a little bit

right that vision that we have to work
 

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.830
right that vision that we have to work
and live much more sustainably than we

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840
and live much more sustainably than we
 

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.260
and live much more sustainably than we
have have in the past - I think you

this we have some inertia ahead of us

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940
this we have some inertia ahead of us
 

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.400
this we have some inertia ahead of us
because the economics aren't always

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.410
because the economics aren't always
 

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.320
because the economics aren't always
there so how do you overcome that

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:45.330
there so how do you overcome that

we're talking about I think afford us

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860
we're talking about I think afford us
 

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.710
we're talking about I think afford us
the opportunity to do that so as we

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720
the opportunity to do that so as we
 

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.680
the opportunity to do that so as we
think about smart cities we think that

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:54.690
think about smart cities we think that
 

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.020
think about smart cities we think that
they're underpinned by three pillars the

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:57.030
they're underpinned by three pillars the
 

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.010
they're underpinned by three pillars the
first pillar is you

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020
first pillar is you
 

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.780
first pillar is you
the cost-effectively deploy all the

00:21:59.780 --> 00:21:59.790
the cost-effectively deploy all the
 

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.340
the cost-effectively deploy all the
sensors that are out in the field to

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:01.350
sensors that are out in the field to
 

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.620
sensors that are out in the field to
gather that data the second pillar then

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:03.630
gather that data the second pillar then
 

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.360
gather that data the second pillar then
is you have to develop a communication

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:05.370
is you have to develop a communication
 

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.370
is you have to develop a communication
network so you can collect all that data

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380
network so you can collect all that data
 

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.710
network so you can collect all that data
and move it up to the cloud the third

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720
and move it up to the cloud the third
 

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.990
and move it up to the cloud the third
pillar then is that you have open access

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000
pillar then is that you have open access
 

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.720
pillar then is that you have open access
of that data so that we can take the

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:14.730
of that data so that we can take the
 

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.040
of that data so that we can take the
folks that have the intellectual

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:16.050
folks that have the intellectual
 

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.900
folks that have the intellectual
capability at the universities that have

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:17.910
capability at the universities that have
 

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.480
capability at the universities that have
a forward lean on that technology and

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:20.490
a forward lean on that technology and
 

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.430
a forward lean on that technology and
forward thinking that develop the tools

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440
forward thinking that develop the tools
 

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.410
forward thinking that develop the tools
that we need so that we can operate and

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:24.420
that we need so that we can operate and
 

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.420
that we need so that we can operate and
take that data and make effective

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:26.430
take that data and make effective
 

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.670
take that data and make effective
economic use out of it so having said

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:28.680
economic use out of it so having said
 

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.660
economic use out of it so having said
that then when you look at the

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:29.670
that then when you look at the
 

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.310
that then when you look at the
partnerships that are evolving between

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320
partnerships that are evolving between
 

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.770
partnerships that are evolving between
universities between utilities between

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780
universities between utilities between
 

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.500
universities between utilities between
cities we all have assets in the field

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:36.510
cities we all have assets in the field
 

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.510
cities we all have assets in the field
the city is a big consumer of some of

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520
the city is a big consumer of some of
 

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.860
the city is a big consumer of some of
the information that will come out of

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:39.870
the information that will come out of
 

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.150
the information that will come out of
this to help them operate more

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:41.160
this to help them operate more
 

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.220
this to help them operate more
efficiently as a utility we're a

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:43.230
efficiently as a utility we're a
 

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.530
efficiently as a utility we're a
platform operator so we have lots of

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:45.540
platform operator so we have lots of
 

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.330

about that a little bit later from some

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580
about that a little bit later from some
 

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.580
about that a little bit later from some
of the other panel participants so we

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:52.590
of the other panel participants so we
 

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.080
of the other panel participants so we
have that expertise it's there we've

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:54.090
have that expertise it's there we've
 

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.030
have that expertise it's there we've
developed communication networks to

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:56.040
developed communication networks to
 

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.450

you were talking about leveraging assets

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:28.230
you were talking about leveraging assets
 

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.780
you were talking about leveraging assets
because one of the things that we've

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:29.790
because one of the things that we've
 

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.520
because one of the things that we've
done with the class this semester and

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:31.530
done with the class this semester and
 

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.050
done with the class this semester and
many of the students are here with us

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:33.060
many of the students are here with us
 

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.550
many of the students are here with us
today so there I'm sure going to be

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:34.560
today so there I'm sure going to be
 

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.920
today so there I'm sure going to be
going to be listening very carefully and

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:36.930
going to be listening very carefully and
 

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:41.060
going to be listening very carefully and
intently hi is that we do have an

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:41.070
intently hi is that we do have an
 

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.250
intently hi is that we do have an
opportunity particularly in a city that

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260
opportunity particularly in a city that
 

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.310
opportunity particularly in a city that
is rebuilding as we are or at a point of

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320
is rebuilding as we are or at a point of
 

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.230
is rebuilding as we are or at a point of
infrastructure improvement should really

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240
infrastructure improvement should really
 

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.470
infrastructure improvement should really
take that opportunity to capitalize

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480
take that opportunity to capitalize
 

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.810
take that opportunity to capitalize
across utilities and so that's really

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820
across utilities and so that's really
 

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.880
across utilities and so that's really
what we're thinking about as a part of

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:55.890
what we're thinking about as a part of
 

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.220
what we're thinking about as a part of
the class is how can we actually create

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:58.230
the class is how can we actually create
 

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.100
the class is how can we actually create
an ROI what makes sense for each

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.110
an ROI what makes sense for each
 

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.250
an ROI what makes sense for each
individual player within a city to make

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260
individual player within a city to make
 

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.200
individual player within a city to make
those investments investments and and

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.210
those investments investments and and
 

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.470
those investments investments and and
investigate that data together so that's

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480
investigate that data together so that's
 

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.730
investigate that data together so that's
really sort of what we've been looking

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740
really sort of what we've been looking
 

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.980
really sort of what we've been looking

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:03.029
charging stations in many states a
utility is precluded from owning and

00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039
utility is precluded from owning and
 

00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:05.999
utility is precluded from owning and
building charging infrastructure so if

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:06.009
building charging infrastructure so if
 

00:27:06.009 --> 00:27:11.820
building charging infrastructure so if
you want to enhance EB penetration you

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:11.830
you want to enhance EB penetration you
 

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.609
you want to enhance EB penetration you
certainly need to have charging stations

00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:14.619
certainly need to have charging stations
 

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:17.159
certainly need to have charging stations
it makes a lot of sense to me to have

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:17.169
it makes a lot of sense to me to have
 

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:19.680
it makes a lot of sense to me to have
the utility be a partner in building two

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:19.690
the utility be a partner in building two
 

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.379
the utility be a partner in building two
charging stations so we figured out a

00:27:22.379 --> 00:27:22.389
charging stations so we figured out a
 

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:24.690
charging stations so we figured out a
way to get into this we said let's do

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:24.700
way to get into this we said let's do
 

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.019
way to get into this we said let's do
pilots let's demonstrate that we add

00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:28.029
pilots let's demonstrate that we add
 

00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:31.529
pilots let's demonstrate that we add
value and the concerns and others have

00:27:31.529 --> 00:27:31.539
value and the concerns and others have
 

00:27:31.539 --> 00:27:34.470
value and the concerns and others have
about our participation do not outweigh

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480
about our participation do not outweigh
 

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.210
about our participation do not outweigh
the benefits that we bring to the table

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:36.220
the benefits that we bring to the table
 

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.489
the benefits that we bring to the table
those are just several examples of how

00:27:38.489 --> 00:27:38.499
those are just several examples of how
 

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:41.399
those are just several examples of how
partnerships can be helpful but the

00:27:41.399 --> 00:27:41.409
partnerships can be helpful but the
 

00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:42.899
partnerships can be helpful but the
utilities participation those

00:27:42.899 --> 00:27:42.909
utilities participation those
 

00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:44.609
utilities participation those
partnerships can be constrained by the

00:27:44.609 --> 00:27:44.619
partnerships can be constrained by the
 

00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:47.609
partnerships can be constrained by the
regulatory process do you have to start

00:27:47.609 --> 00:27:47.619
regulatory process do you have to start
 

00:27:47.619 --> 00:27:49.409
regulatory process do you have to start
to bring the regulator's in as part of

00:27:49.409 --> 00:27:49.419
to bring the regulator's in as part of
 

00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:51.389
to bring the regulator's in as part of
the partnership is that one of the one

00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399
the partnership is that one of the one
 

00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:53.220

of the ways that we overcome I mean kind

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:53.230
of the ways that we overcome I mean kind
 

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.389

of what you're leading to David is that

00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399
of what you're leading to David is that
 

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:55.859
of what you're leading to David is that
we have all this technology out there

00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:55.869
we have all this technology out there
 

00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:57.989
we have all this technology out there
but the rules of the game are creating

00:27:57.989 --> 00:27:57.999
but the rules of the game are creating
 

00:27:57.999 --> 00:28:00.450
but the rules of the game are creating
an impediment for us to make that

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:00.460
an impediment for us to make that
 

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.609
an impediment for us to make that
penetration into the market I mean how

00:28:02.609 --> 00:28:02.619
penetration into the market I mean how
 

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:03.869
penetration into the market I mean how
are you guys starting to find ways to

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:03.879
are you guys starting to find ways to
 

00:28:03.879 --> 00:28:05.909
are you guys starting to find ways to
overcome that either in kind of the

00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919
overcome that either in kind of the
 

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:08.489
overcome that either in kind of the
sensor space or utility or with clean

00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:08.499
sensor space or utility or with clean
 

00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:10.379

that being an impediment yeah I think

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:12.490
that being an impediment yeah I think
 

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.129
that being an impediment yeah I think
for us in California I mean our

for the private sector to work within so

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:35.770
for the private sector to work within so
 

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.310
for the private sector to work within so
that so I think that's a you know that's

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320
that so I think that's a you know that's
 

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.530
that so I think that's a you know that's
not a regulatory thing it's a it's a

know we need to figure out if we're

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:44.740
know we need to figure out if we're
 

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.650
know we need to figure out if we're
going to really propel adoption of

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:46.660
going to really propel adoption of
 

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.220
going to really propel adoption of
technology a lot of these kind of

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:49.230
technology a lot of these kind of
 

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.540

bureaucracies are not allowing for it

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:51.550
bureaucracies are not allowing for it
 

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.490
bureaucracies are not allowing for it
and that's something that we we have to

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:53.500
and that's something that we we have to
 

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.230
and that's something that we we have to
turn upside down in order to move this

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240
turn upside down in order to move this
 

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.140

forward I mean on that bureaucracy front

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.150
forward I mean on that bureaucracy front

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:36.230
the water company to develop the same
 

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.289
the water company to develop the same
Network the gas utility developed the

00:33:38.289 --> 00:33:38.299
Network the gas utility developed the
 

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:40.690
Network the gas utility developed the
same network using one network you can

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:40.700
same network using one network you can
 

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.310
same network using one network you can
kind of leverage that investment once

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320
kind of leverage that investment once
 

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.570
kind of leverage that investment once
because we're all serving the same

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:43.580
because we're all serving the same
 

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.789
because we're all serving the same
stakeholders right but when you look at

00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799
stakeholders right but when you look at
 

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:47.499
stakeholders right but when you look at
other utilities under that motto it's

00:33:47.499 --> 00:33:47.509
other utilities under that motto it's
 

00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:49.810
other utilities under that motto it's
gee well if I buy that service from

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:49.820
gee well if I buy that service from
 

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.999
gee well if I buy that service from
Duquesne Light I can't earn a return on

00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:52.009
Duquesne Light I can't earn a return on
 

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:54.099
Duquesne Light I can't earn a return on
it so there's ways to overcome that we'd

00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:54.109
it so there's ways to overcome that we'd
 

00:33:54.109 --> 00:33:55.749
it so there's ways to overcome that we'd
have to go to the regulator and say look

00:33:55.749 --> 00:33:55.759
have to go to the regulator and say look
 

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:57.609
have to go to the regulator and say look
just because we're buying a service from

00:33:57.609 --> 00:33:57.619
just because we're buying a service from
 

00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:59.289
just because we're buying a service from
a utility they should be allowed to earn

00:33:59.289 --> 00:33:59.299
a utility they should be allowed to earn
 

00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:01.239
a utility they should be allowed to earn
some type of synthetic return on that

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:01.249
some type of synthetic return on that
 

00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:02.919
some type of synthetic return on that
right this way we're getting a much more

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:02.929
right this way we're getting a much more
 

00:34:02.929 --> 00:34:04.810
right this way we're getting a much more
efficient you know deployment you know

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:04.820
efficient you know deployment you know
 

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.519
efficient you know deployment you know
of capital so I think those programs

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:06.529
of capital so I think those programs
 

00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:08.319
of capital so I think those programs
kind of you know tease some of those

00:34:08.319 --> 00:34:08.329
kind of you know tease some of those
 

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:10.359
kind of you know tease some of those
things out and it's it's going to be a

00:34:10.359 --> 00:34:10.369
things out and it's it's going to be a
 

00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:13.089
things out and it's it's going to be a
slower process then you would like when

00:34:13.089 --> 00:34:13.099
slower process then you would like when
 

00:34:13.099 --> 00:34:14.500
slower process then you would like when
you're involved you know with the

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:14.510
you're involved you know with the
 

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.389
you're involved you know with the
regulated industry part of its

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399
regulated industry part of its
 

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:18.369
regulated industry part of its
bureaucracy as you indicated and I think

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:18.379
bureaucracy as you indicated and I think
 

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:19.780
bureaucracy as you indicated and I think
we're working hard to knock all of that

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:19.790
we're working hard to knock all of that
 

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.030
we're working hard to knock all of that
down we certainly are Duquesne Light but

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040
down we certainly are Duquesne Light but
 

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.549
down we certainly are Duquesne Light but
the regulatory process really we need an

00:34:24.549 --> 00:34:24.559
the regulatory process really we need an
 

00:34:24.559 --> 00:34:26.230
the regulatory process really we need an
increased focus on a part of our

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240
increased focus on a part of our
 

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.940
increased focus on a part of our
regulators to kind of up their game a

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:27.950
regulators to kind of up their game a
 

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.539
regulators to kind of up their game a
bit and you know start being

00:34:30.539 --> 00:34:30.549
bit and you know start being
 

00:34:30.549 --> 00:34:33.039
bit and you know start being
streamlining the processes so to speak

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:33.049
streamlining the processes so to speak
 

00:34:33.049 --> 00:34:34.990
streamlining the processes so to speak
but as we know there's a lot of process

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000
but as we know there's a lot of process
 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.220
but as we know there's a lot of process
involved you know in that suit so maybe

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:39.230
involved you know in that suit so maybe
 

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.109

I'm gonna pivot to you here's you know

00:34:42.609 --> 00:34:42.619
I'm gonna pivot to you here's you know
 

00:34:42.619 --> 00:34:45.280
I'm gonna pivot to you here's you know
so regulations are put in place for a

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.290
so regulations are put in place for a
 

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.200
so regulations are put in place for a
reason right you know so that you're

sort of continuity within a system and
 

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:53.919
sort of continuity within a system and
one of the things that we talked about

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:53.929
one of the things that we talked about
 

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.039
one of the things that we talked about
earlier is these ideas of challenges you

00:34:57.039 --> 00:34:57.049
earlier is these ideas of challenges you
 

00:34:57.049 --> 00:34:58.210
earlier is these ideas of challenges you
know what are some of the challenges

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:58.220
know what are some of the challenges
 

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.520
know what are some of the challenges
that you guys see in your organization's

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:00.530
that you guys see in your organization's
 

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.579
that you guys see in your organization's
in terms of you know what's up ahead

in terms of you know what's up ahead
 

00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:05.680
in terms of you know what's up ahead
what would kind of you know what are you

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:05.690
what would kind of you know what are you
 

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.180
what would kind of you know what are you

worrying about whether it's like cyber
 

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:10.390
worrying about whether it's like cyber

putting them in a room and dealing with
 

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.440
putting them in a room and dealing with
some very tough issues and it's an

some very tough issues and it's an
 

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.380
some very tough issues and it's an
off-the-record conversation we have

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:50.390
off-the-record conversation we have
 

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.029
off-the-record conversation we have
members of the financial community there

members of the financial community there
 

00:35:52.039 --> 00:35:54.339
members of the financial community there
too and we deal with these cutting-edge

00:35:54.339 --> 00:35:54.349
too and we deal with these cutting-edge
 

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:57.039
too and we deal with these cutting-edge
issues so that the regulator's get an

00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:57.049
issues so that the regulator's get an
 

00:35:57.049 --> 00:36:00.640
issues so that the regulator's get an
understanding of how their regulations

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:00.650
understanding of how their regulations
 

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.700
understanding of how their regulations
can be an impediment to the evolution

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:03.710
can be an impediment to the evolution
 

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.940
can be an impediment to the evolution
and the adoption of technologies that

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:06.950
and the adoption of technologies that
 

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.910
and the adoption of technologies that
has worked but as rich said that is a

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920
has worked but as rich said that is a
 

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.230
has worked but as rich said that is a
very very very slow process because

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240
very very very slow process because
 

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.120
very very very slow process because
there are hundreds of regulators

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:16.130
there are hundreds of regulators
 

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:17.680
there are hundreds of regulators
throughout the United States

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:17.690
throughout the United States
 

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.740
throughout the United States
you can pull ten regulators in if you if

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:20.750
you can pull ten regulators in if you if
 

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.079
you can pull ten regulators in if you if
you multiply that it would take you a

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:23.089
you multiply that it would take you a
 

00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:25.569
you multiply that it would take you a
hundred years so there's got to be a

00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:25.579
hundred years so there's got to be a
 

00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:28.509
hundred years so there's got to be a
better process so the regulator's get

00:36:28.509 --> 00:36:28.519
better process so the regulator's get
 

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:31.960
better process so the regulator's get
together three major times a year so

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:31.970
together three major times a year so
 

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.539
together three major times a year so

sure so there's a lot of things that are

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:47.810
sure so there's a lot of things that are
 

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.870
sure so there's a lot of things that are
going on so you have kind of the

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880
going on so you have kind of the
 

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.270
going on so you have kind of the
physical risk to the system and then you

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280
physical risk to the system and then you
 

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.089
physical risk to the system and then you
have the cyber risk to the system so

00:40:55.089 --> 00:40:55.099
have the cyber risk to the system so
 

00:40:55.099 --> 00:40:56.829
have the cyber risk to the system so
physically you know things that we're

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839
physically you know things that we're
 

00:40:56.839 --> 00:40:59.410
physically you know things that we're
doing there's a number of things we do

00:40:59.410 --> 00:40:59.420
doing there's a number of things we do
 

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.760
doing there's a number of things we do
to harden the system the harden our

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:00.770
to harden the system the harden our
 

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.050
to harden the system the harden our
substation so that could be the

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:02.060
substation so that could be the
 

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.120
substation so that could be the
infrastructure around the substation to

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.130
infrastructure around the substation to
 

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.680
infrastructure around the substation to
protect it from somebody trying to do a

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:05.690
protect it from somebody trying to do a
 

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.290
protect it from somebody trying to do a
bad thing to the substation we take a

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:08.300
bad thing to the substation we take a
 

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.930
bad thing to the substation we take a
look at the infrastructure of the how we

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:10.940
look at the infrastructure of the how we
 

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.329
look at the infrastructure of the how we
design our grid so that we have

00:41:13.329 --> 00:41:13.339
design our grid so that we have
 

00:41:13.339 --> 00:41:15.640
design our grid so that we have
redundancy built into the grid we have

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:15.650
redundancy built into the grid we have
 

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.370
redundancy built into the grid we have
two-way flows so to speak that we don't

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:18.380
two-way flows so to speak that we don't
 

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.010
two-way flows so to speak that we don't
have any radial feeds or we minimize the

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:21.020
have any radial feeds or we minimize the
 

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.140
have any radial feeds or we minimize the
radio feeds that are out there we have a

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:23.150
radio feeds that are out there we have a
 

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.910
radio feeds that are out there we have a
lot of technology that we deployed I

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920
lot of technology that we deployed I
 

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.680
lot of technology that we deployed I
mentioned earlier we have thousands of

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:26.690
mentioned earlier we have thousands of
 

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.329
mentioned earlier we have thousands of
sensors in the field those are

00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:28.339
sensors in the field those are
 

00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:29.890
sensors in the field those are
controlled through our SCADA system in

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:29.900
controlled through our SCADA system in
 

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.569
controlled through our SCADA system in
our control room so a good example of

00:41:31.569 --> 00:41:31.579
our control room so a good example of
 

00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:33.550
our control room so a good example of
that is a lot of times when you see an

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560
that is a lot of times when you see an
 

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.380
that is a lot of times when you see an
adage you may see your power go out for

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:35.390
adage you may see your power go out for
 

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.120
adage you may see your power go out for
a minute or so and then it comes back on

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.130
a minute or so and then it comes back on
 

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.190
a minute or so and then it comes back on
that's our control room that's looking

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200
that's our control room that's looking
 

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.660
that's our control room that's looking
out there and seeing through the

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:40.670
out there and seeing through the
 

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.690
out there and seeing through the
technology we have where is that fault

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:43.700
technology we have where is that fault
 

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.819
technology we have where is that fault
located and then they're isolating the

00:41:45.819 --> 00:41:45.829
located and then they're isolating the
 

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:48.880
located and then they're isolating the
system remotely so that a good example

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:48.890
system remotely so that a good example
 

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.829

a Fault in one location they know where
 

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.740
a Fault in one location they know where
they can isolate it from the rest of the

you have to roll a vehicle out there to
 

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.840
you have to roll a vehicle out there to
repair you know the woods out there but

we isolate it that way as you start

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:42.390
we isolate it that way as you start
 

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.359
we isolate it that way as you start
looking at the proliferation of smart

looking at the proliferation of smart
 

00:42:44.369 --> 00:42:46.250
looking at the proliferation of smart
meters and then the customer data and

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.260
meters and then the customer data and
 

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.170
meters and then the customer data and
things that come out of that we have to

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180
things that come out of that we have to
 

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.520
things that come out of that we have to
look at that a bit differently because

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:49.530
look at that a bit differently because
 

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.200
look at that a bit differently because
there's desires for people to access

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.210
there's desires for people to access
 

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.390
there's desires for people to access
some of that information so when you

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400
some of that information so when you
 

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.160
some of that information so when you
think about cyber security you know you

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:55.170
think about cyber security you know you
 

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.720
think about cyber security you know you
approach that from a number of different

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:56.730
approach that from a number of different
 

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.640
approach that from a number of different
ways you have multiple layers of Defense

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:58.650
ways you have multiple layers of Defense

ways you have multiple layers of Defense
for people trying to penetrate you you

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.050
for people trying to penetrate you you
 

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.810
for people trying to penetrate you you
kind of design your system like you

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:02.820
kind of design your system like you
 

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.760
kind of design your system like you
compartmentalize it like a ship right if

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:04.770
compartmentalize it like a ship right if
 

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.230
compartmentalize it like a ship right if
you have a rupture on the ship you close

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240
you have a rupture on the ship you close
 

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.090
you have a rupture on the ship you close
doors inside it you isolate it so that

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:08.100
doors inside it you isolate it so that
 

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.040
doors inside it you isolate it so that
the ship doesn't go down we look at how

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:10.050
the ship doesn't go down we look at how
 

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.840
the ship doesn't go down we look at how
do we isolate and compartmentalize

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:11.850
do we isolate and compartmentalize
 

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.030
do we isolate and compartmentalize
different systems within the company

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040
different systems within the company
 

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.980
different systems within the company
itself and then on top of that we need

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:15.990
itself and then on top of that we need
 

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.660
itself and then on top of that we need
to start thinking about from a cyber

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:17.670
to start thinking about from a cyber
 

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.000
to start thinking about from a cyber
perspective as we look at smart cities I

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.010
perspective as we look at smart cities I
 

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:23.780
perspective as we look at smart cities I
think that has to be approached by the

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:23.790
think that has to be approached by the
 

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.270
think that has to be approached by the
specific technology their specific

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280
specific technology their specific
 

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.859
specific technology their specific
desires we need to do with that

00:43:27.859 --> 00:43:27.869
desires we need to do with that
 

00:43:27.869 --> 00:43:30.050
desires we need to do with that
technology in the field for example you

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060
technology in the field for example you
 

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.280
technology in the field for example you
know when we take a look at deploying

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:31.290
know when we take a look at deploying
 

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.260
know when we take a look at deploying
all these sensors out there if that data

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:33.270
all these sensors out there if that data
 

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.520
all these sensors out there if that data
is coming in and we want to give people

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:34.530
is coming in and we want to give people
 

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.380
is coming in and we want to give people
access to it but they can't control or

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:36.390
access to it but they can't control or
 

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.270
access to it but they can't control or
do anything with it that's one layer of

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280
do anything with it that's one layer of
 

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.130
do anything with it that's one layer of
security that you'll put around it if

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140
security that you'll put around it if
 

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.750
security that you'll put around it if
you have control of it where you can

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760
you have control of it where you can
 

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.280
you have control of it where you can
actually go out there and take that data

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:43.290
actually go out there and take that data
 

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.290
actually go out there and take that data
look at where traffic flows are now go

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300
look at where traffic flows are now go
 

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.210
look at where traffic flows are now go
out and start switching traffic lights

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220
out and start switching traffic lights
 

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.770
out and start switching traffic lights
and changing the sequence of it

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780
and changing the sequence of it
 

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.240
and changing the sequence of it
that's a different level of control and

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.250
that's a different level of control and
 

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.280
that's a different level of control and
protection that has to go around that so

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:52.290
protection that has to go around that so
 

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:54.260
protection that has to go around that so
I think it's you know as you look at it

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:54.270
I think it's you know as you look at it
 

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:55.880
I think it's you know as you look at it
you want to try to compartmentalize it

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:55.890
you want to try to compartmentalize it
 

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.950
you want to try to compartmentalize it
and then apply the appropriate level of

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960
and then apply the appropriate level of
 

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.849
and then apply the appropriate level of
risk mitigation in each of those

00:43:59.849 --> 00:43:59.859
risk mitigation in each of those
 

00:43:59.859 --> 00:44:02.609
risk mitigation in each of those

military and talk about micro grids and
energy independence and what that means

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:19.900
energy independence and what that means
 

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.049
energy independence and what that means
and how their technology may be able to

00:45:22.049 --> 00:45:22.059
and how their technology may be able to
 

00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:24.599
and how their technology may be able to
fit into that so what we've done you

00:45:24.599 --> 00:45:24.609
fit into that so what we've done you
 

00:45:24.609 --> 00:45:26.880
fit into that so what we've done you
know we like pilot programs and pilot

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:26.890
know we like pilot programs and pilot
 

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.609
know we like pilot programs and pilot
projects in San Diego as well but you

00:45:29.609 --> 00:45:29.619
projects in San Diego as well but you
 

00:45:29.619 --> 00:45:30.989
projects in San Diego as well but you
know going back to this kind of notion

00:45:30.989 --> 00:45:30.999
know going back to this kind of notion
 

00:45:30.999 --> 00:45:33.239
know going back to this kind of notion
of collaboration when early-stage

00:45:33.239 --> 00:45:33.249
of collaboration when early-stage
 

00:45:33.249 --> 00:45:35.370
of collaboration when early-stage
companies can sit in a room and kind of

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:35.380
companies can sit in a room and kind of
 

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.460
companies can sit in a room and kind of
a neutral space with the utility with

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:38.470
a neutral space with the utility with
 

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.470
a neutral space with the utility with
the universities and others to talk

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480
the universities and others to talk
 

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.329
the universities and others to talk
about their technology and kind of the

00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:42.339
about their technology and kind of the
 

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.069
about their technology and kind of the
real-world application of that

00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079
real-world application of that
 

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:46.079
real-world application of that
technology there's significant benefit

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:46.089
technology there's significant benefit
 

00:45:46.089 --> 00:45:48.960
technology there's significant benefit
in that and so I think these these types

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:48.970
in that and so I think these these types
 

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.880
in that and so I think these these types
of conversations not just happening here

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:50.890
of conversations not just happening here
 

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:52.829
of conversations not just happening here
on a stage but in a room with kind of

00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839
on a stage but in a room with kind of
 

00:45:52.839 --> 00:45:54.559
on a stage but in a room with kind of
the next round of innovators is

the next round of innovators is
 

00:45:54.569 --> 00:45:57.569
the next round of innovators is
increasingly important and we're using

00:45:57.569 --> 00:45:57.579
increasingly important and we're using
 

00:45:57.579 --> 00:45:59.609
increasingly important and we're using
those that ability to facilitate those

00:45:59.609 --> 00:45:59.619
those that ability to facilitate those
 

00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:00.900
those that ability to facilitate those
conversations and help in these

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:00.910
conversations and help in these
 

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.239
conversations and help in these
technology companies develop a

00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:03.249
technology companies develop a
 

00:46:03.249 --> 00:46:05.430
technology companies develop a
technology that actually has a market

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440
technology that actually has a market
 

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.650
technology that actually has a market
and that market being around cyber

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:07.660

yeah it's like maybe I agree

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:13.270
yeah it's like maybe I agree
 

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.370
yeah it's like maybe I agree
all these comments but a slightly

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:14.380
all these comments but a slightly
 

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.850
all these comments but a slightly
different take which is that we feel

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:17.860
different take which is that we feel
 

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.340
different take which is that we feel
that we're on the issue security and

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:20.350
that we're on the issue security and
 

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:22.980
that we're on the issue security and
privacy actually better off supporting

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:22.990
privacy actually better off supporting
 

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:27.510
privacy actually better off supporting
industry standards and and not trying to

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520
industry standards and and not trying to
 

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.670
industry standards and and not trying to
go it alone you know so you know we're

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680
go it alone you know so you know we're
 

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.700
go it alone you know so you know we're
working with best minds and standards

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:32.710
working with best minds and standards
 

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.890
working with best minds and standards
bodies in order to establish a common

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:34.900
bodies in order to establish a common
 

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.660
bodies in order to establish a common
set of standards and ask our partners

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:36.670
set of standards and ask our partners
 

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.500
set of standards and ask our partners
and startups to conform to a series of

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:39.510
and startups to conform to a series of
 

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.610
and startups to conform to a series of
privacy and cyber security and

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:41.620
privacy and cyber security and
 

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.320
privacy and cyber security and
communications and other standards we

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:43.330
communications and other standards we
 

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:46.050
communications and other standards we
need to make innovation easy and

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:46.060
need to make innovation easy and
 

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.360
need to make innovation easy and
predictable in order to really stimulate

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:48.370
predictable in order to really stimulate
 

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.130
predictable in order to really stimulate
it and so there when we talk about

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:50.140
it and so there when we talk about
 

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.770
it and so there when we talk about
platforms the rules have to be published

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:52.780
platforms the rules have to be published
 

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.340
platforms the rules have to be published
and then you have to have third parties

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:56.350
and then you have to have third parties
 

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.680
and then you have to have third parties
that can verify that the rules are being

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:58.690
that can verify that the rules are being
 

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.330
that can verify that the rules are being
enforced and so we have a number of

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:00.340
enforced and so we have a number of
 

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.550
enforced and so we have a number of

based on what Anne said this morning you

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:18.650
based on what Anne said this morning you
 

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.650
based on what Anne said this morning you
know it's certainly not the the utility

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:20.660
know it's certainly not the the utility
 

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.320
know it's certainly not the the utility
of the past the the skill set needs to

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:23.330
of the past the the skill set needs to
 

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.390
of the past the the skill set needs to
be entirely different and so the fact

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.400
be entirely different and so the fact
 

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.770
be entirely different and so the fact
that we're strong in robotics and AI

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:26.780
that we're strong in robotics and AI
 

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.320

makes me think about some of the

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:14.180
makes me think about some of the
 

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.150
makes me think about some of the
challenges that we've seen in the city

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160
challenges that we've seen in the city
 

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.770
challenges that we've seen in the city
is that we can get the pilots up and

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:17.780
is that we can get the pilots up and
 

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.750
is that we can get the pilots up and
running the challenge we have is going

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760
running the challenge we have is going
 

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.820
running the challenge we have is going
to scale so what are some things that

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:21.830
to scale so what are some things that
 

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.920

you would kind of land in a conversation

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:23.930
you would kind of land in a conversation
 

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:25.750
you would kind of land in a conversation
maybe in you know a quick minute or so

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760
maybe in you know a quick minute or so
 

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.910
maybe in you know a quick minute or so
in terms of how do you get the scale how

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920
in terms of how do you get the scale how
 

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.370
in terms of how do you get the scale how
do we go beyond just the pilots so I

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:30.380
do we go beyond just the pilots so I
 

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.200
do we go beyond just the pilots so I
would say from the city of San Diego

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:32.210
would say from the city of San Diego
 

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.970

project that started as a pilot we're in

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640
project that started as a pilot we're in
 

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.450
project that started as a pilot we're in
year 3 now and it's a full-scale project

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:43.460
year 3 now and it's a full-scale project
 

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.130
year 3 now and it's a full-scale project
I think the value of it's about 43

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:45.140
I think the value of it's about 43
 

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.950
I think the value of it's about 43
million so it started as a pilot and it

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960
million so it started as a pilot and it
 

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.510
million so it started as a pilot and it
actually became something real I don't

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520
actually became something real I don't
 

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.010
actually became something real I don't
know that that necessarily happens all

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.020
know that that necessarily happens all
 

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.950
know that that necessarily happens all
the time but I think what got it to

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960
the time but I think what got it to
 

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.690
the time but I think what got it to
where it was to where it is today is

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:55.700
where it was to where it is today is
 

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.330
where it was to where it is today is

mind when you say energy it's not just
 

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.260

a combined heat and power system you can
 

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.089
a combined heat and power system you can
think of district energy systems you can

01:06:51.089 --> 01:06:51.099
think of district energy systems you can
 

01:06:51.099 --> 01:06:53.849
think of district energy systems you can
then layer that on with PV potentially

01:06:53.849 --> 01:06:53.859
then layer that on with PV potentially
 

01:06:53.859 --> 01:06:56.370
then layer that on with PV potentially
so the technology options start

01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:56.380
so the technology options start
 

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.799
so the technology options start
broadening as you start thinking of

01:06:58.799 --> 01:06:58.809
broadening as you start thinking of
 

01:06:58.809 --> 01:07:00.539
broadening as you start thinking of
energy not just as electrical energy but

01:07:00.539 --> 01:07:00.549
energy not just as electrical energy but
 

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:03.240
energy not just as electrical energy but
it's electrical energy and thermal

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:03.250
it's electrical energy and thermal
 

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:06.120
it's electrical energy and thermal
energy and so then what happens is you

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.130
energy and so then what happens is you
 

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:08.670
energy and so then what happens is you

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760
where where that has worked really well
 

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.910
where where that has worked really well
with CNI customers but if you look at UK

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920
with CNI customers but if you look at UK
 

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.819
with CNI customers but if you look at UK
or any other market that has

01:19:11.819 --> 01:19:11.829
or any other market that has
 

01:19:11.829 --> 01:19:14.260

electricity prices you that is that is a

01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239
electricity prices you that is that is a
 

01:19:17.239 --> 01:19:19.720

really quick return on investment and it

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:19.730
really quick return on investment and it
 

01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:21.590
really quick return on investment and it
will be even quicker as the

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600
will be even quicker as the
 

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.500
will be even quicker as the

is dropping when it comes to a lot of
 

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.620
is dropping when it comes to a lot of
the projects that were involved in they

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:27.630
the projects that were involved in they
 

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.170
the projects that were involved in they
are all hybrid projects there are very

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:30.180
are all hybrid projects there are very
 

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.670
are all hybrid projects there are very
few cases where you know there's

01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:31.680
few cases where you know there's
 

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.470
few cases where you know there's
standalone storage application for a

tax credit advantage but really it's

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:38.310
tax credit advantage but really it's
 

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:41.000
tax credit advantage but really it's
about what does it do right and I think

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.010
about what does it do right and I think
 

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.620
about what does it do right and I think
that for a long time the community

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:42.630
that for a long time the community
 

01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:45.650
that for a long time the community
talked about revenue stacking so

01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:45.660
talked about revenue stacking so
 

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:47.870
talked about revenue stacking so
different ways of utilizing storage and

01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880
different ways of utilizing storage and
 

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.340
different ways of utilizing storage and
electricity market I think we talked

01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:49.350
electricity market I think we talked
 

01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:51.470
electricity market I think we talked
about that less and less partly because

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480
about that less and less partly because
 

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.270
about that less and less partly because
of the modes of using the battery and

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280
of the modes of using the battery and
 

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.220
of the modes of using the battery and
when it needs to be available how to be

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:55.230
when it needs to be available how to be
 

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:58.010
when it needs to be available how to be
managed but also because storage is

01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.020
managed but also because storage is
 

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.050
managed but also because storage is
dropping in price when I think about

01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060
dropping in price when I think about
 

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.810
dropping in price when I think about
solar contracts BPA's and when we had

01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820
solar contracts BPA's and when we had
 

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.910
solar contracts BPA's and when we had
you know inverter reserves years ago

01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920
you know inverter reserves years ago
 

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.650
you know inverter reserves years ago
because inverters were very very

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:06.660
because inverters were very very
 

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.260
because inverters were very very
expensive you know it's not an issue

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:09.270
expensive you know it's not an issue
 

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:11.270
expensive you know it's not an issue
anymore you can replace it very cheaply

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280
anymore you can replace it very cheaply
 

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.190
anymore you can replace it very cheaply
we'll be able to do the same thing with

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:13.200
we'll be able to do the same thing with
 

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.280
we'll be able to do the same thing with
batteries now those who are selling to

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:16.290
batteries now those who are selling to
 

01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:19.340
batteries now those who are selling to
the end-users of batteries what is their

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:19.350
the end-users of batteries what is their
 

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:21.770
the end-users of batteries what is their
business model going to be right of

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780
business model going to be right of
 

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.350
business model going to be right of
course you can sell the batteries the

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360
course you can sell the batteries the
 

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.610
course you can sell the batteries the
question of course is how do you make

01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.620
question of course is how do you make
 

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.370
question of course is how do you make
money I think it's not a secret that

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380
money I think it's not a secret that
 

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.500
money I think it's not a secret that
those who have very large pipeline of

those who have very large pipeline of
projects are very competitive in the

projects are very competitive in the
 

01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:37.430
projects are very competitive in the
market so the Tesla's and AES is of the

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440
market so the Tesla's and AES is of the
 

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.170

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:44.150
world or influence it now just the sheer
that the sheer control of the supply

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:44.160
that the sheer control of the supply
 

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.950
that the sheer control of the supply
chain is something that really matters

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960
chain is something that really matters
 

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.960
chain is something that really matters
but that's really only one side of it

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:47.970
but that's really only one side of it
 

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:50.870
but that's really only one side of it
the other side of it is also how do we

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880
the other side of it is also how do we
 

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.450
the other side of it is also how do we
package and how do we then control these

01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460
package and how do we then control these
 

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.910
package and how do we then control these
systems and so the theme that emerges

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920
systems and so the theme that emerges
 

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.830
systems and so the theme that emerges
and that is not has been less of an

01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840
and that is not has been less of an
 

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.480
and that is not has been less of an
issue in large-scale projects but I

01:20:59.480 --> 01:20:59.490
issue in large-scale projects but I
 

01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:01.190
issue in large-scale projects but I
think in smaller scale projects is going

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:01.200
think in smaller scale projects is going
 

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.350
think in smaller scale projects is going
to be this overhead beyond the battery

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360
to be this overhead beyond the battery
 

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.030
to be this overhead beyond the battery
price it's only one third of the system

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040
price it's only one third of the system
 

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.160
price it's only one third of the system
costs right so if you follow the debate

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:07.170
costs right so if you follow the debate
 

01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:09.950
costs right so if you follow the debate

solar for a long time you know the soft

01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640
solar for a long time you know the soft
 

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.210
solar for a long time you know the soft
costs of implementing solar there's

01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:14.220
costs of implementing solar there's
 

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.800
costs of implementing solar there's
going to be a whole lot of that and so

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:15.810
going to be a whole lot of that and so
 

01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.980
going to be a whole lot of that and so
what are the advantages and what are the

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:18.990
what are the advantages and what are the
 

01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:20.480
what are the advantages and what are the
solutions that can help you become more

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:20.490
solutions that can help you become more

solutions that can help you become more
competitive in smaller scale storage I

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560
competitive in smaller scale storage I
 

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.260
competitive in smaller scale storage I
think are very endemic to the customer

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:24.270
think are very endemic to the customer

talk about that for a week I'm really
really a long time but here's an example

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:31.290
really a long time but here's an example
 

01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:33.920
really a long time but here's an example
of something where Siemens brought a

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:33.930
of something where Siemens brought a
 

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:37.760
of something where Siemens brought a
very unique advantage to fluence and and

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:37.770
very unique advantage to fluence and and
 

01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:40.750
very unique advantage to fluence and and
because a es was not dealing with

very fast startup of the batteries and
 

01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:51.620
very fast startup of the batteries and
so we're talking about few milliseconds

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:51.630
so we're talking about few milliseconds
 

01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:54.110
so we're talking about few milliseconds
that can really differentiate you know

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120
that can really differentiate you know
 

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.030
that can really differentiate you know

technology has been dear risks at this
 

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.460
technology has been dear risks at this
point and is also becoming cheaper more

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:07.470
point and is also becoming cheaper more
 

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:09.290

commonplace the financing is a lot
 

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.500
commonplace the financing is a lot
easier so we're going to see third-party

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:12.510
easier so we're going to see third-party
 

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:16.790
easier so we're going to see third-party
