00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.280
it's and that's the same as it's the
same thing it's the same thing as the

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:43.290
same thing it's the same thing as the
 

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.380
same thing it's the same thing as the
battle between the gods across centuries

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:45.390
battle between the gods across centuries
 

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.440
battle between the gods across centuries
or eons and the emergence of the highest

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:48.450
or eons and the emergence of the highest
 

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.350
or eons and the emergence of the highest
possible moral virtue as a consequence

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360
possible moral virtue as a consequence
 

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.250
possible moral virtue as a consequence
of that competition it's the eye on the

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260
of that competition it's the eye on the
 

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.100
of that competition it's the eye on the
top of the pyramid right it's you know

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:58.110
top of the pyramid right it's you know
 

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.990
top of the pyramid right it's you know
in the Washington Monument there's a cap

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000
in the Washington Monument there's a cap
 

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.540
in the Washington Monument there's a cap
on the Washington Monument the Potala

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:02.550
on the Washington Monument the Potala
 

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.340
on the Washington Monument the Potala
the Washington Monument is a pyramid at

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.350
the Washington Monument is a pyramid at
 

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.960
the Washington Monument is a pyramid at
the top of the pyramid is a cap it's

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:05.970
the top of the pyramid is a cap it's
 

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.450
the top of the pyramid is a cap it's
made out of aluminum and the reason it's

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:08.460
made out of aluminum and the reason it's
 

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.770
made out of aluminum and the reason it's
made out of aluminum is because when

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:09.780
made out of aluminum is because when
 

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.330
made out of aluminum is because when
they made the Washington Monument it was

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:11.340
they made the Washington Monument it was
 

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.850
they made the Washington Monument it was
the most valuable metal known and so

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860
the most valuable metal known and so
 

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.560
the most valuable metal known and so
what does it mean it means there's a

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:15.570
what does it mean it means there's a
 

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.480
what does it mean it means there's a
pyramid and there's something at the top

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:17.490
pyramid and there's something at the top
 

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.070
pyramid and there's something at the top
of it but the thing that's are taught at

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.080
of it but the thing that's are taught at
 

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.170
of it but the thing that's are taught at
the top of the pyramid isn't the same as

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180
the top of the pyramid isn't the same as
 

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.690
the top of the pyramid isn't the same as
the left of the pyramid that's the same

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700
the left of the pyramid that's the same
 

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.120
the left of the pyramid that's the same
the pyramid exists there's a dominance

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.130
the pyramid exists there's a dominance
 

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.860
the pyramid exists there's a dominance
hierarchy something climbs up to the top

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:27.870
hierarchy something climbs up to the top
 

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.050
hierarchy something climbs up to the top
but it's not just at the top of one

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060
but it's not just at the top of one
 

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.690
but it's not just at the top of one
pyramid it's at the top of all of them

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700
pyramid it's at the top of all of them
 

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.880
pyramid it's at the top of all of them
the thing that rises to the top of any

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:34.890
the thing that rises to the top of any
 

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.830
the thing that rises to the top of any
given pyramid is the same thing that can

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:36.840
given pyramid is the same thing that can
 

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.460
given pyramid is the same thing that can
dominate all pyramids it isn't good

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:40.470
dominate all pyramids it isn't good
 

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.070
dominate all pyramids it isn't good
enough to be the best at a dominance

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:43.080
enough to be the best at a dominance
 

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.410
enough to be the best at a dominance
hierarchy what you want to be is the

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420
hierarchy what you want to be is the
 

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.000
hierarchy what you want to be is the
best at the set of all possible

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.010
best at the set of all possible
 

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.810
best at the set of all possible
dominance hierarchies right and that's

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820
dominance hierarchies right and that's
 

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.700
dominance hierarchies right and that's
the thing that's gold at the top of the

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:52.710
the thing that's gold at the top of the
 

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.800
the thing that's gold at the top of the
pyramid and that's the eye that's what

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:54.810
pyramid and that's the eye that's what
 

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.180
pyramid and that's the eye that's what
the Egyptians figured out and what does

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:56.190
the Egyptians figured out and what does
 

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.510
the Egyptians figured out and what does
that mean it means the thing that puts

00:12:59.510 --> 00:12:59.520
that mean it means the thing that puts
 

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.090
that mean it means the thing that puts
you at the top is attention pay

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100
you at the top is attention pay
 

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.320
you at the top is attention pay
attention

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:03.330
attention
 

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.360
attention
keep your eyes open it's not the same as

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.370
keep your eyes open it's not the same as
 

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.140
keep your eyes open it's not the same as
thinking it's not the same thing

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.150
thinking it's not the same thing
 

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.910
thinking it's not the same thing
it's like watching and the thing about

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920
it's like watching and the thing about
 

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.080
it's like watching and the thing about
human beings is we can see we can see

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.090
human beings is we can see we can see
 

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.110
human beings is we can see we can see
better than any other creature except

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120
better than any other creature except
 

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.610
better than any other creature except
birds of prey

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620
birds of prey
 

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.250
birds of prey
and so our capacity to see is in fact

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260
and so our capacity to see is in fact
 

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.560
and so our capacity to see is in fact
what we use in the world our brains are

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:24.570
what we use in the world our brains are
 

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.450
what we use in the world our brains are
actually organized around vision unlike

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:26.460
actually organized around vision unlike
 

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.010
actually organized around vision unlike
most animals their brains are organized

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:28.020
most animals their brains are organized
 

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.490
most animals their brains are organized
around smell not us we can see we stand

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500
around smell not us we can see we stand
 

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.990
around smell not us we can see we stand
upright so we can see a long distance

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000
upright so we can see a long distance
 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.660
upright so we can see a long distance
and in our ability to see is what saves

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:35.670
and in our ability to see is what saves
 

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.490
and in our ability to see is what saves
us and what saves our communities and

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500
us and what saves our communities and
 

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.760
us and what saves our communities and
that's what these stories are trying to

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:39.770
that's what these stories are trying to
 

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.400
that's what these stories are trying to
portray you might say well why didn't

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:43.410
portray you might say well why didn't
 

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.440
portray you might say well why didn't
people just say so and the answer to

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:45.450
people just say so and the answer to
 

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.130
people just say so and the answer to
that is because they didn't know it took

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:49.140
that is because they didn't know it took
 

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.590
that is because they didn't know it took
a long time to figure it out forever

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600
a long time to figure it out forever
 

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.810
a long time to figure it out forever
it's taken forever to figure it out it's

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820
it's taken forever to figure it out it's
 

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.110
it's taken forever to figure it out it's
it's part of what I hoped when I wrote

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120
it's part of what I hoped when I wrote
 

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.360
it's part of what I hoped when I wrote
this book and and part of the reason

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:02.370
this book and and part of the reason
 

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.490
this book and and part of the reason
that I'm teaching it is because it seems

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500
that I'm teaching it is because it seems
 

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.690
that I'm teaching it is because it seems
to me that it would be useful for

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700
to me that it would be useful for
 

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.760
to me that it would be useful for
everyone to actually understand this

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:07.770
everyone to actually understand this
 

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.220
everyone to actually understand this
instead of just having it told as a

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.230
instead of just having it told as a
 

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.620
instead of just having it told as a
story it's like that's great man yes you

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:12.630
story it's like that's great man yes you
 

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.990
story it's like that's great man yes you
need the story but why not also just

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000
need the story but why not also just
 

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.800
need the story but why not also just
understand it so well so that's what

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:21.810
understand it so well so that's what
 

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.300
understand it so well so that's what
we're trying to do we're trying to

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:23.310
we're trying to do we're trying to
 

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.340
we're trying to do we're trying to
understand this so that's good enough

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.350
understand this so that's good enough
 

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.950
understand this so that's good enough
for today
