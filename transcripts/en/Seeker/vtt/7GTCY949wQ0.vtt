00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.620
You may be living under the assumption that
if your sexual partner is deceased, they will

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.810
no longer be in a position to increase their
biological fitness.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.900
After all, one cannot continue to be sexually
active once one is dead.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.220
Right?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.120
Many frog species exhibit something called
explosive breeding.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.500
This entails a short breeding season wherein
there is intense male:male competition for

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.550
female mates.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.940
Often, many males will attempt to court the
same female, since the ladies are only sexually

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.289
available for a short window of time.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.929
Adult frogs are terrestrial, but they have
sex and lay eggs in the water, so the tadpoles

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.489
are free to swim until they’re ready to
return to land.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.910
The unfortunate part for many females is that
when vastly outnumbered by a crazy mob of

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.850
sex-crazed males they are easily crushed or
drowned.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.019
Males are so intent of depositing their sperm
that in many cases they neglect to realize

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.600
they are killing their partner in the process.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.170
This loss of life during explosive breeding
is an unfortunate reality for females of the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.259
Amazonian frog Rhinellla probosciea.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.280
Because of this, males have evolved a ‘functional
necrophilia’ strategy, whereby they promote

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.479
extraction of the eggs from the abdomens of
dead females and then fertilize them in a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.680
post-mortem fashion.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.469
Males will sit on top of a dead females’
back, and rhythmically gyrate her body in

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.070
order to encourage extrusion of her eggs.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.549
Once the eggs are out, he can then fertilize
them with no requirement for the female to

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.900
be anything but the dead cadaver that she
is.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.990
This strategy may sound appalling, but - when
push to shove- it does function to increase

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.840
the reproductive success of both the males
and females engaging in it.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.289
Sure, such intense competition over a short
space of time can certainly lead to extreme

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.950
measures, but it may actually be their ONLY
chance at passing on their genetic blueprints.
