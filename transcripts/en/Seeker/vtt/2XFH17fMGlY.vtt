What do you do if you're bit by a snake?!

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:08.010
Stay tuned to find out.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.009
Hey there venomous viewers, Jules here for
DNews!

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.169
Being bitten by a snake is no laughing matter.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.460
Neither is being stung by a swarm of bees,
attacked by black widows and scorpions, stabbed

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.050
by a stingray, or envenomated by a blue-ringed-octopus.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.980
All of these animals are considered “venomous”,
which means that they carry a toxin that can

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.200
be injected to produce a harmful response
in another animal.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.661
Now, it’s important to note that although
some venomous animals can be deadly, like

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:36.320
the Box Jellyfish, a huge number of venomous
animals pose little to no risk to humans.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.149
For example, although all 2,000ish species
of scorpion carry venom, only about 30 or

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.089
40 of them have venom strong enough to kill
a person.

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.149
And your risk goes down even further if you
have access to the right antivenom, which

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.680
is sometimes known by its original terminology
of “antivenin.”

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.460
Thanks to the prevalence of antivenom, you
are nine times more likely to die from being

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.030
struck by lightning than to die from a snakebite
in the United States.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.440
But that’s not true everywhere in the world,
and that’s a big problem.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.410
In Africa, one popular antivenom, which was
used to treat ten types of snakebites in the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.780
Sub-Saharan region, ran out in June 2016 because
the existing stock expired, and the company

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.950
making it couldn’t continue producing it.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.970
That’s largely because making antivenom
is an expensive and complicated process.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.920
So, how is it done?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.780
Venoms come in different forms and functions,
with different types of toxins, which is why

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.100
there’s not yet a “universal antivenom.”

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.560
So let’s take a look at the deathstalker
scorpion as an example of how venoms work.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.200
One of the toxins in this venom is a protein
called “chlorotoxin”.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.450
This acts on cells in your body by blocking
the molecular channels on the surface of the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.450
cell.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.410
In muscle cells, this forces them to tense
up, leading to paralysis, and a whole host

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.990
of other negative effects that can lead to
death.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.140
But antivenom is full of antibodies, which
bind to these toxins, changing their shape,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
and preventing them from blocking those channels..

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.020
The problem is, for many venoms, humans don’t
produce the right antibodies on our own.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.450
Instead, we rely on horses, goats, sheep,
donkeys, rabbits, cats, chickens, camels,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.200
and even sharks to produce them for us.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.860
We picked these animals because they have
immune systems that create the right antibodies

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.240
for the toxins.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.710
So to make antivenom, we inject one of these
animals with a diluted form of the venom and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.870
an adjuvant, which is something that helps
create a stronger immune response.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.590
And just like with a vaccine, their immune
system responds, producing antibodies.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.420
The animal’s blood is then extracted and
the antibodies are separated out and used

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.570
to treat humans.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.900
It sounds simple, but it requires a lot of
complicated steps.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.750
Getting snake venom requires you to actually
milk the snakes, and it takes many, many,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.170
many milkings — in some cases, tens of thousands
— to produce even just 1 pint of venom.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.920
And after all this work, taking the antivenom
doesn’t give you life-long immunity.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.770
Instead, it’s a form of “passive immunity”,
which means the antibodies aren’t coming

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.520
from your own immune system and you’ll need
more antivenom if you get another bite or

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520
sting.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.990
The good news is that researchers are developing
venoms that work on multiple types of species.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.600
In a 2016 study published in PLOS Neglected
Tropical Diseases, researchers created a new

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.490
antivenom by taking 12 venom samples, nine
of which were filtered to contain only the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.319
most toxic proteins, and combining them in
a solution together.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.290
This was injected into a horse, and the resulting
antibodies ended up neutralizing the bites

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.220
of 18 Asian and African snakes.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.210
Venom is nasty business, but luckily, if you’ve
got antivenom handy, in particular, the right

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.180
kind of antivenom, then chances are you’ll
probably survive.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.080
That is, unless you’re attacked by a blue-ring
octopus; there’s no antivenom for those,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.870
so be especially careful when swimming in
Australia and the eastern Indo-Pacific.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.930
Good luck out there.
