00:00:01.403 --> 00:00:03.786
[What skills do you think
are most important

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.706
for people to have for jobs
available 10 years from now?]

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.824
I think social skills include flexibility

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:12.170
and the ability to work
with a diverse group of people.

00:00:12.194 --> 00:00:13.631
I think that's very important.

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:15.754
And I think communication skills --

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:19.099
learning to clearly communicate
where you are in your progress,

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:20.759
what your roadblocks are,

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:22.528
and understanding that that's okay.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.070
"I'm having an issue, I need this help."

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:27.447
People need better communication skills,

00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:29.448
because I think teams are more agile,

00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:32.814
and when people come together,
you just have to learn to communicate.

00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:35.666
I think communication
is a very important skill.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.793
I think computer skills
are going to be something

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:40.575
people expect you to have.

00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:43.282
Imagine going to work and you're like,

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:45.202
"Gee, you know, I can't type.

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:46.493
I can't use a keyboard."

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.128
Well, of course
you have to use a keyboard!

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:51.723
So, the ability to learn
computer languages,

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:54.175
to have some basic programming skills.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.774
Even the designers in our group,
they program in Arduino.

00:00:57.798 --> 00:01:01.028
The social scientists are programming
these visualization packages.

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:04.391
I think computer literacy,
programming literacy,

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:07.146
is going to be extremely important.
