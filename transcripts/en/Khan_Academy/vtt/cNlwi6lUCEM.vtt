00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.920
So we have the question, Devon
is going to make 3 shelves for

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.900
her father.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.440
She has a piece of lumber
that is 12 feet long.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.710
She wants the top shelf to be
half a foot shorter than the

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.510
middle shelf.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.150
So let me do this in
different colors.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.280
She wants the top shelf to be
half a foot shorter than the

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.150
middle shelf.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.870
So I'll just-- let's just read
the whole thing first. And the

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.020
bottom shelf to be half a foot
shorter than twice the length

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.120
of the top shelf.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.370
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.040
I'll do that in blue.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.690
The bottom shelf to be half a
foot shorter than twice the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.300
length of the top shelf.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.340
How long will each shelf
be if she uses the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.440
entire 12 feet of wood?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.020
So let's define some variables
for our different shelves,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.000
because that's what we
have to figure out.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.200
We have the top shelf,
the middle shelf,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.530
and the bottom shelf.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.489
So let's say that t is equal to
length of top shelf-- t for

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.150
top-- of top shelf.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:16.485
Let's make m equal the length
of the middle shelf.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.560
m for middle.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.120
And then let's make b equal to
the length of the bottom

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.070
shelf-- b for bottom--
bottom shelf.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.520
So let's see what these
different statements tell us.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.920
So this first statement, she
says she wants the top shelf--

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.450
and I'll do it in that same
color-- she wants the top

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.120
shelf to be 1/2 a foot shorter
than the middle shelf.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.650
So she wants the length of the
top shelf to be-- so this is

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.780
equal to 1/2 a foot shorter
than the middle shelf.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.590
So, if we're doing everything in
feet, it's going to be the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.640
length of the middle
shelf in feet minus

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.010
1/2, minus 1/2 feet.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.060
So that's what that sentence
in orange is telling us.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.760
The top shelf needs to be 1/2 a
foot shorter than the length

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.120
of the middle shelf.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.270
Now, what does the next
statement tell us?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.630
And the bottom shelf to be-- so
the bottom shelf needs to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.300
be equal to 1/2 a foot shorter
than-- so it's 1/2 a foot

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.830
shorter than twice the length
of the top shelf.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.420
So it's 1/2 a foot shorter
than twice the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.680
length of the top shelf.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.620
These are the two statements
interpreted in

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.820
equal equation form.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.910
The top shelf's length has to be
equal to the middle shelf's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.060
length minus 1/2.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.800
It's 1/2 foot shorter than
the middle shelf.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.750
And the bottom shelf needs to
be 1/2 a foot shorter than

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.010
twice the length of
the top shelf.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.360
And so how do we solve this?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.100
Well, you can't just solve
it just with these two

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.050
constraints, but they gave
us more information.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.040
They tell us how long will each
shelf be if she uses the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.480
entire 12 feet of wood?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.920
So the length of all of
the shelves have to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.880
add up to 12 feet.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.850
She's using all of it.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.380
So t plus m, plus b needs
to be equal to 12 feet.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.920
That's the length
of each of them.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.940
She's using all 12
feet of the wood.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.680
So the lengths have
to add to 12.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.450
So what can we do here?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.610
Well, we can get everything here
in terms of one variable,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.100
maybe we'll do it in terms of
m, and then substitute.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.590
So we already have
t in terms of m.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.960
We could, everywhere we see
a t, we could substitute

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.220
with m minus 1/2.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.470
But here we have b
in terms of t.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.460
So how can we put this
in terms of m?

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.190
Well, we know that t is
equal to m minus 1/2.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.720
So let's take, everywhere we see
a t, let's substitute it

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.820
with this thing right here.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.770
That is what t is equal to.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.100
So we can rewrite this blue
equation as, the length of the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.150
bottom shelf is 2 times the
length of the top shelf, t,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.460
but we know that t is equal
to m minus 1/2.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.860
And if we wanted to simplify
that a little bit, this would

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.990
be that the bottom shelf is
equal to-- let's distribute

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.930
the 2-- 2 times m is 2m.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.670
2 times negative 1/2
is negative 1.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.100
And then minus another 1/2.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.710
Or, we could rewrite this as b
is equal to 2 times the middle

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.390
shelf minus 3/2.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.740
Right?

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.870
1/2 is 2/2 minus another
1/2 is negative

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.800
3/2, just like that.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.140
So now we have everything in
terms of m, and we can

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.260
substitute back here.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.020
So the top shelf-- instead of
putting a t there, we could

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.070
put m minus 1/2.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.810
So we put m minus 1/2, plus
the length of the middle

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.670
shelf, plus the length
of the bottom shelf.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.860
Well, we already put
that in terms of m.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.310
That's what we just did.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.250
This is the length of the bottom
shelf in terms of m.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.340
So instead of writing b there,
we could write 2m minus 3/2.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.460
Plus 2m minus 3/2, and
that is equal to 12.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.530
All we did is substitute
for t.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.110
We wrote t in terms of m, and
we wrote b in terms of m.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.590
Now let's combine the m terms
and the constant terms. So if

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.730
we have, we have one m here, we
have another m there, and

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.760
then we have a 2m there.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.550
They're all positive.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.530
So 1 plus 1, plus 2 is 4m.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.380
So we have 4m.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.490
And then what do our constant
terms tell us?

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.590
We have a negative 1/2, and then
we have a negative 3/2.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.270
So negative 1/2 minus 3/2,
that is negative 4/2 or

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.290
negative 2.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.670
So we have 4m minus 2.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.500
And, of course, we still
have that equals 12.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.446
Now, we want to isolate just the
m variable on one side of

00:06:09.446 --> 00:06:09.825
the equation.

00:06:09.825 --> 00:06:12.810
So let's add 2 to both sides
to get rid of this 2 on the

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.430
left-hand side.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.850
So if we add 2 to both sides
of this equation, the

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.000
left-hand side, we're just
left with 4m-- these guys

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.330
cancel out-- is equal to 14.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.570
Now, divide both sides by 4, we
get m is equal to 14 over

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.940
4, or we could call that 7/2
feet, because we're doing

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.730
everything in feet.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.800
So we solved for m, but
now we still have to

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.050
solve for t and b.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.720
So let's do that.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.230
Let's solve for t.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.420
t is equal to m minus 1/2.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.040
So it's equal to-- our m is 7/2
minus 1/2, which is equal

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.410
to 6/2, or 3 feet.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.840
Everything is in feet,
so that's how we

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.900
know it's feet there.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.060
So that's the top
shelf is 3 feet.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.930
The middle shelf is 7/2 feet,
which is the same thing as 3

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.930
and 1/2 feet.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.480
And then the bottom shelf
is 2 times the top

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.075
shelf, minus 1/2.

00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:21.480
So what's that going
to be equal to?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.090
That's going to be equal to 2
times 3 feet-- that's what the

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.430
length of the top shelf is--
minus 1/2, which is equal to 6

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.130
minus 1/2, or 5 and 1/2 feet.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.960
And we're done.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.310
And you can verify that these
definitely do add up to 12.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.480
5 and 1/2 plus 3 and 1/2 is 9,
plus 3 is 12 feet, and it

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.440
meets all of the other
constraints.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.850
The top shelf is 1/2 a foot
shorter than the middle shelf,

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.060
and the bottom shelf is 1/2
a foot shorter than 2

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.410
times the top shelf.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.470
And we are done.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.470
We know the lengths of
the shelves that

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.460
Devon needs to make.
