00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.840
Overcoming bad inner voices

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.820
We don't often think about it, and may never discuss it with others at all, but pretty much everyone has voices in their heads.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.060
A murmuring stream of thoughts that run along inside our minds most of the time.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.600
Sometimes, the inner voice is encouraging, calling for you to run those final few yards, "You're nearly there, keep going! Keep going!"

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.260
Or urging you to calm down because you know it will all be okay in the end.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.380
But sometimes...

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.660
...the inner voice is simply not very nice at all.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.460
It is defeatist and punitive, panic-ridden and humiliating.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.480
It doesn't represent anything like our best insights or most mature capacities.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.740
It's not the voice of our better nature.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.240
We find ourselves saying, "You disgust me," "Things always go to shit with you," or "You useless little idiot."

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.500
Where do inner voices come from?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.800
An inner voice always used to be an outer voice.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:27.040
We absorb the tone of others: a harassed or angry parent, the menacing threats of an elder sibling keen to put us down, the words of a schoolyard bully, or a teacher who seemed impossible to please.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.760
We internalized the unhelpful voices, because at certain key moments in the past they sounded compelling.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.280
The authority figures repeated their messages over and over, until they got lodged in our own way of thinking.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.100
Part of achieving happiness and maturity involves altering our inner voices

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:00.160
which means encountering equally convincing and confident, but also helpful and constructive varieties of voices over long periods

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.520
and taking care to internalize them.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.240
They might be the voices of a friend, a therapist or an author.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:21.440
We need to hear them often enough and around tricky enough issues that they come to feel normal and natural responses, so that eventually,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.540
They come to feel like things we are saying to ourselves.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.520
They become our own thoughts.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.820
The best sort of inner voice speaks to us in a gentle, kind and unhurried way.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.980
It should feel as if a sympathetic arm were being put around our shoulder

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.680
by someone who had lived long and seen a great many sad things, but wasn't embittered or panicked by them.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.900
In certain states of humiliation around work, in many of us, there is a mocking and contemptuous voice inside one's head.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:06.560
It suggests that love, respect, and kindness only ever come via worldly success and competence.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:21.080
Our failure: not being able to make a public speech, taking time to learn to drive a car, not being especially brilliant at sales, rightly debars us from love and appreciation.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.340
We need to incorporate a voice that separates out achievement from love,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:41.100
that reminds us that we may be worthy of affection, even if we fail, and that being a winner is only one part, and not necessarily the most important part, of one's identity.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.680
This is, traditionally, the voice of the mother,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:55.540
but it might also be the voice of a lover, a poet we like, or a nine year old child chatting to his or her mom or dad about stress at the office.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.660
It is the voice of a person who loves you for being you, outside of achievement.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.960
Many of us grew up around nervous people: people who lost their tempers the moment the parking ticket couldn't be found,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.860
and who were knocked off course by relatively minor administrative hurdles, like the electricity bill.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:27.980
These people had no faith in themselves, and therefore, without necessarily wanting to do us harm, couldn't have much faith in our abilities either.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.460
Every time we faced an exam, they got more alarmed than we did.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.420
They always asked multiple times if we had enough to wear when we went outside, they worried about our friends and our teachers.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.240
They were sure the holiday was going to turn into a disaster.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.660
Now, these voices have become our own,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.980
and cloud our capacity to take an accurate measurement of what we are capable of.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.220
We have internalized voices of irrational fear and fragility.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.900
At such moments, we need an alternative voice that can pause our runaway fears

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.940
and remind us of the strength we have latent within us, which the currents of panic have hidden from us.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.640
Our heads are large, cavernous spaces.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.660
They contain the voices of all the people we have ever known.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.260
We should learn to mute the unhelpful ones, and focus on the voices we really need to guide us through the thickets of life.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.420
We humbly offer this voice, as one of the more helpful ones we might take on board.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.560
[Outro video, left side] From a young age, we're taught it's a terrible thing.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.640
So when we feel it, as we all do, we are inclined not to examine it, we just feel---

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.280

---Regional Italian. Whatever that means.
