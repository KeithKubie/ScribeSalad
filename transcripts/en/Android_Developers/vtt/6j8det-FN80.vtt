00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Good afternoon everyone and
welcome to the Friday App Clinic.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.870
This week, after enduring Ian's constant switches
to himself on producer cam, we've decided

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.760
to make life a little easier and just have
him on the show so welcome to the App Clinic,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760
Ian.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Thank you very much.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.650
I'm also joining just cause I, this week's
topic is podcast players and I am inveterate

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.300
podcast listener, I really enjoy podcasts.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.920
Although I've also, because of the, let's
just say the characteristics of the apps we're

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.109
looking at this week and how I feel about
them.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:46.739
I've also brought my friend Big Pete and any
time I get so frustrated that I just wanna

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.819
drive my phone through my head because the
podcast player UI is so bad, I'll be taking

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:53.819
a drink.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So expect Ian to be pretty drunk
by the end of today's episode.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.820
That is a spoiler alert.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.959
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, like Ian said, we're looking
at podcast apps today.

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.829
We've got a wide variety of apps to choose
from.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.149
I think we have something like 8 or 9 apps
that we're nominated in the moderator queue

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.149
this week.

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.149
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, there were far more than
that

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.149
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's just that we had to draw

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.360
the line somewhere.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think we passed out somewhere
around the 8 or 9 mark.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.060
So that's as far as we're gonna try and go

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.060
&gt;&gt;Daniel: 12

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: 12?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.170
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I've got 12 but you guys can do
as many as you like.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Great.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.329
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I don't think we're gonna get
through 12.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We made Daniel make title
cards for 12.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.230
[Laughter]

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's right.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Thanks, Daniel.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.100
[Inaudible]

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.210
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We've also got, so we've got
Daniel who's doing the engineering for us

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.390
today, we've got App Clinic veteran, Fred
Chung, who's gonna be helping us out as our

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.390
producer.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.749
So if you have any questions, comments, anything
that you wanna pass on to us during the show

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:49.600
please let us know in the comment stream for
the G Plus event and Fred will pass those

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600
along to us.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.770
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, let's switch to the
producer cam, shall we?

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.770
Fred cam!

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.770
&gt;&gt;Fred Chung: Fred cam coming up!

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.770
[Cheering]

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.770
&gt;&gt;Fred Chung: Fred cam!

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.770
Fred cam!

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.770
[Laughter]

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.389
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent and you've even got
the shocked and surprised producer on camera

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:05.389
look down.

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:06.389
[Laughter]

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:07.389
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Excellent.

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:10.690
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Perfect so let's, Ian, we've
got somewhere up to 12 apps to look at today

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.860
so let's kick off.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.860
Let's get started.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, so just to get started
here let's talk about what a podcast player

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.950
should do.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.909
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What do we use podcast players
for?

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I mean, really, I like to think
of podcast players as basically being music

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.230
players except instead of music it's all spoken
word.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.510
My idea of kind of the perfect version of
the media, of the music player is something

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.140
which is gonna let you listen to both your
own music and the radio, switching between

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.140
them.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.140
&gt;&gt;Ian NI-Lewis: Right.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.890
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I don't think that media player
quite exists yet, so that's another wish list

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.670
for you guys, but for podcasts that should
be possible, right?

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it should.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.019
Now let me just add something because I wanna
take this up one level.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.050
Let's not talk about just the features, let's
talk about how we use it and, for me, it's

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.050
in the car.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.050
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Indeed, indeed.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.190
I think that's probably the most common used
place for podcast players.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.300
It's going to be people that are commuting
whether it's in your car or in the train and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.950
we're in California, here, so I've had to
get used to driving to work again.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think, for me, anytime that
I have the ability to sit down and read something,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.250
I would much rather read.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.110
So the only time I want a podcast is when
I have to keep my eyes on something else,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.110
like the road.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.819
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The road, yeah, it's generally
considered helpful.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.310
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: With that in mind, I've noticed
that a great many of podcast players just

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.870
don't actually work very well in the car.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.620
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's an interesting point.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.930
I mean, let's take it up another level and
say, well, what is the perfect podcast app?

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.790
What is it that you'd really like to see which
would cause you not to drink because frankly,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.110
if podcast apps make you drink and you like
to use podcast players while you're driving,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.349
this is not a good message.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.940
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Believe me; the California
Department of Transportation has actually

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.010
been very clear with me on that point.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.010
[Laughter]

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'm not surprised, absolutely.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So why don't we take a look
at that list?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.099
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Please, yeah, can you put that
list up for us Daniel?

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:15.030
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Notice that angry baby wants
very much for podcast players to fit into

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.620
these particular, what would you call them?

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.620
Recommendations?

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.870
Best practices for, or it's a wish list, right?

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.800
It's a developer wish list for podcast apps.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.600
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.470
We put angry baby up there because that's
kind of how I felt after looking at 12 of

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.470
these this morning.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There are some good ones.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.350
&gt;&gt;Ian NI-Lewis: There actually are

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.350
&gt;&gt;Ian NI-Lewis: There are some good ones.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.500
I don't think we found a perfect one.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No, but I think if you took
all the best things from each of these you'd

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.330
have a pretty kick ass app.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.350
So I think that's where we'll, hopefully,
get to by the end of this is to encourage

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.590
each of the developers here to build apps
which make all of them awesome.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I noticed that part of what
makes a great podcast is just what makes a

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.390
great synchronized app in general.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.980
Anything, anytime that you're bringing information
from the internet to the user's device that

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.710
should be as transparent as possible.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.280
You know, Reto had a great talk at Google
IO about making apps magical and making it

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.080
feel like you're always connected to this
wonderful well of information at very high

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.790
speeds even though we know that over the past,
Google connection isn't always a hundred percent

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.420
reliable or speedy.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:29.260
So, the first thing that a podcast player
needs to do is make sure that it has good

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.220
synchronizations, something that's transparent

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.220
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: in the background, something
that the user doesn't have to worry about

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.850
or fuss with.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.290
And I think that some of these podcast apps
did a reasonably good job of that, others

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.370
maybe not so much.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.871
Why don't we take a look at some of the first
ones here?

00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:48.871
We'll say, for instance, DoggCatcher.

00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:49.871
You wanna switch over to that?

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:54.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, let's have a look at DoggCatcher.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.690
DoggCatcher's a really popular one so I've
asked people a few times cause we actually

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.730
have a podcast of Android developer live office
hours which we put out there and we actually

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.060
put all of the Google IO sessions as podcasts
as well.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.740
So I asked people, you know, what are the
podcast apps that you recommend?

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.720
And DoggCatcher was actually amongst the very
top, so this is an app that a lot of people

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720
like.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.390
Can we get the tablet on screen as well then?

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.390
Perfect.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:29.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, DoggCatcher starts out
with a quick set of configuration options

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:37.440
and I'm fine with this, okay, fine I wanna
keep a couple episodes of each podcast, alright,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.660
I guess I better accept the EULA, hopefully
it doesn't commit me to anything too terrible.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.650
Then it shows feeds playing audio video news.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.310
So I somewhat like that.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.310
Okay, I've got some feeds.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That seems reasonable, you've
got a nice tablet UI via tablet, I'm liking

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.510
that.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let me click on something
and then play it.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.810
Well, now that's interesting.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.370
It just told me no episode is loaded, playlist
is empty.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.490
Well, obviously I just clicked on this, right?

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now I do like one thing about
DoggCatcher is, what's the most obvious set

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.580
of controls on this?

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.820
What is the thing that catches your eye more
than anything else?

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I would like to say that it's
the play, fast forward, etcetera buttons on

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.510
the bottom.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I agree with you completely.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.810
Would it surprise you to know that many podcast
apps

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.710
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Do not make that easy to access?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.810
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, having just looked at
12, no it wouldn't surprise me.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.010
It may surprise some of you.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.770
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: One of the things that you
should probably think about when you design

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.910
a user interface is what will your users spend
the most time doing?

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:46.430
And if your application is listening to podcasts,
you might think that listening might be one

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:52.510
of the things that you wanna have front and
center but some of these apps don't have transport

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.490
buttons readily accessible, some of them are
too small, some of them move all over the

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.490
screen.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I found at least one where
it was hidden away in a context menu.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.930
[Laughter]

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: A context menu to be able to
play, interesting.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yeah.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very interesting.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.520
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's the thing with context
menu is we've got a bunch on here.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.310
I don't know, what do these do?

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.310
Let's find, oh,

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.310
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh wow.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.310
What doesn't it do?

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There's a lot of context there.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:22.690
Now, I guess the question I have here is if
I have expressed some interest in a podcast

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:30.220
and even a point of, maybe, wanting to play
that, why isn't it downloading that podcast

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.220
right now?

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.220
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.220
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Why would I have to ask it
to download?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.220
&gt;Reto Meier: Indeed.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.700
I mean, it's kind of a key feature here with,
uh, there's two things that Ian's mentioned

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.539
which I really, I think is a theme across
a lot of these, and one is, this UI is really

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.539
busy.

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:49.819
There is a huge amount of information to try
and consume here, to understand what you're

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:50.819
supposed to do next.

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:54.879
So it takes you a really long time to go from
clicking the app launcher to being able to

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:57.890
use the app for the purpose which it was specifically
designed.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.949
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now let's talk about, on that,

00:08:59.949 --> 00:09:00.949
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Please

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:05.459
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: on that note, let's talk about
my very least favorite part of this UI.

00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:08.240
It's a button you see all the time and it
needs to die.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.540
But before we talk about this button let me
take a drink.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.730
[Laughter]

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:22.269
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ian's mic is causing us problems,
alright.

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.439
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alrighty then.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.439
[Pause]

00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:27.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Depending on how bad it is then
maybe people at were forced to drink.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.550
So hopefully this is a little better.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: How's this?

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.949
&gt;&gt;Fred Chung: Just go.

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:31.949
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright

00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:33.649
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You'll let us know.

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:35.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, Fred's on a time delay,
right?

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.860
[Laughter]

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.879
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: 15 seconds, he'll tell you whether
or not you're annoying

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:43.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes, well, let's just get,
you can tell, by the way, that I'm usually

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:46.300
a lot more lubricated when we do the game
show because

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.019
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: as time goes by I stumble

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:50.589
over my words less and less.

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:52.250
It's the power of alcohol.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.699
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Can you guess what button

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:56.860
I'm talking about, Reto?

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Uh, well, gosh.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.060
If I had to choose a button it would be this
button here.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's a bad button.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That is a bad button.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.839
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That is a bad button but you
don't see that in everything.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:07.839
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Even less favorite button.

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:13.110
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I have a button that needs
to die a thousand horrible deaths.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.199
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Actually, I would say maybe

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.980
15 thousand cause I bet that's how many apps
use this button.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.589
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's a lot of apps.

00:10:19.589 --> 00:10:24.610
Oh, gosh, I mean, for a podcast app I kind
of wanna see this button here die.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Bingo!

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.430
Thank you very much, Reto, that is the correct
answer.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.810
I'll be getting you your prize later.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:37.269
Why, in God's name, would you have a synchronize
button when you have the ability to stay in

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:39.230
sync all the time?

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.430
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.300
Don't ask me to refresh, just refresh.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.300
Be fresh.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.459
These days there's really no, there's, I think,
no reason why you would ever want a refresh

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:50.459
button.

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:52.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Certainly not front and center
like that.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.620
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No, absolutely.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.910
There was a time when I could see it as something
maybe in the overflow menu to force a refresh

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.899
but these days with things like the Google
Cloud Messaging, you can do those real time

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:03.899
pings.

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:07.310
You can have a server which is checking these
feeds and pinging your users directly when

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.640
they have new content.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.620
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's, in my mind, this button
is a fix me cause I screwed up button.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:21.939
For some reason things didn't synchronize
correctly or for some reason I want to override

00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:22.939
my sync setting.

00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:26.920
So, for instance, one really useful feature
that a lot of these apps have is the ability

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.680
to not synchronize until you get on Wi-Fi
or until your device is plugged in.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.639
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So you let it sync overnight
or while it's sitting on your desk at work

00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:39.910
or whatever and it doesn't eat up your bandwidth
while you're driving your car.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.560
I love that, that's great.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And if I need to override
that that's fine but this isn't one of those

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:47.279
times.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:51.959
We're on Wi-Fi, this tablet is plugged in,
well, I guess it's not plugged in maybe that's

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:52.959
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's possible.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Maybe I'm being too hard.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But still.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, I'm not being too hard.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.650
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So you wanna be able to, you

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.269
know, I mean, we're gonna press this button
and it is going to start synchronizing things.

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:05.459
There we go, updating feeds.

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:06.459
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Updating feeds.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:10.089
It's a lot of use of toast in this app as
well to tell me what's going on.

00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:16.199
I have to tell you, I think of toasts as it's
the log.D statement of UI.

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:20.829
It's, I'm building an app, I wanna make sure
my service isn't running and running, I wanna

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:24.399
make sure that my errors are visible when
I'm testing the app.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.410
Users should never see this.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a print app.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.894
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a print app, exactly right.

00:12:28.894 --> 00:12:30.399
It's debugging when you don't have a debugger
attached.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.309
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now the other thing that I
think is interesting is there is a download

00:12:33.309 --> 00:12:37.279
manager here and I don't, I think that's a
good thing.

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:39.339
I always like to know what's going on.

00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:42.660
But notice that I can't get to it until I'm
synchronizing.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.970
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah, it's disabled.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:44.970
I see, yeah.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.709
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So now I can go here and I
see, alright, there's a download queue.

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:56.649
What's interesting here is, you know, I've
got something that says, okay this is downloading

00:12:56.649 --> 00:13:00.459
and these will download soon, I can cancel
it.

00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:02.040
What happens if I click here?

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.730
What sort of context menu might it pop up?

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.730
Apparently nothing.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nothing, interesting.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.399
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In fact, it turns out that
this button, which to me says, there's more

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:16.290
stuff, you might wanna click this because
there's stuff you could see.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.520
Well, in the previous menu there was like
400 hundred things you could do when you click

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520
on it.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.820
I'm thinking to myself, oh my God, why don't
I click that?

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.690
I should probably click that button because
I am missing something.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.439
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Please, just click it.

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.209
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What'd it do?

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:30.830
Okay, no there you go.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.830
That's interesting because

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:32.830
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Interesting.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: if I clicked it in the right
way it would bring me this.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Uh huh.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.339
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But if I just click the

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.610
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right next to, it's canceled

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It will cancel.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is a really interesting
point.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.240
Could you show the audience the size of your
finger?

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.119
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Put it next to a Galaxy Nexus

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:52.240
for some scale.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:59.399
Ian has big fingers and that's the reason
why we have 48 pixel touch targets.

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:02.050
Because when you try and get that thumb onto
that touch target

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I actually have like Adrien
Brody hands

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.290
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I don't think these are big

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.290
fingers.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.279
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, they're not over-sized
fingers, you know, and that's the key.

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.680
You've got man hands and you should be proud
of that.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.620
The point is you can't hit those touch targets
and when you have a destructive action within

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:22.100
touch range within another touch target and
your touch targets aren't big enough, you're

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.170
gonna get exactly the situation that Ian's
been facing where it's been canceling downloads

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.200
instead of getting context.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So good

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In fact, that was the first
time I've seen a context menu out of 10 downloads

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.850
that I was canceling.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.850
[Laughter]

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.850
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly right.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I did not even realize it
was there.

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:45.459
Um, now what I do like is now that I'm in
this I can start playing things, um, and if

00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:49.999
I don't like what I'm playing I can skip it.

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:51.439
And this is kind of cool feature.

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:52.439
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Interesting.

00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:55.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It will only respond to long
presses and that to me is a car feature

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now I worried a little bit
because what I really wanna do is plug this

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.290
into the Bluetooth audio in my car so that
I can use my steering wheel controls.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.290
That makes sense.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.889
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I don't think it's elitist
to say that anymore.

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:10.889
Reto Meier: Not these days.

00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:13.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: My mom's Hyundai has those
steering wheel controls

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.029
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:16.550
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sure.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:25.559
So, I'm gonna go ahead and long press it and
then it will, well what will it do?

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:27.990
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It did nothing.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.990
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: it's unclear.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.990
Yeah, very little.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The reason, I think the reason
it did nothing is because nothing is downloaded.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah, of course.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.759
You've only got the first thing you're playing
which has been downloaded, nothing else has.

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:41.339
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, so I can play this.

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:47.339
But this is actually one of the things that
really bothers me is if you look at how this

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:48.679
is set up.

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:51.420
This is a feed management app, front and center.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.300
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think you'd like to manage
your feeds.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.120
Now, the truth is I don't wanna manage my
feeds.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:08.180
It reminds me of going to a music app and
having the first thing it shows you be a store

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.069
or a metadata editor or something like that.

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:13.420
A lot of music apps do that for various reasons.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's true.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.059
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: but I hate it cause 9 times
out of 10 what I really wanna do when I enter

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:20.610
one of these apps is play the content.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.869
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Listen to some content, absolutely.

00:16:21.869 --> 00:16:26.209
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It seems like playing the
content should be the absolute most important

00:16:26.209 --> 00:16:32.660
thing and if you don't have content to play
the first thing you should be doing is figuring

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.970
out why there's no content to play and fixing
that.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.290
I think this is the key, I mean, for most
of your use cases here what you wanna do is

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.970
open the app, hit play and get on with whatever
you were doing, driving your car presumably.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.029
And I have to say it's the same thing when
I get in the car first thing in the morning

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:53.020
or when I'm on my way home and I listen to
music, I just wanna open the music app, hit

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.319
play and be done with it.

00:16:54.319 --> 00:16:57.879
At the very most what you wanna do is maybe
choose the style of what you wanna listen

00:16:57.879 --> 00:16:58.879
to.

00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:04.500
A playlist or a theme and it's the same here,
for these sorts of podcasts apps it's exactly

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.339
the same use case.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.620
It's a case of I wanna listen to a particular
thing or I wanna listen to a particular theme

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.970
and if I hit skip because I'm bored, I want
it to play something.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.730
I don't wanna then have to go through that
management of the streams again.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The idea that the first thing
I wanna do is look at how my streams are doing

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:28.910
is an immediate clue to me that this app can't
manage its own stuff.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.620
When I open, now I was a DoggCatcher user
for awhile and the reason that I finally left

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:39.800
it is because every time I got in my car in
the evening I would start driving, I would

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.420
open my phone and I'd realize that I have
to pull over to the side of the road

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.850
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And manage stuff.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.450
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, right.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It was a horrible experience.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.130
What I really wanna be able to do is get directly
to the content and here's another point, not

00:17:55.130 --> 00:18:01.210
only am I stuck managing the feeds as my central
thing but look at the other categories.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.080
We've got playing and then we've got, that
makes sense,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.620
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure, shortcut to get to what
you're currently listening to.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sure, although I'm not even
certain that that's what we're currently listening

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.910
to but we can't actually play it cause of
the man.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.960
[Inaudible chatter in background]

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No audio.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.120
Got audio back, excellent.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wow, that was quick.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.980
How did that happen?

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nicely solved.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.120
Thanks, Fred.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Did you fix it by unmuting
your headset?

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.870
Okay, I'm just asking.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.980
&gt;&gt;Fred Chung: [Inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.140
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:41.300
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, so the other things
we can look at here is we've got audio podcast,

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.920
okay, that's somewhat useful.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.160
I mean, there's definitely a difference between
audio and video like you wouldn't want to

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.550
what we're doing right now in the car.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No, that's not gonna be particularly
useful.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Because

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.930
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: All the references to stuff
happening on the screen, what's the benefit?

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And you would not get the
benefit of our faces which are so, so pretty.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.810
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So there are pluses and minuses
is what we're saying.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then we've got news.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.190
Now that's an interesting choice, right?

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Wow, as a top level tab destination.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.650
That's interesting.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:13.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now let's compare this with
something that is more, let's say, entertainment

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.440
oriented, so Google Music, for instance.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:24.660
Now I'm not gonna say that Google Music is
the best UI ever but what, um, what Google

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.490
Music does is very, very common, right?

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.520
All, now, see what we were talking about.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520
Yes.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.550
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You don't wanna add account.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, I don't.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Select.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ah.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Theoretically.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So we could talk for hours
about Google Music

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.240
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: but what I really wanted to

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:51.960
show is how Google Music has a feature that
every music app that I've used, actually,

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:58.360
recently has which is that you can browse
and put things together by albums, artists,

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.100
songs, playlists and genres.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.400
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.620
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And recent and, of course,
there's a now playing feature as well.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It seems to me, and I may be
jumping in on your queue here, but these seem

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.280
like reasonable navigation queues for a podcast
app as well.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.280
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Completely.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.410
I mean, they're so common and so well known.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.830
It's not just Google Music that does this.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.420
My stereo in the car does this.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: My mom's Hyundai does it,
actually.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Your mom's got a pretty sweet
Hyundai.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's amazing, yeah.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.270
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: They've got some good products

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.270
there.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.270
Not that I'd ever drive one.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.270
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Of course.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.270
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know why?

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.330
Because I work for Google and they have appearances.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.090
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: When they bring out like a

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.090
hybrid electric

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: then I'll probably be in.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Probably for that, yeah.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.840
So, let's go back to the DoggCatcher.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: DoggCatcher, yeah.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:50.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The truth is I am happy to
know what my audio stuff is, don't care about

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.670
my video.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: News.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:57.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Great that I've got news but
what I really want is to have a page that

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.620
says news, comedy, sports, science, you know
the genres that I actually listen to.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.570
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think this is a really important
point because I think with podcast apps like

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:14.000
this, podcast players, there's this temptation
I think of a developer to develop for yourself

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.670
which it's a good place to start but if you
wanna have real wide scale appeal then you

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.150
need to think a little bit beyond that.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.820
So think about how someone who doesn't actually
use listens to podcasts, who isn't specifically

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:30.630
looking for a podcast player but they do want
to listen to spoken audio content.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.530
Someone who would be listening to the radio
but they realize the radio is, you know, not

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.530
working for them.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.090
There's only NPR and once they've listened
to all of those, what's next?

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:43.620
So if you approach this the same way, you
have genres, you have albums, playlists, all

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.020
these things then it's something they can
be much more familiar with and you can say,

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.680
oh I wanna listening to some political commentary
so you go to that and you see all these different

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.720
shows, not feeds or anything like that but
shows which have the kind of content that

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.720
you wanna listen to.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.970
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right and I want to sometimes
in the morning, um, I really want to listen

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.920
to news no matter where it's coming from.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:10.560
I get like 5 minutes of the BBC in the morning
and then I get my CNN, whatever, I also wanna

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.230
be able to skip, you know?

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:18.460
Maybe the BBC's talking about Sub-Saharan
Africa today and not interesting to me so

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.440
I'm gonna skip over to whatever.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.450
In the evening, get in my car and I wanna
listen to comedy, I wanna listen to the Smartest

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.560
Man in the World or Radio 4 Comedy of the
week.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.560
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, I wanna be able to pick
that genre and skip around inside of it without

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:41.710
having to skip over all of the other genres
that I have on the phone.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely, yeah.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's, I think that that's
one thing that all of these podcast players

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.730
are lacking to a certain extent.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, help with the discovery
cause I think that's a lot of what the solution

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.460
is that I've been seeing is apps which help
you manage your existing collection of podcasts.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.790
So you already know what you want, you already
got them subscribed in Google Reader or something

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:05.210
similar to that and that's why you have this
management becomes a really big portion of

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.170
it cause it's all about managing feeds you
already have.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.360
You can create something much more powerful
by having, aiding that discovery.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.990
It's like, well I know that I want to, you
know, comedy in the evening so give me a bunch

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.820
of comedy content, make that easy for me.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think that somebody who
actually does that pretty well Stitcher which

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.330
I don't see on here so we might not have picked
it up.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.410
Um, there, there entire deal is about discovery.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.250
They also do streaming.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.540
So you don't have to worry about downloads
at all.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And management is easy, too.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.540
They have an almost Pandora like interface
for discovery.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:44.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The only problem with Stitcher
is once you've got something set up it's very,

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.710
very confusing on how to change it.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.590
I think they use like a star, favorites type
of thing

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.590
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right, right.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But then you have to star
something and then do some extra stuff and

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.590
you gotta check some boxes.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.980
So I would, we won't bring up Stitcher right
now because we don't have it installed, it

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:04.530
wasn't one of the top apps that we were looking
at on the moderator but I wanted to call it

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.650
out as something that does discovery a little
better.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:08.650
Now,

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:09.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I wanna

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.010
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: one of the things that isn't
quite as good at discovery is

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.010
&gt;&gt;Fred Chung: Hey, guys, sorry.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.010
Reto show me your mic.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.010
You can leave it on

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:20.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You want me to leave it on the
test?

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.020
Sure.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You forgot the most important
rule.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I did.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.800
Magic rule, leave your mic where you can see
it.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.810
&gt;&gt;Fred Chung: [Inaudible]

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:33.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think we're, we're done with
DoggCatcher and we're gonna move on now.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.990
So yes, we are aware that we have spent a
fair amount of time.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We have spent a long time
talking about podcast apps in general.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes, exactly.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If we were just gonna like
gong ourselves after five minutes then the

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:54.160
audience would have missed the amazing transition,
handoffs, that you and I obviously spend weeks

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160
practicing.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Clearly, clearly well rehearsed.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So let's take a look at, help
me out here.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.260
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Vulzenschlager.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.630
No, that's not quite right I missed an N.
Volksempfanger.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.630
Yes.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:06.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There you go.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.830
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There you go.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:13.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I knew the foreigner would
be able to get that.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.550
So, again, the very first thing you see when
you start up.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There's a lot of white space.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And, yeah.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.480
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And it kind of has the podcast
icon of shame.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.890
Okay and I have no subscriptions.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.080
Let's, you know, let's get a subscription.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.080
Fine, okay, now
[Laughter]

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Here's

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Good luck with that.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: this is a problem.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:40.520
Yeah, I realize I'm shallow and I realize
I'm not a good techie but the truth is there's

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.010
a lot of apps that don't make me type in a
URL

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.430
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You haven't memorized the URLs
for all of your favorite podcasts?

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I have not.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.580
You'd think that I would have.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.580
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ian, come on.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I mean, certainly Android
has a much better cut and paste functionality

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:52.390
than it used to.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.390
[Laughter]

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think you're gonna have to
take a drink.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Just looking at this makes
me need to take a drink.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:05.530
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: While Ian's doing that I will
type in the one podcast that I know.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:12.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If you want, the truth is
I and probably most of the people that have

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.150
looked at this app
[Laughter]

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: have already uninstalled it.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.330
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Already closed it?

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.590
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.140
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright, podcast.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.350
Now you can see from this, this is actually
a pretty easy to remember URL.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sure.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But it's taken me more time
to type this in than I really have patience

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520
for.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.320
And if I've misspelled this then it's kind
of game over.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You're pretty much screwed,
yeah.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I put it in.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It still says we have no

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It still says we have no subscriptions.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.430
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I can look through here and
everything is empty.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.430
Now we have the spinning, the spinning progress.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, oh, oh look what's happening.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.560
How exciting.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.570
We have something in there.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.180
I was successfully subscribed to the podcast.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.980
I wouldn't have minded seeing some sort of
progress indication while waiting for that.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.780
You wanna, we've already subscribed, show
us, show us what we subscribed to so that

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.130
if we're going through with fingers of lightening,
typing in all,

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.760
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: If you've memorized your URLs
we'd at least know what we're up to.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.440
We can click through and otherwise it's

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's pretty.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.640
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a nice simple UI.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.930
So this is something I wanted to highlight
for this app, in particular, cause compared

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.280
to some of the other we're gonna look at,
has a very clean UI.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.130
It's very simple, very straight forward, just
showing the information that you need, though,

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.120
arguably, not enough information.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.420
Not this is where it all gets a little bit
weird.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.340
For start, if you keep your eye on this section
of the screen you'll see that there is a checkbox

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.350
which occasionally flashes in or out.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:52.440
I'm not entirely sure why or how to bring
it up consistently but see that, just for

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.980
a fraction of a second?

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, I didn't.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.760
Let's see one more time.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.760
No.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No, not that time.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:05.890
But, again, so we've got this big amount of
white screen and we have a play button but

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.010
it's not that it's hidden but it's not particularly,
it doesn't really jump out.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.530
So if I was gonna try and use this app in
my car, I've got a problem right away.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:19.230
Now I think the, we can't bash them too hard
cause obviously they're thinking, well I've

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.580
got an action I wanna take

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.580
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm gonna put it on the action
bar and this is a good example of when it's

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.460
okay to break the rules.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:34.010
There are actions that you're taking on content
where the content in the screen is the most

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.010
important thing.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:41.220
And those actions are, far and away, best
suited in the action bar.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.270
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.280
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: However, there are some actions
that are either extremely contextual so you

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:53.360
put them next to the content, directly next
to the content or so universal that they really

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.270
don't belong in the action bar because they
are, themselves, the most important thing

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:03.890
and in this case I would argue that the transport
for any app that plays audio, the transport

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.890
is the most important thing.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:05.890
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In fact, it should be on every
screen.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.860
You never want to be in the position where
you can't access the transport because if

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.170
nothing else you might need to pause that
audio.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly and this is a good example.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:20.200
So, again, and this is a theme that I'm gonna
continue to come back to, time and time again,

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.420
which is I want the app to start doing what
I downloaded it for as quickly as possible.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.680
Ideally, as soon as I click the icon, open
the app, you can start doing something, in

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.450
this case, playing me some kind of audio.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:37.830
Here I've had to click, I've had to add a
subscription then navigate into that and then

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.890
navigate into a particular thing and then
hit play before it's actually going to start

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.890
that playback.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.110
At which point it does introduce the controls
along the bottom which is nice.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.190
They are

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Small

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: absolutely tiny.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.190
Yeah.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.280
Which makes me think, I was gonna say it makes
me think this was designed for a phone but

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.820
we have the tab, the tablet layout with fragments
so they're half way there.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.680
And I get the impression, I think; this is
even an alpha release.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.960
So it's early days for them.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But you definitely wanna consider
straight away as Ian just pointed out, these

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:09.340
need to be big buttons, they need to be front
and center, this is the key to what your app

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.680
is doing, so increase their size.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.200
While we're talking about the transport mechanism,
cause I think this is a good point and I wanna

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:22.510
talk a little bit more about that, if we switch
to the camera phone, or the phone camera I

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.030
should say, then we should be able to look
at some of these apps on a phone.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:30.230
And I'm gonna do that because I wanna highlight
a couple of specific things.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:36.050
So if I start playing an app here in DoggCatcher,
there's a few things I'm gonna look for straight

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.050
away.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:41.460
So as soon as I navigate away from that app
I still wanna be able to control that audio

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.460
from anywhere.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.130
So the first thing I'm gonna check is see
whether or not I can control it on the lock

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.130
screen.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, I can which is nice.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.070
We even have the album up which is tidy.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:57.130
I have the ability to pause, play, skip, although
again skip doesn't actually do anything in

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.130
this instance.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's not

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: A little tricky

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It does trick you, it is tricky.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.800
It's like I wanna be able to skip this song,
I'm getting bored and listen to the next,

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.220
uh, the next podcast in that particular album
or skip to a completely different podcast

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.150
if that's the better option.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Makes sense.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, let's, uh, let's unlock
this.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.880
I also wanna be able to do that in notifications.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.690
And, again, this is something that DoggCatcher
has done well.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.390
So I can actually pause directly from the
notification.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.750
Now, you'll note that by doing so, they've
actually removed the notification straight

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.750
away.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, which is a little weird.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.960
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is a little weird.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.660
Now this is kind of tricky, right?

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.470
Because the reason the notification is there
when it's playing is because you need an ongoing

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.830
notification if you have a service running.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.050
When I've paused it that service isn't running
so let's take it away.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:44.050
The thing is, give me a chance here, you know,
maybe I just paused it because I wanna yell

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.550
at someone out the window, you cut me off
and I wanna be able to press play again straight

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.930
away.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.420
You'll note that it's gone from everywhere.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:55.020
So if I go back to the lock screen, again,
there's no way to restart the audio until

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.240
I reopen the app.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240
It's hard.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It wasn't a pause.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.250
It was abort, abort, abort.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.320
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.250
It's a big red button and that's too aggressive.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, this would be great
if they used Jellybean rich notifications

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.850
because then they give you that choice.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.960
I mean, maybe you did just wanna kill the
whole thing

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.960
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: when you clicked on the notification
that didn't have any indication of what it

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:14.900
was going to do at all.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.900
[Laughter]

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.900
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But, if you didn't, in general
we suggest that when you make a notification,

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:26.370
if it doesn't have any other UI, if it doesn't
have a rich UI associated with it, the natural

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.230
thing is when you click on it you should bring
up the activity that's firing the notification

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.230
to begin with.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.230
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.270
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And that should always be
your default.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.490
You shouldn't do anything else, really, unless
you have, like we said, rich notification

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.970
UI on, ala Jellybean.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:43.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's just have a quick look
if DoggCatcher has a widget.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.410
It does.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.570
So this is the last thing and

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:47.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's cool.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:48.570
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: They've done a good job with
that.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:54.500
So they have maintained those transport mechanisms
throughout every part of the UI, the system

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.500
UI.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.250
So that's definitely a thumbs up for DoggCatcher.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.140
Not all of the apps that we looked at do any
of those, let alone all of them.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Next one.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.830
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Should we have a look at another
app?

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.660
Why don't we go ahead and go to BeyondPod
which is another one that gets a lot of good

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.660
recommendations.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:19.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now it turns out that this
is, or has been, one of my go to podcast apps,

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:24.980
although, probably because it's the least
frustrating of all the frustrations I've encountered.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.980
That's high praise.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You're setting that high bar.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:38.620
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, yeah, um, so this is
an interesting UI.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.280
It goes from feed to player.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:52.500
There should also be, let's see, uh, so you've
got a categorized list and it turns out, actually,

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.310
they've, the developers are very responsive.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.770
This is actually a different UI than I used
just last week.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:58.770
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.770
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I actually used this.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:07.240
Um, so they've done categorization in here
which is cool but, again, a little weird and

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.370
difficult to use in the car.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes, absolutely.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Very

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:15.149
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is a good example of where
you wanna have a big, big UI with big, big

00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:18.589
buttons that you can just press which have
pictures which indicate what they are so you

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:22.639
don't need to think or read or navigate or
worry about touching the wrong bit, it's just

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.700
bang, bang, bang.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:29.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now I have to compliment these
guys on doing a much better job than the first

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:37.190
version on BeyondPod that I downloaded where
the initial set of categories was on a view

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:41.711
pager and the second page was the detail of
what a category

00:34:41.711 --> 00:34:42.711
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I see.

00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:46.779
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: and the third page was the
detail of the feed selected and then the fourth

00:34:46.779 --> 00:34:52.269
page was, I think, the now playing and paging
between the view pager did all sorts of really

00:34:52.269 --> 00:34:53.269
wacky things.

00:34:53.269 --> 00:34:56.540
At the very, very, it was a departure from
what you would expect the view pager to do.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, you don't want the view
pager to ever maintain any sort of state apart

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.779
from where you've scrolled to on any particular
list view.

00:35:03.779 --> 00:35:05.299
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yep.

00:35:05.299 --> 00:35:08.200
So let's go ahead and start.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.520
This is one thing that's a little interesting.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.940
They do RSS as well as actual audio

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.559
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: podcast so this is an RSS
feed.

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:18.460
Let's see if we can find one that's actually
an audio, Global News

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's go with the BBC, yeah.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:26.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So this, now, this is interesting.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.440
The, uh, they do streaming which is really,
really nice.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:35.519
But I will say the one thing that's been extremely
frustrating to me about using BeyondPod is

00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:44.569
that we, we try to stream but we don't always
have a connection.

00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:50.730
And BeyondPod, if you don't have a good connection
will download, it will play downloaded stuff

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.430
but it will try to fill at home first.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.430
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:58.069
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So there are cases where I
have completely downloaded a podcast but because

00:35:58.069 --> 00:36:00.140
the player can't make a connection it won't
play.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's very frustrating.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:06.470
It's the same sort of rage inducing anger
that you get when you wanna play a game which

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.539
you've paid the license for, you've played
it before, totally works but because you happen

00:36:10.539 --> 00:36:17.150
to be on an airplane and wanting to play Angry
Birds or Asphalt 7 for a few hours in between

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:21.440
here and Honolulu you can't because you can't
get a Wi-Fi connection.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.749
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:36:22.749 --> 00:36:26.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's also worth pointing out
here, as well, when you're doing a buffering

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:31.369
and streaming in general, it is a good, it
is a good technique but you need to also be

00:36:31.369 --> 00:36:34.450
careful you're doing it the right way to make
sure you're not draining the battery just

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.619
for the sake of having these sorts of downloads.

00:36:36.619 --> 00:36:40.539
So, one of the best practices which Ian was
trying to point out, is that you should have

00:36:40.539 --> 00:36:44.839
enough content for the foreseeable use of
this app.

00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:50.059
So, if you're listening to things like podcasts,
you probably wanna pre buffer the entire episode

00:36:50.059 --> 00:36:53.839
and you may even wanna think about getting
whatever's next on the queue as well.

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:58.029
So they don't just happen to be, there's a
set of lights on Charleston which is in a

00:36:58.029 --> 00:36:59.999
cell tower dead zone.

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:04.079
So if I happen to get to that stop, and it's
a long intersection you're there for a few

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:10.069
minutes, if I get there and a song stops,
you know I run out of song, depending on the

00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:11.130
app I'm using, I'm screwed.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.930
It's sitting there going I'll get to it eventually
and it's not until I'm on the freeway that

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:18.309
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You should have a strategy
for dealing with that.

00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:22.470
Not just buffering up what you think you're
gonna need but maybe falling back into something

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.470
old or whatever

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:28.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now this, what you're seeing
on the screen now is my face, but if you were

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:34.259
seeing the tablet, there you go, the, this
is my other pet peeve.

00:37:34.259 --> 00:37:38.859
And this is not limited to BeyondPod, there's
actually a few other players that do this.

00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:42.589
I tried to skip forward and it said the playlist
was empty.

00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:47.050
Now it's interesting because I got to this
by going to the BBC and choosing the first

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:48.050
episode.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.050
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:54.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If I skip forward after that,
based on your extensive knowledge of

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.640
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: IPods or, you know, Sony Walkman

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.640
or
[Laughter]

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.369
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: music players of any stripe,
what would you expect to happen at that point?

00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:07.529
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'd kind of expect it to play
the next episode.

00:38:07.529 --> 00:38:09.529
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:38:09.529 --> 00:38:11.029
That is also what I expected.

00:38:11.029 --> 00:38:15.920
However, no, it will not play that because
I don't have anything in the playlist.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:23.460
Now the interesting thing is, having been
a BeyondPod customer for about 6 months now,

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:30.200
bought BeyondPod Pro, I have absolutely no
idea how to add anything to the playlist.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.510
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I have no clue.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.510
What?

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.510
[Laughter]

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's how angry he is.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880
[Laughter]

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.500
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: He's ripping the mic off his
lapel angry.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:47.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What's even worse is that,
now they don't say it here so maybe they changed

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:53.210
it, but the version I originally used called
it the smart playlist which implied that it

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.170
had some sort of intelligence and might do
something for me but apparently

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.849
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Does it imply that, Ian

00:38:57.849 --> 00:38:58.849
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes

00:38:58.849 --> 00:39:00.380
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Or does it imply that you need
to be smart to use the playlist.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think what it's saying is
it's just smart enough to know that it doesn't

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.900
need to listen to me.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.900
[Laughter]

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The self-aware playlist.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.431
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It does not serve me

00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:11.500
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'd like to go to the next track.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: As a master.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.789
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'm sorry I can't do that, Ian.

00:39:14.789 --> 00:39:16.809
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:23.420
So, to wrap up a bit, some of the other things
that we looked at include Good News which

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:29.789
has really nice features but suffers from
many of the same feedback problems

00:39:29.789 --> 00:39:30.789
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:39:30.789 --> 00:39:31.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: that we talked about.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.890
In particular, it's possible to get Good News
into a state where you have to just sit there

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:40.089
staring at the screen waiting for it to do
something and it is giving you very little

00:39:40.089 --> 00:39:41.089
idea

00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:42.089
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right.

00:39:42.089 --> 00:39:45.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: of what it's doing.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.550
Especially, this is especially frustrating
because I have, let's say, 25 hundred unread

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:50.550
articles

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:51.550
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.740
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: in my Google Reader account
which Good News, to its credit, links up with

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.450
very, very easily.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:03.329
It will say I've synced a hundred articles,
I can't read those articles, I can't see them,

00:40:03.329 --> 00:40:07.160
all I can see is the thing that says you gotta
wait until all 2,500

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Until all of them are synced
up.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:13.509
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So you might think about whether
or not that's a good user experience.

00:40:13.509 --> 00:40:17.009
Um, Listen Up is promising, a little rough

00:40:17.009 --> 00:40:18.009
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:40:18.009 --> 00:40:19.009
It's definitely early.

00:40:19.009 --> 00:40:21.089
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Podax made no impression on
me whatsoever.

00:40:21.089 --> 00:40:23.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hipstacast has

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.779
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Did that leave an impression?

00:40:26.779 --> 00:40:28.369
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: a terrible icon.

00:40:28.369 --> 00:40:32.890
It looks fine on this screen because it's
against this kind of cloudy background.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:38.190
Put it against anything else, the problem
is it just doesn't have enough contrast so

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.910
it's very, very easy to blend into the background.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:40.910
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:45.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So why don't we finish up
by just taking a look at Pocket Casts which

00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:49.609
for all its sins is probably one of the best
that we've looked at.

00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:51.239
This is probably going to be my go to app.

00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:53.269
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is going to be your go
to podcast app?

00:40:53.269 --> 00:40:55.499
Is it going to be your go to podcast app on
a tablet?

00:40:55.499 --> 00:40:57.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Uh, I have no idea.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.170
I haven't used it on a tablet.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:00.170
Wouldn't use it on a tablet

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.170
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I don't carry that around
in my

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.530
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, I've been contemplating
this because I have a spare Nexus 7, that's

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:11.039
right, your all jealous, and I've been trying
to figure out how I can mount it to the dashboard

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:14.569
of my Prius cause I work for Google so I have
a Prius.

00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:15.569
But all the services

00:41:15.569 --> 00:41:16.569
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And you're insufferable

00:41:16.569 --> 00:41:18.089
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is true.

00:41:18.089 --> 00:41:22.180
I went to the dealership I'm like, I need
a car and then after 10 minutes of talking

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.400
to me they knew exactly what they needed to
give me.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.520
All the surfaces get, all the surfaces inside
are exactly the same as the surfaces on the

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520
outside.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.170
So there's nothing flat.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:37.220
Everything is curved and rounded so there's
nowhere I can stick the device to actually,

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.650
to mount it in my car.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:43.549
So, I don't know but that would be an instance
of if you have a car with slightly squarer

00:41:43.549 --> 00:41:48.380
edges, I have the impression that many American
cars have quite straight edges inside the

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.380
car.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh no, that's a myth.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.560
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Is that a myth?

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Perpetuated by certain political

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:53.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Europeans?

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:54.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: establishments

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:55.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: oh, I see.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:56.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Everything in America is straight.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.609
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well if the man won't let me
have, you know straight surfaces in the car

00:41:59.609 --> 00:42:02.890
then I guess it's a non issue but I always
thought that would be quite useful.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, this is something that
we never like to see.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:07.900
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hi there
[Laughter]

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's like in the Hitchhiker's
Guide where it says, "Hi, I'm gonna press

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:14.019
this button, oh what'd it do?

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:16.420
A flag went up saying; please do not press
this button again."

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.420
[Laughter]

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: All this is saying is, "Yeah,
by the way, don't press that button."

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.579
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: "Not yet anyway.

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:24.579
Press a different button.

00:42:24.579 --> 00:42:25.609
Try something else."

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:29.579
Uh, I think this is a programmer thing, right,
because compilers would be like, "Oh yeah,

00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:31.289
did you mean to put a semicolon there?"

00:42:31.289 --> 00:42:32.289
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:42:32.289 --> 00:42:35.749
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: and what do new programmers
always say, "Well, it knows that I needed

00:42:35.749 --> 00:42:36.749
a semicolon."

00:42:36.749 --> 00:42:37.749
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Why did it just put it there?

00:42:37.749 --> 00:42:38.749
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Why did it put the semicolon
there?

00:42:38.749 --> 00:42:39.749
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You mean to tell me it's not
there?

00:42:39.749 --> 00:42:44.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, you should be more
magical than C Plus Plus, that's all I'm saying.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:50.059
So if we wanted to have a podcast I guess
we, we click on the library icon and this

00:42:50.059 --> 00:42:54.670
is the really frustrating thing is once I
click on the library icon, absolutely nothing

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.670
happens.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.779
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's pretty much a, it's a
pretty black screen there.

00:42:56.779 --> 00:43:01.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: basically Mr. headphone icon
is full of, I'm taking a drink.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.980
[Laughter]

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: he's taking a drink.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.359
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think what we actually have
to do is do a search.

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:08.359
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh.

00:43:08.359 --> 00:43:09.359
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And this is nice.

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:13.210
We've got the popular podcasts, that's good,
a browser category, I mean, the discoverability

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.210
here is much, much better

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.210
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: yeah, this is more like it.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: than most.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.210
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now, Roman Nurik would go
ballistic at this point.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.499
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, I think he's gone so angry
that he's fallen off the hangout.

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:25.029
That's, that's, out of his chair and off the
internet.

00:43:25.029 --> 00:43:27.039
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yep, now, we're out of time.

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:28.039
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's true.

00:43:28.039 --> 00:43:29.839
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But we're gonna keep going
anyway.

00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:30.839
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's right.

00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:32.039
So many people were interrupting.

00:43:32.039 --> 00:43:33.039
It's you.

00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:34.039
[Laughter]

00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:39.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The reason that Roman Nurik
would be mad about this, just drinkin' mad,

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: which doesn't take much cause
he's Russian but

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:42.630
[Laughter]

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.079
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ukrainian I think.

00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:47.650
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You made a mistake there.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:48.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Huge faux pas

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:50.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I am so sorry.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:51.650
Alright,

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.790
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'm not gonna point out who
he's apologizing to here.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.940
It could be the Russians, it could be Ukrainians,
it could be Roman, it could be anyone, frankly.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's really just Roman.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.390
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: and everyone else.

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:00.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Everyone else.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:01.390
[Laughs]

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I am so sorry.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Roman and everyone else.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.390
[Laughs]

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well no, I'm apologizing to
everyone except the person who put this God

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.741
awful gradient background
[Laughter]

00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:10.741
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: on this list page.

00:44:10.741 --> 00:44:14.920
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This actually reminds me of
a demo, do you remember the demo scene from

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:21.739
like, I guess it was the late 90's where you
had like a 64K demo where you had like awesome

00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:26.210
graphic stuff done within 64K and one of the
cool things you could do was these gradients

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:27.920
and they would shift and change and move.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.410
We're not in the 90s anymore.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's quite true.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.950
No, if we were, he would be Milli and I would
be Vanilli and we're not.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.960
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, and you can only be thankful
for that.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.792
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The other thing that we object
to, that Roman objects to, I don't know how

00:44:39.792 --> 00:44:40.792
I feel about this.

00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:41.792
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This isn't us, this is just
Roman.

00:44:41.792 --> 00:44:44.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Is these, these little right
arrows.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.269
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, the right carets yeah I'm
not a fan of those at all.

00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:49.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, nobody is.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:53.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, and particularly when they
get stretched in this way, that's not cool.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh that's a beautiful, beautiful
thing.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.730
Well, let's not be too harsh.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.079
Let's just choose something, the Sesame Street
podcast.

00:44:59.079 --> 00:45:00.079
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sweet.

00:45:00.079 --> 00:45:01.079
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's gotta be completely

00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:03.170
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well if that doesn't put you
in a good mood I don't know what will.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.869
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'll just hit the back button,
nice, that worked.

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:07.249
This, oh no.

00:45:07.249 --> 00:45:09.079
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You're out.

00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:11.740
Also should point out that you hitting the
back button, the fact that that worked is

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.819
nice but the fact that there's no other way
to navigate back from that deep nested thing

00:45:15.819 --> 00:45:18.789
to the bit where you get to play is kind of
irritating.

00:45:18.789 --> 00:45:24.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, yeah, in the sense that
if I had a real action bar with navigational

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.970
hints I would be able to navigate directly
rather than hitting a button five times.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:29.970
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:35.270
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Speaking of hitting that button,
you know, if I go here and start one of these

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:44.519
things going, then press this little magic
button it's going to show me this and then,

00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:48.619
now I don't know if it'll do this on the tablet
but on the phone, hitting the back button

00:45:48.619 --> 00:45:49.890
on that just quit the app completely.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:50.890
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:54.859
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It doesn't do that on the
tablet so that's cool.

00:45:54.859 --> 00:46:00.240
They have kind of a nice UI where this skips
forward 30 seconds, this skips back 10 seconds.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I can see that it's actually
a video cast because we can see that's being

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:05.670
displayed.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.769
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, and which is a good thing
to point out because it means they can't see

00:46:08.769 --> 00:46:13.119
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The rest of what you're doing.

00:46:13.119 --> 00:46:14.470
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We're back now.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:21.579
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So we're going to have to
do just one more, uh, one more depth into

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:24.339
this.

00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:29.160
One of these needs to be, okay, Greg Proops
never has videos so we'll go ahead and use

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.160
Greg Proops.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.160
[Laughter]

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.579
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Hit the back button a few time.

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:35.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hit the back button several
times, I don't mind, I'm a back button hitter.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:36.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Uh, it's too many.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Maybe one too many times.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.140
So we'll go to the smartest man in the world
podcast.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.380
Notice it's going to play immediately which
is wonderful.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.299
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, immediately once it's
finished buffering.

00:46:47.299 --> 00:46:48.569
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: finished buffering, yeah.

00:46:48.569 --> 00:46:50.000
Okay, now you can see this.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.060
So on the right hand side of the screen, 30
seconds skip forward.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, I really like that.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Left hand side 10 seconds
back, that's awesome.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.690
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: What did he just say?

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now if I click here, what's
it gonna do?

00:46:59.279 --> 00:47:00.779
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It wants to skip.

00:47:00.779 --> 00:47:03.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That actually skipping forward.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.460
Why would I need that?

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.750
This is skipping forward?

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.359
No wait, this whole side of the screen is
skipping forward.

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:09.359
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:11.369
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What I really want when I
hit this is to go to the next podcast

00:47:11.369 --> 00:47:12.369
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The next track.

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:13.369
Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:13.369 --> 00:47:17.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There is no way to go to the
next track which annoys me no end because

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.920
sometimes I just get a podcast that's really
boring.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.849
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: If this was a podcast, this
may be the time where you'd wanna skip ahead.

00:47:23.849 --> 00:47:27.329
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wouldn't you be saying to
yourself, "God, I wish I could just press

00:47:27.329 --> 00:47:30.440
a button and skip directly to the Friday Review
of Games?"

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.440
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.529
I'd skip 30 seconds 15, 20 times now.

00:47:33.529 --> 00:47:35.430
I'm just done; I wanna get to the good stuff.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.609
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: By the way, Reto's not talking
about a podcast player he's talking about

00:47:38.609 --> 00:47:41.829
his life but he does it with drugs.

00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:45.790
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Anyway, so, to sum up.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:49.940
Pocket Casts is a great app functionally.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:56.049
The UI does not look like it's designed for
Android, it looks like it, A, I think it took

00:47:56.049 --> 00:47:59.839
some cues from maybe a different system, one
that's a little more bubbly and rounded than

00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:00.839
ours.

00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:01.839
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Little bit like the Prius.

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:03.569
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And that shows up in the review.

00:48:03.569 --> 00:48:04.569
So

00:48:04.569 --> 00:48:05.569
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:06.569
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: people complain about that.

00:48:06.569 --> 00:48:11.999
It's the same way if you, if you bought that
other phone and you got an app that looked

00:48:11.999 --> 00:48:13.759
just like an Android app you'd probably

00:48:13.759 --> 00:48:14.759
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:48:14.759 --> 00:48:15.880
You'd be similarly frustrated.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.369
It's that, it's creating that magic.

00:48:17.369 --> 00:48:19.480
You wanna open the app and feel like you're
at home.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.539
Feel like it's part of the eco system, part
of the system that you're running.

00:48:23.539 --> 00:48:29.059
You open this app and straight away you are
wondering what phone you have, how does this

00:48:29.059 --> 00:48:30.059
work?

00:48:30.059 --> 00:48:31.059
How do I get to do different things?

00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:32.059
How do I navigate?

00:48:32.059 --> 00:48:36.750
All of those things which as a developer who
maybe owns a different kind of phone, it's

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:41.920
obvious to you, I know how this works, you
tab across the top here and the refresh icon

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.930
is always here but for typical Android users
it's gonna be hostile.

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.009
It's a hostile environment and that's what
you wanna avoid.

00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:54.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But at least I can arrange
my podcasts and episodes and look at everything

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:59.190
without having to delve through multiple categories.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:07.670
But of all the things that we've looked at
today, we haven't seen anything that does

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:12.130
podcast playing nearly as well as just a simple
music player.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:16.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely and it's interesting
that whenever I ask people about their favorite

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.380
podcast player, one of the most frequent responses
I get is people are asking, you know, "I really

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:26.160
wish Google Music could just integrate podcasts."And
I think that's an opportunity for people because

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:30.579
Google Music, the player, is not a particularly
fancy implementation.

00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:31.839
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:32.839
It's normal.

00:49:32.839 --> 00:49:33.839
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's pretty straight up.

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:34.839
It's just standard.

00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:35.839
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's white bread.

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:39.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is totally white bread and
a lot of these apps, we haven't delved into

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.729
the details of what a lot of these apps do
because they do a lot of things, they have

00:49:42.729 --> 00:49:46.309
a lot of functionality, it's really great
and really important for podcasting.

00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:50.480
But they don't do the basics as well as they
could and I think that's, you know, that's

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:55.430
the take home piece of advice that I'd give
you guys who are developing these sorts of

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.549
apps is get the basics right.

00:49:57.549 --> 00:50:01.109
You know, get that first screen when I open
it up and I just wanna start listening to

00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:06.550
a podcast, make all of that as simple, as
clean and as easy as it can be.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.900
And then everything else, that's all, that's
all bonus.

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.829
That's what makes you better than all the
other apps.

00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:13.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's put up the angry baby
for 15 more seconds.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:18.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Just say, look, these aren't
things that we walked in thinking all podcast

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.920
apps should do.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:25.210
This is something we wrote this morning after
sitting down with 12 different podcast apps

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:30.499
trying to make them work, trying to make them
fit our lifestyle and ultimately deciding

00:50:30.499 --> 00:50:34.970
that none of them were actually what we wanted.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:39.479
So make that podcast app, you got my dollars,
I'll pay, you know, I would pay 20 bucks

00:50:39.479 --> 00:50:44.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I should point out as well that
these podcast apps, at least 2 or 3 of these

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:49.089
were paid apps between sort of 1 and 5 bucks
and people will pay 5 bucks for an app if

00:50:49.089 --> 00:50:50.920
it does everything they want it to do.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Any day of the week.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:53.630
Absolutely.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:58.690
Alright, so we have to go get Dan Galpin out
of his cage and lay down the protective sheets

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:02.680
along our camera here to make sure that he
doesn't spit all over it.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.930
So we've got a lot of work to do before the
Friday Review of Games starts.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.800
So, Reto, I think we should sign off.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We should.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.279
Thank you very much for joining us this week,
Ian.

00:51:11.279 --> 00:51:12.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:51:12.279 --> 00:51:14.359
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Hopefully we'll see you again
in the future.

00:51:14.359 --> 00:51:18.859
Thank you, especially, to Fred and Daniel
for helping us out behind the camera.

00:51:18.859 --> 00:51:22.059
We're gonna be back next week, same time,
1 o'clock on Friday.

00:51:22.059 --> 00:51:25.640
I think we're going to be looking at finance
apps next week.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.240
Is that right, Fred?

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.240
Finance apps?

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.240
I think so.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:33.250
So do make sure that you put your nominations
for finance apps that you've used and you'd

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.849
like us to take a look at in the moderator
page.

00:51:35.849 --> 00:51:38.809
And we will see you again same time next week.

00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:39.630
Thank you for watching.
