00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:17.676
SANDRA BERMANN: Good morning.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:18.002
STEPHEN MACEDO: Hi.

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:18.658
How are you?

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:19.149
SANDRA BERMANN: How are you?

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:19.640
SUBJECT: Coffee all?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.150
SANDRA BERMANN: Yes.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.730
Coffee would be
great, thank you.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.150
STEPHEN MACEDO: Me too, please.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.777
Thank you.

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:24.610
SANDRA BERMANN: You
know, the whole question

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.010
of migration through the ages --

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.660
since biblical
times, we've had it.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.439
But now, in our lived history,
we have a refugee crisis.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.370
We have more migration than
we've had since World War II.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.380
And I started thinking
about this community

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.320
and the possibility
of having one

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.810
in doing my own work on
translation studies but also

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.260
literary history and
started to realize

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.410
how much I needed to
know to talk about some

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.550
of these things in
the current period.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.940
So I went to a
couple of colleagues

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.360
and talked with
them, learned a lot,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.070
and started to
think about how much

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.770
it would mean to have
a group of faculty

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.520
from roundabout campus who
could talk about these things

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.240
and, in innovative
ways, share knowledge,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
share ways of thinking
about this issue,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.080
and how, eventually, this
could have a huge ripple effect

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.930
on campus through our
teaching, through having

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.110
student affiliates,
graduate and undergraduates.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.860
And, perhaps, over
time, we will see

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.280
opportunities for changing
the public discourse

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.230
and developing it
into something that

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.530
can create better
solutions or at least

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.816
better debates about them.

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:37.690
STEPHEN MACEDO: Yeah.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.570
We probably need to understand
why people see this issue,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.860
you know, so differently,
disagree so widely --

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.000
where they're coming from,
what their perceptions

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.100
are, what their
misperceptions are,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.842
and how this can be clarified.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.550
One of the things I
find most interesting

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.200
is that this is an
issue that doesn't

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.950
cut across the usual
left-right divide cleanly.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.220
There are liberals that
worry about high levels

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.364
of immigration because of the
impact on the working class.

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:04.780
There are conservatives
that worry

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.220
about high levels of
immigration both for that reason

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.770
but also because of
effects on the culture

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.672
and because of concerns
about cultural stability.

00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:14.380
On the other hand,
there are progressives

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.220
that are in favor, of course,
of high levels of immigration,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.380
generous policy towards
refugees and poorer

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.377
migrants from abroad.

00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:22.960
And, likewise, there
are conservatives

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.080
who believe in open markets
and open borders, a little

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.310
more libertarian.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.740
So these issues
are difficult ones

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.470
for both of the major
political parties, in a way.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.379
And it makes them interesting.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.920
Then the question
of who is a refugee

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.130
is a central one that hasn't
been all together settled.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.340
It's a disputed category
in international law.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.990
And are people that move out
of great poverty refugees

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.900
or merely economic migrants?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.220
A lot of these issues
need a lot more attention

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.471
as a matter of policy and law.

00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.595
SANDRA BERMANN: Absolutely.

00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:56.230
And one of the
fascinating things

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.630
is the whole use of language
and translation, because what

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.430
if you are migrant
and you do not

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.800
understand the
language of the country

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.650
into which you've migrated?

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.230
To have good translation
that's consistent --

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.940
these questions have
always fascinated me.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.830
And I think those were some of
the issues that attracted me,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.830
at the beginning, trying to
think about this much more

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.880
broadly.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.220
So there are all these
questions in the humanities

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.924
that fit into this larger
issue of migration.

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.590
STEPHEN MACEDO: I
guess another question

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.673
is, you know, what does
it mean to be an American?

00:03:31.673 --> 00:03:36.610
And what does it mean to be
French in periods of rising

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.110
and large-scale immigration?

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.200
How do narratives change?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.045
And I know that scholars of
literature are studying that.

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:45.170
SANDRA BERMANN: Absolutely.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.410
I mean, the question of
narratives and narratives

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.920
of migration is absolutely huge
and crosses the disciplines.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.824
And we each look at
it very differently.

00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:54.490
But if you think of,
as you were saying,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.700
the narratives that
tell us our nationhood

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.210
or why governments
choose certain programs --

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.890
migration programs --
then there are also

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.020
the journalistsâ€™
stories that try

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.100
to get very close to the
migrant lives and can be short

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.420
or in book form.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.630
And then there are, of course,
all the literary narratives --

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.180
literary and filmic,
visual arts, music --

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.089
that explore other
aspects of it.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.296
So it's a huge question --
a huge cultural question.

00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:23.170
STEPHEN MACEDO: Yeah.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.120
And one of the exciting things
about the research community

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.536
is that scholars bring all of
these different perspectives

00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:28.960
to bear.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.960
I mean, some people are unnerved
by these changes in what it

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.235
means to be an American.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:33.715
SANDRA BERMANN: Of course.

00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:34.450
STEPHEN MACEDO: But
the American story

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.710
is one of constant change.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.170
SANDRA BERMANN: Absolutely.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.800
STEPHEN MACEDO: And
it's great strength

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.432
that we have an
immigrant history.

00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:41.890
SANDRA BERMANN:
It's so interesting

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.280
to hear what other national
perspectives are on this, which

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.890
can be very different, and to
have people in our research

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.040
community who are working on,
you know, the Pacific Asian

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.760
world, who are working
on Europe and also

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.340
Latin America and the U.S. and
many other parts of the world,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.006
the Middle East.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:01.469
So it's really very interesting
comparatively, as well,

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:02.260
in terms of region.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.460
STEPHEN MACEDO: Yeah.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.530
And we've got here some of the
best scholars in the Woodrow

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.470
Wilson School, sociology,
political science,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.860
in my neck of the woods,
also -- philosophy, economics --

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.890
working on both the empirical
and the moral dimensions

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.910
of these questions.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.220
And I look forward to,
you know, doing more.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.670
