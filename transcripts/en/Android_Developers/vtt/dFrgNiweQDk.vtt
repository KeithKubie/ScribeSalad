00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.130
The Guardian has grown from being a British
newspaper to being one of the largest English

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.840
language news sources on the planet.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.760
The Guardian products work across the entire
globe but we’re really keen on taking this

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.800
even further.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.390
We’re extremely excited about the growth
in space travel and space tourism and our

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.490
UX engineering and design team are now looking
at how we can take the fantastic experiences

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.240
you find on Earth and get them to work even
if you’re not on Earth, if you’re in orbit,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.670
if you’re on the moon or on a trip to Mars.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.430
Whilst testing our designs on Earth we developed
a system called Astro UI.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.460
We’ve brought this into all of our UX flows.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.570
The gloves of the extra vehicular mobility
unit are much larger, we needed to design

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.839
some new icons, floating action buttons specifically
and we used the updated material design guidelines

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.390
for this.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.659
Another challenge in space is gravity or the
lack of gravity.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.670
Using the principles of motion we created
a system called Fixed Point View - no matter

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.060
which way the phone is orientated, the articles,
the videos, the images will automatically

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.909
align to the viewer.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.689
There are regular Android APIs that are very
helpful in space flight; one in particular

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.050
is the text-to-speech API.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.820
In space there are times when you can’t
easily look at the screen so ‘Read it to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.700
me’ is especially useful.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.259
Astronauts can then have an article read in
their helmets when they’re on the moon for

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.259
example.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.249
The testing is really important because we
need to understand what works and what doesn’t

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:38.469
work in space.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.030
In the Google Play Developer Console there’s
a new feature called hangout with expert.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.030
Hi.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.719
Hey, this is Captain Mark Kelly, how do you
guys hear me

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.479
This allows us to have face to face access
anytime with the space beta tester, either

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.159
on the Earth or in space.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.340
Being in space is a bit like being underground.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.909
Sometimes the data is really expensive and
sometimes not there at all.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.859
Our APKs are as lightweight as possible, so
that they can be really easily installed;

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.180
then when they are running, we cache as much
content as possible.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.601
Innovation sits at the heart of what the teams
at The Guardian do, but it’s all for a purpose;

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:19.569
that purpose is getting our journalism into
readers’ hands and now those experiences

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.260
extend not just everywhere on Earth but beyond
it as well.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.040
Android and Google Play are parts of us achieving
that.
