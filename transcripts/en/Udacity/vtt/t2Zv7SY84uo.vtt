00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.650
Now that we have a database, we can take

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.420
advantage of an Android pattern to bind our view to

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.220
our data model known as a content provider. A content

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.810
provider allows us to think of our view data in

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.010
terms of URIs which is a convenient structure for

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.020
our applications. We can have views display different data based

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.130
upon which URI is currently active. As it turns out,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.270
a URI is the primary data member for those Intents,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.300
that Rato so gloriously described. With a combination

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.310
of content providers and intents, one can nicely

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.730
decouple the data being displayed from the view.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.940
And there's one other great thing we get from

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.020
using URI with a data location. It's easy

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.890
to have our database notify components that are registered

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.060
to observe that location which causes our cursor

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.990
to update our list and show the latest data.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.190
Content providers can return all sorts of data but typically, they return either

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.440
a list of items, or a single item. Here's how one might modify our

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.440
query to select the data for a specific date, rather than a range of

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.770
days which in this case also contains more information for the viewer to see.
