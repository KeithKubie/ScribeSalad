00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.480
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, good afternoon
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.050
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.760
I'm the Chief of the
African Middle East Division

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.770
and I'm delighted to
see you all here.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.520
And so welcome.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.820
Some of you are new.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.150
Some of you have been
here many times before.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.580 position:56%
So before we start the program, let
me say something about our division.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:55.460 position:56%
We are the African and Middle East
Division and we include 78 countries

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.610
in terms of our responsibility.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.910
Those 78 countries are about
the whole African continent,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.810
North and Sub-Sahara and Africa.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.550
We have the whole Middle
East that extends to --

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.950
from Morocco to Afghanistan.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.290
We also include the
Near East section,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.190
Central Asia, Armenia and Georgia.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.700
And we have the Hebraic section
which also includes collections

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.430
that come from all over the
world to the collections.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.490
Now the collections that
we are custodian of are

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.320 position:56%
in the languages of those countries.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.230
In other words, if you're
doing research on let's say,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.200
today's topic on Lebanon, if you
were looking for sources in Arabic,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.660
they would be part of
our collections here.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.920 position:56%
But if those sources on Lebanon were
in English, or French, or German,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.700
or Greek or Italian, they would
be part of the general collection.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.870
In other words, we
collect in the vernacular

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.030
and in the scripts
of those countries.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.000
Our programs include --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.930
so we collect and we serve
these materials to the audience.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.220
But we also do exhibits and
we've had some major exhibits

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.120
in the past five years
on Afghanistan.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.660
We've had one on the Hebrew book.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.870
We had one on the Persian book.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.640
We had one of the Armenian book.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.360
And we're possibly trying now
to raise funds and have one

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.260
of the Arabic book and
on the African book.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.710
We also have symposia and we bring
scholars from all over the world

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.310
to discuss various topics.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.130
We just had two recently, one on
the ancient city of Tyre in Lebanon

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.810
and we had international
archaeologists, museum keepers,

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.170
curators, artists and
others come and participate.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:38.030
And we had a Juneteenth symposium,
conference on the end of slavery

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.890
and again, it was -- we had
packed audiences in both cases.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.660
So why are we all, why
are we doing these things?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.340
We're doing this in order to
make our collections come alive.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.240
We collect books and
we take care of them.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.540
We preserve them.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.840
We store them.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.430
We serve them.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.550
But we also want people to
understand how those cultures

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.110
and those societies
live, how they speak,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.910
how they vote, how they write.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.750
And it is through these programs,
through the scholars who come

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.220
and share with us the work they
have done, through film producers

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.810
as we have today, that we
make these cultures live.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.410
Live in your imaginations,
in your thoughts.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.670
We just had a wonderful program on
Ethiopia with someone who had gone

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.350
to Ethiopia and had filmed
and taken photographs

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.830
of the beautiful topography
of Ethiopia,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.290
the mountains, the
lakes, the fields.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.380
So in this way, those of us who are
lucky enough to be present, live --

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.090
leave this one-hour presentation
enriched and more knowledgeable

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.630
than when they first
came to the Library.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.420
We are also addressing people
outside of the Library,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.250
across the world because since
we are webcasting our programs,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.580
people from every continent
in the world can have access

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.450
to these programs and
see them and learn

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.720
about the programs we're doing.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.720
So now, I would like to introduce
our Arab Word Specialist,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.380
Dr. Muhannad Salhi, a historian,
a graduate from the University

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.210
of Chicago and the person who
has organized today's event.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.150
I want to say a couple of
words also about our specialist

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.180
in all our three sections,
the African,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.860
the Near East, and
the Hebraic section.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.910
They're all scholars themselves.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.210
They have written.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.510
They have published.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.810
They are quoted in books.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.900
And they know the society
and the culture

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.360
and the languages of the region.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.680
So our scholar, Dr. Muhannad
Salhi, will introduce the speaker

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.760
and the film producer
today, Muhannad.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.170
&gt;&gt; Our speaker today and
documentary filmmaker,

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.990
I should say, is Rouane Itani.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.230 position:56%
She is a Lebanese-American filmmaker
based in Washington, DC, a local.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:42.240
And Ms. Itani started her media
career in broadcast TV in Beirut,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.800
Lebanon before coming to the United
States where she earned her MA

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.950
in Film and Video Producing.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.210
She runs a boutique media
production company, Aflama LLC,

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.240
and has several years of experience
creating corporate documentary

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.930
and educational projects.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.230
She is fluent in Arabic,
French and English.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.710
<i>Madame Parliamentarian </i>, the
movie we are about to see --

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.010
or documentary, I should say,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.530
that we are about to see is
her first independent film.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.190
So without further
ado, Rouane Itani.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.250
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Hello, I
would like to thank Mary-Jane

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.210
and Dr. Muhannad Salhi from the
Near East section of the African

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.510
and Middle Eastern Division
of the Library of Congress

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.090
for organizing this event
and inviting me here today.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.430
And thank you all for being
here for this hour together.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.190
Just a few words about
the documentary film

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.730
that we're going to be seeing.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:48.850
It's short, 16 minutes and its
entitled "Madame Parliamentarian".

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:54.660
Just to give you a general context,
I usually like to take Q and A's

00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:00.590
after the film but just to
give you a general setting,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:06.260
it was filmed during two
- the last two elections

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.630
of Lebanon, 2005 and 2009.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:18.810 position:56%
And it focuses on the participation
of women in the Lebanese parliament.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:25.020
I'll just say a couple of things
about the general political

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.730
or parliamentarian
system in Lebanon.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.540
In general, Lebanon is
-- population consist

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:41.070
of we just say roughly
50% Christian, 50% Muslim

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.790
and the distribution of the seats

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.030
in the Lebanese parliament
try to reflect that.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:54.510
So the way the seats are identified
or located follow a religious quota

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.360
in a way so though the
terms confessionalism

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.370
or sectarianism will be mentioned
a couple of times in the film

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.440
and probably by me
in the Q and A after

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.260
and that's what these
terms refer to.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.760
I know that for some people in
the United States or other places,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.000 position:56%
they might not be familiar with the
term confessionalism or sectarianism

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.470
and that's what it refers to.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.810
It's basically how the parliament,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.500
the seats in the parliament
have certain quotas

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.250
to reflect the religious diversity
of the population in Lebanon.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.660
I think I'll leave it at that
for now and watch the film

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.180
and we can discuss later.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.980
Thank you.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:24:51.500
[ Inaudible Video Playing ]

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.200
Just again, to get -- to
give a little bit more

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.550
about the political structure
and the demographic structure.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:06.860
To make sense for people who don't
know that under the Christian

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.280
and the Muslim populations,
the makeup of a country,

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.670
there are 17 religious sects.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:19.580
So there are various churches and
various divisions of denominations

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.110
of Islam, Sunni, Shia and a
third minority which is Druze.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:29.800
And under Christians, there are
majority Maronite Catholics,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.200
East Orthodox, Greek
Orthodox, Catholic Orthodox,

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.330
there are various churches
and two Armenian churches.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:44.900
So depending on which zones
or districts in the country,

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.500
the populations distribution
there, in some populations

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.470
in some districts, let's say, the
population might be more homogenous

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.120
in terms of the religious makeup.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.330
And in that -- in those districts,
for instance, in terms of quota,

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.000
there might be maybe four seats

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.670
for the same religious group
allocated for the parliament.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.170 position:56%
So that the people in that district,
the electors will be voting

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.730
for when they get a list, an
electoral list to vote for.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.390
They actually see the names
of the candidates and next

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.910
to them are the religious
affiliation

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.040
and then they have several

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.720 position:56%
by specific religious
denomination depending on the makeup

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.830
of the population within
that district.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:40.990 position:56%
So that's kind of how it works so it
gives you a little bit of a sense.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.910
All right, let's take questions.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.320
It was wonderful.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.690
I've always wondered.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:27:01.630
I had always the same question.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:12.220
Why is it that in Lebanon,
the women are so free

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:20.980
in so many different ways, why are
they not represented in parliament?

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:37.550
So I think you're addressing
the issue right on [inaudible].

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:44.910
My question is the issue of money.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.060
They bring this up again and again.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.680
But women in Lebanon are
just as wealthy as men.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:59.320
In other words, the money that
goes to support the men who are

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.430
into a position, into
the electorate, okay,

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:06.800
can very well be used for a woman.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.510
In other words, why is the
issue of money being brought

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:16.720
in when [inaudible] very
wealthy woman [inaudible].

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.740
So why is the money issue an issue?

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Okay, the stakes --

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:28.280
it's really one of the core
questions which comes at the end

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.470
of the film as a main question.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.470
So it's a very important
piece of the puzzle.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:38.370
And there are various
ways to address this.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.890
If we cannot go through
the [inaudible] --

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.900
the kind of the chronology of
the history from what you've seen

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.850
in the film, the 10 women who
have ever entered parliament,

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.300
nine of that -- well, we all, many
of them, nine of them actually,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.050
have come in because of the
man in their family who was

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:58.400
in the parliament or very close to
power, political power before them

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.510
and they've just kind of filled
in the seat of their father,

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.920
brother, et cetera, husband.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.920
So there's that one layer that
the women in the first place,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.460
they're not running
independently and getting in.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.300
That's also a problem for men too.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.910
So it's both, it's
everybody that there is kind

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.310
of the Lebanese phenomenon.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:27.610
There is that aspect of clanship
or wealthy families who have been

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:32.600
in power in the past who keep kind
of coming back again and again

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.400 position:56%
and recycling the same family names.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.620
So the women's representation
is falling under some

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.750
of those situations also.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.550
And one of the issues
here is looking

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.490
into why aren't there independent
women in the first place?

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.870
And then we can talk about -- yes,
why aren't there independent women

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.640
who are not made part of that whole
general political party blocs,

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.380 position:56%
the major blocs that have the powers
in the country and those that are

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.680
within the system, yet, why
aren't they even running?

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.980
Because there's not
enough women running also.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.280
So it's multilayered,
it's not just the capital.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.140
A few years ago, actually, when I
first filmed in 2005, the media,

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.140 position:56%
the access to media to cover a
woman's candidate wasn't equivalent.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.190
They were giving access to men and
they were lumping all the women

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.710
in kind of like a side bar.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.940 position:56%
Then there was a change in that law.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.890
So now the last I know is that
there is equality of media access

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:17.240
so both men and women candidates
have equal access to show 50%

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.590
of like so that's when men and
women can have access to the media

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.580
to cover their campaigns
when they're running.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.010
So that's an improvement.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.680
So there was one [inaudible],
the question of budget was coming

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:37.160
into that it require a lot of
money to buy media spots or access

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.960
to the media to publicize oneself
and to run a campaign in general.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:48.120
Women have been found to be
campaign managers for men.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:53.190 position:56%
But it's kind of like the whole
structure hasn't been created enough

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.260
at least yet for women
candidates to figure out how

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:03.670
to channel all not just the money
but the support, the mechanism,

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.140
the whole structure of campaigning
and promoting themselves.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.690
So there's all of that.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:14.580
In addition, the question
of access to money

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.100
for women might be a little
complex because there are women

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.240 position:56%
who are independent and are wealthy.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:28.390
We don't again, some of these
wealthy women, are they wealthy

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.670
because they come from that
wealthy family clan system

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.970
that has been in power.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.320
Again, so they're still
not regular independent --

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.930
when I say independent meaning
like not part of that kind

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.160
of political power structure.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.550
If they're coming from that,

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.390
their money probably
came through that family.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:51.010
There is also a lot of
social pressure sometimes

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.980
from within the family that if a
woman comes up and they say, "Why,

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.470
is there a shortage
of men in our family?

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.920
Like why is the woman
going to take that money?"

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.430
So there are multiple,
multiple questions

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:08.010
and I think it's a little
bit more challenging

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.510
than just simply a woman
saying, "I have all this money.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.440
I'm just going to run."

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.730 position:56%
It's multi-layered and that would be
maybe a topic for another film to go

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.140
and see, talk to a wealthy
woman and say, "You know,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.080
why aren't you putting your
money in a future campaign?"

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.850
But that -- thank you,
that's a very good question.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.650
Yes?

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:58.290
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:03.580
So like I said, some of those
interviews, they were 2005 and 2009

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.510
which were the last elections
fortunately that have happened.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.440
Another set of elections was
supposed to happen in 2013.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.880
Every four years is when
the election was due.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.130
But you, because of what's been
going on in the region with Syria

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.400 position:56%
and all the problems, the
elections have -- are still on hold.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:30.160
So imagine, since post-war
Lebanon which is 1991 until 2009,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.570
there were elections
every four years.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:39.380
And now the last ones were 2009
which is really a long time.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.680
So some of what you're hearing
is from those years before

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.100
and now the question is
how have things changed,

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.410
if there is an election in 2017
which is the next one that's kind

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:56.050 position:56%
of they're hoping that would happen.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:34:02.120 position:56%
And what -- at the time, what people
meant was that the media coverage,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.590
not the -- so there is access
of women to the media meaning

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:09.740
if the women want to put their own
spots and promotional campaign,

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.780
you know, spots and
promotions, they have to just --

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.880
they have to pay but
also that now both men

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.380
and women can access it equally.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:28.130
The coverage was that media
people themselves like, the news,

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:33.150
and producers, and news media, when
they're trying to cover the news

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.940
or follow the candidates.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.910 position:56%
They would take the male
candidates and cover them thoroughly

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:42.630 position:56%
about who this person is, where they
come from, what their ideas are,

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.500
et cetera and go on in
depth as one candidate meant

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.560
and then they would lump all
the women candidates as --

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.150
and here are the women as just like
these are just women candidates.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.970
But we don't know who they are
really or what they stand for,

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.620
what they're running for.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.400
And that's what they're
referring to.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:09.550
&gt;&gt; And so [inaudible], people
will also [inaudible] air time

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.130
covering it?

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: I believe so, yeah.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.300
&gt;&gt; Then why isn't [inaudible]?

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.630
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: That's
what I understand, yeah.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.530
I don't know the depth of the law
but that's my understanding is

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:27.300
that it, the media should now allow
equal access on the air for male

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.130
and female so that they cannot be
covering males more extensively

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:37.730
and just spending three minutes
on all the women candidates.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.670
Yes?

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:48.170
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just have a
question [inaudible].

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:24.880
I just have a question on
some of the information

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.530
because I'm interested in the film

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:41.540
to say Lebanon is 50-50
Christian and Muslim?

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.020
But when you showed the graph

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.900
of the different sectarian
percentages in the film, it wasn't.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.620
It was Muslim larger,
Christian maybe 40%,

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:57.430
22% so the Christians are just
broken down into all the, you know,

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.570
professions that we talked about.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:00.870
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Are you referring
to the maps or the [inaudible]?

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, yes and the [inaudible]
that was 100%, 100% for [inaudible].

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.750
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: I think you may
be referring in the pie charts

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:12.660
to there is a quote, there are a
couple of things going on there.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.950
There is a proposal about
having 30%, a quota for women,

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:21.050
to be 30% of the parliament.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.770
So there is that one reference
and this is a percentage

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:29.280
that was recommended during
the Beijing Women's --

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.870 position:56%
International Women's Conference and
this is a percentage that is sought

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.150
after in many countries
around the world.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.410
So even including right now,

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.460
several European countries
have implemented that.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.160
Several African countries
have implemented that.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.720 position:56%
That's following those Beijing
recommendations is what the world is

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.350
kind of moving towards.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:58.480 position:56%
And in Lebanon, there has been these
efforts by the woman's movement

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.940
to try to ask for that but there
is a pushback from the last --

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.750
the parliament refusing
that and there is --

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.150
that's kind of if you
want updated information.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.320
That last number of years,
that's what's happening

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.640 position:56%
that the women's movement has had
to work with the parliamentarians --

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.880
the majority male that
represented parliamentary Lebanon

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.620
and negotiate how they can
have more representation

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.420
of women in the parliament.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.620
The parliament has rejected,
has voted down twice the request

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:40.520
to have 30% so that's not
going to happen anytime soon.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.620
It doesn't look like it.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:46.600
So now then, there were
conversations about,

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.340
okay, can we have 20%?

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:54.990
Can we have 10%, and now
there are other discussions

00:38:54.990 --> 00:39:00.060
about possibly having what they
call a zippered electoral list

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.550
or candidates list.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:10.130
Which means that when the next
elections would happen that people

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:16.910
when they vote, they will see a
list with names of male and female,

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.930
men and women candidates so every
other one will be like male, woman,

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.810
man, woman, man, woman, man, woman.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.570
That's what they call
a zippered list.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.290
Tunisia, I believe,
is implementing that.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.740
Many other places are and it
seems to be a good kind of way

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.590 position:56%
of showing equally that for the
electoral, for the electorate to see

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:42.840
that you have both names
available there available for you.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.010
And that's still being discussed.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.120
Another discussion has been okay,
forget about the 30% of seats

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.440
that would be set up in
the parliament for women.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.180
Can we have 30% or something
along those lines on the list?

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.480
So and when you see the name
of the [inaudible] candidates,

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.780
you're not seeing all men,

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.080
that we need to have more
women on those lists.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.380
And so these aren't some
of the proposals that have,

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.680
are being still discussed
behind closed doors or you know,

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.980
still kind of ongoing right now.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.280
&gt;&gt; So I wasn't going
to that actually.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.580
I was referring to the [inaudible].

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.880
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Oh,
I'll try to repeat.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.180
&gt;&gt; Could you [inaudible]?

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.480
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: So I think the
question was about some of the maps

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.780
and references to religious
distribution in the country.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.080
So I'll just try and clarify.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.430
The last census that was
officially done in Lebanon was 1932

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:15.170
and now people who have to,
who use you know, the census

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.720
and that information, they
still go back and refer to that

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.140
which at the time generally --

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.370
roughly speaking was 50%
Christian, 50% Muslim.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.510
And the reason those numbers are
important is because what I --

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.770
what you've seen, what I've
explained is that the seats

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:38.040
in the parliament try to reflect
the demographics of the country.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.660
At the end of the civil war,
the Lebanese civil war in 1991,

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.790
there was a change in the
parliament distribution.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.810
They increased the
number of [inaudible] --

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:53.160
members of parliament to 128.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.620
It was less before.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.930
It was close to a hundred and
they made now the distribution

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:03.960
of the seats in the parliament,
50% Christian, 50% Muslim.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.720
So in a way, now the
parliament is more equitable,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.970
if you usually, if
we want to say that.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.290
While before there were issues and
that's what people thought about,

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.030
you know, is one group being
represented more than the other,

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.700
has more power than
the other, et cetera.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.740
And it's hard right now to
know exact numbers of figures

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.790
of what the demographic
ridges and sects are

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.390
because there is no
official census being made.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:34.250
So some of these graphs in
the film, some of them were

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.650
from a number of years ago.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:42.140
We don't know -- I don't know if
anybody has a map or a distribution

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.670
that is by any means
official or definitive.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.440
So these are all, you
know, roughly depending

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:55.470
on what source they came from,
who made those estimates.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.030
There more estimates, I would say.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.640
And also, because the distribution

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.160
of these religious
groups varies depending

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.220
on sector -- sections
of the country.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.450
And there is also the issue
of migration and a lot

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:17.340
of displacement due to the Lebanese
civil war and other problems

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:21.240
where a lot of, there were a lot
of displaced refugees that moved

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.700
from neighborhood, or part of the
country, or region to the other.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:31.120
So it's really complicated
to figure out, you know,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.210
what is the real religious
distribution

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.480
or the sectarian distribution.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.670
And so that's kind
of the larger issue.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.040
Yes?

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:50.340
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what the 30%
rate is because as you mentioned,

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.830
you know, the Lebanon's
political system is [inaudible].

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:59.820
Is one of the [inaudible]
representatives [inaudible]

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.380
that perhaps overburdened
by also [inaudible].

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.030 position:56%
Is that also one of the [inaudible]?

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:08.250
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Absolutely,
so I'll kind of re-answer

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.710
with including the question
because that's exactly the fact.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.560
The reason why the parliament
has rejected twice that proposal

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.980
of asked of by the
women's movement --

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:24.400
to ask to have 30% of the seats
in parliament to be women.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.370
The arguments that
come back with no,

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.540
are that we already have all
this complicated religious quota

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.780
that we have to deal
with, with the candidates

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.740
and the seat distribution,
how can we add on top

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.490
of that another quota for women?

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.380
That it would make impossible
and very complicated.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.880
So that is -- that's exactly one.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.980
Now the issue of quota is very
controversial issue in probably

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.260
in many countries but all
very much so in Lebanon.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:58.330
And even the word the term quota is
controversial and very polarizing

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:01.590
and people have a strong
reaction to that term quota.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:07.190
So as the years went by, now the
women's movement has started not --

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.610
trying not to even use the
term quota because it divides

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:15.650
and polarizes people so
badly like for and against.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:20.800
Some of the women themselves
are against that idea of quota

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.080
because they feel that it is,
it is discriminatory in itself.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:30.330
It's as if women are not qualified
or strong or equal or ready.

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:33.920
It's kind of like why do we need
to be handed out special treatment?

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.430
We don't need to be given seats.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.730
We can do it on our own.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:42.910
So there's some of that, that
is being said by certain women.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:47.210
And because by law, from the
beginning of the independence

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:51.880
of the country, the constitution
gives equal rights to men and women

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.520
to vote, to run, so
there is nothing legally

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.230
that is stopping a
woman from running.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:03.640
I mean, in terms of voting, there
is no problem because women vote,

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.450
so women do go and they vote
and the number of voters

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:13.720
of women is maybe not 50% but it's
definitely more than 40% according

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:19.340
to the last general surveys
that happened in 2009.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.610
So it's not a shortage
of women voters

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:26.670 position:56%
and there are various organizations
that have been working very strongly

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:31.610
on promoting and encouraging
women to vote in more numbers

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.560
and giving them ID cards and
all of the support to vote.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.780
So the problem is not on the
voting, it's more on the running --

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.660
on really women presenting
themselves.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.800
And I'll just add a couple of
updates because the film was,

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.030
you know, from those years
back that there are two

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:53.490
or three major organisms
in the country independent

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.170
from the government
but also a couple

00:45:55.170 --> 00:46:02.270 position:56%
of semi-governmental
organizations that have been working

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:09.260
with women candidates
creating leadership training,

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.360
encouraging women to run.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.880 position:56%
Training them on how to run a
campaign, how to do public speaking,

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.290
how to fund raise, all of that.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:28.080
And in 2009, the number of
women candidates were only 12.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:33.560
So there were only 12 women
who ran for parliament in 2009

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.630
and four of those got in.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.160
And the last I know which
was a couple of years --

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.510
2013 when there was supposed to be
an election, there were up to 40,

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.660
four-zero candidates,
women candidates.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.710
And this is believed
to be due to the fact

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:57.920
of having organizations now
systematically working with women

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.360
in a kind of a more organized
way around different districts

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.230
to bring more women
candidates to the front

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.520
to prepare them, to get them there.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.580
So it's starting to become
more hopeful for women

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.820
to show that we are there.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.480
Because another argument
from the parliament was

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.140
that well, there are no women.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.450
There are no women candidates.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.590
There are not enough women
who want to be running.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.220 position:56%
That's why we can't give them quotas

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.620
because who are we
going to put in there?

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.770 position:56%
And now the response from the
women's organizations is to show no,

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:36.420
we have 40 candidates right now
and it could be much more if we go,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.360
if we go on so that's
kind of this part.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.340
Yes? Sorry.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.900
I don't know how much time we have.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.200
Go ahead.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.500
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] 10 minutes.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.800
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] to the issues
that the woman's [inaudible].

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.100
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Ah!

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:59.880
&gt;&gt; And it's something beyond
just having women [inaudible].

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.180
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Yes.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.640
So the question is are there
specific women's issues

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.180
that women would like --

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.480
&gt;&gt; They're not just issues.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.780
That it's not --

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.030
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: -- or issues or
specific issues that people would

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:14.400
like for women candidates
to raise in parliament.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.640
I think that that's the question.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:23.530
I'll mention in terms of women's
issues that and that is a problem

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.740
by itself, what I'm just going
to say which is women don't --

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.650
women candidates don't
want to be [inaudible] --

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:35.580
cannot be pigeon-holed in that
you're going to become a woman,

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:44.210
a parliamentarian to promote or
to lobby for women's causes only.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:47.090
You should be seen as a
woman candidate like any --

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:53.030 position:56%
like the man, just anybody and be
interested in any political platform

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:58.590
or issues then topics that you
want to focus on and work on.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:02.230
So there is that, that first
fight to just look at women

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:08.000
as a normal politician and not
expect them any special service,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.060
or treatment, or focus
on any issues.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:16.420
In addition to that, of course,
the women's movement wants men

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:25.510
and women candidates in the
parliament to fix the laws

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.870
that are affecting women's status
in the country so it's kind

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.300
of like a two-side approach.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.850
And the main issues for
the women's movement

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:42.270
in general are there are still
laws that are unjust for in regards

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:47.500
to domestic violence and
sexual rape, domestic rape,

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:52.110
like that domestic -- so
domestic violence and harassment,

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.570
things along those lines.

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.390
And there is a big one
which is about citizenship.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:02.910 position:56%
Right now, Lebanese women who marry
a non-Lebanese man cannot give their

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:08.030
citizenship to the man nor to
their children who are born --

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:11.960
who could be born and
could be living in Lebanon.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:15.030
So that passing of
citizenship from a woman

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:18.570
to her family is right now absent.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:20.010
It's always been absent.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:24.750
While a man can very simply marry
a foreign woman give her Lebanese

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:27.720
citizenship and the children,
of course, will be born

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.620
and because he is a male father,
he could pass on his citizenship.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.920
So these are like the main
two big issues that in terms

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.400
of women's rights are being
by parliament to be adjusted.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.910
Did I see -- yeah, someone
here had another question?

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:45.970
Oh, go ahead.

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:59.540
&gt;&gt; I thought I heard it mentioned
in the film, some suggested an end

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.410
of the confessional system?

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:02.710
Was that anything on that?

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:08.110
I don't hear any that it's really
the end of discussion at all.

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:10.160
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: That's
kind of like a side topic.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:16.170
I'm not sure if somebody may
have mentioned it briefly.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:19.540
That's a whole other
issue that I would say,

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:26.130
it's kind of off-topic in a way.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:34.490
Yes, there is -- it's something
that, it's a hot potato in Lebanon

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:38.460
and people discuss it but
it's, I will leave it at that.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.760
It's kind of a side bar.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.060
Yes?

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.360
&gt;&gt; Can [inaudible] be less?

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.890
How many Lebanese women
work outside the home?

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:46.190
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: Oh,
work outside the home.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:51.090 position:56%
I was going to say for the political
representation, Lebanon is the less

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:55.010
than -- it's like 3% in [inaudible]
-- in the parliament and here,

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:59.570
I believe in Congress,
it's reached 12% so even

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.280
in the U.S., it's not that high.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:07.550
It's only around 12% of women
are in Congress while Rwanda,

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:10.630
the last I know, used to be the
number one country in the world

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:15.470
that had the highest number
of women in their parliament.

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:17.670
So you think, you know, women --

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.990
well, Rwanda has the highest
number of women in parliament.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.670
The U.S. has only 12%.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:28.290
A number of countries in Europe
have very close to 50% or 40 --

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:31.390
30 to 40% or somewhere
around that number.

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:34.780
But I don't know the answer
to again about percentages.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:48.760
I just, would just
estimate kind of offhand

00:52:48.760 --> 00:53:06.720
that it's a high percentage,
more than 30%.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:24.750
I would say 30 to 50% of
women work outside the home.

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.890
I guess that's the question, right?

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:30.860
&gt;&gt; The reason why I asked
this is because previously,

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.820
[inaudible] women working
outside the home, they [inaudible]

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.980
and so they got their
own [inaudible].

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:41.150
And also, they might have
felt some way to give it away

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:46.280
or spend it the way their
fathers or husbands would resent.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.780
And so, are they changed for women?

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:52.910
Can they support facts like
office sidelines or in this list,

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:59.200
support by government really but
women are making their own money

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:06.880
and so they feel freer maybe in
balance of power within the family

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.360
to be more of an equal partner
[inaudible] to decision making.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.310
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: So do I need
to repeat, summarize some

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:12.610
of that for the [inaudible]?

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:16.270
So I believe what you
mentioned was that in the U.S.,

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:20.010
as more women started
working outside the home,

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:23.190
they gained more independence
financially

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:25.230
to use their money as they wished.

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:30.390
While at the beginning, maybe
as they were starting to work,

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:36.660
they were getting their money more
either through family inheritance

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:42.070
or through the men or
getting them later in life.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:56.580 position:56%
And they felt that they were
obliged to spend that money in a way

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.920
that would please the
males and their family.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.200
And so as more women
have independence,

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.170
financial independence,
how to use their,

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:08.980
gain and use their own money then
they have more freedom to do that.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.160
And I would say that would,
is probably very correct,

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.890
very applicable to Lebanon also.

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:19.680
Right now, there are women who are
bank presidents, business owners,

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.190
pilots, airplane pilots,
tons of architects,

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:25.310
40% of the judges are women,
engineers, tech people.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:26.950
You know, they're there.

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:33.280
But I guess, that's another
film that we need to do to get

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.830
to answer that -- that part.

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.480
Do we still have time?

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.780
I don't know.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.080
I have one or two last questions?

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.380
Yes?

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.050
&gt;&gt; I was curious how the film is
being introduced to [inaudible],

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.660
you know, where in Lebanon?

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:50.800
I'm just curious about that.

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.320
&gt;&gt; Rouane Itani: So when I
made the film, as you see,

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.930 position:56%
I made it in English even though
there is an Arabic subtitled version

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:00.610
and a French subtitled
version so it could be shown.

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:04.510
It has been shown in Lebanon and
a couple of places, high schools

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:05.810
and it was well received.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:10.480
And there was a discussion
with the Ministry of Education

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.600
and some organizations that
work on education to figure

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.250
if it could be used in the
school, in the educational system.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:21.800
So that could possibly
happen in the future.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.610
But I think my original plan was to
just bring awareness to the issue,

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:31.840
to kind of shed light on the
status of women in Lebanon.

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:38.010
Because I feel that especially,
that I live here like in the U.S.,

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:40.790
there are a lot of
misconceptions about women

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:44.750
in the Middle East overall and
they think that women are much --

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:49.110
I don't have less, much less
rights than they actually do.

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:52.170
And to show that at least in this
particular story for the case

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:56.740
of Lebanon and in this particular
subject that women are there.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.040
They have obstacles
but they're there.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.340
So I thought this would give
a general sense to audience,

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.640
to international audiences
about the status

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.940
of women in Lebanon in general.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.240
And it's been -- it's
shown in a few festivals

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.540
and at various organizations,
independent screenings.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.840
And I would hope that I, we
could still show it more widely

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.140
around the world and
with more organizations

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.440
or educational systems.

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.740
So if you have suggestions
for groups

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:11.040
who might be interested,
I'd be open to that.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.340
And then the website is
www.madameparliamentarian.com

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.640
so it's the name of the film.com.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.940
You can find more information and
the film is available for sale

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.240
on DVD and [inaudible]
streaming from the website and --

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.540
I don't know what else I can say.

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.840
Is that [applause]
-- oh my time is up?

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.140
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
