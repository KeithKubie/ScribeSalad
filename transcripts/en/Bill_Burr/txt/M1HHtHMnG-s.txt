Speaker 1:          00:06          Like a boss. For some reason, I think if I'm fluent in Spanish, I can go down to South America with that South America. Why did that just pop in my head? Remember that fucking song that David Bowie and a Mick Jagger did dancing in the streets and they will rubbing their ass is together and they were yelling all the fucking places, different countries out. And then Mick Jagger goes South America

Speaker 2:          00:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:45          and it made me like the stones a little bit less. Um, anyways, I figured if I can go down there to South America, I would fucking, uh, if I could speak the language, I could talk my way out of being kidnapped. You know, you have to watch that show arrested abroad abroad. You ever seen that shit? Fucking people go now I'm, I think you don't have to take, I'm going to do is martial artists guy. I think I've been a fucking ride a motorcycle from here to the tip of South America.

Speaker 3:          01:17          I decided to ride a motorcycle to the tip of South America and back.

Speaker 1:          01:23          You know, and guess what happens? It gets like a third of the way there. He goes, left on fucking Venezuelans that are right on fucking a Chalupa right?

Speaker 3:          01:35          It's just this premonition that something's gonna go wrong. And that's when I started going, hmm, do I turn it around or do I keep going?

Speaker 1:          01:47          Next thing you know, he's, he's there a bunch of fucking gorillas. They're just looking at like, is this like entrapment? There's no way it's this easy. Did a fucking white guy on a Goddamn vesper just turned down this dirt road in the middle of the fucking rainforest? Is the, is there a fucking death squad behind this guy?

Speaker 1:          02:08          You know, and I just figure if you actually spoke the language instead of these people walking around, I'd get it. Right. Cause that's what, that's what Spanish sounds like to a white man like me or I'm going to elaborate that map map until you fucking break it down. I just think that that would be good to be laying in the tent. Keon dog. You know what? We're not going to fucking kill this guy right now. We're going to kill him tomorrow instead of it sounding like I'm now all right. And then maybe you could figure out how to get out of there. So that's what I do. So like, you know what I've always wanted to do? I want to go out, I want to go to the, uh, the Galapagos Islands. I think he would have to go through Columbia or Venezuela, you know, those places down there, you know, instead of having like, they have like a Pablo Francisco Boulevard, I mean, I'm not going to that street as a Goddamn redheaded white man. Hey, how are ya? Who'd like to a kidnap me first and all me for ransom,

Speaker 3:          03:07          you know,

Speaker 1:          03:08          you know, when they say you've got to watch out who you fucking hang out with that, that's one of those times you really have to watch out who you hang out with because if you hang out with a bunch of fucking losers and you get kidnapped and they start demanding money for you, that's going to be a rough one.

Speaker 3:          03:26          Jim [inaudible] Oh, Steve. Yeah.
