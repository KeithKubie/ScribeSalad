00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.500
From the very first time people gathered around
the campfire, they’ve spun stories of young,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.190
chosen heroes taking down mighty empires,
otherworldly monsters that creep in the dark,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.619
and magical artifacts hidden from all but
those brave enough to find them.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.590
Today’s movies and TV still call on those
same stories, changing the details to make

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.610
it their own.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.280
But sometimes, the similarities between a
film and those that “inspired” it cross

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
the line.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.750
Here is Screen Rant’s list of Popular Movies
That Stole Their Plots From Other Films.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.129
Alien

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.370
Director Ridley Scott immortalized his film
career with 1979’s “Alien,” following

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.309
the crew of a spaceship slowly picked off
by a murderous alien stowaway.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.109
Scott’s deep space horror and vision of
the future helped to shape a new age of science-fiction,

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.840
but the plot of the movie may not have been
so original.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.199
Comparisons to the 1958 film “It!

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.219
The Terror From Beyond Space” have been
made since the movie was first released, with

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.510
one producer admitting the film was shown
on set to make sure they weren’t copying

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.510
it entirely.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.510
“It!”

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.750
May swap out a distant alien world for Mars,
and the Xenomorph for a humanoid lizard, but

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.830
entire scenes, sequences, and even the films’
finale are recreated entirely.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.461
Since the original film was influenced by
several classic sci-fi stories itself, no

00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:16.461
lawsuits were filed.

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:21.800
But the writers of “Alien” still have
some explaining to do.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.260
Star Wars

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.670
George Lucas made no claims that he was creating
a genuinely original story with his “Star

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.450
Wars” saga, calling on ancient archetypes
– a princess in distress, a young hero,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.390
a wise old wizard, and an evil masked villain
– re-imagined in a galaxy far, far away.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.940
The work of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa
was another major influence.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.640
But when you go back and watch Kurosawa’s
“The Hidden Fortress,” it becomes clear

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.420
just how much Lucas adopted for his own story.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.270
The characters are nothing new, but the decision
to tell the story through the eyes of two

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.640
bumbling tag-alongs is a direct lift.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.090
Elements of “fortress” that couldn’t
fit into “A New Hope” – were worked

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.030
into “The Phantom Menace” years later,
and watching the movies back-to-back shows

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.310
Lucas did more than follow Kurosawa’s lead.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.630
He even included a nod to the movie in “Star
Wars” itself, but the Imperial Officer was

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.480
force-choked before speaking the entire title
(38:34).

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.080
The Fast &amp; The Furious

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.620
The tale of Dominic Toretto and the “Fast
&amp; Furious” gang may have become a blockbuster

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.710
juggernaut, but it didn’t start out that
way.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.180
Inspired by a magazine article exploring the
world of import street-racing in New York

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.730
City, the script grew into a story of an undercover
cop infiltrating the community to sniff out

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.060
racers robbing shipments of high-end merchandise.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.069
Or in other words, a remake of Kathryn Bigelow’s
“Point Break,” released a decade earlier.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.730
Simply swap racers for surfers, and the structure
of both films is almost identical: Keanu Reeves

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.950
and Paul Walker’s characters get close to
the gang’s leader through the women in their

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.870
lives, fall in love, accept the gang as their
new family, and refuse to believe they’re

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.650
the criminals that need to be brought down.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.150
In the end, both come to understand their
outlaw ways.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.319
But only The Fast &amp; the Furious became a long-running
franchise.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.700
Which is the real shame.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.630
Toy Story 3

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.569
As brilliant and important as Pixar’s “Toy
Story” may be, it’s not as original as

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.280
you’d think.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.300
“The Brave Little Toaster” deserves some
of that credit, released as a children’s

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.190
novel before it was adapted into a full-length
movie.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.230
Starring household appliances cast aside by
their now college-aged owner, Rob, the team

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.599
decides to find their way to his dorm room,
encountering terrifying obstacles along the

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.599
way.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.340
Being thrown in with disassembled or broken
gadgets, and even winding up in a junkyard

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.410
headed for disposal were all re-imagined for
the “Toy Story” series, particularly its

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.410
second sequel.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.520
It shouldn’t be surprising, since many of
Pixar’s original staff worked on “Toaster,”

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.950
including director John Lasseter.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.290
Pixar’s animators telling the same story
twice can be forgiven, only because both films

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.100
ended up as quality stories, meant to be as
educational and entertaining to children as

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.190
they were to their parents.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.560
The Lion King

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.680
As one of the films responsible for launching
the Disney Renaissance, The Lion King stands

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.209
as one of the most beloved animated movies
in history.

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.520
The film draws from the biblical tale of Moses,
and Shakespeare's Hamlet.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.120
But fans of Japanese cartoons noticed a similarity
to "Kimba the White Lion," an anime series

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.340
following a young lion cub who is forced to
grow up and take his rightful place as king.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.989
With scenes and themes copied from Kimba,
and early footage showing Simba as a white

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.690
lion cub, it didn't help that voice actor
Matthew Broderick assumed The Lion King was

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.580
related to the Japanese cartoon he had enjoyed
as a child.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.220
The director claimed nothing had been stolen,
but script rewrites throughout production

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.060
meant it was possible.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.910
In the end, the studio behind Kimba deemed
Disney too big to fight, and took it as a

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.910
compliment.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.220
The Island

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.470
There's a good chance that most movie fans
have never heard of "Parts: The Clonus Horror,"

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.880
but thanks to Michael Bay's "The Island,"
that doesn't mean you haven't seen the dystopic

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.850
sci-fi tale of clones seeking freedom.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.520
The 1979 movie showed a future where clones
are lied to about a desolate earth, never

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.669
learning that they're being grown for their
organs to be harvested for the super-wealthy.

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.360
One clone sees through the lies, escapes,
and eventually comes face to face with his

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360
sponsor.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.250
So when Michael Bay added Scarlett Johansson
and told the exact same story, the original

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.570
filmmakers took legal action - eventually
settling out of court.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.580
A Fistful of Dollars

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.130
The rise of spaghetti westerns in the 1960s
made actor Clint Eastwood a household name,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.880
establishing him as one of the most iconic
cowboys in movie history.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.680
A Fistful of Dollars began his rise to stardom,
playing a gunslinger who drifts into a Mexican

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.970
border town torn between two families, and
plays both sides in pursuit of gold.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.590
As it turns out, Akira Kurosawa had the same
idea for his film Yojimbo, swapping Mexico

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.040
for Japan, and a cowboy for a masterless samurai.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.494
When a lawsuit was filed, Leone claimed that
both he and Kurosawa had both been inspired

00:05:41.494 --> 00:05:45.250
by an even older play, and the dispute delayed
the movie's release for years.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.270
The settlement was more than worth it in the
end, with Eastwood's "Man With No Name" appearing

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.900
in two successful sequels.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.180
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.320
Just like Star Wars, George Lucas was open
about the origins of Raiders of the Lost Ark,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.260
shaping Indiana Jones in the image of classic
serial adventures.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.320
But one film may have had more of an impact
than any other.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.270
"The Secret of the Incas" starring Charlton
Heston may not be a well-known movie, but

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.040
Lucas was certainly a fan.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.300
Aside from hero Harry Steele looking exactly
like Indiana Jones in every way, the use of

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.889
a secret key to illuminate the location of
buried treasure, and other similarities are

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.680
impossible to ignore.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.210
The costume designer on Raiders has confirmed
that the crew viewed the film multiple times

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.610
for inspiration, but couldn't explain why
George Lucas or Steven Spielberg didn't credit

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.479
the movie they borrowed from so heavily.

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.530
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.530
Did we miss any movies that borrowed their
plots from other films?
