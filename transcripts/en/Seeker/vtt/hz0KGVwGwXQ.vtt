00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.980
New data has accurately measured
and potentially confirmed

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.355
some mind-blowing theories
about the universe.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.990
Anthony here for DNews, and
space is big, super big.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.110
Think of the biggest thing in
your house and then double it

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.660
and space is at least that big.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.240
OK.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.639
That might have been a little
nonspecific, but to be fair,

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.930
we've been dealing with some
wildly different estimates

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.417
about just how big
the universe is.

00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.250
But now thanks to new
measurement techniques

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.980
discover by the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.640
Survey Collaboration, we've
got a more accurate handle

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.960
on the size of--
well everything,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.570
the whole everything.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.055
Knowing how far
away something is

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:44.910
is very important in astronomy.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.522
The way something looks visually
through a telescope means

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:49.730
something different depending
on how far away it is .

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.630
And as things get
farther and farther away,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.085
our ability to accurately gauge
those distances gets harder.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:57.880
20 years ago, estimates about
the size of the universe

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.350
varied as much as 50%.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.050
But now, the
appropriately-named BOSS

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.870
just analyzed data from the
Sloan Foundation telescope

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.660
in New Mexico of the largest
sample of the universe ever,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.890
1,277,503 galaxies across
6 billion light years

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.160
to an accuracy of 1%.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.314
We have got a 6
billion light-year map.

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:24.230
So how did they do it?

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.640
They use baryon
acoustic oscillations.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.650
Basically, as the universe was
rapidly expanding after the Big

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.440
Bang, it put out these
waves of pressure

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.920
like ripples that set up how
galaxies are distributed today.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.590
They're spherical, and the team
used the radius of the BAOs

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.020
as a sort of unit of
measurement creating

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.000
this giant cosmic ruler half
a billion light years long.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.510
And the team says
not only does this

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.630
allow accurate measurement of
distances to celestial bodies,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.790
but it will also help to
figure out other big questions

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.750
like the rate of
expansion of the universe.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.080
The BOSS data also
supports Einstein's idea

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.670
of the cosmological constant,
meaning that dark energy exists

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.900
and has remained constant
throughout the history

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.686
of the universe.

00:02:04.686 --> 00:02:06.310
It also means we can
start figuring out

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.530
more about just what
exactly dark energy is

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.430
and how it works.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.950
Another insane
thing they found, it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.710
looks like our universe is
flat rather than curved.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.950
Flat here means that
if you go forward

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.550
in space in a
straight line, you're

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.280
going to keep going
in the same direction

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.350
like drawing a line
on a sheet of paper.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.390
A positively-curved
universe, on the other hand,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.250
would be like going forward
but drawing a straight line

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.340
on a ball.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.760
And if our universe
is flat, that

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.420
means it goes on infinitely
and is forever expanding though

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.240
at a constantly-slower
rate, which

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.300
is a really amazing thing
to picture during the day,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.290
but gives me an
existential crisis

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.640
if I do it in bed at night.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.380
The really amazing thing,
BOSS isn't even done.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.956
It's got data from about
a million more galaxies

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:48.580
to map and analyze
over the next month.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.380
And based on those
results, the team

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.870
will run computer simulations
of mock universes,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.810
and tweak their findings, and
then do it all over again,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.030
looking for changes that
will help them even more

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.620
accurately measure just
how quickly our universe is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.750
expanding and
helping them to fill

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.490
in more holes in our map of it.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.050
This is huge, literally,
because it is the universe,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.470
but also in terms
of understanding

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.190
how the universe works.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.850
I think it broke my brain.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.730
How are you guys holding up?
