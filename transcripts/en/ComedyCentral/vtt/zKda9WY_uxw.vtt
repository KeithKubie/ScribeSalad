- So this is
my entire defense, uh,

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:08.875
is that if I were
to burn my house down,

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:13.045
I guarantee you my husband
would be in it.

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.514
There's no way I would go
to all that trouble

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:18.684
and then have nothing
to show for it.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.617
- Four years ago, my house
burned down to the ground.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.820
I lost everything, and I fell
into a depression so deep,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.289
I didn't know if I would ever
get out of it.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.458
So naturally I thought this
would be a funny story

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.327
to tell on television.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:37.196
I--before I tell this story,
though, I have to say,

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.465
there's a little bit of ongoing
legal battle,

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:43.536
so--yeah, I'm being sued by some
of the adjoining townhouses

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.806
and the entire townhouse
association,

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:49.508
so my lawyer has strongly
suggested that I begin

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:52.278
with a disclaimer, so I just
want to make it really clear:

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:57.216
I did not willingly or
negligently

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.819
burn my house down.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.321
But if I did do it, this is how
I would do it.

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.023
Um...

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.524
No, my husband wasn't home.

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.826
My husband was all the way
across the country.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.196
We live in--
in New Jersey,

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.398
and--yeah, I mean, you can make
fun of it if you want,

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.166
but let me just say this:

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.802
at least once, may--
sometimes twice a day,

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.571
I'm the hottest person
wherever I'm at.

00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:22.308
So, something to think about.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.710
[chuckles]

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.244
I've been here less than
24 hours.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.313
I feel like shit.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.914
Um...

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:30.349
So we're living in New Jersey.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.017
My husband's all the way across
the country.

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:35.087
He's performing stand-up across
the country.

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:37.056
And I'm just home alone
with my daughter

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.857
when my house burns down.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:43.229
And so this is my entire
defense, is that if I were to

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.732
burn my house down, I guarantee
you my husband would be in it.

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.267
[laughter]

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.269
There's no way I would go to all
that trouble

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.772
and then have nothing to show
for it.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.607
You know what I mean?

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:58.177
So it's just my dau--I would
never endanger my daughter.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.946
She's my world.
She's my everything.

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.247
She's, like, five or eight or
something like that.

00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:05.451
And--no, I love her so much
on the weekends.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.886
Um...

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.188
No, if something bad,
I mean, happened,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.290
I--I would just--
I would really miss her

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.359
around the big holidays.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.628
So...

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.964
So my daughter and I are home.

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:21.267
At that time, she was about four
years old,

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:25.905
and it was about 10:00 at night,
and I put in a movie for her.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:28.241
I know, if you're a parent,
you're judging me right now.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.875
It's like, isn't
that a little late

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:31.744
for a four-year-old to start
watching a movie?

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.812
It's like,
we stayed up late,

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:36.148
you know, then we slept in,
we got up late--

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:39.151
'cause at that time, my--
my daughter did not have a job.

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.086
Um...

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.289
So--let me just say this too.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.091
We'd been smelling smoke since
about 4:00 that afternoon

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.060
until about three weeks
after the fire.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.063
Uh, it really gets in.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.964
Uh, it's pervasive.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:54.433
So, I just--what am I gonna do?

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.335
I just was like, okay, fine.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:57.669
I put in her movie.

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.806
"The Little Mermaid,"
which she loves.

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.741
She's seen that movie so much.
She's seen that--

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.509
she's watched that movie
more times

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.844
than the guy who edited it.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:09.415
And then I, next to her, uh,

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.917
on the bed, was--

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.318
this is the most embarrassing
part of the story.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:15.788
I was doing tarot cards.
I'm not into that.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.523
I'm not into the occult or
anything.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.325
I'm not--like, I've--I'm
just--I'm a normal person.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.860
Like, I've only done, like,
maybe, like,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.463
two vision boards in my life.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.698
Like, I'm not that kind of
person.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.034
But, you know, as a parent--
parenting is, like,

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.536
very rewarding in small doses,
and then there's

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.272
like, long stretches of
"The Little Mermaid."

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:37.543
So, I was just totally
focused on my future,

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:40.446
and then my daughter was like,
"Mommy, look."

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:44.216
And the patio
windows in my bedroom

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:46.719
were just completely
awash in flames.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.120
They were--it was so bright.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.622
It was crazy that I didn't
notice it,

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:54.193
'cause I was, like, so focused
on my future.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:57.997
Not my immediate future,
but I was like,

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:59.197
looking ahead.

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:00.833
The thing--I know it's ironic.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:04.503
Like, I'm looking at tarot cards
while my house is burning

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:07.539
to the ground, but to be fair,
you know, there's no, like,

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.375
"Hey, look to your left" card.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.311
So my daughter was like, "Hey,
we got to get out of here."

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:16.315
And I was like,
oh, you're bossy.

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:20.019
And then I grab my phone,
I run out.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.253
You know, at some point I
checked to see

00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:22.822
if my daughter
was with me--she was--

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.591
and as we're leaving,

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.827
we see my neighbor

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.661
walking up the steps
to go to her unit,

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:32.431
but she's moving at a really--
like, she's moving so slow--

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.600
like she just ate
a handful of valiums.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.770
She's just, like, moving up, uh,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.939
going up to her unit,
and I go, hey, there's a fire.

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.541
She goes, "Yeah, I know.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:44.243
I just called 911."

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.745
I was like, great,
have fun up there.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.781
Um...

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:52.418
So, spoiler alert,
she makes it.

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:58.257
Um, she's one of the people
suing me.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.426
But, um, she--the--
her cats.

00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:04.596
Uh, she had two cats.
They didn't make it.

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:08.134
[sighs]
Hey, I would've moved quicker

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:10.135
if I was her--
is that my fault?

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:12.804
That she was like...[groaning].

00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:14.640
You know, let's get a move on.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.308
Um...

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:18.478
So, I do feel bad--I mean,
I felt about it, you know.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.246
I'm--I'm a vegetarian.
I get it.

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.814
I mean, I would never eat
cats anyway,

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:24.149
but I mean, you know,
you care.

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:28.220
So, I call my husband, and he
was about to go onstage,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.889
and I was like, oh, my God, so
I freaked out, and then

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.790
he freaked out, and then he
realized there was nothing

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.994
he could do, so he was like,
"Well, I mean, I'm--got to--

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.795
I'm gonna go do my show."

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:41.600
Because that's how messed up
comedians are.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.770
They'll just go on, you know,
just--

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.638
something bad happens, you just
go do your show anyway.

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:49.075
You just go make people--like,
I--I had a miscarriage

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.677
right before this, and I just
compartmentalized.

00:06:52.677 --> 00:06:55.614
I said, no, you go out there.

00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:58.184
You deal with that later.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:01.520
These people want to laugh.
So, I do that for you.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.621
- Thank you.

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:05.324
- You're welcome, and...

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:10.028
So, anyway--so, okay, so,
uh, then--

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:12.498
oh, it was a five-alarm fire,
which means

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:15.168
there was five different
fire, uh,

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:18.871
units--stations--whatever--
houses were there--

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.606
which, I didn't know that's what
"Five alarm" meant.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:23.209
I just always thought it was
a level of spiciness.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:26.111
Um, so that was an interesting
thing to learn.

00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:27.813
And then we're standing
across the street,

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:30.316
and we're just watching our
house burn down to the ground,

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:32.184
and then my daughter,
suddenly it dawns on her.

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:35.220
She's like, "Are my stuffed
animals gonna make it?"

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.122
And I was like,
no, honey, they're not.

00:07:37.122 --> 00:07:39.224
And she just started
bawling so hard.

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.893
I felt--it was heartbreaking,
so I said,

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:43.195
I--I'll get you any...time--

00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:44.630
we'll replace those
stuffed animals.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.131
Any time you want
a stuffed animal,

00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:48.033
I will get you a stuffed animal.

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:49.635
And then, cut to four years
later, we have

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:53.339
what can only be described as
a stuffed animal problem.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.976
So then, after the house
burned down,

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.211
the detective came out.

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:03.516
There was a guy who watched too
much "Law &amp; Order,"

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.851
you know, came over and started
question--I mean,

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:07.820
I guess we've all watched too
much "Law &amp; Order."

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.255
I guess that's what unifies us
as humans.

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:12.758
You know, we've just all seen
too many "Law &amp; Orders,"

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:16.228
but he was, like, really into
it, and so then he

00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:18.063
interrogated me for a while, and
I was like,

00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:21.333
hey, back off, Stabler.

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.868
You're getting a little
excited.

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:25.938
And then I guess his working
theory was that I'd been

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:29.274
smoking pot on my balcony,

00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:32.344
'cause I guess the tarot cards--

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:36.348
people are like, "Why else would
you do tarot cards?"

00:08:36.348 --> 00:08:38.050
So he thought I was on my
balcony smoking pot,

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.085
and then I just said to him,

00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:42.288
You know how hard it is to keep
a joint lit?

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:44.557
And then he was like,
"Oh, right."

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.792
And so then I just--
I just got to go.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:50.262
And they were like, "Okay,
that's that, I guess."

00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:52.531
So--but then I called my
husband, and I was like,

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:55.067
"Well, you know, we've lost
everything.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.935
It's--it's over."

00:08:56.935 --> 00:09:00.272
And my husband was at the
airport at this time, you know.

00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:01.974
He'd finished his show and
everything.

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:05.644
And he said to me, "I just had
the best show I've ever had."

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:07.580
[laughter]

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.815
So that was good.
Some good came out of it.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.484
And, uh, we didn't actually
lose everything.

00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:15.254
Uh, they just only recovered

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.423
the "Little Mermaid" DVD.

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:19.325
So, thank God
we still have that.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.794
You guys have been a lot of fun.
Thank you very much.
