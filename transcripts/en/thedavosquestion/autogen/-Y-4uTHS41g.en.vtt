Hi my name is Sachin Duggal and I am the Chief
Executive and President of a company called

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.960
[inaudible] and one of the technology pioneers
in 2009. So role models are very important

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.960
because ultimately the create and element
of [inaudible] society at large and in the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.630
Middle East you have people that are disruptive,
but positive disruption and I think a good

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.119
example is [inaudible] who ultimately is going
to have the best role models Middle East region

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.610
has. Someone that has that sort of passions
but also that sort of outward thinking in

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.630
terms of what she's doing for education both
for children and especially for young girls.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.590
Role models also create idols for the younger
generation of people to look up to and ultimately

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:53.059
people they want to be like. That's very important
in an economy that's growing as fast and is

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.980
as diverse as the Middle East is and so ultimately
the role model mechanism as such allows people,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.579
number one, to move forward in a direction
where they have someone to look to; number

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.470
two, try an attribute or copy some of the
attributes of the role model, and then finally

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.470
you'll see new generations of role models
coming out because ultimately great leaders

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.640
are ones that have followed others in the
past.
