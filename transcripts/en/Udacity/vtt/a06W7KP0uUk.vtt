00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.860
I hinted earlier in the lesson about architectural description languages. These

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.590
are, as it sounds, notations for describing architectures. They provide an extra

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.990
modicum of formality and precision, that goes beyond just having a diagram.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.718
Moreover, by having that extra precision, it then enables some tool support. For

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:25.990
example, building to diagram the tool. Diagram a solution in such a way,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.360
that the diagramming tool can check for whether you've done things well.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.980
Analyzers, okay, for determining the structural properties and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.060
behavioral properties of your system. And even simulators.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.470
I've listed here some of the popular architectural description languages.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.090
The one that we'll be looking at a little bit later is called Acme.
