00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.960
That’s me. Sana. Making chai for a bunch of people.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.140
And those, are the bunch of people.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.400
For as long as I can remember, chai has been an inseparable part of my life.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.740
I was born in Pakistan but was a super cute baby when my family left the country for the United States.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.760
And while we held onto a lot of cultural traditions,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.560
it’s been chai that probably became the strongest link between my everyday here and my roots.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.960
And I think that’s because chai is such a mundane part of life in South Asia - unlike wedding celebrations -

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.200
that having something so everyday from your roots, that’s a routine, makes the connection to your heritage

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.540
..a little more real.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.820
Even though I low-key admit that I’ve never been a huge chai drinker on my own.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.040
Hey guys, I’m sana and welcome to my chai night where I’m gonna talk to some friends about their love of chai

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.840
and how while it is something that connects us to our roots,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.420
it has a really complicated history and kinda makes for a complicated relationship.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.120
Hint: colonialism.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.560
So, every so often I hold chai nights at my place.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.000
And I’m holding one tonight with a bunch of friends who I just wanted to talk about what tea means to them

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.900
and why they drink it and also about their own habits.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.380
Tea for me means having guests over.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.920
Chai reminds me of my mom.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.640
Chai is culture.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.060
Tea means comfort.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.360
I don’t want to say it’s a replacement for bars or things like that but it serves a similar function

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.500
where it’s just something to do.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.800
Typically in Algerian culture, we actually drink a lot of coffee.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.300
So tea was always like a sense of comfort and also for guests.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.320
One of the things in the immigrant experience, at least for my parents, was that they were able to hold on to their identity.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.600
And I really believe that with every cup of chai that we’ve had in our house we retain that culture.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.600
And before you go “but Sana, how is tea relevant to my life???” or you go

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.620
“yes Sana, spill the literal tea!!” - here’s a  super quick rundown of how big tea is in the United States.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.060
While Americans love coffee - thanks Boston tea party for stigmatizing tea - Americans actually drink a LOT of tea.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.500
According to the Tea Association of the USA, 80% of American households have tea.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.280
And almost 160 million Americans are drinking tea, in some form (mostly black), on any given day.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.360
And the United States, by the way, is the third largest importer of tea in the world.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.440
Meaning, it's not some fringe culture - it's part of the mainstream.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.560
But what does tea mean to those of us who are immigrants or are in the diaspora?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.880
Is it just a hot drink or something more?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.940
Chai is hospitality. Chai is taking care of people. That’s what it’s always been in our family.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.420
It’s having people come over, everybody always wants chai and that’s kind of how it started for us

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.180
and that’s kind of how it’s become for me as well.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.620
When people think about tea they always associate

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:09.400
it with chai and I’m from Indonesia and usually tea doesn’t come with milk. We use a lot of jasmine tea.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.300
My mom also taught me how to make chai.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.960
And when I look back now, it means a lot to me just because I never knew my grandparents,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.040
I never knew my aunts when I was younger or my uncles. And just thinking about the fact

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.680
that, you know, there’s some family tie there in the way they’ve learned the recipe, it kind of makes me feel like I’m connected to my family in that way.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.840
It’s the national drink of Egypt. I know lots of relatives of mine don't actually drink water.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.420
So, when I ask them what they drink when they're thirsty, they say ‘we drink tea’.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.140
The way I consume tea, I mean, my parents would be so upset to see.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.960
I'm just using teabags; I don’t have the tea set up with the samovar with the piece on top

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.540
where you have the strong tea brewing.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.860
Obviously a connection with my mother; she’s a serial chai drinker.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.900
She needs to have her three cups a day. If she doesn’t have one cup, then the world is ending.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.580
I actually don’t really drink that much chai, but I always make chai for everyone.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.340
And for me, personally, when I smell chai, when I see it, when I make it - I'm reminded of my parents and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.060
their inability to function in the morning, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon or night, without it.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.920
And it’s this incredibly ordinary ritual that I can either keep super low-key by microwaving a bag of Lipton

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.780
in a cup and adding some milk or going all out and boiling a big cauldron of chai with cardamom and cinnamon.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:32.880
But tea isn’t without a history that could complicate the way that a lot of us, especially from South Asia, relate tea or chai to our roots.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.100
Now while it originates from China, tea is, kinda, the result of empires clashing.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.420
For a lot of societies in the world, tea is the result of colonialism.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.200
And for that, I’m gonna throw it to Graham Cornwell, a PhD candidate at Georgetown, who talks a bit about tea and politics.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.620
Tea is the product of colonialism and empire, but not just the British Empire.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.440
It's actually sort of the product of imperial rivalries.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.920
Dutch, British, Portuguese rivalries over access to tea.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.580
For South Asians like me, our tea habits are actually rooted in the British colonial experience.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.460
The British had developed a habit for tea - especially very sweet tea - in the mid-19th century but they couldn’t break China’s monopoly on tea cultivation.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:22.120
Until they did, by taking tea to India and using what they referred to as the 'jewel in the crown of the British Empire' to cultivate tea.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.260
They do this primarily for economic reasons, the taste, sort of the appetite, the thirst, I guess

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.220
for tea in Britain is such that they need to find ways to cultivate it more cheaply and in larger quantities.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.680
But even then tea, or chai as some of us call it in South Asia, didn’t really become popular until much later.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.120
In fact, for the longest time, chai was the drink of the elite.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.160
And in India, that meant those with close connections to the British Empire itself.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.440
And it’s only after the partition of India and Pakistan, so mid-20th century, that chai becomes something

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.500
that even the everyday man or woman can drink.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.500
And that’s because of how British-led  tea production in the Empire, especially South Asia, evolved.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.960
You have developments in transportation and the opening of the Suez Canal.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.100
Things that sort of make commerce easier for many parts of the world.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.880
And then, of course, the British tea plantations in India expand tea production in the world.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.520
And so there's  simply more to go around and this drives the price down over time.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.380
As it becomes cheaper, more people try it.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.300
So, how do my friends here feel, knowing that one of their most cherished daily rituals is actually

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.300
the byproduct of empire and colonialism?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.240
I don’t think it’s taken away anything from what chai means to me, in itself, though.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.720
Chai always has been chai to us. It’s never been chai tea, it’s never been chai latte, it’s just been chai. Right?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:52.400
Being an Algerian I’ve always seen, like the way that we make tea is with mint, and I’ve always seen it as being a Maghreb thing.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.080
Maghreb meaning Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.760
I think so much of what we consume are these kind of hybrid products of this post-colonial world we live in.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.460
So, what would Italian food be without tomatoes which are a new world fruit.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:19.100
What would thinking about chai with milk or Bánh mì - all of these things that are now every day practices for people.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.040
I think you get into kind of tricky territory when you want to seperate out

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.240
what’s authentic and what’s a kind of colonial construction.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.600
All history is complicated.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.760
But at least the complicated and sometimes uncomfortable history behind this cup of chai,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.480
gave us something to come together over.
