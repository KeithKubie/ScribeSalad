As you've seen in this lesson,
there are a lot of interesting facets

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.600
to accessibility worth considering
when you're building your app.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.160
We saw in the second lesson that a well
laid out focus strategy is extremely

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.875
important, but without focus styling,
that effort goes completely to waste.

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:18.075
We also learned previously that semantic
markup is critical to assistive

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:19.605
technology users.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.115
And with styling keyed off
of semantic properties,

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.675
we can ensure a consistent
experience for all of our users.

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:29.595
Ensuring all text meets a minimum color
contrast ratio is an easy way to improve

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.815
readability for everyone,

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:34.400
particularly those users with
any kind of vision impairment.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.330
And responsive design benefits
all mobile device users

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.580
as well as users who
employ browsers' zoom.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.100
So keeping all of that in mind means our
final product is going to reach more

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.260
users, and those users are just going to
have a better time using our app.
