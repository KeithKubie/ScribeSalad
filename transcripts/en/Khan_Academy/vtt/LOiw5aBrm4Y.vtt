00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:01.947
Voiceover: What I want
to do is this video,

00:00:01.947 --> 00:00:04.486
is dig a little bit
deeper into the deficit.

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:06.344
Just so that you can
get the data yourself,

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.066
they're all available at this document

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.476
which is hosted by the
Department of Treasury

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:14.140
so you know that I'm not
making up these numbers.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.744
Just to review, the
deficit is really a measure

00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:19.627
of how much you are
overspending in any given year.

00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:24.067
If you look at the deficit, and I'm
going to focus on 2010 in this video,

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:27.800
in 2010, the government spent,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.270
so the spending for
the government in 2010,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.951
was about $3.5 to $3.6 trillion dollars,

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.758
and it brought in in mainly tax revenues,

00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:39.936
but it has a few other sources,

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:44.545
but mainly tax revenues, it brought
in about $2.2 trillion dollars.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.668
Based on this the overspending,

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:52.607
or the amount of spending beyond
the revenues, or the deficit,

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:57.604
the deficit in 2010 was
$1.3 trillion dollars.

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.341
What I want to be clear on,
this is only one way to account

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:02.884
for spending versus revenues.

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:04.289
This is not the way that most

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.935
companies would primarily
report their own income

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.403
over the course of the
year, or their own cost,

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.208
or their own loss over
the course of the year.

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:15.850
Most companies would not just have
to account for their cash outlays.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.441
That's all we're considering in
this $3.5 to $3.6 trillion dollars.

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.695
A traditional company would
also have to include any other

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.478
liabilities or any other
obligations they're taking on.

00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:28.772
For example, if I hire you and I promise

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.072
to pay you $50,000 over the
course of the next year,

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:33.869
and I'm going to pay them to you in cash,

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.694
but I also promise that when you retire,

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:39.022
I'm going to pay you $10,000.

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:42.441
I'm going to give you a
$10,000 per year pension.

00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.944
On a traditional income statement,

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:46.941
I would not just expense the $50,000.

00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:49.704
I would definitely put
that in my expenses,

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:51.759
and the government would
put that in their expenses,

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.353
but I would also have to account

00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:54.542
for this liability that I'm taking on.

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:55.400
I would also have to say,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.537
"Look, in order for me to
be able to afford a $10,000

00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:01.734
"pension at some future date,
I have to make some estimates

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:04.072
"about when you would retire
and how long you would live,

00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:06.938
"and what interest I could get
on money, and all of the rest."

00:02:06.938 --> 00:02:09.707
But I would have to say I would have
to set aside some amount of money

00:02:09.707 --> 00:02:12.656
so that in the future I
can meet that obligation.

00:02:12.656 --> 00:02:16.126
Maybe I have to set
aside $2,000 this year,

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.318
and hope it grows properly over the course

00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:20.458
of the next 20-30 years until you retire

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:23.085
so that I can afford to pay you that much.

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:25.049
Who knows? But I would
also have to account

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.118
for it right here, that extra liability.

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:28.547
The government, in the
calculation of the deficit,

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:32.038
does not account for that extra liability.

00:02:32.038 --> 00:02:33.998
It is taking on other liabilities.

00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:37.026
It is making these pension
promises to government employees.

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:39.626
It has obligations to the veterans

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.586
and Veteran's Affairs and all of that.

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:45.467
That is not accounted for in the deficit.

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:49.266
It is accounted for in the gross costs.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:53.040
You see here, we said when
we look at just the budget,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.700
we're talking $3.5 to
$3.6 trillion dollars.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.514
That's direct cash outlays,
or mostly direct cash outlays.

00:02:59.397 --> 00:03:02.602
If you include all of this other stuff,

00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:09.588
then it balloons to $4.5 trillion
dollars, $4.5 trillion dollars.

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:11.158
In a previous video I mentioned

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.664
that the government right now

00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:14.332
for every dollar that it's spending,

00:03:14.332 --> 00:03:17.255
it has to borrow 40 cents of that dollar.

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:21.079
If you really think about the
total obligations that it has,

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.128
and the total obligations
being $4.5 trillion took on,

00:03:24.128 --> 00:03:27.081
viewed that way it only
has about half of that.

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:29.594
It only has about half of
that coming in in revenue.

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:31.596
So every dollar in revenue
the government is taking

00:03:31.596 --> 00:03:34.500
on an equal amount of
obligations that year.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.450
Some of that is going to express
itself in terms of increased debt,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.865
and some of that is just going to
show up as increased obligations.

00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:43.188
You can see both of those
things are increasing

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:45.092
year after year after year,

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.757
and depending on who you talk to

00:03:46.757 --> 00:03:48.122
which side of the political spectrum,

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:49.859
some people will blame it on Bush.

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.998
They'll say, "Look at this." The
spending increased under Obama,

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:55.254
which someone on the right would say.

00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:56.325
But then someone on the left would say,

00:03:56.325 --> 00:03:57.519
"Yes, but the spending increased

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.183
"because we have to do
all of these bailouts.

00:03:59.183 --> 00:04:04.112
"The economy started to
tank at the end of 2008.

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:06.164
"We have to do all of
these emergency things."

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:09.328
As soon as the economy tanks,
you automatically, the deficit

00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:12.522
position gets worse because
you bring in less revenue.

00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:13.922
Not only do you bring in less revenue

00:04:13.922 --> 00:04:16.496
because corporate profits are
down, fewer people are employed,

00:04:16.496 --> 00:04:19.947
people start earning less, but
you also have higher expenses

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:23.490
because all of these automatic
obligations kick into effect;

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.996
unemployment benefits, Social
Security benefits, Medicare benefits.

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:29.185
Those increase so deficits
naturally get worse,

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.116
but the whole point here
is to say regardless

00:04:31.116 --> 00:04:33.250
of what party you're on,
things are getting worse,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.248
and they don't seem to be getting better.

00:04:35.248 --> 00:04:37.778
Generally, you'll always
see this net operating cost,

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.287
sometimes the net operating
costs will look lower

00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:42.532
than the actual deficit
like it did in 2008.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.782
That's because there would
be some type of actuarial

00:04:44.782 --> 00:04:48.290
or accounting reestimate
of the future obligations

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.053
maybe the pension obligations or whatever.

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:51.542
But in most years, we're taking on more

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:53.999
obligations than just our cash outlays.

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.117
That's why you see the
operating costs so much higher

00:04:57.117 --> 00:05:00.970
than just the pure
deficit right over here.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.361
This chart right over here actually goes

00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:06.112
into what the difference
is, the actual difference.

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:08.451
You see that it's mainly
things like liabilities

00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:12.138
for veteran's compensation, military
and civilian employee benefits,

00:05:12.138 --> 00:05:13.941
government sponsored enterprises.

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:16.057
There is some downward
revision of the TARP.

00:05:16.057 --> 00:05:18.304
I don't think you can see that.

00:05:18.304 --> 00:05:20.162
All of a sudden you realize
that the TARP is going

00:05:20.162 --> 00:05:22.645
to cost us more in the future than
you thought it was going to be.

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:25.388
Even though you don't spend
that $86 billion this year,

00:05:25.388 --> 00:05:28.655
you realize that you have an
$86 billion higher obligation.

00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:32.321
If you add all of these, or I
guess you subtract all of these

00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.123
from the budget deficit, then you're going

00:05:34.123 --> 00:05:37.608
to get the net operating costs.

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:40.248
You might already find that depressing,

00:05:40.248 --> 00:05:41.983
but the point of this video is actually,

00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:46.314
that's just the beginning, because
if you look at where we're going,

00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:48.983
the trajectory, it gets
even more depressing

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:51.694
because not only do we have
this huge budget deficit,

00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:54.858
or this huge operating cost,

00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:58.883
this loss I guess you could
say on an annual basis,

00:05:58.883 --> 00:06:00.775
but it's going to get worse
and it's going to get worse

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:03.246
not just from the overspending,
not just from the overspending

00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:05.449
on the government programs,
and defense and all of that,

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.393
but because our debt is increasing
so much that the interest,

00:06:09.393 --> 00:06:11.990
the amount we spend on interest
is only going to increase.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.197
That just makes matters worse.

00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:15.660
The more you spend on interest,
the larger your deficits.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.341
The larger your deficits,
the more you have to borrow,

00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:20.160
the more you have to spend on interest.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.493
This is a long time line right
here. It goes out to 2080,

00:06:23.493 --> 00:06:26.341
but it's pretty clear that something,
something is going to give.

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:30.458
As a percentage of GDP, the government,

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:32.215
the size of the government
has historically been

00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:34.662
around this depending on
different periods in history,

00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:37.412
but in the recent past
it's been in the 20% range.

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:39.579
If you just let things go
the way they're going to go,

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:41.408
and a lot of these are
kind of mandatory spending,

00:06:41.408 --> 00:06:43.003
things we've already
obligated ourselves to,

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:44.963
or what we think we've
obligated ourselves to,

00:06:44.963 --> 00:06:47.402
it looks like the size of
the government is really

00:06:47.402 --> 00:06:48.737
just going to take over the economy.

00:06:48.737 --> 00:06:51.067
It's going to grow over
the next 20-30 years

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:55.650
to 30%, 35%, 40% of the entire economy.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.071
If that by itself is not scary
or depressing enough for you,

00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:04.304
then we just have to look at
this chart right over here.

00:07:04.304 --> 00:07:06.343
We've already gone over
some of this chart.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.944
This is the gross costs. This is
the total amount we're spending,

00:07:09.944 --> 00:07:13.405
outlays, cash outlays and other
obligations we're taking on,

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:15.857
and accounting for it in
some way in the present.

00:07:15.857 --> 00:07:17.940
Then you have the taxes
that you're bringing in,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.455
and you see that this
is your net operating

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:21.205
cost that we calculated already.

00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:23.668
Then it shows your assets,
the assets of the government,

00:07:23.668 --> 00:07:25.733
mainly buildings and land
and things like that.

00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:28.079
The government has a lot
of nice land and buildings.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:31.202
Then you also see property, plant
and equipment, and all of that;

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:33.137
aircraft carriers,
whatever you want to throw

00:07:33.137 --> 00:07:35.809
into the mix right over here.

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:39.061
Then you see the debt and there's
been a lot of talk of the debt,

00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:40.478
but you might be saying,
"Wait. Even in 2010,

00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:44.274
"right now as we hit the debt
ceiling we have $14.3 trillion,

00:07:44.274 --> 00:07:47.871
"but didn't we have like $13.
something trillion in debt in 2010?

00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:49.673
"Why does this only say $9 trillion?"

00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:52.668
That's because we had
another $4 trillion in debt

00:07:52.668 --> 00:07:54.864
that is not held by the public.

00:07:54.864 --> 00:07:56.640
This is just debt held by the public.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.684
The public includes things
like foreign governments,

00:07:58.684 --> 00:08:01.133
but there's another $4
trillion that is held

00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:04.218
by the government itself so
that is not accounted for.

00:08:04.218 --> 00:08:06.782
That $4 trillion is mainly excess funds

00:08:06.782 --> 00:08:09.740
from the Social Security Trust that
are all invested in treasuries,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.539
but the government, at the
end of the day, is responsible

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:13.547
for the Social Security Trust.

00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:16.001
So it is not accounted
for right over here.

00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:17.597
You have $9 trillion there.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:20.144
You have another $6 trillion
that is seldom talked about

00:08:20.144 --> 00:08:23.797
which is benefits for federal
employees and veterans.

00:08:23.797 --> 00:08:26.399
That's right over here,
so huge obligation.

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:29.803
A total of $16 trillion in liabilities.

00:08:29.803 --> 00:08:31.736
If that by itself
doesn't scare you enough,

00:08:31.736 --> 00:08:33.131
or doesn't depress you enough,

00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:35.964
we just have to go down a
few lines on the statement,

00:08:35.964 --> 00:08:38.065
and you'll see something that does.

00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:41.069
This right here is the
expected, or the present value

00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:45.508
of the obligations for social insurance.

00:08:45.508 --> 00:08:47.628
The way that they talk
about social insurance,

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:50.880
it's both social security
and things like Medicare.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.825
These things that we've
promised we would pay to people

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.395
in the future at least
that we've told people

00:08:56.395 --> 00:08:58.269
that we will pay them in the future.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:59.939
The present value, and
the easiest way to think

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.739
about present value, and
I've done videos that go

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:03.128
into a little bit more depth on that is

00:09:03.128 --> 00:09:04.859
how much money given some assumptions,

00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:06.533
if you assume that if I put money aside,

00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:08.326
and that money grows at some rate,

00:09:08.326 --> 00:09:10.643
how much money would I have to put aside

00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:12.876
in order to fund those obligations?

00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:16.408
This value is over the next 75 years,

00:09:16.408 --> 00:09:17.671
and I want to make it clear.

00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:19.148
You might say, "Oh, 75 years, of course,

00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:20.202
"that's going to be a huge number."

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:23.087
But remember, we're assuming
that we can grow money.

00:09:23.087 --> 00:09:25.539
We're assuming that
obligations that are 75 years

00:09:25.539 --> 00:09:29.041
from now that if i have to pay
someone $10 75 years from now,

00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:30.870
I don't have to put $10 aside.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.476
I might only have to put
50 cents or a dollar aside

00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:36.835
and assume that that 50 cents or
dollar will grow by some percentage

00:09:36.835 --> 00:09:41.750
so that by the time 75 years go
by, I'll actually have that $10.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.668
This is actually a discounted value.
This is assuming that the money

00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:48.086
that you could set aside today

00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:50.114
that the obligation
today, that it would grow

00:09:50.114 --> 00:09:53.082
to actually fulfill the actual
amount that you have to pay.

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:56.994
This should scare you.
These are huge numbers.

00:09:56.994 --> 00:10:00.574
This close group are what they
call the current participants.

00:10:00.574 --> 00:10:01.889
We could read the footnotes.

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:03.587
Includes current participants receiving

00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:05.916
and/or are eligible to receive
benefits for the Social Security

00:10:05.916 --> 00:10:08.650
and Medicare programs ages 15 and over

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.999
at the start of the 75
year projection period.

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:15.050
That's $43 trillion. Then open group.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.648
They have current and future participants.

00:10:16.648 --> 00:10:18.469
This is slightly lower
because it's including

00:10:18.469 --> 00:10:20.658
people who are going to be
paying into the program,

00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:23.115
and not necessarily
taking out of the program.

00:10:23.115 --> 00:10:26.045
but it's still a huge, huge liability.

00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:28.971
It's twice as big as
the official liabilities

00:10:28.971 --> 23:59:59.999
that the government takes on.
