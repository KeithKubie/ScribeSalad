00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.040
Thought your children were safe from SPERM?

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.660
Think again!

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:13.480
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with a heartwarming
tale about sperm, and all the ways it can

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.080
screw up your future children.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.250
You may remember a Dnews I did a while back
that talked about memories - and specifically,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.280
phobias - being passed down through our DNA.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.890
And if you thought that was terrifying - it
gets worse.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.380
A study published in this week's issue of
Nature Neuroscience finds that past trauma

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.369
can also be passed down to your children - through
sperm.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.399
It's long been known that children and grandchildren
of people who've survived traumatic events

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.870
- like abuse or war - are more likely to experience
mental illness than the rest of the population.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.750
But despite hundreds of studies, there are
still no known genes responsible for depression

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.690
and borderline personality disorder.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.750
According to this study, people who experience
early childhood trauma often exhibit a number

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.520
of hormonal imbalances, including over-expression
of microRNAs, which are snippets of genetic

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.739
material that regulate gene expression.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.720
Too many of these, can cause a dip in the
production of certain proteins.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.180
Researchers exposed a group of male mice to
repeated and prolonged periods of intense

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.700
stress, thus inducing symptoms of depression.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.340
They then allowed the mice to reproduce, and
found that both the second and third generation

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.549
of offspring - showed the same symptoms of
trauma, despite never having experienced it

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.549
themselves.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.170
Perhaps more interesting, the researchers
found that, like their parents', the sperm

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.439
of the second generation offspring also exhibited
abnormally high numbers of microRNAs.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.439
However, the third generation did not - even
though maladaptive behaviors were clearly

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.439
present.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.290
"It's possible," researchers say, "that the
alteration is transferred into another non-genetic

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.550
mark" before it hits the third generation
- but the overall results of the study, demonstrate

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.520
just how sensitive reproductive cells are
to early environmental conditions.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.960
So, maybe something to consider if you plan
on having children.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.960
Just a thought.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.320
As always, if you have questions about this
study - there are links in the description

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.399
with more info.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.760
Below that, is a comment box - for all your
sperm-related discussion.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.250
Anyhoo.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.250
Fascinating stuff.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:18.049
