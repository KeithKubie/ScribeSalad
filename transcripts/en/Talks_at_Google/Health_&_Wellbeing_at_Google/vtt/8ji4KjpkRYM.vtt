[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.730
WENDY JUDSON: Thank you, Dr.
Shirazi, for coming in today,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.500
and I'm excited to be moderating
this discussion with you.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.750
DAVE SHIRAZI: I'm so
grateful to be here.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.020
WENDY JUDSON: It is about sleep
hygiene, and that is important.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.770
Today, however, our focus
is on sleep disorders

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.200
and interventions that
can be made which are

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.110
gentle and minimally invasive.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.830
So my first question
for Dr. Shirazi

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.070
is, based on all of
these credentials,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.800
I'm especially interested
in your Traditional Oriental

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.280
Medicine degree and also
the Spiritual Psychology

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.993
and just to find out how that
informs your practice today.

00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:46.160
DAVE SHIRAZI: Oh, thank you.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.240
Great question.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.220
So the dental
component allows me

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.940
to treat things in a functional
way with oral appliances.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.780
But of course, we're not
just structural beings.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.990
We're energetic beings.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.520
We're emotional beings.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.990
We're spiritual beings.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.850
So when I apply acupuncture
and the philosophies

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.860
of Chinese medicine for people
with just straight insomnia,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.030
it seems to be a great adjunct
when treating their snoring

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.538
or sleep apnea problem.

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:17.830
WENDY JUDSON: Very interesting.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.970
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.720
WENDY JUDSON: So I
wanted to just give you

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.290
an overview of what Dr. Shirazi
is going to discuss today.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.650
And it includes snoring
and sleep apnea,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.270
especially obstructive
sleep apnea,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.050
which is more
common than I knew.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.110
I've been learning a great
deal just discussing this talk

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.820
with Dr. Shirazi.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.740
Also related are migraines and
headaches, bruxism, or teeth

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.810
grinding, jaw clenching, and
the resulting craniofacial pain,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.160
or TMJ pain.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.780
So what is sleep?

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.138
Do you want to give us
a little lesson here?

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:00.930
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.160
So it's a state of consciousness
that every mammal needs.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.500
It's not just that every mammal
has, but every mammal needs.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.510
We say it's absent
from consciousness,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.500
even though there is
mental activity being done.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.740
It's a way for our
physical bodies

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.680
to actually shut
down and rejuvenate.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.570
And in fact, the
only time we ever

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.350
get growth hormone is during
one specific stage of sleep

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.090
called delta.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.930
And it's a time for mental
and emotional repair

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.750
and processing, including
memory, which happens

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.150
predominantly in REM sleep.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.960
WENDY JUDSON: And moving
on, why, again, do we sleep?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
What does it do for us?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.260
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.000
So those are the main things.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.930
It restores our physical,
mental, and physiological

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.790
well-being.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.760
And I was just thinking
about this the other day,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.460
about how evolution deemed
that being vulnerable for eight

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.140
or more hours in the
dark every single day

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.570
is so necessary that
we would even still

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.240
have that while still
being vulnerable to attack.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.750
So that tells me,
evolutionarily speaking,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.300
that sleep must be absolutely
essential, that over the years

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.150
we could not think of
a better way of getting

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.370
our mental, emotional rest
and our physical rest.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.540
WENDY JUDSON: Yeah, so
this is really a need.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.050
And I just want to plug a
book that I read, or listened

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.840
to-- because I only do audio
books-- called "Why We Sleep,"

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.360
and it goes into
this a lot more.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.210
Why would we voluntarily
choose to make

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.810
ourselves this vulnerable for
such a long period of time?

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.430
You'll be fascinated,
and it'll--

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.805
DAVE SHIRAZI: It
is a great book.

00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:52.500
WENDY JUDSON: --change the
way you think about sleep.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.290
This is a map of sleep
deprivation published in a 2015

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.620
study in "Sleep Health."

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.020
What was surprising
to me is I expected

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.550
to see a lot of the dark
areas in urban centers.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.520
And that's not
what we necessarily

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.140
see across this map.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.380
Can you speak a little
bit to what's significant?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.380
DAVE SHIRAZI: I'll do my best,
because it's one metric, sleep

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.100
deprivation.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.470
Of course, there can
be a number of reasons

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.030
why we're sleep deprived.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.850
But the occupation,
for example, that

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.730
is most susceptible
to sleep deprivation

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.570
are shift workers, people who
work at night and they get--

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.972
and they're sleeping
when it's light outside,

00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:37.680
and they're awake when
it's dark outside.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.140
That's not natural,
physiologically speaking.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.910
You'll notice that
that map also overlays

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.460
over the rate of your
BMI, your obesity level.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.830
And it seems to
match it pretty well.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.070
In that whole, that
panhandle region

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.150
is where we see the most obese.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.710
And we know that obesity
can cause sleep apnea.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.650
But more often times, it takes
whatever snoring and sleep

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.080
apnea level you have
and exasperates it,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.840
which will of course deprive
your sleep even more.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.120
WENDY JUDSON: So as we go
through these slides here,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.760
we're going to see that
there's a really big connection

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.380
between weight gain and
sleep deprivation or sleep

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.588
fragmentation, even.

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:21.630
DAVE SHIRAZI: Absolutely.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.950
There is a
correlation, for sure.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.000
WENDY JUDSON: Here
are some statistics.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.920
1/3 of the US
population suffering

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.390
from sleep disorders, 75 million
individuals who are chronic

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.895
suffers, and 10%, only 10%,
have been diagnosed and treated.

00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:40.020
DAVE SHIRAZI: That's right.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.970
So three different
things to mention.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.370
So 1/3 of the population
suffers from sleep disorders.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.060
That's true.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.310
Could even be a little
bit more by the time

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.330
this study has been out.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.860
Insomnia is the number
one, sleep apnea

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.770
is number two, and then a myriad
of other neurological issues

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.020
associated with sleep.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.940
And of course, the
75 million, that's

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.790
for sure more now than before.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.030
What's interesting about
the 10% that's been treated,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.980
that's been diagnosed
with sleep apnea.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.770
Yes, it's true, 90%
haven't been diagnosed yet.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.690
But even in that little 10%
subsect, almost entirely

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.740
of that 10%, they've been
offered a CPAP for treatment.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.480
And only about 50% of it
hold, stick with the CPAP.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.680
So it's really more 95% of
the population with snoring

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.595
and sleep apnea do anything
about it or even know about it.

00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:32.970
WENDY JUDSON:
We're going to talk

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.190
about the types of sleep apnea.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.720
There are two major areas.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.600
And then as you discuss
the problems that

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.400
are associated with
this, can you also

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.910
tell us a little bit
about why our palate is

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.398
important in the treatment?

00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:52.440
DAVE SHIRAZI: Absolutely.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.610
So the most common kind of
sleep apnea, which is like, 85%,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.620
90% of all breathing disorders
in our sleep, is obstructive.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.480
So that has to do with
the way our air flows.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.310
All mammals are
supposed to breathe

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.890
in and out through
their nose exclusively,

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.060
even when exercising.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.560
Most people who are runners
will say, oh, that's impossible.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.745
But no, actually that's
what we're supposed to do.

00:07:17.745 --> 00:07:18.870
And I'm not saying I do it.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.580
I'm just saying
that's what we're

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.260
supposed to do as mammals.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.050
So the size and
width of our palate

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.290
directly correlates to
our breathing ability

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.370
through our nose.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.500
The roof of the mouth is
the floor of the nose.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.380
So if we have a
nice, wide palate,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.570
our nasal breathing
will be much more patent

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.010
and we can both inhale and
exhale much more freely.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.410
As soon as we have
a limited ability

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.577
to breathe through our
nose, be it through a cold,

00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:50.910
be it through environmental
allergies, or even some food

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.020
sensitivities, our mouth
has to dynamically change

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.920
in order to breathe, because
we need to breathe to survive.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.600
So as soon as this
starts closing up,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:07.560
our mouth opens and our mandible
rotates backwards, which

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.910
limits our ability to breathe.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.930
Does that make sense?

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.972
WENDY JUDSON: Absolutely.

00:08:10.972 --> 00:08:12.660
So basically what
you're saying is

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.460
the body is going to
find a way to breathe.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.668
DAVE SHIRAZI: No matter what.

00:08:15.668 --> 00:08:17.580
WENDY JUDSON: And
it doesn't really

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.495
matter what happens to
the alignment of the head

00:08:21.495 --> 00:08:22.988
or other parts of the face.

00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:24.030
DAVE SHIRAZI: Absolutely.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.353
As we talk about bruxism,
that'll become most evident.

00:08:26.353 --> 00:08:28.020
WENDY JUDSON: And
that's what I realize,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.840
because I definitely
have bruxism, but I said,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.100
how can that--

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.419
I mean, my mouth is closed.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.299
How can I also have sleep apnea?

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.669
So this nasal breathing
and the nasal airway

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.488
is truly important and a
source of sleep apnea, as well.

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:43.530
DAVE SHIRAZI: Absolutely.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.330
It could be causal.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.760
WENDY JUDSON: So we're
going to roll a video here

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.050
that just gives you a visual
of a person experiencing

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.910
sleep apnea.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.920
Do you want to speak
about the opening eyes?

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.670
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yes.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.540
I absolutely will.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.392
I'll talk through the
video, if that's OK.

00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:00.600
WENDY JUDSON: That's perfect.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.017
DAVE SHIRAZI: So you'll notice,
the first thing, the video

00:09:03.017 --> 00:09:05.850
hasn't started yet, but
you'll notice on his hand,

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.240
he has a home
sleep study device.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.360
I actually prefer home
sleep study devices,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.390
because it's done,
obviously, in your own bed,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.180
and we get a more realistic
response of what's going on.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:24.210
If I'm more concerned about
your legs moving or insomnia

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.800
or something more associated
with the central component,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.380
I'll want to do it in a lab.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:29.940
There it is.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.010
WENDY JUDSON: Do I
need to move forward?

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.343
DAVE SHIRAZI: So you saw that
his eyes just flicked open

00:09:33.343 --> 00:09:34.330
just a moment.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.800
So we're actually not
waking up when our eyes open

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.120
during an episode.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.520
We're actually just going
from a deeper stage of sleep

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.140
to a lighter stage of sleep.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.750
So we're supposed to breathe
in and out through our nose.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.780
In this video shows
exhaling through the mouth,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.800
but that's wrong.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.300
But when we have
an airway collapse,

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.960
the drop and oxygen
causes the brain

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.375
to tell the intercostal
muscles to just sort of do

00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:59.700
a little mini CPR and breathe.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.740
You need to breathe,
restore the airway.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.990
You see how his eyes
opened up right there?

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.610
He didn't wake up.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.180
All right?

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.580
So he could do that
400 times in a night

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.860
and not remember a single
one, because he's still

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.180
technically--

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.260
and through EEG, we
can see it happening.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.650
He's still technically asleep.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.350
And then you came up with
that wonderful query, which

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.750
was, well, if the mouth is
opening and I'm choking,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.260
how am I clenching
my teeth right?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.530
So in the studies
that we see, we

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.860
see it about half the time on
people that clench their teeth.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.640
We actually see the airflow
starting to decrease

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.210
and then we see the
masseter activity increase.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.100
And then when the
airway is restored,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.740
the masseter stopped clenching.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.260
Does that make sense?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.135
WENDY JUDSON: The masseter
is the muscle that

00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:47.800
opens and closes the mouth.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.760
DAVE SHIRAZI: Correct.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.330
Correct.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:55.510
So we can even classify it
as a reflex to breathing.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.740
And we see that about 50% of the
time as a cause of clenching.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.570
Even on the very
same patient that

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.670
clenches their teeth because
of their airway, as a response,

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.770
we'll see them clenching with no
airway disturbance whatsoever.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.900
And in that other
50%, if you will,

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.900
we put it under the category
of stress, mental stress,

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.480
emotional stress, or even
physiological stress.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.410
WENDY JUDSON: But that is
still sleep apnea then?

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.660
DAVE SHIRAZI: In that second--

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.760
WENDY JUDSON: In
the second category?

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.468
DAVE SHIRAZI: No.

00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:26.650
No, that's what I'm saying.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.390
In the absence of
an airway disorder,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.140
you can still clench
50% of the time.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.175
WENDY JUDSON: But you
can still help with that?

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:34.300
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah, we can.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.010
WENDY JUDSON:
--through the devices.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.427
DAVE SHIRAZI:
Through the devices,

00:11:36.427 --> 00:11:38.920
we can reduce your ability
to clench 50% to 100%.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.540
That's right.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.890
WENDY JUDSON: So this slide
shows us some clinical signs

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.570
of OSA, Obstructive
Sleep Apnea, and then

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.920
what are called comorbidities.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.030
I had to look that up.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.930
So can you explain
comorbidity and--

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.680
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah,
all the things that we

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.910
see overlapping, whether it's
correlational or it's causal.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.050
So the first one you see
up there is menopause.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.790
So we definitely see
differences in what

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.810
the patient's hormonal
balance is as it relates

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.200
to storing and sleep apnea.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.590
So someone with a high
testosterone content

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.590
is going to be more
predicated to having snoring

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.670
and sleep apnea.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.340
And that's why when
women go into menopause,

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.500
we see a shift in the
balance of their hormones

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.030
more into testosterone, and then
we see more apneas, typically.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.760
Hypertension, it's very common.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.760
People that have uncontrolled
hypertension, meaning they

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.250
tried one or two
or more medications

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.280
and it only puts a dent in their
blood pressure, very commonly,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.730
at least 80% of the time,
it's the apnea that's

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.920
causing the hypertension.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.130
Obesity, it goes both ways.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.010
Like I mentioned, being obese
can cause you to have snoring

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.880
and sleep apnea, but can
actually take whatever you have

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.140
and make it worse.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.830
We see that more commonly.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.420
But also, when you're getting
interrupted sleep, when

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.270
you wake up, you're more
tired, and therefore you

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.980
want to eat more.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.110
And you're not conscious
that you want to eat more.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.340
You just eat more.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.623
And that contributes to obesity,
because you're eating more

00:13:15.623 --> 00:13:16.790
calories throughout the day.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.880
WENDY JUDSON: And that's
a hormonal changes

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.380
that occurs, right?

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.350
DAVE SHIRAZI: And that's
a hormonal change, yeah,

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.058
with the ghrelin.

00:13:20.058 --> 00:13:20.860
Exactly.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.730
Morning headaches.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.010
That can go in two
different directions.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.890
If you have the kind of
headaches where you wake up

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.990
feeling kind of like
an empty head, that's

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.440
usually more from an
oxygen deprivation, I find.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.860
Tension type headaches, which
is the most common headaches

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.020
in the world,
that's predominantly

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.360
caused by clenching
your teeth and how

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.790
it pinches on the nerves
in the back of the skull.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.980
And like I said, the number
one cause of clenching

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.670
is some form of upper
airway disturbance.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.000
Type 2 diabetes.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.340
We have direct, not just
correlational, but causal

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.550
research that shows that
the inflammation that's

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:03.350
caused from sleep apnea can
lead to type 2 diabetes.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.860
And we'll actually see these
very same patients being

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.010
treated with either CPAP
or oral appliance therapy

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.862
and their blood sugar is
coming down without medication.

00:14:11.862 --> 00:14:13.570
So we know there's a
causal relationship.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.340
We don't say it's
the only cause,

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.795
but we definitely see
a causal relationship.

00:14:17.795 --> 00:14:20.170
WENDY JUDSON: So I went ahead
and skipped to this slide--

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.420
DAVE SHIRAZI: It's a good one.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.320
WENDY JUDSON: --that
shows the correlation,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.760
just since we're
discussing that.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.630
We can hop back after that.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.490
But this shows some
of the hormones

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.980
that are released or disturbed.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.100
DAVE SHIRAZI: That's right.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.610
So this slide is very
much a condensation.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.940
There is a whole physiological
cascade that's going on.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.090
But from the oxygen
deprivation, we

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.310
have the repetitive hypoxemia.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.290
You go through
moments of low oxygen.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.120
But more important to that is
that sleep fragmentation, what

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.490
we call the arousal index.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.000
It's the arousals that actually
cause the inflammation what

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.050
we're finding.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.040
So your arousals can come from
your own snoring or sleep apnea

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.480
or they can come from your bed
partner's snoring and sleep

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.980
apnea.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.450
It can come from a
noisy neighbor's dog,

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.610
from construction, from a
dog or a cat in your bed

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.490
that's constantly jostling or
they themselves are snoring.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.180
That can cause
the fragmentation.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.300
So what the
fragmentation does is

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.520
it causes the sympathetic
nerve activity.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.920
We go into fight or flight.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.050
And that causes the
cytokine release.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.630
Well, cytokine release is
just an inflammatory cascade.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.280
It could be not just cytokines.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.630
Could be interleukins.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.130
It could be C reactive protein.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.540
It could be TNF alpha.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.660
But all of those
inflammatory markers

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.790
will cause us to
become hungrier,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.970
will cause our sugar to spike,
will cause, like we said,

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.640
hypertension, can
lead to-- we now

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.300
are discovering that depression
is more an inflammatory disease

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.160
than it is anything else.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.350
WENDY JUDSON: So
really a lot of us

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.630
are walking around with a
low level of inflammation

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.890
that we're not even aware of.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.080
DAVE SHIRAZI: A high level
of inflammation and not aware

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.570
of it.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.237
And then on top of
it, this inflammation

00:16:04.237 --> 00:16:06.880
causes our blood
brain barrier to open.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.920
So now all these
inflammatory markers

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.610
and whatever you ate that day or
drank that night that you maybe

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.790
shouldn't have eaten or drank,
now has the ability to get up

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.563
into the spinal fluid.

00:16:18.563 --> 00:16:20.980
And then you have the weight
gain, the insulin resistance,

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.250
the type 2 diabetes.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.727
But then that also contributes
to more sleep apnea,

00:16:25.727 --> 00:16:27.310
because you can
either have the weight

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.680
gain from just
gain of fat or you

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.770
can have the weight gain because
you're retaining more fluid.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.830
And if you have more fluid
in your upper pharyngeal area

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.340
or your tongue, that will also
collapse your airway at night

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.620
more so.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.620
WENDY JUDSON: All right.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.710
Well, let's look at
that airway and go back

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.630
on some of these slides here.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.790
So this is some of the
points of obstruction.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.970
And then we'll look
at the machinery

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.508
that you use to
diagnose patients.

00:16:57.508 --> 00:16:58.300
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.170
So we have four points of
occlusion in obstructive sleep

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.010
apnea.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.050
We have our nasal breathing.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.910
And predominantly,
in my observation,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.970
nasal breathing has to do
with the internal nasal valves

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.000
and the turbinate space,
the adenoidal soft tissue,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.619
soft palate area, the tongue,
and the intrapharyngeal space

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:18.890
or throat.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.710
So any or all of those
can be causal or affected,

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.958
and they're all
related to each other.

00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.000
So like we talked about,
if someone can't breathe

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.583
through their nose,
they automatically

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:31.300
mouth breathe, which
shifts the position

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.180
of their tongue and their jaw.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.240
That make sense?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.830
If someone has a cold or a flu
and their tonsils and adenoids

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.830
are inflamed, there's going
to be a change as well.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.050
WENDY JUDSON: So one
obstruction can lead to another,

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:44.800
essentially.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.530
DAVE SHIRAZI: It's an
instantaneous physiological

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.820
change in order to
survive and to breathe.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.520
WENDY JUDSON: And what is this?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.340
DAVE SHIRAZI: So we just have
a CAT scan in our office.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.020
It's what called a
cone beam CAT scan.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.270
So it uses just a
fraction of the radiation

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.960
of a traditional CAT scan.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.050
It's pretty clever.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.600
Instead of a
traditional CAT scan

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.360
that has 2,000 or 3,000
microsieverts of radiation,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.730
this machine goes around
your head and neck,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.210
puts a tiny burst of radiation
as it goes throughout,

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.230
and then it extrapolates
that data into a three

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.240
dimensional rendering.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.710
That is about 60
microsieverts of radiation.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.045
And a one way flight to New
York is 100 microsieverts

00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:29.820
of radiation.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.620
So we're talking really,
really tiny levels.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.510
And then we have the
ability to then look--

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:35.830
you can go to the next slide--

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.880
to have a look at the nose
and the throat and the airway.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.800
Now, about this slide
and about why this just

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.820
gives us a picture in time.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.840
So what I'm actually
more so than the airway

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.810
in this particular slide that
you put up that I'm looking at,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.240
I'm looking at the
position of the jaw.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.740
Because I'm thinking,
if that's what

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.843
they look like when they're
wide awake and sitting up,

00:19:01.843 --> 00:19:03.760
I'm thinking, what are
they doing when they're

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.310
on their back and sleeping?

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.960
Because in this case, they're
wide awake and not sleeping.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.220
So more important
to me is what's

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.980
actually happening
in their sleep

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.770
and in their own
home environment.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.730
So that's why I like to
do home sleep studies.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.900
I like to recommend
that for my patients

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.975
so they can find out
what is going on.

00:19:22.975 --> 00:19:24.850
WENDY JUDSON: So that
would be the first step

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.530
before you get to the CAT scan?

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.230
DAVE SHIRAZI: No, we do this--

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.880
WENDY JUDSON: Or
you do this first?

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.930
DAVE SHIRAZI: We do
this on the initial

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.683
as well, just to kind of see
what we have to work with.

00:19:31.683 --> 00:19:33.100
Because some people
are just going

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.450
to be a straight surgical case.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.033
OK, we've got to
take these things out

00:19:36.033 --> 00:19:38.770
or we got to fix your nose
or whatever the case may be.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.910
And some people, if
they're very, very severe,

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.690
unfortunately CPAP, it
becomes their best option.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.820
But the vast majority
of the people

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.760
in the public that have
snoring and sleep apnea

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.180
fall under the mild
to moderate category.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.410
So they're well within a
dentist's scope of practice

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.578
to treat with oral appliances.

00:19:58.578 --> 00:19:59.870
WENDY JUDSON: That's good news.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.350
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.260
We just need more education.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.750
WENDY JUDSON: Because not too
many people like the CPAP.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.220
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yes.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.930
And actually, we were
talking about this

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.180
just before we
came on stage, was

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.780
a lot of people won't even do
the sleep study, even at home,

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.190
because they're afraid their end
goal is going to be only CPAP.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.320
So they're afraid to even
just get started even

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.180
having their sleep evaluated.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.710
And that is not
their only option.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.480
I like to go over
the whole thing.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.060
I like to give the patient
every single option I know of,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.260
and then let them decide
what's good for them.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.360
WENDY JUDSON: Now, we've got
some sides here on the sleep

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.885
cycle, a couple of them.

00:20:38.885 --> 00:20:40.010
DAVE SHIRAZI: That's right.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:45.550
WENDY JUDSON: So this first one
shows our REM, non REM cycle.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.710
And then what's
significant in this?

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.587
It's the same time frame,
right, as the other slide?

00:20:51.587 --> 00:20:52.420
DAVE SHIRAZI: It is.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.860
This one just goes
into a bit of detail.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.310
It's actually an older slide,
because currently we're

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.350
not measuring what's
called stage four.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.260
We're kind of mixing stage
three and stage four into one.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.840
But we're actually
discussing going back

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.670
into measuring stage four again.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.380
So I'm putting it up.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.970
So the different
stages that we have,

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.250
so stage one is alpha wave.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.550
We all go into alpha wave as
soon as we close our eyes.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.790
Stage two is a slightly
deeper stage of sleep.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.820
Stage three, and in
this slide stage four,

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.030
is the only time where we get
our delta sleep, which is where

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.080
growth hormone comes from.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.050
So in children, 50% of our sleep
is delta, because obviously, we

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.080
need to grow.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:38.470
But after we've reached our
ability to no longer grow,

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.740
we now need growth
hormone to repair.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.130
So growth hormone is still
essential for our survival,

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.180
but we're just using it to
repair instead of growing.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.130
And of course, REM,
like we discussed,

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.300
those are the peaks that
you see on that graph

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.470
where we get our
mental, emotional rest,

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.800
our ability to retain things
that we learned that day,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.830
to process things
that we think are

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.190
significant for our
survival socially.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.200
So the brain is
aware of not just

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.950
our physical survival but
our emotional survival.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.450
WENDY JUDSON: So
sleep fragmentation

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:18.115
is going to deprive us of a lot
of intelligence, ultimately.

00:22:18.115 --> 00:22:19.490
DAVE SHIRAZI:
Yeah, that is true.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.890
We actually see
that in children.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.530
We actually see a
difference in intelligence

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.530
in children that have
compromised sleep due to apnea.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.050
WENDY JUDSON: This
has been a thing

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.500
that I don't understand,
because now I'm a parent,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.180
so I have to take
my kid to school.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.060
And I don't understand why
they have to start at 8:00.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.185
DAVE SHIRAZI: That's right.

00:22:38.185 --> 00:22:40.240
WENDY JUDSON: And
the book I referred

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.240
to says a 9:00 AM
start time for schools

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.570
is really a lot wiser
and better for kids.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:52.155
So something to think about and
maybe push for as a society.

00:22:52.155 --> 00:22:53.530
DAVE SHIRAZI: The
data definitely

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.800
supports that on schools
that shift their morning

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.490
time to 9:00 AM, which allows
children to get more sleep,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.140
because children need
more sleep than we do,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.350
they have better outcomes.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.170
Less sick days, better
performance in class.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.850
WENDY JUDSON: We were
talking last week,

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.520
and again this morning,
about the importance

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.380
of breastfeeding for the
development of the palate,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.580
right?

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:26.613
And why we've done a disservice
by bottle feeding babies.

00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:28.030
DAVE SHIRAZI:
Two-fold disservice.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.210
Because when we look at
skulls before the Industrial

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.990
Revolution, most of
them had straight teeth.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.450
Most of them had very,
very wide palates.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.170
They had relatively small
sinuses and big nasal turbinate

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.790
space.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.440
And we know that the average
breastfeeding period was

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.380
between three to five years.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.600
Now, when you're
breastfeeding, if you

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.480
can imagine if the nipple
is inside the child's mouth,

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.750
the tongue pinches
the base of the nipple

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.470
and then makes this little
rolling action over the palate,

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.830
squeezes the nipple, and
gets the milk that way.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.260
And when they stop
breastfeeding,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.450
they still swallow this way.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.690
And while we're growing,
it's the tongue that actually

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.460
develops the palate naturally.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.700
Does that make sense?

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.230
So when we go to bottle feeding,
we have a two-fold problem.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.630
Because one, the
nipple itself is now

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.880
suppressing the tongue down.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.050
And two, you're using
your buccinator muscles,

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.840
that's your cheek muscles, to
swallow like this, which then

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.130
narrows the palate, which then
raises the arch, which means

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.280
you really don't even have space
for your tongue to go up there

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.440
anymore because it's so
narrow and high arched.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.600
Does that make sense?

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.392
WENDY JUDSON: Yeah.

00:24:44.392 --> 00:24:47.350
So we could reduce a whole
lot of this sleep apnea

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.508
just by having children
breastfeed for a longer period.

00:24:50.508 --> 00:24:51.550
DAVE SHIRAZI: Absolutely.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.565
For sure.

00:24:53.565 --> 00:24:55.190
WENDY JUDSON: Which
you say right here.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.210
Can sometimes be
completely fixed when

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.710
you discover it early enough.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.210
DAVE SHIRAZI: So that is--

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.377
I'm not sure about the data.

00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:05.335
I don't know if we've
had longitudinal studies.

00:25:05.335 --> 00:25:08.270
Because you have to realize,
understanding snoring and sleep

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.960
apnea has only been
going on for 40 years.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.090
Before that, it was
just Pickwickian,

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.420
where we talked about the
jolly old fat man that snored

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.340
and could sleep standing up.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.900
But we didn't have
knowledge of it back then.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.400
Who knows?

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.660
It may not have even existed
in that kind of numbers.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.630
But the point of that
slide, that sentence,

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.350
is the only time
we can technically

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:38.720
cure sleep apnea without
surgery is in children

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.720
through what's called
functional orthodontics, where

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.540
we develop the palate,
develop the tongue,

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.360
develop the mandible forward.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.130
That make sense?

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.030
WENDY JUDSON: Yeah.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.710
And so in adults,
what we're doing

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:55.617
is trying to just improve.

00:25:55.617 --> 00:25:56.950
DAVE SHIRAZI: We can improve it.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.410
The data is not as
conclusive as it

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.352
is for children for adults
doing functional orthodontics.

00:26:03.352 --> 00:26:05.560
WENDY JUDSON: And these are
just some of the symptoms

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.850
of sleep apnea in kids.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.860
So any of you who have kids
may have noticed some of these,

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.098
and it might be something
you want to explore.

00:26:14.098 --> 00:26:14.890
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.130
The most common
side effect, if you

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.770
will, or symptom of
snoring and sleep apnea

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:27.110
in children, interrupted sleep,
is hyperactivity and ADD.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.770
That's the most
common one of all.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.930
And it's because
pediatric neurology

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.650
is opposite of adults.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.510
So when adults get tired
from sleep fragmentation,

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.500
children get amped up and wired
and have difficulty processing

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.380
things and sitting still.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.530
Defiance has actually been
overlapped with this, as well.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.330
And the number of
studies that have

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.380
shown that correcting sleep
apnea or a sleep disorder

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.850
breathing in the child with ADD
or ADHD and then it resolves it

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.010
is in the thousands.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.550
It's not a secret.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.130
It's not talked
about, unfortunately.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.470
Most pediatricians, if
you ask them about it,

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.420
they would be kind
of blase about it.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.040
But it's something that's well
established in the literature.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.530
And every child should
be screened for snoring

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.970
and sleep apnea,
without exemption.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.910
WENDY JUDSON: OK.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.448
Now what about in the elderly?

00:27:24.448 --> 00:27:25.240
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.500
The elderly, of
course, need snoring--

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.190
sleeping as well, sorry.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.630
But they need less sleep than
children or even adults do.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.930
But their sleep has
changed, depending

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.060
on how active they are.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.060
So when we see the
elderly population,

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.180
but they're still teaching
at the university level,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.040
they're still physically
active, they're

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.950
still getting good
amounts of REM and delta.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.330
The ones that aren't,
we see much less sleep.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.070
And in that population,
we're seeing

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.740
a lot of other
neurological diseases being

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.610
overlapped to it.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:05.170
Because instead of getting
hyperactivity and ADD,

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.690
we're seeing in the elderly
neurodegenerative disorders

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.053
like Parkinson's
and Alzheimer's.

00:28:10.053 --> 00:28:11.970
WENDY JUDSON: So we could
avoid some of those.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.303
DAVE SHIRAZI: Potentially, yeah.

00:28:13.303 --> 00:28:16.870
So Alzheimer's has been called,
in the last 10 years, type 3

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.930
diabetes because
of the relationship

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.310
between their inflammation
and their sugar levels,

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.760
which my father had, by the way.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.180
So we already know
the relationship

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.910
between insulin resistance
and diabetes with sleep apnea.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.150
It's not a far cry to
say, OK, here it is,

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.680
relationship with Alzheimer's.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.180
WENDY JUDSON: So
taking care of this

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.918
now can really help
us in the future.

00:28:41.918 --> 00:28:42.710
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.600
WENDY JUDSON: This
is hard to read,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.160
so I'm just going to skip by it.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.570
DAVE SHIRAZI: No worries.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.380
WENDY JUDSON: Moving on
now to the TMJ or TMD.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:55.120
Can you clarify what
is the appropriate term

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.580
to talk about problems with TMJ?

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.010
DAVE SHIRAZI: You hear so
many times, I have TMJ.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.740
OK, so TMJ is just the
name of the anatomy.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.760
Temporomandibular.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.590
Everyone has a TMJ.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.060
TMJ disorder is some sort of
dysfunction associated with it,

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.610
whether it's a
dislocation, a broken

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:20.260
jaw, like a fractured jaw and
neck, arthritis, effusion,

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.710
swelling of the joint.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.670
It could be a disorder
that falls in there.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.820
So that, nomenclature
wise, the word TMJ

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.120
just means the anatomy.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.190
WENDY JUDSON: And the TMD is
the actual disorder or problem

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.690
with it?

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.815
DAVE SHIRAZI: That's right.

00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:37.570
And then it's sort
of like cancer, where

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:41.500
you have stage one, stage two,
stage three, metastatic or not.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.120
It's like we subdivide
different TMJ disorders.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.340
WENDY JUDSON: And we
kind of spoke about this,

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.170
but the tongue moving
appropriately in the mouth

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:56.640
is definitely connected
to this TMD problem.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.390
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah,
so if you can imagine,

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:01.780
if you're swallowing
properly, if your tongue is

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.640
coming forward and
swallowing properly,

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.630
it's going to bring
the mandible with it.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.570
But if on the other hand, while
you're sleeping, let's say,

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.572
your tongue is tethered
to your mandible

00:30:12.572 --> 00:30:14.030
while you're sleeping
on your back,

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.460
you've effectively
doubled the weight

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.140
of your mandible,
which will close off

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.100
the airway a bit more.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.430
Does that make sense?

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.930
Yeah.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.290
That's very, very hard to
decipher through literature.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.540
But we see it.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.480
There are a countless number
of studies where they actually

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.150
do what's called myofunctional
therapy, where they train you

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.100
how to swallow properly
when your tongue is

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.870
too low on your mandible.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.310
And they'll show a 50% reduction
in AHI scores of the snoring

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.060
and sleep.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.410
WENDY JUDSON: AHI scores?

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.000
DAVE SHIRAZI: So that's our
metric for measuring sleep

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.980
apnea.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.030
A stands for Apnea, when your
airway is closed for 10 seconds

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.090
or longer.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.470
H stands for Hypopnea,
when your breathing

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.840
is so shallow that it
causes your oxygen to dip 3%

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.710
or greater.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.305
And the I stands
for Index, which

00:31:01.305 --> 00:31:05.620
is the number of times
per hour you do the both.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.810
WENDY JUDSON: So then
correcting this problem,

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.970
what really surprised me is
that the posture can change.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:16.540
So this forward head
posture that I work on a lot

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:21.310
can actually be mitigated
by addressing TMD.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.560
DAVE SHIRAZI: It depends if
you have both that posture

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.940
and you have a TMD
at the same time.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.530
So if this is your
ergonomics all day,

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.170
I don't know how much TMJ
therapy is going to help you.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.820
But if you have a TM problem, if
you are mouth breathing, which

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.970
is one of the main reasons why
we have forward head posture,

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.305
and then you add a poor
ergonomic situation where

00:31:43.305 --> 00:31:45.430
you're doing this or you're
on your phone like this

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.760
all the time, that is
definitely going to compound it.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.390
WENDY JUDSON: So we
have a study here

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.390
and showed that a higher
proportion of headache patients

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.210
diagnosed with TMJ
pain, they also

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.590
reported more frequent
and intense tooth contact,

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.590
more masticatory muscle
tension, stress, and pain

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.900
in the face, head, and
other parts of the body

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.676
than the non-headache controls.

00:32:09.676 --> 00:32:10.550
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.340
This is something we also
commonly see in the literature.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.530
Again, we're probably past
2,000 studies as well,

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.070
where we see those with both
tension type and migraine type

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:29.220
headaches have much more TMJ and
clenching problems than norms,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.190
than just people in
the normal population.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.160
And then we also
see studies that

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.450
show that when you address the
TMJ disorder, they're both--

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.780
either their tension type
headaches completely go away

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.330
or their migraine type
headaches can potentially

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.850
reduce substantially.

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.770
So we definitely
see that overlap.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.390
WENDY JUDSON: That was great.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:56.430
So here you might want to talk
a little bit about this slide

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.962
and what is a migraine as
compared to another headache.

00:33:00.962 --> 00:33:02.420
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah,
very different.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.500
So a tension type headache,
when we're actually clenching,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.170
imagine all these muscles, not
just the clenching muscles,

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.300
but of the neck just
all going like this.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.560
We actually see a compression
of the greater occipital

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.550
and greater oracular nerves
at the base of the skull,

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.570
and it comes across here, and
it can feel like a vise grip.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.670
And sometimes people will
experience, they'll say,

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.170
oh, I went to my chiropractor.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.270
They adjusted my neck and
my tension type headache

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.590
went away immediately.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.500
And then I slept and then the
next morning it came back.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.990
It didn't hold.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.340
But when it was in fact
the clenching that kind of

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.150
led to it.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.190
Migraine type headache.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:45.170
So a migraine is what we call a
centrally sensitized disorder.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.870
And what that means
is you all understand

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.580
what referred pain is, right?

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.250
You have a pinch in your neck
and it makes your arm hurt.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.500
That's referred
pain down your arm.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.150
Central sensitization
is where you

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.270
have a chronic,
repetitive pain that

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.590
causes actual physical
plastic changes to your brain.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.630
Then that causes other
parts of your brain

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:10.040
to create problems, like
in the case of migraines,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.259
making blood vessels
open and close.

00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:13.909
WENDY JUDSON: Is that why the
visual disturbances can occur?

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:14.480
DAVE SHIRAZI: That's right.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.380
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.543
Absolutely.

00:34:16.543 --> 00:34:17.960
But it could also
be other things.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.120
You can have burning
mouth syndrome.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.219
You could have
trigeminal neuralgia.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:25.310
These are all essentially
sensitized disorders.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.340
And what determines which
one you could potentially

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.710
have is your genetics.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.909
But then it's what is creating
the response of your genetics

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.067
to do that.

00:34:36.067 --> 00:34:37.400
Because your genes aren't just--

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.530
I find the whole
argument of migraines

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.050
being genetic only as
absolutely preposterous,

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:46.190
because someone can go
their whole life, 40 years.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.620
They have, obviously, the
genetic markers for migraine.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.840
They never had a
single migraine.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.190
And then something changes.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.955
They change their diet, they
have sleep fragmentation,

00:34:54.955 --> 00:34:57.080
they get a jaw problem,
they have a dental problem,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.090
they have a sinus
problem, and then they

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.460
start getting migraines.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.545
So we can't look at the
genetics as the cause of that.

00:35:05.545 --> 00:35:06.920
We have to look
at it and go, OK,

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.460
what was it in their
environment that created that?

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.250
And so migraine
is, if that is what

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.250
your genetic predisposition
is, then having

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.270
chronic inflammation or chronic
pain induced by your jaw,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.290
by a nasal airway issue, by fill
in the blank, anything that's

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.270
connected to the
trigeminal nerve,

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.160
can then create a migraine.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.965
WENDY JUDSON: Now, why is the
trigeminal nerve significant?

00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:32.090
I'm gonna go ahead through.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.450
DAVE SHIRAZI: It's an extremely
special cranial nerve.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:37.170
It's easily the biggest one.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.270
It's both sensory and motor.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:44.360
It anastomosis with
other cranial nerves.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.850
And it's just really
essential to our survival.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.600
It's related to our vision,
our nasal breathing,

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.577
and our chewing.

00:35:51.577 --> 00:35:52.660
WENDY JUDSON: Anastomosis.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.030
Could you--

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.197
DAVE SHIRAZI: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:35:54.197 --> 00:35:56.997
The word anastomosis means
kind of merging together.

00:35:56.997 --> 00:35:58.580
So you can have a
couple [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.955
Like for example,
along the face,

00:35:59.955 --> 00:36:03.350
an anastomosis with
the facial nerve.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:05.900
So you can have a
constant facial pain

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.955
that then causes the
central sensitization

00:36:07.955 --> 00:36:10.310
in the trigeminal nerve,
because they're all connected.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.560
WENDY JUDSON: Right, there's
nine nerves that actually

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.727
pass through the jaw, right?

00:36:13.727 --> 00:36:15.227
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah,
there's several.

00:36:15.227 --> 00:36:15.892
That's right.

00:36:15.892 --> 00:36:16.630
That's right.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.630
There's several.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.590
WENDY JUDSON: So this one goes
back to our reptilian brain,

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.240
as do most of the
cranial nerves.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.377
But there, there's the
anastomosis, right?

00:36:27.377 --> 00:36:29.460
DAVE SHIRAZI: Well, no
that's not the anastomosis.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.150
The anastomosis is really
predominantly happening

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.570
outside where it starts
to kind of merge together.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.490
Over here, you can
kind of see how close

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.200
they are to one
another and how they're

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.250
so close to the brain stem.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.000
You see the olfactory,
you see the second.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.950
You see they all
just come together.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:46.640
WENDY JUDSON: Yeah,
it's a big one

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.138
compared to everything else.

00:36:48.138 --> 00:36:49.680
DAVE SHIRAZI: It's
much, much bigger.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.138
And that should
tell you something.

00:36:51.138 --> 00:36:53.960
The brain is all
about real estate.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.600
Anything that's in
the brain is there

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.710
because it really,
really needs to be.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.200
So if we have something that
takes up a lot of real estate,

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.613
that means the brain puts
a lot of value on it.

00:37:07.613 --> 00:37:08.970
Does that make sense?

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:09.762
WENDY JUDSON: Yeah.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.480
And then I put this
one in from your deck,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.330
because so often
times people are

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.600
coming to me with head,
neck, shoulder pain

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.820
because they've been
at the computer.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.810
And yet it could all be
related to the jaw, or at least

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.060
a good portion of it.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.920
So addressing that could
help a lot of this.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.170
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.967
Just stopping the clenching
or stopping your ability

00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:38.300
to clench during the day while
you're working and trying

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.030
to control the situation
will go a long way

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.000
to relieve either
the muscle pain here

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.590
as it refers to other parts of
your body as trigger points.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.840
WENDY JUDSON: Now,
there's another picture

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.250
of the difference of
a before and after.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.293
What was this patient given?

00:37:55.293 --> 00:37:56.710
DAVE SHIRAZI: So
this is a patient

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:01.780
that had both a sleep apnea
issue and a TMJ issue.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.770
So we're looking
at a number things.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.650
So in my-- there
are many reasons

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.760
why we can have
forward head posture.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.600
One, the ergonomics,
like you mentioned

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.360
is, in today's
climate, a big problem.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.040
But if you're mouth breathing,
in order to mouth breathe,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.250
you just unconsciously
bring your jaw

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.800
forward so you can breathe
through your mouth.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.300
Does that make sense?

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.800
Because when you're
nasal breathing,

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.633
the air has a nice
little passage of flow.

00:38:29.633 --> 00:38:31.300
But when you're mouth
breathing, the air

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.970
has to make a 90 degree shunt.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.510
And you have to kind of open
it to make it more arced.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:38.600
Does that make sense?

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.810
So we just unconsciously do it.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.570
The brain has many
reflexes built

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:47.090
into it, many
protective mechanisms

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.920
so it doesn't have to
constantly be reminded of things

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.760
that it doesn't
consider important.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.840
So if you walked into a
room that smelled very, very

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.840
bad, after about
five minutes, you

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.870
stop realizing that
there is a smell.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.650
Because the frontal lobe
doesn't need that information.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.660
That's not relevant to your
survival, at that point.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.450
However, if you have
a sprained ankle,

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.120
your brain needs to
unconsciously know

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.640
that if we have to run
away in an emergency,

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.250
we'd put all the weight
on the other leg.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.400
So you oftentimes don't
have to think about limping,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.620
because your brain
automatically does it.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.083
Same thing with breathing.

00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:26.500
When we have to
breathe, the brain

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.650
can't constantly be reminded
that, oh, by the way,

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.830
hold your head here because
your nose is blocked.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.450
It just automatically does it.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.460
And then we come to
swallowing, which

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.940
is what we do 2,000
to 3,000 times a day.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.880
When we do it, our
teeth come in contact.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.560
And if we have a
jaw problem, that's

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.020
when we're putting the
most amount of pressure

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.410
into the nerves of the
jaw during the day.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.920
So then what the brain
can do is unconsciously,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.920
reflexively hold the jaw
a little bit different,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.890
a little bit away from where
the pain is coming from.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.230
But then we have
to swallow again.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.260
So by the way, I just
recently learned myself

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.980
within the last couple of years,
swallowing is a survival reflex

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.540
because it tells the airway
that it's safe to breathe.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.740
The saliva that passes
tells the brain,

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.240
ah, we're good to breathe now.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.040
Carry on.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.340
So when we swallow and
our teeth come together

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.340
and the jaw goes back there, if
we have a jaw problem, if you

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.390
have a TMJ disorder that's hurt
hurting, much like the limping

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.700
on the other leg, our jaw goes--

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.958
and by exaggeration,
our jaw goes forward.

00:40:33.958 --> 00:40:36.250
But then we have to swallow
again, and when we swallow,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.540
our teeth have to contact.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.485
So when we do, we do a
pigeon maneuver like this.

00:40:41.485 --> 00:40:43.360
So if you can imagine
a couple thousand times

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.620
a day of doing this
pigeon maneuver,

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.860
you're going to have--

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.850
WENDY JUDSON: You're gonna end
up with forward head posture.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:50.230
DAVE SHIRAZI: Potentially, yeah.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.688
WENDY JUDSON: And
the muscle memory

00:40:51.688 --> 00:40:54.190
that is associated with
that clenching, too, right?

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.565
DAVE SHIRAZI:
Well, the clenching

00:40:55.565 --> 00:40:59.440
that we do is with our
teeth together in the back.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.640
So the CPAP, I just want you
to know, I am not anti CPAP.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.380
The CPAP works.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.650
It has something like a 98.7
success rate in treating

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.510
sleep apnea, period.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:19.320
The problem with
CPAP is that it has

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.680
a huge failure in patient
compliance, like 40% to 60%,

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.860
depending on which
study you look at.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.320
I am not a fan, I
should say, I am not

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.240
a fan of CPAP in children.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.980
In the growing child,
I'm very much against it,

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.820
unless we're talking about a
central problem potentially

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:42.250
or some other kind of either
brain or genetic malformation.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.810
But for the majority
of the people,

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.160
if you can tolerate
the CPAP as an adult,

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.652
I'm never going to tell
anyone not to do it.

00:41:48.652 --> 00:41:51.110
WENDY JUDSON: But let's look
at what the other options are.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.068
DAVE SHIRAZI: The other
options are exist, too.

00:41:53.068 --> 00:41:54.520
You have oral
appliances that do--

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.770
so whereas a CPAP is what
we call a pneumatic splint,

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.480
it literally pushes--

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.240
the air pressure is not
designed to help you breathe.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.120
The air pressure is designed
to blow up your airway,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.500
like you blow up a balloon,
to keep your airway patent.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.180
And so your inhale
and your exhale kind

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.190
of fights against the pressure.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.250
But at the same time, it doesn't
allow the airway to collapse,

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.070
because you're blowing it open.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.810
You're, basically, you're
allowing the air pressure

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:25.060
to blow your tongue forward.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.680
Does that make sense?

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.460
So an oral appliance is
actually called a splint,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.450
like a physical splint as
opposed to a pneumatic splint.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.660
Well, we can potentially
bring the tongue forward,

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.470
bring the jaw forward,
lift the tongue,

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.960
like instruct the tongue to
go on the roof of the mouth,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.790
help with the nasal breathing
by opening up the nasal valve.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.790
WENDY JUDSON: Now, we're
talking about this type

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:48.430
of a splint, not the kind that
they form around your teeth.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:49.870
DAVE SHIRAZI: No, that's
the kind I'm talking about.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.850
The kind that's custom
made to your teeth.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.310
Now, this kind of device
that you have showing

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:58.090
is what's called an ALF, an
Advanced Lightwire Functional.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.840
This is a kind of what we call
functional orthodontic device

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.650
that we can use in children
to expand their palate

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:10.558
and literally cure
sleep apnea in most.

00:43:10.558 --> 00:43:12.850
It also acts, by the way, as
a myofunctional appliance,

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.880
because that little center
loop that you see on there

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.970
actually helps train
the tongue where to be.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.520
If we get a little
hair in our mouth,

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.200
we go nuts until we get it out.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.080
The tongue becomes acutely
aware of that tiny little piece

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.980
of hair, because we have so
many nerves in our tongue.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.650
The tongue actually seeks
out that loop and it

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:35.770
helps train the tongue
on where to swallow 24/7.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:41.750
But then we can activate it and
then develop the palate itself.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.980
WENDY JUDSON: So if I were to
use this instead of my splint

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.990
that I have, because
I find my splint,

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.612
I just want to
clench more on it.

00:43:48.612 --> 00:43:49.570
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah, OK.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.517
WENDY JUDSON: So could
I stop clenching?

00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:52.600
DAVE SHIRAZI: Potentially.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.610
So let's discuss
that for a moment.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.110
There were studies
done, and I think

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.180
you may even have
the slide here,

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.960
where they took subjects
that had sleep apnea

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.750
and clenched their teeth
and didn't use their CPAP.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.550
They used a night guard instead.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:10.590
And we found that it
made their apnea worse.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.520
And then they also
clenched worse,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.490
because we found that they
were clenching harder in order

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.530
to breathe, is the presumption.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.730
So in this, we actually
have seen studies just

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.480
with myofunctional therapy where
there is less clenching just

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.090
from knowing where
you're tongue is.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.870
With the ALF, we're
also finding that it

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.300
changes your autonomic tone.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.610
It allows your
sympathetic nervous system

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:41.020
to shift more to parasympathetic
and allows more calm,

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.840
which allows more natural
physiological reactions

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.465
to happen and less of a
response to the clenching.

00:44:46.465 --> 00:44:47.960
Does that make sense?

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.210
WENDY JUDSON: It does.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.980
I'm wondering, Cleo, do you want
to speak about your experience,

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.700
since you do actually
have this device?

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.070
CLEO: I do.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.950
Yeah, so I have an
ALF device installed.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.660
One thing that you said
actually was that you're like--

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.140
you can put it in children.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.640
I'm an adult child, apparently,
because I have one of these,

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.390
too.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.500
And what it's been
doing is it's definitely

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.220
physically widening my palate,
which has been amazing.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.760
But even before I was doing
anything, when he first

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.300
installs it, you
don't have any--

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.810
he doesn't try to
make it do anything.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.300
You just let your body
adapt to it initially.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.760
And it's exactly
what he was saying

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.890
about how my tongue
was immediately

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:38.080
attracted to the metal
part on top right there.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.970
And then I started
sleeping with my tongue

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.887
on the roof of my mouth,
and all of a sudden I

00:45:41.887 --> 00:45:43.670
was sleeping through the night.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.790
I used to think that--

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.770
I was waking up three
or four times a night

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.270
to go to the bathroom,
and I thought

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:51.520
it was because I need to
cut off my water earlier

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.620
and earlier at night,
and it wasn't helping.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.080
And of course, I'm blaming
the cat for some of this,

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.560
too, because he's 21.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.980
I mean, he's kind of a pain.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.205
But it turned out
that it wasn't--

00:46:02.205 --> 00:46:04.330
I wasn't waking up because
of the bladder problems.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.060
I was waking up and
noticing that I should

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.970
go to the bathroom and thinking
that that was the causation,

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.140
but it wasn't the cause.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.050
It was actually that I just
was not getting good sleep.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:16.960
And I was getting nine
and a half hours of sleep

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.340
and waking up tired
thinking, well,

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.340
I'm just going to spend
more than 1/3 of my life

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.793
in bed, because I can't
seem to get enough sleep.

00:46:23.793 --> 00:46:25.210
And now that I
have this device, I

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:29.150
wake up after seven, seven and a
half hours and I'm ready to go.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.610
So it's been pretty--

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.200
personally, from my
perspective, it's

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.070
been very effective at dealing
with my snoring and my bruxism.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.310
That was basically what
we were trying to target.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.070
And I went to see
Dr. Shirazi because I

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:43.450
used to have a
night guard, which

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.557
would prevent me from
grinding my teeth at night.

00:46:46.557 --> 00:46:48.640
Didn't prevent me from
grinding my teeth at night.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.760
What it did was it prevented me
from doing damage to my teeth

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.140
when I was grinding at night.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.360
It didn't help me sleep.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.480
It just helped me reduce the
amount of damage I was doing.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.290
And now I don't
wear that anymore,

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:03.310
because I don't clench at night
anymore or grind my teeth.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.865
So yeah, it's been fantastic.

00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:06.490
WENDY JUDSON: Outside
of the time where

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.320
you might be sore
from adjustments,

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.300
does the device bother you?

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.850
Do you notice it?

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.908
CLEO: I don't really
notice it anymore.

00:47:14.908 --> 00:47:16.450
When I have the
adjustments, my teeth

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.130
will be a little
tender for a few days,

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.280
and sometimes chewing certain
things is more difficult.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.800
But it's not a lifelong thing.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.510
I'm probably going to wear
this for 18 to 24 months,

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:30.250
depending on how quickly
my palate and my teeth

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.900
allow the movement to happen.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.750
Because you have to let
your body accept the change.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.840
And then after that, it'll
just be a night retainer

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.410
to keep things in place.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.785
WENDY JUDSON: So
there will still

00:47:40.785 --> 00:47:43.620
be something that at
least reminds your body.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.440
Like you have the
little loop right now.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.270
CLEO: Yeah.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.400
And I will say that
what I was really

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.390
fascinated about with this
was that I know that I only

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.460
breastfed for about
two weeks as a baby,

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.247
because my mom had
developed an infection

00:47:56.247 --> 00:47:57.580
and she had to take antibiotics.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.690
So she couldn't
breastfeed me anymore.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.590
I also know that I sucked
my thumb until I was seven.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:06.430
I remember it because my
sisters made fun of me.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.840
Older sisters, you
know how they are.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.810
And that was because,
and you'll see this

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.930
in children, the place where
you're sucking your thumb,

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.800
that spot is the place of where
your tongue is supposed to be.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.130
That's the central
location where

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.220
you-- it's a calming
center in your brain

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.928
is how you had explained
it to me, right?

00:48:24.928 --> 00:48:26.928
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah,
actually, what's interesting

00:48:26.928 --> 00:48:28.500
is in Chinese
medicine, you know how

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.320
we have that yin yang symbol?

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.960
We actually say, because
we call the back the yang

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.340
and the front the yin.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.100
The moment where the
yang meets the yin

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.590
is right there in that
spot in the soft palate.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:41.090
CLEO: Right.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:44.190
So it's right there where a
child sucking their thumb,

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.100
they're actually looking
to comfort themselves.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.620
And that trained my brain to--

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.500
bottle feeding trained my
brain and trained my tongue

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.600
to just rest on the
bottom of my mouth.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.180
And that causes snoring, because
I was choking off my airway,

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.075
and the teeth grinding because
my body was freaking out

00:49:00.075 --> 00:49:01.950
because it's like, oh,
you can't breathe now.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:03.975
You're going to die.

00:49:03.975 --> 00:49:06.060
So that's great.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.353
Does anyone have any questions
or do you have another slide?

00:49:09.353 --> 00:49:10.770
WENDY JUDSON: The
one slide, well,

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:15.750
since he didn't bring up tongues
and the whole tongue reading.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:19.480
This, because of the
traditional oriental medicine,

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.870
I noticed that there
were slides where

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.790
they show the scalloping
of the tongue, which

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:29.340
means that, essentially, an
inflamed tongue is resting

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:33.250
against the teeth and the teeth
are making impressions on it.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.320
In Chinese medicine,
that has a diagnosis,

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.960
but it also is significant
to this whole issue of apnea

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.455
and TMJ, or TMD.

00:49:41.455 --> 00:49:42.840
DAVE SHIRAZI:
Well, what's really

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:47.730
interesting is when the
whole tongue diagnosis

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.720
phenomenon began, it was first
documented 2,500 years ago,

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.510
but it can go back 3,000 or
4,000 years, the whole tongue

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:57.090
diagnosis and the
scalloping and et cetera.

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.630
But back then, obesity
was not really a problem

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.760
and snoring and sleep apnea
wasn't really a major problem.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.440
It was a transient thing.

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.020
So what was interesting was
that they didn't know that.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:10.380
So in today's time, we know
that when someone is clenching

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.160
their teeth, they're putting
neuromuscular tone back

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.070
in their upper pharyngeal
muscles and their tongue.

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:20.190
And the tongue only has one
place to go, which is forward,

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.640
which opens up the airway.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.970
But it also presses
up against the teeth,

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.310
and that's where you
get the scallop lines.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.940
Does that make sense?

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.750
So we're seeing that
sort of a different thing

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:34.050
but then still being
relevant, in Chinese medicine,

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.090
when we see a swollen
tongue because it's

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.082
scalloping against the teeth.

00:50:38.082 --> 00:50:39.620
Does that make sense?

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.770
WENDY JUDSON: And inflammation
is part of that picture

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:43.270
too, right?

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:44.870
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yes, because
when we have inflammation,

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.130
we can have edema.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.580
We can hold onto a lot of fluid,
and we hold it in our tongue

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.380
as well.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.800
And our tongue is
actually very interesting.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.010
So if our tongue swells up,
because of weight gain or edema

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:01.700
or what have you, and we
even have the surgery,

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.280
we actually have a
surgery that takes

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.085
the middle section of the
tongue out and folds it back in,

00:51:07.085 --> 00:51:10.030
in about six months, when
the pain starts going away,

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.140
in about six months,
it grows back

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.180
to the same size it was before.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.490
Because we use that
tongue so religiously

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.310
in speech and in swallow,
and to say nothing

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.270
of eating, that [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:26.410
WENDY JUDSON: What about loss of
sensory neurons doing something

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:27.110
like that?

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:27.640
DAVE SHIRAZI: Pardon?

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.348
WENDY JUDSON: The loss
of sensory neurons

00:51:29.348 --> 00:51:30.580
when you cut the tongue.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:30.880
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.560
It can potentially grow
back, because we just

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.268
need [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:33.268 --> 00:51:35.410
WENDY JUDSON: Even
all of the sensation?

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:36.910
DAVE SHIRAZI: We
need it, because we

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.130
have a lot of what's
called proprioception,

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:42.430
which is nerves that tell
us where everything is.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:46.930
Our lips are sensitive,
not because of kissing,

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.970
but because we don't
want to swallow or put

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:51.430
anything in our mouth that's
prickly that could potentially

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:52.690
be a choking hazard.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:56.080
When we chew our food,
we need to taste the food

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.480
to see if it's extremely
bitter and therefore could

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.130
be poisonous.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:02.320
And we need to also
double check to make sure

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.620
that it's not too sharp,
so that we can survive.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.350
So the brain puts
a lot of repair,

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:14.833
puts a lot of nerval real
estate, again, if you will,

00:52:14.833 --> 00:52:15.500
into the tongue.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.080
And that's why we see more
so than any other part

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.200
of the area, when we get a
cut, it heals the fastest.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.260
WENDY JUDSON: So unfortunately,
we have reached time.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:27.080
And what's exciting to
me is I don't see anyone

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.590
leaving the room.

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:31.100
So maybe we need to
have a second talk just

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:31.820
about the tongue.

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.510
Who knows?

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:37.460
But I wanted to put up a
slide that shows where you are

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.330
and how to get in
touch with you.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:42.350
The TMJ and Sleep Therapy
Centre is a worldwide franchise

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.250
operation.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:44.110
DAVE SHIRAZI: It is.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:44.720
It is.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.200
It was founded by my
mentor, Dr. Steve Olmos.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.770
We do have, I think as of
today, 57 centers or 58

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:53.160
throughout the world.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.600
I have two of them here in
Thousand Oaks and Brentwood,

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.550
Los Angeles.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:03.170
But like I said, all over
US, Canada, Bahrain, England,

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:07.480
Dubai, all over
Australia and Canada.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.450
We're here for you.

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:11.570
You can go on that first
website, tmjtherapycentre.com,

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.970
to find a center near you.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.300
Or you can come to our
site, TMJ LA or TMJ Conejo.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.960
And we'll see if we can
be of service to you.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.900
WENDY JUDSON: Great.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.460
Thank you so much, Dr. Shirazi.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.960
DAVE SHIRAZI: It's
been my pleasure.

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.127
This felt like five minutes.

00:53:25.127 --> 00:53:26.002
WENDY JUDSON: I know.

00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:26.930
It went fast.

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:27.800
CLEO: We're going
to take a couple

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.760
questions from the audience.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.770
But let's give a round of
applause to him in case people

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:32.190
have to go to the next meeting.

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:33.732
DAVE SHIRAZI: Thank
you guys so much.

00:53:33.732 --> 00:53:35.380
Thank you.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming here today.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.880
Quick question.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.710
So what are some
active decisions

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:43.030
or conscious decisions
I can make now

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.208
that would improve my sleep?

00:53:45.208 --> 00:53:47.000
DAVE SHIRAZI: So what
aspect of your sleep?

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.120
So I want to give you the most
relevant answer as it relates

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.780
to you, because Cleo and Wendy
told me that you guys have

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:59.330
already had a meeting already,
a Google talk, on sleep hygiene.

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:00.720
So I don't want to be redundant.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.595
I just want to be of
service to you as best--

00:54:02.595 --> 00:54:05.300
what aspect of your sleep
or what aspect of sleep

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.710
would you like to address?

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.502
AUDIENCE: I sometimes
I feel like I wake up

00:54:08.502 --> 00:54:09.512
with pain in my neck.

00:54:09.512 --> 00:54:10.220
DAVE SHIRAZI: OK.

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.340
That is associated with
clenching your teeth

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.740
and clenching your jaw, like
we were talking about today.

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.200
Because we don't just
clench these teeth.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.600
We clench the upper
trapezius muscle.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.700
And then depending on where
we sleep, it'll make it worse.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.710
So for example, when people
have one sided jaw problems,

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:29.625
we see them sleeping
with their hands

00:54:29.625 --> 00:54:32.300
right underneath their jaw,
and they're just used to that.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.165
And they clench and
they shift their jaw

00:54:34.165 --> 00:54:36.140
as they're clenching,
which hurts the jaw

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.390
and hurts the neck and
shoulders, as well.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.640
If you absolutely have
to sleep like this,

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.520
tuck it underneath the
pillow and then do it.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.690
But then have your jaw assessed,
have your airway assessed

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:50.097
and see, OK, why am I clenching?

00:54:50.097 --> 00:54:50.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:51.960
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah, my pleasure.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.543
Good question.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for all the great talk.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:05.000
How is this wire functional that
opens up the palate interacting

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.900
with, let's say, the aesthetic
orthodontic that many of us

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:09.710
have?

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:11.090
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yes,
OK, so usually

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:12.990
in a very, very positive way.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:18.350
So again, we talked about
what people look like prior

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:20.030
to the Industrial Revolution.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.450
They had the nice, wide
Julia Roberts-style

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:25.610
arches, nice, big, wide arches.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:26.930
And I find that attractive.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:28.945
In Europe, that's
what most people have.

00:55:28.945 --> 00:55:30.320
They have nice,
big, wide arches.

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.270
Their parents breastfeed longer.

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:34.010
The orthodontists
in Europe are not

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:37.850
as eager to extract teeth
and bring everything back.

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:42.830
So the ALF appliance is
devised to actually develop

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:44.150
the arch very, very gently.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:45.980
So it completely transforms.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.680
I have a lot of before and after
cases to show you, if you like.

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.250
It completely
transforms the smile.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:54.350
Because it's getting
that much wider.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:56.168
AUDIENCE: But
don't you get gaps?

00:55:56.168 --> 00:55:56.960
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.290
Yeah, so it's not uncommon,
after ALF treatment,

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:03.170
to do a little bit of
Invisalign, something like--

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:06.110
or I should say aligners, not to
throw a brand name out there--

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:10.940
that will straighten the teeth
into where we put the palate.

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.150
Does that make sense?

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:13.400
So we're using the teeth.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:17.060
When we're using ALF,
we're using the teeth

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.520
to help support the
palate and the mandible

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.590
to where we want it.

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:24.590
And as soon as we start to
see teeth tipping or OK,

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.270
maybe we went too
far or maybe we've

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:28.280
reached the body's limits.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.160
Then we can talk about, OK,
do you like the way it looks?

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.070
Or would you like to do
some kind of orthodontics

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:34.870
to straighten it?

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:36.020
Or it could even be braces.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.837
Just straighten
that last bit of it.

00:56:37.837 --> 00:56:38.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.780
DAVE SHIRAZI: Yeah.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:39.530
Good question.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.740
And then one in the
corner, as well, too.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.960
AUDIENCE: My question
is, does your--

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:52.430
excuse me-- therapy center
take medical insurance?

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.850
DAVE SHIRAZI: So it depends.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:54.350
It depends.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.910
We're actually in
the process right now

00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:01.070
of negotiating with five
major PPO insurances

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:03.260
to be in network.

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:06.980
But historically, we've
been out of network

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:10.670
because it's been such a hassle
with the medical insurance.

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:12.530
And unfortunately,
medical insurance

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.790
has gotten more
challenging over time

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:16.910
instead of less challenging.

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:22.280
But we're hopeful that with
this becoming in network

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.060
with these five, through
our biller, that we'll

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.010
be able to cut
through the red tape

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.380
and you guys will be
able to get the benefits

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.627
you so rightly deserve from
your medical insurance.

00:57:34.627 --> 00:57:35.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.220
DAVE SHIRAZI: My pleasure.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:40.132
That's great.

00:57:40.132 --> 00:57:42.030
AUDIENCE: That's what it's for.

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:45.190
So if I'm snoring at night and
my sleep is being disturbed

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:48.322
either because of that or
because my wife's jostling me,

00:57:48.322 --> 00:57:50.780
would it be beneficial for me
to practice breathing through

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.590
my nose more?

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:52.665
Is that kind of the idea?

00:57:52.665 --> 00:57:54.290
DAVE SHIRAZI: That's
one of the easiest

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:56.390
thing within your control.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:00.770
Putting the tongue right
behind your two front teeth

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:03.260
where that bump is,
practicing swallowing

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.030
and this kind of
rhythmic motion,

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.980
and focusing on breathing
through your nose.

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.460
Breathe Right strips, if
you have nasal obstruction,

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.640
something like a Breathe Right
strip or a nasal dilator,

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.220
is very helpful to
help to force you

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.060
to breathe through your nose.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.930
Sometimes we recommend
taping the lips shut, again,

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.320
to force you to breathe
through your nose.

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.270
Most of my patients that I
recommend that I want in a V

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.610
so that you can actually
have a little escape window.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:31.910
But you have a beard, so
you can't really do that.

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:34.225
Those are the things that
are within your control.

00:58:34.225 --> 00:58:35.600
AUDIENCE: What
about guaifenesin?

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.600
DAVE SHIRAZI: I'm sorry?

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.287
AUDIENCE: What about
guaifenesin to help remove any--

00:58:39.287 --> 00:58:40.370
DAVE SHIRAZI: Guaifenesin?

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:41.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the Mucinex.

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.360
DAVE SHIRAZI: Oh, Mucinex.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.000
OK, so if that's
an issue, if you're

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.630
getting excess mucus
secretions through your nose,

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:48.380
yeah, that's fine.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:53.570
So for example, things like
nasal steroids, for example,

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:59.300
it will shrink up your nasal
breathing by almost 100%

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.800
for four hours.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.280
And then it has a
drastic rebound effect

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.140
where your nose swells up
and you can't breathe at all

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.750
after it wears off.

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.210
And plus, the preliminary
studies showed that it actually

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:13.760
changes your brainwaves,
your EEG signals,

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.890
from the steroid that's
in it, we presume.

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:19.880
So I'm not a fan of
nasal corticosteroids.

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.280
If someone was an
athlete and they

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.773
were allowed to do
nasal corticosteroids

00:59:24.773 --> 00:59:26.690
and we want them to
breathe through their nose

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.510
and they're having a flu or
something that stops them,

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:31.100
OK, go ahead, do it.

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.850
But to me, it's not
a lifelong solution.

00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:37.700
I personally make
my own nasal spray

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.980
with essential oils, just
over-the-counter essential

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:40.700
oils.

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.910
And just anecdotally-- I haven't
done a study, anecdotally--

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:49.070
80% of my patients that were
essentially addicted to FLONASE

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.570
or some kind of
nasal corticosteroid

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:53.510
have put it down and
switched to my nasal spray

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.760
and only refer to the
FLONASE as an emergency.

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.000
And in my personal
opinion, steroids

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.450
should only be used
in an emergency.

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:06.262
It depletes our adrenals.

01:00:06.262 --> 01:00:07.220
There are side effects.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.440
You're paying for
it later when you

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.560
have chronic corticosteroid
use, whether it's

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.200
topical cream,
nasal, or otherwise.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.850
It's fine for short term.

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:18.050
A week is fine.

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:21.530
But we should only be using
it on an emergency basis,

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.620
in my opinion, if you
have no other choice.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.930
CLEO: And back to what you
said about the guaifenesin,

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:28.550
I would say that if
you're chronically

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:31.815
having to use something like
Mucinex or a decongestant,

01:00:31.815 --> 01:00:33.440
there might be
something else going on.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.360
There might be some
allergy going on,

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.810
whether it's an environmental
allergy or a food allergy,

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:42.050
that you can investigate to see
why you're not breathing well

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:42.690
at night.

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:44.690
And it might even be the
case that it's actually

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:46.940
happening during the day,
too, and you don't notice it

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.790
because you're actually able
to drain your sinuses better

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:51.780
during the day.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.230
But at night when you're
lying down and everything

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:55.258
can get clogged up.

01:00:55.258 --> 01:00:56.550
DAVE SHIRAZI: Excellent points.

01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:58.883
CLEO: I think that we have
to take Dr. Shirazi to lunch.

01:00:58.883 --> 01:01:00.650
Is there one more question?

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:01.310
OK.

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:02.290
One more question.

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:03.980
Wait, there's a fight.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.050
Arm wrestle.

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.180
OK.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.430
AUDIENCE: Actually, three.

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.270
DAVE SHIRAZI: Oh, OK.

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.460
AUDIENCE: How long
do you recommend

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:18.100
breastfeed to fix baby's
breathing problem for life?

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.780
DAVE SHIRAZI: So, I mean,
obviously there hasn't

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.690
been any studies on that.

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:28.550
We definitely want-- to me,
the absolute minimum in my mind

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:30.080
is one year.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.040
We breastfed-- my
wife, we, my wife

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.010
breastfed our son
for almost two years.

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:41.640
If someone did it for two to
three, I'm OK with it, too.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.400
When teeth come
into the picture,

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.630
we're supposed to
use those teeth.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:52.310
So we're supposed to have all
our teeth by age two or three.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:54.080
So all our baby
teeth, I should say.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.320
We should be chewing food with
those teeth when they come out.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.330
Because whereas the swallowing
develops our palate this way,

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:04.760
our chewing muscles
develop our jaws

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.700
in this direction, the
vertical direction.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.597
So I often see
this in my office.

01:02:09.597 --> 01:02:11.430
Someone will come and
see me and they look--

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.320
I don't mean this
in a derogatory way

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.010
at all-- they look like a
Japanese animation character,

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:19.580
because they have big eyes and
a teeny, teeny, teeny mouth.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.730
I know that at a
very young age, they

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:23.660
ate predominantly soft food.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.490
They did not put their
[INAUDIBLE] activity

01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:27.710
to good use.

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.630
And when they have a
little teeny mouth,

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:32.330
their jaw is a little bit
smaller, and they come back up

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:37.620
and they have more propensity
for a TMJ problem later on.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.030
So in my mind, it's at least
a year, two years better.

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:44.390
Plus the other aspect
of it is the first year

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:49.790
of an infant's life, they do
not have a mature immune system.

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:54.800
They get 100% of their
immunity from their gut.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.560
So whether you're breastfeeding
and giving it to them

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.380
or you're adding probiotics
to their formula--

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:03.330
and hopefully you're using a
goat milk-based formula over

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:04.490
a soy--

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.380
that's how they're getting it.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.370
They're sincerely not getting
immunity for any length of time

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:14.572
from anything else other
than from their gut.

01:03:14.572 --> 01:03:16.030
CLEO: Thank you so
much for coming,

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:17.620
and we really
appreciate the talk.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.520
Thank you.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.970
[APPLAUSE]
