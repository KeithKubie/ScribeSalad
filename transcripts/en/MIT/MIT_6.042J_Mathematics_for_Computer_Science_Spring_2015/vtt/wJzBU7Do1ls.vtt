00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.510
ALBERT MEYER: We've looked at
independence for two events.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.470
What about when we
have a bunch of events?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.130
Well, in that case
we want to look

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.360
at the idea of
mutual independence.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.960
So let's check that out.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.410
I'll say that if I have
n different events,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.310
I'll say that they're mutually
independent, intuitively.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.860
If the probability
that one of them occurs

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.270
is unchanged by which other
ones happen to have occurred.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.270
So expressed in conditional
probability, which

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.760
is the way to make it precise,
what we're really saying

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.540
is that events A1 through An
are mutually independent when

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.080
the probability of Ai is equal
to the probability of Ai,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.090
given the intersection
of any of the other

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.630
As as long as i is
not one of them.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.030
So take A1, A2, or
A1, A2, A3, and so on.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.320
And A5 is going to
be independent of all

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.260
of those other intersections.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.580
If we shift over to the other
definition of independence

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.000
that we used for two sets,
in terms of products,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.470
you could say that n sets
are mutually independent when

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.350
the probability of the
intersection of any bunch

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.394
of them is equal to the product
of the individual probabilities

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:20.810
of the events in
the intersection.

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.040
Let's look at an example
of mutual independence.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.880
Maybe the simplest
one is the one

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.090
of independent coin flips, which
by definition are independent.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.740
So the idea is that I will
flip a coin a bunch of times.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.990
And I will let Hi be
the event that the ith

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.370
time I flip I get a heads.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.260
So if you think about
what's going on,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.610
what happens on
the fifth flip has

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.350
nothing to do with what happens
on the first, fourth or seventh

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.850
flip.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.630
There's no causal
relationship between the flips

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.030
before or after flip five.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.714
Flip five is an isolated
event by itself.

00:02:03.714 --> 00:02:05.880
And the fact that there
were a bunch of heads before

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.290
or there will be
a bunch of heads

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.100
afterward doesn't have any
impact on the probability

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.120
that the fifth flip
comes up with a head.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.330
At least that's what we
believe and that's the way

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.800
that we would model them.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.690
So what that means,
for example, is

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.770
that the probability of
a head on the fifth toss

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.200
is equal to the probability of
a head on the fifth toss given

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.670
that the first toss was a head
and the fourth toss was a head

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.650
and the seventh
toss was not a head.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.180
This is the complement of H7.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.860
So that would just
be an example of one

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.750
of the many different
conditional equations that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.400
hold when you have
mutual independence.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.770
Let's look at an example.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.070
Suppose that I flip
a fair coin twice.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.190
Now, the previous definition
didn't require fairness at all

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.240
in the coin flipping.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.700
But now I'm going to need it.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.430
So that means that heads and
tails are equally likely.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.880
And suppose I flip
the coin twice.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.290
Well, let H1 be as before,
the event that a head comes up

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.040
on the first flip.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.880
And H2, the event that a head
comes up on the second flip.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.500
And let O be the event that
there were an odd number

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.132
of heads in the two flips.

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:18.345
Now, I claim that O is
independent of whether or not

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:19.720
there's a head on
the first flip.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.630
That may seem a
little weird because O

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.912
depends on both the first
flip and the second flip.

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:27.370
It's whether or not there are
an odd number of heads there,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.360
but nevertheless, I
claim that whether or not

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.920
there are an odd
number of heads is

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.560
independent of whether or not
the first toss was a head.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.640
Let's just check it using
the official definition.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.940
First of all, O is
the event HT TH.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.100
If I write out Hs and
Ts, a pair of them

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.340
for what the results of the
first and second flips were,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.780
you get an odd number of heads
exactly when there's first

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.110
a head and then a tail or first
a tail and then a head, which

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.620
means that the probability
of O is exactly a half.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.410
Because the other
two outcomes are

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.460
TT and HH, which is when you
have an even number of heads.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.420
Now, O into section
H1 is saying that you

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.920
have an odd number of heads
and the first toss is a head.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.839
The only outcome that
fits that description

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.600
is HT, which means that--
and the probability of HT

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.980
is a quarter-- so the
probability of O intersection

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.725
H1 is a quarter.

00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:30.800
O into section H1 is
just a peculiar way

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.360
of saying you got a head
and then you got a tail.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.190
So that means that the
probability of O intersection

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.280
H1 is a quarter.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.100
And of course, that's equal
to the probability of O,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.140
which we decided was a half,
and the probability of H1,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.890
which of course is
a half, because we

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.480
said the coin was fair.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.460
So I've verified the condition
for the independence of O

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.800
and H1, and therefore, I'm done.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.530
But the weird
thing to notice now

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.500
is that if you look at O, H1,
and H2, the three of them,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.510
they are not
mutually independent.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.740
Because in fact, if you
know any two of them

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.610
you can figure out
what the third one was.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.780
But just explicitly in terms
of conditional probabilities,

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.670
the probability of there
being an odd number of heads,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.500
given that the first
toss was a head

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.140
and the second toss
was a head, is 0,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.980
because once you
know H1 and H2 you

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.450
know exactly how many
heads there were.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.400
There were two.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.560
And that's not odd.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.350
So the probability of odd
given H1 intersection H2

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.360
is 0, which is not equal to the
probability of odd by itself,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.790
which was a half.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.586
So the three of them
are not independent.

00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:43.960
They're not mutually
independent,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.660
even though any two of them
are because O and H1 are.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.090
And obviously O and
H2 are by symmetry.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.680
And H1 and H2 to
are coin tosses,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.970
and they're independent.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.900
So that leads us to the general
idea of k-way independence.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.090
And an example would be if
you flip a fair coin k times,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.270
let Hi be whether or not
there's a head on the ith flip.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.810
And you let O, again,
be whether or not

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.430
there are an odd
number of heads.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.210
And by the same
argument, you can

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.190
verify that any set
of k of these events

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.280
are mutually independent.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.360
But if you give me all k plus 1,
then they are not independent.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.800
In fact, any k of them will
determine the k plus first one.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.590
But any k among themselves
will be mutually independent.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.680
So that's why this notion of how
independent a bunch of sets are

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.080
comes up, and this
is how to count it.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.050
So in general, events A1 through
an arbitrary set of events

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.110
are k-way independent
if any k of them

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.600
are mutually independent.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.300
Pairwise, then, is just the
case of two way independence.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.520
And what we saw was the
example that with k coin

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.260
flips the events
odd and the outcomes

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.140
of head or not on H1 through
Hk are k-way independent,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.410
but not k plus one
way independent.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.130
By the way, now
that we understand

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.250
what k-way independence is,
mutual independence of n sets

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.520
is simply n-way independence.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.860
But I just wanted to
close with the remark

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.490
that checking with n events
are mutually independent

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.390
means that you
actually have to check

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.440
all the intersections
equaling the products

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.860
of the individual events
in the intersection.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.470
So that there are two to
the n possible collections

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.912
of subsets of A1
through An and you

00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:46.120
have to check for each of
them, that the intersection

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.782
of those ones that you chose
is equal to the product

00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:50.740
of their probabilities.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.220
But of course, you don't need
to check the empty selection.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.360
And you don't need to
check the single [? set ?],

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.150
so you just have to
check the 2 to the n

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.830
equations corresponding
to all the subsets of size

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.320
more than one.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.390
So it's 2 to the n minus n
plus 1 equations to check.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.730
So in general, it's
not going to be

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.550
easy to verify mutual
independence by doing

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.220
this kind of a calculation.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.180
And you usually
arrive at it really

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.270
by assumption most of the time.
