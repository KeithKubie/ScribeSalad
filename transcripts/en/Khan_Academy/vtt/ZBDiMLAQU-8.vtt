00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.512
- [Voiceover] Kenisha is asked
to subtract seven B squared

00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:05.484
minus five B plus one from two B squared

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:07.410
plus three B plus 11.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.058
Her work is shown below and we see

00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:10.475
all the steps that she took.

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:13.725
And then they say at which
step did Kenisha make an error?

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:15.445
And it's pretty clear she made an error,

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:16.791
because they're not giving us an option

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:17.883
that she didn't make an error.

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.577
So let's see what went on here.

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:21.875
So the first thing is, we want to subtract

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.918
seven B squared minus five B plus one,

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:27.612
we want to subtract
that from two B squared

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:30.166
plus three B plus 11.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.232
And we see that in step
one she set it up properly.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.483
She is indeed subtracting,

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:37.410
she is indeed subtracting
seven B squared minus

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.848
five B plus one from

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:43.125
two B squared plus three B plus 11.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.195
That's fair.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:46.215
Alright, so step one seems to be okay.

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.793
Now let's see step two,

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:50.091
it looks like she's going to
distribute the negative sign,

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.692
so the negative of seven B squared is,

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:54.665
as you can see is
negative seven B squared.

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.594
We're gonna subtract seven B squared.

00:00:56.594 --> 00:01:01.594
And then you have the
negative of negative five B.

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:04.233
Well that's going to be positive five B.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:05.835
So this right over here,

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:08.250
this one over here should,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.479
this over here should
be a positive five B.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.545
Let me do that in a new color.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.378
So this should be a positive five B.

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:18.140
And then the negative of positive one,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.254
this should be a negative one.

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:21.785
That should be a negative
one right over there.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.457
So she's making a mistake,

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.174
she's making a mistake in step two

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:29.263
when she distributes this negative sign.

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:32.490
So step two is where she made,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.625
is where she actually made her error.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.506
From there it seem reasonable,

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:41.452
she is subtracting the coefficients
on the B squared terms,

00:01:41.452 --> 00:01:44.309
so two B squared minus seven B squared,

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:46.328
gets us this right over there.

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:51.328
Then on the B terms, you
have three B and then,

00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:52.366
let's see,

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:55.291
you have, it should be three B plus five B

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:56.964
if she distributed the
negative sign right,

00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:58.774
but since she didn't distribute
the negative sign right,

00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:01.793
she has three B minus five B.

00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:04.626
And it should be 11 minus one,

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:07.806
but since she didn't do
the distribution correctly,

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:09.363
we have 11,

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:12.637
it should be 11 minus
one, as we said before,

00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:14.423
because you're gonna
distribute this negative sign,

00:02:14.423 --> 00:02:16.374
but she left that as a plus one

00:02:16.374 --> 00:02:18.163
and so that's why she got that over there.

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:20.903
So her real mistake was
clearly in step two.

00:02:20.903 --> 00:02:22.898
'Cause from there on she's
doing reasonable things,

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:24.821
it's just she made that one error.
