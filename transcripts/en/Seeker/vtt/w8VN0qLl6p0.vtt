00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.410
No credit card?

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.030
No problem!

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.730
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you
are sick of hearing about all these credit

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.460
card and data breaches, you are not alone.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.520
Michaels Craft Store - one of the happiest
places on earth - announced recently that

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.210
2 separate 8-month-long security breaches
at its stores last year may have exposed as

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.369
many as 3 million customer credit and debit
cards.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.400
Between this, last year's Target breach, and
the crazy data theft that happened in South

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.540
Korea earlier this year - it might be time
to consider some alternative payment methods.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.070
And that's exactly what one Swedish startup
is trying to do.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.110
Quixter is a company founded by former students
of Sweden's Lund University, and it allows

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.830
users to pay for items at a checkout with
a simple swipe of their hand.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.220
It's a new form of biometric scanning, that
uses the unique pattern of veins inside your

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.890
palm to identify you.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.210
Unlike fingerprint scanners, which can leave
behind prints - the creators of this technology

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.150
claim there's no possible way to commit fraud
with this system, because it doesn't require

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.960
physical contact with the user.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640
The other obvious benefit, is that it reduces
the amount of time consumers spend waiting

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.080
in line at stores.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.030
The hand swipe itself takes only a couples
seconds, but Quixter also requires users to

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.510
enter the last 4 digits of their phone number.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.380
Which isn't so much an added security measure,
as it is a way for users to see exactly how

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.480
much they're being charged before they pay
for something.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.280
Similar vein-scanning hardware has been used
in Japanese and Brazilian ATMS for years now,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.210
but this is one of the first instances of
it being used specifically for payment processing.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.370
US company BiYo, formerly known as PulseWallet
- was technically the first to develop this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.070
technology - for which they claim near-perfect
results, citing one false positive for every

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.960
1.25 million scans.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.950
Unfortunately, it may be a while before anyone
sees Quixter's technology outside of Sweden.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.580
The system is currently active in only a handful
of locations surrounding the university's

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.909
campus - with a total of around 1,600 users,
mostly students.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.620
The company does plan to expand their reach
- but the biggest hurdle, they say, is getting

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.680
businesses and banks on board.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.060
Signing up as a user, is as easy as going
to a store, registering your social security

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.090
and phone numbers, and linking your bank account
online.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.380
It seems simple enough, but I've seen a lot
of mixed responses to this online.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.379
Let us know in the comments below if this
is something you would ever considering using.
