00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.455
Part of the work I've done with couples revolves around kind of the sexual

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:08.550
scripts, which are the sexual response cycles that I see couples come in with.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.865
And it's almost like they have this preconditioned idea that this is the story

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.823
I'm supposed to have for sex and if it doesn't go this way, then there's

00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:19.267
something wrong. And so, I have to talk with him about, you know what, that's

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:21.951
just the story that we have in the United States, mainly from this medical

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:28.405
point of view. But, you can write your sexual script any way you want. So, it

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:32.960
doesn't have to end in orgasm. It doesn't have to start out with this massive

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.744
building up of desire and excitement. it can go any way that you want it to and

00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:41.059
that's what's really important as people need to understand that they really

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.330
own their sexual response cycle. And they own their sexual script. And it

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.976
really can be written and rewritten any way that's, that's comfortable for

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:52.880
them. So we know that there's a difference in sexual response depending on the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.980
culture but do women and men have different orgasms. Even though a lot of

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.880
people orgasms whether it be through self stimulation self love or partnered or

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.724
partnered experiences, many people do orgasms. However, there are large

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:12.760
percentages of people who do not. again a lot of times that does tend to be

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.282
women who experience more difficulty orgaziming. On average, the orgasm, kind

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:24.542
of experience is the shortest part of a sexual response cycle. Unless of

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:28.050
course, you're, you know, a pig in which case, it's like thirty minutes long.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.560
But, humans are very short cycled for their orgasm but that really varies from

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.171
person to person as well. So, for some people an orgasm might last like thirty

00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:41.706
seconds, for other people it could last a matter of minutes. and actually woman

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:47.770
tend to have longer orgasms than men. or are capable of longer orgasms. Women,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.790
when they do orgasm are also able to have multiple orgasms pretty consecutively

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.920
in a row pretty easily compared to their male counterpart. So, once a woman

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.700
kind of figures out how to have an orgasm, she actually has more opportunity

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.428
for longer orgasms and more of them in comparison to men. However in general,

00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:10.991
more women do struggle to kind of learn how to orgasm. And I say learn how to

00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:14.489
orgasm because one of the biggest differences is just is an, it's an anatomical

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.273
difference, right. So men they have basically all of their equipment right in

00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:22.771
front of them on the outside, you know, their penis is right in front of them,

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:28.210
their testicles is right in front of them. So it's, it's very easy to kind of

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.868
self explore and figure it out what to do, right. With women, most of the

00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:37.545
equipment is internal. so it's very difficult to kind of figure out what, what

00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:42.723
your body's doing, what something feels like. I mean and there's a difference

00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:44.373
between a clitoral orgasm and a

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:45.054
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:49.539
spot orgasm or a G-spot orgasm. And a lot of women, it takes a lot of

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:55.450
exploration before they're really able to have an orgasm in either location.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.230
And a lot of the holdup for women is just that many societies, pretty much

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.785
across the globe, many societies have put restrictions on women. social

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.745
restrictions, moral restrictions, religious restrictions where they're, they're

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:12.210
kind of sent this message that sex is something that they're not supposed to

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.167
enjoy. And doesn't really, their needs really aren't all that important in

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:22.021
terms of desire, arousal and orgasm. And so, it's very challenging to, for

00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:26.494
women not only because it's anatomical differences to orgasm because we have to

00:03:26.494 --> 00:03:32.777
learn. But they also have to tear down kind of this societal block or wall that

00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:38.969
has been created in their mind around not being able to orgasm. So, couple

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.131
things I recommend for people when I see clients, especially women who are

00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.430
struggling to have an orgasm and they want to have an orgasm. It's okay if

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.490
people don't want to orgasm too. That's fine. but what I recommend when they do

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.272
is, a lot of self exploration, so getting to know their own body. And then a

00:03:55.272 --> 00:03:59.688
lot of, just cognitive behavioral therapies to work on the fact that it's

00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:04.242
totally normative and natural to have sexual feelings and to feel good when

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:09.320
you're engaging in certain behaviors.
