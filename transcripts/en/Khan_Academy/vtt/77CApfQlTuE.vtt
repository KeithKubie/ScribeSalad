00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.960
In the last video
we saw that if we

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.520
had a market with
perfect competition,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.860
and if the current
short-term equilibrium

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.870
price is above the
price the necessary

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.770
or is above the price at which
firms would be generating

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.720
economic profit, then
more and more firms

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.710
would start entering.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.652
Because if the economic
profit is positive,

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.110
then that means
it's a better place

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.120
to use your resources than
whatever your opportunity

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.320
cost is, that
you're making profit

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.690
above and beyond your
opportunity cost.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.420
So more and more
people enter it.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.920
So after a little bit,
after one company enters it,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.190
or maybe the same firms
starts adding more seat miles

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.110
or adding more planes, than we
have another short-term supply

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.264
curve that looks like that.

00:00:41.264 --> 00:00:42.930
And then there's a
new equilibrium price

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.305
that's a little bit lower,
and a new equilibrium quantity

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:46.760
that's a little bit higher.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.820
And that keeps happening.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.850
Still your equilibrium price
was higher than your price

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.510
necessary for a normal profit,
or a zero economic profit.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.210
And so more people enter still.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.690
And so we have another
short-term supply curve.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.785
And we move further
to the bottom right

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:03.660
of this demand curve.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.960
And it keeps happening until
we have a supply curve, where

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.340
the equilibrium price, where
this new short-term equilibrium

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.790
price, is the same as the price
at which everyone is making

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.010
a normal profit, or the
price needed for zero

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.980
economic profit.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.710
At that point,
people are neutral

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.670
whether they drop out or
enter into the market,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.110
and so the quantity
remains stable.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.350
And so that's why we view
each of these curves over here

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.880
as our short-run supply curves.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.007
But this line right over here--
let me do this in a new color,

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:37.840
let me do it in yellow,
this line over here,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.970
we've talked about this
in previous videos--

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.060
that's why this line over here
we call our long-run supply

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.700
curve.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.880
Because depending on whether
the equilibrium price is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.380
above or below
this, at some point,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.670
supply will enter
or exit the system

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.150
so that we eventually
get back to some point

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.280
along this long-run supply
curve right over here.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.256
Now, this was assuming
perfect competition.

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:01.630
Many players,
identical products,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.360
we did it for air travel,
no barriers to entry.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.160
Let's think about
what happens if we

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.421
have the exact opposite
of perfect competition.

00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:12.170
So we're going to start
at the same point.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.290
We're going to start there.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.373
So we're going to start
at the green supply curve.

00:02:15.373 --> 00:02:18.016
And we have this
orange demand curve.

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:20.390
But let's say that instead of
having perfect competition,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.160
we live in a country
where-- and there

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.730
are countries like
this-- where they

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.460
say there's only one air
carrier that can do business.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.900
It is the national air
carrier in our country.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.820
And so instead of many players,
we now have one player.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.070
And then obviously,
it's identical product.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.280
Well, they only have
one product, one player.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.920
Huge barriers to entry.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.790
No one else.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.810
You could also say
infinite barriers to entry.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.850
No one else by law is
allowed to enter into this.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.570
So I'm going to
the extreme case.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.220
And obviously, there is
the ultimate advantage

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.490
for the existing player.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.310
They are the one
that the government

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.440
is allowing to participate.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.610
And price information, we
don't really care about.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.339
There's only one price quote
coming from one player.

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.130
Now when we do that,
when we talk about one

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.440
player as the only
player in the market,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.810
we are not talking about
perfect competition.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.005
We are then talking
about a monopoly.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.080
And it is the same
word as perhaps one

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.300
of your favorite board games.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.920
And the point of
that board game is

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.600
to own all of the properties
of one of those colors.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.150
So at least in the framework
of that board game,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.740
of the Monopoly board game,
the Parker Brothers board game,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.750
you have a monopoly on the blue.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.640
If you own Park
Place and Boardwalk,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.994
you have a monopoly on
that part of the market.

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:44.410
So then that's
what you try to do.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.050
When you have a monopoly, you
can then charge higher prices

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.600
for when someone
lands on your space.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.140
And something very
similar will happen here.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.130
Now, we only have one player.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.440
And let's say right now the
equilibrium price is higher

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.900
than the price you need to
have zero economic profit.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.260
So you have one player, and
that player is definitely

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.900
getting some serious
economic profit.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.040
Well, they can just sit there,
because no one else can enter.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.140
You're not going to
have this trend where

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.950
more and more supply
gets on the market

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.250
until you get to this
long-run supply curve.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.040
In fact, there will not be
this long-run supply curve.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.730
The long-run supply curve
is whatever, frankly,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.860
the monopolist decides
they want to do.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.980
If this is where their
profits are optimized,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.884
they'll do there.

00:04:28.884 --> 00:04:30.800
In fact, they can even
go the other direction.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.140
Even though they're already
making some economic profit,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.450
they might determine,
hey, we can make even more

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.090
economic profit if we lower
the quantity offered even more.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.582
So they might even take
supply out of the market.

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:43.040
And so they could
have a new supply

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.680
curve that looks like this.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.710
And we have a new equilibrium
price that is even higher.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.600
And it's at a lower
equilibrium quantity.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.724
They could even do it more.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:52.500
They could even raise
price even more.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.810
And so then you have a
new equilibrium price

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.280
that is up here, and a
lower equilibrium quantity.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.330
So clearly, when you have a
monopoly, something not so good

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.760
is happening for the consumer.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.980
They're able to raise price.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.380
It's actually not
even efficient,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.070
because the optimal quantity
is not being produced.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.950
But I want to leave
you there and maybe

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.635
leave you with something
to think about.

00:05:13.635 --> 00:05:15.510
I said that the monopolists
now, because they

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.070
don't have to worry about
other people entering in

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.457
to lower the price and get
to this normal profit line,

00:05:21.457 --> 00:05:23.290
because they don't have
to worry about that,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.600
they can set their quantity
to whatever they want.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.880
Or I guess another way
you can think about it,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.230
they can set their prices to
whatever they want and get

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.530
the corresponding quantity.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.820
But the question is,
how do they set that?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.920
How would they determine
where along this curve

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.000
that they would like to
either set the price,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.210
or I guess you could say set the
quantity by limiting production

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.100
in some way?
