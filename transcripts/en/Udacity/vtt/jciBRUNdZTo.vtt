00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.760
Surprisingly, in this case, the answer is the global object.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.000
When you don't have a dot to help you pass a specific binding for

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.140
the keyword this, JavaScript binds this by default to the global object.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.730
This can be seen as similar to the fact that JavaScript binds undefined to

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.160
positional parameters when we call the function without enough inputs.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.720
So if we had passed no inputs in between these parentheses,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.880
we would expect one and two to be undefined.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.720
A similar line of reasoning leads us to the conclusion that the default object

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.460
of global would be bound to this whenever we don't have a dot.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.710
The dot is the mechanism by which we pass in a binding for the keyword this.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.730
So without a dot,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.290
you could expect that some default value to get bound to the parameter this.
