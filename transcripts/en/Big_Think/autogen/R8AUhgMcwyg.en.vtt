affairs first is look we live in one of
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740
affairs first is look we live in one of

science has conquered a lot when it
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.969
science has conquered a lot when it
comes to disease and so I think the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
comes to disease and so I think the
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.730
comes to disease and so I think the
expectation is the next new thing in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
expectation is the next new thing in
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.999

that's a large reason why doctors are

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
that's a large reason why doctors are
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.670
that's a large reason why doctors are
uncomfortable about talking about this

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
uncomfortable about talking about this
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399
uncomfortable about talking about this
but also we as a society don't like to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
but also we as a society don't like to
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.870
