1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,163
Hmm.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,560
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:07,561
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,410
March 27th, 2017 2017 fuck
a decades flying bike.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:15,830
Yeah.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,140
You know what? I'm the 2011, 1213.

7
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:21,770
Can somebody tell me that 14 was cool?

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,670
Vaguely remember 15 and
then 16 and you know,

9
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:28,220
I want to thank everyone who
whined so much about it last year,

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,590
the worst year ever. I mean, that
one's pretty vivid. Lot of crying,

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,541
lots of crying.

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,810
And I don't mean for the right reasons
like David Bowie and prince passing,

13
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:41,210
but you know, you know Hillary
losing and that type of shit a lot.

14
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:45,530
A lot of crying, a lot of whining. Um,

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,290
anyways, I uh,

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,090
okay.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,260
I don't even know what
the fuck to tell you.

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,260
I've been a did being
fucking daddy daycare here.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,510
You know what I did for the first
time we finally went out, right?

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,330
Me And d were going fucking
crazy. Cause you have a baby,

21
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:03,650
you have a little baby. Yeah. Have
a little lady. This is the thing,

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,920
if it's your first kid, you fucking
scared to death. You're like,

23
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,620
I can't take this thing outside.
It's going to get a bowler.

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,210
You get all fucking nervous, you know,

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,710
and then it's gotta get his
fucking immunizations and
all of that type of shit.

26
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:23,570
And he just let go neo. Who Do I
fucking believe here? Jesus Christ.

27
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:28,190
I'll tell you those fucking shots. This
is what I actually, I just sat down.

28
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:32,090
I was like, nobody who's ever been in
the medical field told me not to do it.

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,080
I've had comedians, high school friends,

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,160
a fucking actresses,

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,860
a bunch of non doctors have advised to go,

32
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:46,670
what am I not going to get her
fucking vaccinated for polio? No,

33
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:49,670
it's that what it is
in fish. Shut the fuck.

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,680
Do you even own a lab code?

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,090
All you're doing is scaring
the shit out of me. So anyways,

36
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,260
um, so we were, you know, you fucking
afraid. So finally we were just like,

37
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:05,040
all right, fuck this. We
got a Stroller, you know.

38
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,290
So we started taking
walks around the block,

39
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,270
but my block has like the shittiest
sidewalk. It's like a, you know,

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,350
the ground's all shifted out here.
There's tree roots pushing it up.

41
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,500
You have no idea when you just
walk down the street, you know,

42
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,190
you start pushing the strolling, you're
trying to keep the kid quiet, you know,

43
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,790
cause she finally fell asleep. It's like
I'm pushing my daughter up the street.

44
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,800
It's like fucking linked to liquid
nitrogen. I'm just trying to keep her,

45
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:32,700
I don't want to say I'll start
crying, middle of the street,

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,520
just going down the street,
waking everybody up.

47
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,610
And I guess they were already
awake. I Dunno. So, um,

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,080
we finally ended up going to
the mall. I had that experience.

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,340
I went to the mall with
my wife and my kid.

50
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,260
We pulled in at a take out a stroller,
take her out of the car seat,

51
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:56,340
put her in and start walking around
the mall. And I gotta tell you,

52
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,210
it was fucking awesome. I, for the
first time in my life, I get the mall,

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,540
I get it. You know,

54
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,500
it's for teenage kids when they're trying
to get away from their parents, like,

55
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,630
mom, just leave me alone,
whatever. With friends,

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,560
that era before you have a license
really. And you can't really go anywhere.

57
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,830
You just need some sense of
fucking freedom. And it's for what?

58
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,120
After you become a parent,

59
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,390
you have to get out of the fucking
house into some sort of controlled

60
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,660
environment where there's enough God
damn people that you don't have to worry

61
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:29,590
about anybody snatch and your
goddamn kid, you know. Um,

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,720
so we walked around and uh,
just had a great fucking time,

63
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,980
was like the perfect day and uh, you know,

64
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,820
neo was all excited to be
out because uh, you know,

65
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,580
women just to have Jesus the shit
they go through being being the guy,

66
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,130
it's the best. I swear to
God it's why they fucking,

67
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,880
I think it's why they make our
lives so god damn miserable is they,

68
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,170
they see how easy it is.

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,020
And the thing is is we don't realize
how easy it is cause we've only been us,

70
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,370
you know what I mean? How long
it takes them to get ready.

71
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,930
Okay.

72
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,220
Do you know how long it
takes me to get ready now?

73
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,890
I've got a fucking shaved head. I
mean I don't even have to do anything.

74
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,740
You could literally hose me off in
the backyard and I could, you know,

75
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,850
I'd be ready in like seven
minutes, easy, seven minutes.

76
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,670
Cause I always got to run around and
find my cell phone for like five of those

77
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:20,510
minutes. But you know, if I,

78
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,990
if I actually was organized and knew
where all my shit was, I could be,

79
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,610
I could be writing like
three minutes. Um, anyways.

80
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,590
Yeah, they go through all of
that shit. You know what I mean?

81
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,910
You gotta breastfeed, they gotta, they
gotta they gotta pump all of that crap.

82
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,650
I don't have to do any of
that. You know what I mean?

83
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:41,030
So she was going fucking
nuts dealing with, um,

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,460
everything that nature put on her.

85
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,400
And she finally had to get out of the
house and it's the happiest I've seen her.

86
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,050
We walked around, had a
great time. You know what?

87
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:51,500
They haven't malls now this is second
mall I've been to that they have like a

88
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:55,480
Tesla, um, store. Like
you can go and like,

89
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,750
who the fuck just goes to the mall
and buys a car? You know what I mean?

90
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:02,750
You go there, you buy sunglasses,
right? A fucking Hula Hoop, whatever,

91
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:06,920
whatever it is, you buy it, buy a
car. So I, you know, I can't resist.

92
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,960
I got to go in there, right? And I'm
like, what's the deal with this thing?

93
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:12,920
Zero to 60 what do you, what are you
2.5 the guy's like 2.3 that's amazing.

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,540
I was up in San Jose.

95
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:18,620
The Guy told me 2.5 you shaved off
in another two hundreds of a second.

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,990
And I'm like, all right. So I get
four adults in there and he goes,

97
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:24,741
you can get five.

98
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,480
And I go and I'm still going to
go zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds.

99
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,790
It doesn't make any sense. All
that weight. What am I up to there?

100
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh 2.93 and he goes, yeah,
probably two six. It's like,

101
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,060
what are you basing that on?

102
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:39,800
Other than the fact that you
want to make a commission?

103
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,150
What am I basing mine on? I don't
fucking know. So he goes, all right,

104
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:49,790
let's take a look at this over. I go,
dude, I just bought a car. I love it.

105
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,160
I'm not going to buy a car and we tell
you right now, but I just want to see,

106
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,460
you know, if I got the car that I wanted,
what this thing's going to cost me,

107
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,410
right? So I I go give me the one
with the motor, the all wheel drive.

108
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,890
Alright, I went black.

109
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,070
I didn't want to get the black interior
cause it's hot as shit out here, right?

110
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,280
So the guy goes, do you want the fucking,
the full moon roof and everything?

111
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,120
I go, dude, look at me. Oh I'm
almost an albino and I have a shade.

112
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,660
Had DD fucking and he goes down all
the tents, crazy on it. And I said,

113
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,030
all right, put it on the
fucking car. What do I care?

114
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,660
I'm not buying this thing right. Give
me the best you know, best tires,

115
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:26,900
best rims, best, best fucking
everything. Then they had this thing,

116
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,950
oh know for five grand when you get on
the highway kind of drives it kind of

117
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:34,040
helps you. And I was like, dude,
why would I buy a car like this?

118
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,920
And have something else dry. I want to
drive it. I don't need that shit. Right.

119
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,160
So that I didn't get everything
else I got in in the end.

120
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,940
I took a picture of it. I forget
how much it costs. Ah, fuck.

121
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,200
I don't need the exact number in the end.

122
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,920
You know what it costs
hundred and $52,000.

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,333
Okay.

124
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,330
Oh fuck. And what kills me.

125
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:59,450
Someone's going to go to the mall and
buy one of those hundred 52,000 fucking

126
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:03,260
dollars. I just wish they looked cooler.

127
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,320
I love the fucking tires and
everything and there's is, you know,

128
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:10,070
if you get the right tires and rims
and shit really helped that car and the

129
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:13,700
front end definitely looks better,
but I dunno man, you don't,

130
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,710
it looks like it looks like
that for two a portion.

131
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,460
It's ugly as shit had Panamera
whatever that, you know,

132
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,740
you don't think like always
try to do that in like the uh,

133
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,720
the car commercials will, they have
a two door car. They have the dad,

134
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,060
then he has the baby and then he grabs
the bumper and he turns it into a four

135
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:33,920
door car. Like, Oh wow, this is like a
sports car, but it's a four door sedan.

136
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,660
No it isn't. It's a four
door sedan and it won't,

137
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,320
but that's trying to be a sports
car and then it becomes ugly.

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,970
That's why I liked the Mercedes,

139
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,320
the BMW in the jet and the Jaguars
because they still look like cars,

140
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,650
like four door sedan. Then you step
on the gas. It's like, Oh shit,

141
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:52,730
look at this. Who Knew I'm
aren't talking about here.

142
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,190
Anyway, so we ended up having a, a a
great time and uh, I walked by the, um,

143
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,470
the fucking split stories, that
thing, whatever, whoever, uh,

144
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,210
the one that looks, looks like the
letter h, it's not Nike or Adidas,

145
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:12,560
it's the other one is the one that
fucking Steph curry has an in the window

146
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,580
there, these ugly ass basketball shoes.
And I looked in and said curry threes.

147
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,123
Yeah,

148
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,100
dude, gun to your head.
What do you like better than

149
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,220
the Colby eleven's or the curry threes?
I don't know. Do the curry threes,

150
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,350
you know, with a fucking Chris
pair of jeans and a Hoodie

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,060
over we you chain on the outside.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,330
Okay.

153
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,890
Male fashion needs do Jordan threes.

154
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,220
All right. Jordan trees. Okay.

155
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,970
With the pair of Joe's
jeans. All alright. And,

156
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,790
and a button down in a new Yankee dude.

157
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,900
New Yankee had two and a slice of pizza.

158
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,570
Does it get any better?

159
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,410
Playing playstation on the TV and
inside down this cowboy stadium.

160
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,690
Crazy ultimate bachelor party dude.

161
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,840
A pair of fucking Jordan nine
right jeans cuffed creased with,

162
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:30,850
with an Abercrombie and
Fitch v-neck t shirt,

163
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,770
extra soft

164
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,950
play play station with the slice of
pizza in a fucking cowboy stadium.

165
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,330
Does it get any better than that dude?

166
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,133
Okay,

167
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,500
I'm sorry. I don't know what it is.

168
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,440
I like sneakers and I've actually been
buying some, I just liked the old ones.

169
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,280
Like I got a pair of shell toes and I
got a pair early eighties fucking Adidas

170
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:58,820
like high tops. Like I liked that
shit. Like, I dunno what the,

171
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:02,210
when fucking Picasso started designing
these goddamn things, it's like,

172
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,740
it makes no sense. Um, I'm going
to get in trouble for this shit.

173
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,830
I'm going to say later on in this podcast
that I didn't know what the fuck to

174
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:14,810
tell you. I get some shout outs to do.
I never give shout outs. Right. And um,

175
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,460
I just had a bunch that would
just pile it up and I'm like,

176
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:21,920
I finally got to give out some
fucking shout outs and then,

177
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,750
but I just never get around to them.
It's extra work. I never give a fuck.

178
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,580
But then finally somebody tipped
me over the fucking edge. Right.

179
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,820
Laura is, I gotta gotta I gotta give
this person a shout out. All right,

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,790
so first of all, let's, let's get the, uh,

181
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,900
let's get the opener and
the feature out of the way.

182
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,060
A shout out to Eric and Bose for
hooking me up with some of those Bose

183
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:48,500
headphones. I was bitching about, um,
people being loud in, uh, you know,

184
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:51,350
on the plane and shit. And by the way,
this is not so I can get more free shit.

185
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,220
I don't want any more shit. I'm getting
rid of Shit. If you give me free shit,

186
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,880
I'm going to give it away or I'm going
to send it down to fucking goodwill and

187
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:01,400
it's going to end up in a truck that
sits in a warehouse and they're going to

188
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:06,200
dump it and then, Oh shit. So I don't
want any shit, you know, and nice email.

189
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,680
Hey Bill, like you stuff, that's just
fine. Okay. But if somebody did send me,

190
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,300
you gotta say thank you. Right. All
right. Shout out to Eric at Bose and then,

191
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,370
uh, James Shotwell. Um, I
did this thing this weekend,

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,953
um,

193
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,140
rock against ms where I got to give
an award to a Richard Pryor's widow,

194
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:30,290
Jennifer Pryor, and uh, you know,

195
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,750
Richard suffered from that disease and
of course he turned it into comedy and

196
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:38,240
set out the disease, actually slowed
him down so he could live longer. Um,

197
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:43,190
which is really fascinating
that, that's probably true. Um,

198
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,710
and anyways, James Shotwell was
down there doing, I don't know,

199
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,830
working like the sound, I've got to
see all these fucking killer bands,

200
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,360
these amalgams,

201
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,840
like fucking Alison chains with
Nancy Wilson from heart coming out,

202
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,260
crushing it. Then she
brought her new a band out,

203
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,000
road case royal and they fucking killed
it too. She's a, she's still a beast.

204
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,400
I got to see Steven Adler
play with an all star band.

205
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:14,200
He played um, the hell did he
play? He played, uh, the Ramones.

206
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,670
I want to be sedated and then I got to
stand at like 10 feet away from him.

207
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,630
I got to watch him play.

208
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:23,410
Welcome to the jungle and rocket
Queen and see all this subtle,

209
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,390
all these little subtle things
that he's, first of all,

210
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:29,170
I get to see all the genius drum parts
that fit so perfectly to that song.

211
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,060
And then just the different ways that
he played them. Um, you know that part,

212
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,310
you know, so, uh, no, no, no, no, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. It's really,

213
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:42,640
I always thought he was on both times.
He's just riding on the floor, Tom.

214
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,010
And on the second scenario
it comes over with the Flint.

215
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,830
That's that little shit when you're
a drum nerd like me. I'm like,

216
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,460
that's how we fucking plays it. And I
got the, of course he was Cooley Shit,

217
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,470
you know, he's such a fucking
great guy, man. Had, you know,

218
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,230
a couple people were there that had MSC,

219
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,660
let him fucking sit like right
behind them while he played.

220
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,290
When he finished playing, he came out,

221
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,230
he high fived everybody
in the front row do.

222
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:08,980
We were at the La Theater in
downtown La and it was um,

223
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,100
okay.

224
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,780
I guess it was a theater was
designed by Charlie Chaplin. Okay.

225
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,060
And when you walk in in the foyer,

226
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:22,920
there's a picture of Charlie Chaplin
walking in the night at first opened with

227
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:27,240
Albert Einstein. And uh,

228
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,130
of course I missed that photo.
Somebody told me it was there,

229
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:33,830
but downstairs they have this kid's
room that still has the original paints.

230
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:35,340
So they say don't touch the walls.

231
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,370
And of course it's all these
creepy fucking drawings.

232
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,130
Like being a kid was so
fucking scary back then.

233
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,350
All these creepy drawings of
clowns and horses and shit. And um,

234
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,770
someone was trying to claim, and I
refuse to believe that this is true,

235
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,740
that they, that's where you brought
your babies when they cried.

236
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:55,350
And if they got really loud, they
had these little like cabinets,

237
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:58,050
you just opened the door and you put
the baby in, you closed the door.

238
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,950
It's like even downstairs
they could still hear it.

239
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,650
I refuse to believe that that's
true. But, um, I ended up,

240
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,660
I call hosted it with Craig Gas,

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
who that guys impressions of fucking
unbelievable man is Sam Kinison is Gene

242
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,180
Simmons, Sebastian Bach. And he's
hung out with all of these guys.

243
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:21,960
So he has all these unreal stories
and he does dead on impressions of Jim

244
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,730
Florentine was there. Um, it was
an amazing fucking night. So,

245
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,390
um,

246
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,080
thank you to Nancy sail for putting that
whole thing on and I'll do it any year

247
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:34,380
that they want. And
then lastly, but Lezley

248
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,650
um, got it. We got a,

249
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:42,651
actually I got a request from
somebody who says that she's a fan,

250
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:46,770
a lady fan of the podcast
that my stand up, but a,

251
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:51,180
what she requested I
guess is already over. Ah,

252
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,180
she's trying to be, uh,

253
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,240
in next year's sports illustrated
swimsuit, Lisa Marie Jafta.

254
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,690
But the voting's already
closed. So I don't know.

255
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,920
I don't know if it was real or not.

256
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:06,080
I immediately didn't believe
that it was a real email.

257
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:09,980
And then she sent a video golf. Now,
seriously, I know you're a bald,

258
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,440
middle-aged content, but I
actually liked your stuff.

259
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,550
If you could send your listeners
over to vote for me, you know,

260
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:21,380
maybe I could get in the issue
next year. And uh, I dunno,

261
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,440
that's such a weird world.
You know what I mean?

262
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,370
You don't need that fuck myth about that
world was one time Nia had been watched

263
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,340
this fucking thing about
it and they had this creep

264
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,550
that was like the Goto guy and
he called himself uncle Terry.

265
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:46,100
Anybody who's not your uncle ladies,
anybody who's not your uncle.

266
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,790
And he says, just call me uncle so
and so. Yeah, he's trying to fuck you.

267
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,133
He's a fucking,

268
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,260
this guy was one of the creepiest fucking
people I've ever seen in my God damn

269
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:59,240
life. Um, so anyways, my apologies.

270
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:01,760
The voting is already fucking over,
but I don't even know if this,

271
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,460
I don't even know if it was real to
be honest with you, but you know what?

272
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,670
I'm a middle aged bald man and I that's
wanting to believe that that's true.

273
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,070
Is it? That's really all I have.

274
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,420
Um, and speaking of swimsuit models, oh,

275
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,820
la Billie fat tits area's been fucking
doing great on the elliptical of back at

276
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:29,720
it, man. I'm back at it. I fucked up
last night and had a glass of booze,

277
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,690
all the booze one last
night I just added a glass,

278
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:37,280
which is probably considered a triple
in any fucking hipster bar. But, um,

279
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,420
I was going to go to bed. I
wasn't gonna have it, you know,

280
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,010
I've been doing good. I stopped
eating at five and 1130. You know,

281
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,180
Nia had come home. I was hanging out
with my daughter, the whole nightmare.

282
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,450
She was a riot. She was
a riot. Jesus Christ out.

283
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,680
She had two apocalyptic fucking
diapers yesterday. That was just like,

284
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,870
it's just like really, I don't think,
I don't think I, I don't think I,

285
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:07,871
we've bought enough provisions
to ever get this fixed again.

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,590
So, um, she came home late and,

287
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,330
uh, and I was just going to go to bed
and I kept playing that mental tennis.

288
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,950
Should I have a glass? Don't
have glass, try to lose weight.

289
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:25,340
Should I have a glass? Don't. And then
finally the booze was just looking like,

290
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:29,840
come on. You know what the booze was like?
It was like Jimmy the gent, you know,

291
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,570
after they fucking did the
lift, one's the highest.

292
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:35,590
However you say the bottle
is just over there and going

293
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,530
[inaudible] and Henry comes
walking in. So I add one.

294
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:46,430
So I dunno. Um, it like one 80, 1.2,

295
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,520
and I've just been in the 80s. I
hate being in the 80s. That's one.

296
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,480
That's when I just,

297
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,230
and when I shift my weight around on the
couch just to go reach for the remote,

298
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,800
you just feel the role's going
home on the side of you. You know,

299
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,940
I don't know how people do it.

300
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:02,280
I don't know how you just walk
around being a fucking fat body.

301
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,010
I don't know why you tolerate that.
You got one fucking life and you knew,

302
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,950
you know God damn well
in the back of your head.

303
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:12,720
You don't know where you go after this.
Okay. Let's say best case scenario,

304
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:17,080
you get reincarnated. All right?
Cause the whole heaven health thing,

305
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,350
it's the same thing every
day. After a while it's,

306
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,260
it's not even gonna have any value. What
are you like me on fire again? Okay,

307
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,350
what does it, another perfect day. Oh boy,

308
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,830
you're going to be like those
teenagers at the mall. Oh God,

309
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:35,150
I'm so bored. Right? Um, best case
scenario, you get reincarnated.

310
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:38,510
The fucking odds that you're going to
come back again as a human being. I mean,

311
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:42,020
you know, if you can come
back as a fucking mouse or
some shit, like, you know,

312
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,380
fucking run around almost
having a heart attack. His,

313
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:50,150
some reptile is slowly tracking
you getting eaten alive. You know,

314
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,330
this is the best she got. So you can
fucking sit here and become a tub of shit.

315
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:56,930
You don't want you, you owe it to
yourself. So this is what I've been doing.

316
00:18:56,931 --> 00:19:01,730
This has been the breakfast of a freckled
champion. Um, every morning I wake up,

317
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:04,790
go do to do dude, and I go
out to the garage and, um,

318
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,110
what do I do? I go to, um,

319
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,100
I go in the fucking elliptical as my, um,

320
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,870
my rotator cuff is slowly getting
better. Today. I did some lady pushups.

321
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,730
I was going to do 20. I was like, don't
push it. Stop to 12, stopped at 12,

322
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:26,180
just trying to keep the fucking man
tits from sagging down into my navel.

323
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,690
Um, and I do like a half hour on the, uh,

324
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,410
on the elliptical and then it come in
and for breakfast I have one of those

325
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:40,040
little oranges and I
have a, a, a poached egg

326
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,010
and that's it. And then I have a
banana between there and lunch.

327
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,780
And then for lunch I have some
sort of protein, a, you know,

328
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:53,600
maybe with a little bit of bread, some
sort of Ghana. I know breads the enemy,

329
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:57,380
go fuck yourself. Um, it's the
only bread I have. And then

330
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,020
I don't know what the fuck it is.

331
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,220
Then I have a protein with the salad
at four protein with the salad at six,

332
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:07,160
and then I'm done. Then I just drink
waters for the rest of the night.

333
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,820
In theory, unless the fucking
Jimmy, the jet moment happens.

334
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,940
And I get fucked over. Um, anyways. Uh,

335
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,540
so I have to do this shit. I gotta
get my ass back down. I can't,

336
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:25,010
my birthday's coming up in June. I'm
going to be 49 fucking years old,

337
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,650
which I'm actually pretty, I'm all
right with it. Once you have a kid,

338
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:31,530
you kind of are right with being old.
You're like, other than that, yeah. Yeah.

339
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,990
And I'm 47. I don't have a kid.

340
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,680
I'm just going to die alone.

341
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,720
I'm going to be 49 and there's no fucking
way I'm going to be in the one 80.

342
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,270
So it's just not going to happen.
I'm telling you right now,

343
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:48,220
I am going to be one 72 my fighting
weight, where the hell I want to be.

344
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,840
My shoulder's going to be healed.

345
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,350
And I have a bet with Paul Versey
that when I'm 70 years old,

346
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:54,790
I'm going to be able to do 10 pull ups.

347
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,600
And if I don't get this
rotator cuff fixed, uh,

348
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,270
I'm going to be fucked because all
I keep thinking about is Jordan,

349
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,050
when he came back on
the wizards, you know,

350
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,310
and that was the first time you really
saw drop off in his playing level.

351
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,670
Cause not only was he gone for
three years, he didn't really play.

352
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,290
And when you stop, that's when you're
fucked. That's what I've learned.

353
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,110
Trying to get it back. It's, it's
hard. It's really fucking hard.

354
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,010
Although,

355
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:29,310
although Dee del Ray who crushed it in
San Jose del Ray in San Jose told me he's

356
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,460
doing sets of 20 fucking pull-ups.

357
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,870
I've never done 20 pull
ups in my life straight.

358
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,830
I think the most I ever I was able to
do is I just can't get past like 16.

359
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,100
He's 51 years old. Can do 20 pull
ups, sets of 20. So there's hope.

360
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,150
There's always hope.

361
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,990
Is this like an inspirational podcast
bill used to shit on stuff. All right.

362
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:53,950
I will. Um, but I, I can't, I can't,
I'm jabbing up. I'm having, you know,

363
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:58,840
I've gotten such so little material
I have on a daughter. I thought like,

364
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,070
all, fuck, here we go. My whole
act is gonna fucking change, man.

365
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,020
And it's been so awesome. You
know, what am I going to do?

366
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,960
Talk about how great it is somehow get
you don't really do as I, I should. I,

367
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,970
I pretty much in my act,

368
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,760
I just shit on people that talk
about how difficult parenting is.

369
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,430
You know what I mean? I'm not
saying, you know, it's not,

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,340
I'm not walking around sleepy as shit
all the time, but you know, come on.

371
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,423
Okay.

372
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,690
You know, go watch that
fucking movie. I tell.

373
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:29,080
Told you to watch where they torture
that kid that plays the violin.

374
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,540
That guy from peaky blinders is in it.

375
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,450
Anthropoid go watch that fucking thing.

376
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
Watch what those people went through
and tell me that being a parent is hard.

377
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,300
Um, anyways, sorry. Plowing
ahead. Oh, what happened?

378
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,400
Where do I start? Do I talk F1
do I talk about the Celtics?

379
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,850
Do I talk about the Bruins
playing for their play off,

380
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,800
fighting for their playoff lines?

381
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,190
Let's talk Bruins and I'll do a little
advertising here with the Bruins.

382
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,160
Fucking 84 points. We lost
four fucking games in a row.

383
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,270
We just won one of those
goddamn games. We are now,

384
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,430
we will like all the way up to like,

385
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,260
I think a fourth seat at one point or
a fifth c. We are now an eighth seat.

386
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,270
Okay.

387
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,680
Toronto is ahead of us. I heard
that goaltender got hurt though.

388
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,433
Um,

389
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,770
where the fuck is it? I had this
goddamn standing sweat. Do I? What?

390
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,820
Did I deal with it anyways?

391
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,500
Okay.

392
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,120
I Dunno. Well, we, we got a huge Wayne,

393
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,680
thank you to Riley Nash for those two
fucking huge goals against the island is

394
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:40,681
we got the predators on Tuesday and then
we played this Stass is a big fucking

395
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,590
Boston team week. Dude.

396
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:49,591
You're going to the BS versus Stass
show them against the predators,

397
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,140
dude. Um,

398
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,890
and I'm going to go out on a limb and
say we kind of have to win both of those

399
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,610
fucking games or hope everybody
beneath is just keeps losing

400
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,250
unreal. Unreal. This is the
third year in a row. We're just,

401
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,050
the bottom's fallen out. But you know
what, I slowly see improvement though.

402
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,590
And I can see how this could
be a team that could, uh,

403
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,260
actually score a ton of goals
in the future. You know,

404
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:17,380
I saw on their website
today the up, you know, the,

405
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,130
the frozen four is happening
and uh, we got like,

406
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,670
we have four prospects in the
frozen for this year. So who knows.

407
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,580
I mean the frozen for versus getting HL
is a big fucking leap. But who knows,

408
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,910
who knows? Maybe there's
an, there's an Austin, uh,

409
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,620
with the fuck's his name Matthews in
there. Who knows. Um, but anyways, dude,

410
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:38,890
speaking of that shit, speaking of the
frozen four, what about the final four?

411
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,430
I barely paid attention, man, cause
I've been running around, you know,

412
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:45,250
being a dad and everything, but I,
every time I would just like, you see,

413
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,780
you heard me going, Duke lost,

414
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,360
then I'm like Kansas Lost
Kentucky, lost the final fours.

415
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:57,680
I remember verbally telling me was
it's North Carolina, understandable,

416
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,830
South Carolina Gonzaga. And uh,

417
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:06,860
I forget who the other team
is. Basically, there's no,

418
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:10,400
everybody's bracket is fucked at this
point. If your bracket isn't fucked,

419
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:14,720
if there's somebody out there
that actually picked this
year's final four in the

420
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,554
NCAA,

421
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:21,410
you that don't know shit about fucking
basketball and just guessed or your dad's

422
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,690
in the mob and something's going down
this year because just everybody's out of

423
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:31,430
it. Um, I don't know who
I'm going to vote for.

424
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,183
Okay.

425
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,750
Gonzaga South Carolina.

426
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,370
My teams would Duke or Kansas
and I was always liked UCLA.

427
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,960
Um, and they all got, UCLA
got fucking knocked out.

428
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,090
You know what annoyed me that day? I was
walking down the street and you know,

429
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:50,580
cause all the bandwagon fucking UCLA fans,

430
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:53,940
all of a sudden everybody's
rabid out here. You know what?

431
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:56,700
I was wearing a Bruin sweatshirt and
I'm walking down the street and this guy

432
00:25:56,701 --> 00:26:00,090
goes, hey, goes hates UCLA
Bruins, not Boston Bruins.

433
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,630
And I just laughed at him. Ed, you guys
are good this year. He's like, yeah,

434
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:06,600
we are. And walked away. And
I was like, wait a minute.

435
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,260
That was at the car wash and
I fucking looked it up. Like,

436
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:11,490
who was the Bruins first?

437
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,390
And it was like the UCLA basketball team
was around before the Boston Bruins,

438
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:20,580
but their first year and
like 1918 or something,

439
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,880
they were the UCLA cubs and then the
next year they switched to the grizzlies.

440
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,000
And in like 1928 they joined.

441
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,770
I don't know what there was the
pack something pack 10 pack 12 Oh,

442
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:37,440
I don't know what the fuck it was
back then. Pack eight I have no idea.

443
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:41,250
But like there was some team from
Montana that was already the grizzlies.

444
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,270
In 1928 they switched to the UCLA Bruins.

445
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,250
However at the Boston Bruins
were in 1924 all right,

446
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,450
so all due respect to coach wooden,

447
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,620
all due respect to the UCLA program. I
actually liked the school and everything,

448
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:02,430
but when it comes to that Bruin
Shit, go fuck yourself. All right.

449
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,170
We were there first. Okay,
CIF, stand the fuck down.

450
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,050
It's a different sport. It's
a pro sport. So relaxed,

451
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,080
you know, you know bad.

452
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:16,950
I've been replaying that in my head that
I wished that I had that information.

453
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,550
You know, I wish they were in the
final four and I would've actually,

454
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:21,960
I'm such an argumentative con.

455
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,940
I would actually fucking maybe drive
over to Westwood and gets some air quote

456
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,740
lunch and just walk around with that
shirt. It's like, it'd be like, ah,

457
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,170
Nike crazy. Hey, no gay history,

458
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,280
no history. You know, like, like
I'm the fucking the sports guru.

459
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:44,160
Like I just didn't look that shit up
cause some guy was a contemplating of the

460
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:47,910
car wash. Um, all right, let's
do some reads here for this week.

you stretch and then get one of these

562
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:21,010
mattresses. I think you're going to
be good. Go get a massage. You know,

563
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:22,420
drink some fucking water.

564
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:23,970
Okay,

565
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,710
10 grand for a mattress.

566
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,230
Okay.

567
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,380
Just have some fucking Asian lady
walk on your back a little bit.

568
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,543
Save some money.

569
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,620
Helix customers report at 30030%
improvement in overall sleep quality.

570
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,040
And it has to be an Asian
lady. Okay? Cause that dainty,

571
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,320
you can't get one of those American, we
can't get some white woman, you know,

572
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,470
you any, any other race, they're
going to be too far unless they're,

573
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,320
they're not gonna be old enough to
be in there. You know what I mean?

574
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,030
They get you going to
be too God damn dense.

575
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,210
They can be full of fucking
growth hormones and that
they're going to break it

576
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:56,044
back.

577
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,103
Okay?

578
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,520
That is an exclusive, dainty Asian lady.

579
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,670
I just thought about
that. I've never seen any,

580
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:07,550
any footage of a white lady
walking on somebody's back.

581
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,460
You just feel like I ride around,
get up, get up. All right.

582
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:14,930
Your mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% free.

583
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,920
He looks, uh, and for couples, they
customize each side of the mattress.

584
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,290
That's why everyone from GQ magazines
to Forbes are talking about Helix,

585
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,960
last heloc sleep, customizing
both sides of your mattress.

586
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,270
I can't tell if that's gonna make
your relationship happier or it's the

587
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:33,500
beginning of the end. Oh God, I
don't even like the way he sleeps.

588
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,290
It'll be great.

589
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,830
Then I just want to test out what it'd
be like to sleep a different bed with

590
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:39,240
them, but still be in the same bed.

591
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,440
That's why everyone from GQ magazine
to Forbes are all talking about helix

592
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:48,240
sleep. Alex, uh, you have
100 nights to try it out,

593
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,190
and if you don't love it,
they'll pick it up for free,

594
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,240
rose and gave you 100%
refund. No questions asked.

595
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,330
We don't even want to know what that
stain is. We're not going to ask you.

596
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,220
Go to Helen's sleep.com/bar and get
$50 off your order. That's helix,

597
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,860
sleep.com/bar Heloc, sleep.com/. Burn
all right, there you go. Just like that.

598
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,730
We're done with the advertising we've
done with the advertising and we're on the

599
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:15,450
other side of, of the half hours.
We're going to do traffic on the sixes.

600
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,710
Anybody out on the four oh five, you
might want to get yourself a helicopter.

601
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,280
There's a lot of traffic.
Everybody slowing down,

602
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:27,390
watching somebody change
a tire. Um, anyways,

603
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:29,310
let's talk some F1 action. Did anybody,

604
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:34,311
did you watch the Australian grampy
grampy Grand Prix down in Melbourne,

605
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,590
Australia? Uh,

606
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:42,030
it was a great fucking race and it
lived up to the hype that this year the

607
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:44,390
Ferrari's, we're going to be good.

608
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,650
And I've only watched
this sport for one season,

609
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,110
so I don't know shit
about it all. He knows.

610
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,960
Last year it was all about the
Mercedes team, Louis Hamilton,

611
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,250
Nico Rosberg, you know, they had
the whole days of thunder. You know,

612
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:58,680
I'm the guy who's been around
the block on the other. Fuck I'm,

613
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,970
I'm the Tom Cruise Guy,

614
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:04,110
somebody fucking Robert
Duvall and everybody else,

615
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:08,580
which is watching last year. And if
those two guys didn't hate each other,

616
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,440
it would have been fucking boring as
shit because basically every race was

617
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,080
erased to the first corner.

618
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,020
Whoever got there first was just driving
through clean air and the cars were so

619
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:21,540
equally matched, nobody
could catch up with somebody.

620
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,800
You basically had to fuck
up or your car died. Um,

621
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,530
so all the exciting racing was
for like, you know, fourth, fifth,

622
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:33,450
sixth place or whatever, three psychos
going after it for the last, you know,

623
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,710
championship point as they say, you know,
back in 10th place. That was exciting.

624
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,460
But up front it was just Lewis
Hamilton or Nico Rosberg just,

625
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,810
just doing laps was, you know,
Kinda got a little boring.

626
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,500
So this year they were
talking about how, um,

627
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,090
Ferrari was very quiet, eerily
quiet during the off season,

628
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:55,070
working on their, their,

629
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:59,160
their suspension and the engine and
all that type of shit with the new

630
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,090
regulations, whatever the fuck they are,

631
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:05,091
I don't know what they are and that they
were gonna make a serious challenge for

632
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,590
, uh, against Mercedes issue.

633
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:12,120
So the fucking race starts
and, uh, the Australian Dude,

634
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:16,020
I already forget his name. Uh, Rico
Rican Berg. I have no fucking idea.

635
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:19,980
Like eventually I'll, I'll get these
people's names down. Ricky rocket,

636
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,760
I forget. Okay. Everybody wanted
him to win the poor bastard.

637
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,110
He's down there and they'd
taken like the, the,

638
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:30,360
the warmup lap or whatever. And uh,

639
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,120
not even the warmup lap.
They just going around,

640
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:36,100
getting ready to get into positions just
to do the warmup lap and his car gets

641
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:39,610
stuck in sixth gear. We've all been
there, right the side of the highway,

642
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,330
except he's got 100,000
people in a fucking zillion
millions of fans around the

643
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,320
world watching this shit.

644
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,670
So they got to push his car and they got
to take out the fucking transmission in

645
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,470
like five minutes. Throw
a new one in there,

646
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:54,760
try and get it back in the fucking car
before the race starts. That alone,

647
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,320
if they just showed that,
that would've been amazing.

648
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,690
They kind of kept cutting back to
it. I wish they showed more of it.

649
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,340
A long story short, he wasn't able to
get out there until, uh, the second lap.

650
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,420
He was already two laps down.

651
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:08,740
So that kind of sucked for all the
Australian fans and uh, then his car shit,

652
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:13,090
the bed halfway through the race,
however, so the race fucking starts.

653
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,783
All right.

654
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,020
I think Lewis Hamilton had the pole
and then Sebastian Federal, um,

655
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,170
for Ferrari was in second place and Lewis
had a great start and he was out front

656
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,430
and I go, wow, I guess that's it.

657
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,440
I guess the Mercedes are
gonna win it this year. Right.

658
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:34,510
So they get about 20 laps
in and Lewis Hamilton pits,

659
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,373
it's one of these races,

660
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,340
it's like 57 laps and the announcers were
saying that they were going to pit one

661
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:42,430
time and it's all when you pit
and blah blah blah, blah blah.

662
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:44,410
So all this shit is
becoming fascinating to me.

663
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,150
So Lewis Hamilton goes into Pitt,
right? Sebastian Vettel was,

664
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:53,500
I don't know how far behind,
couple seconds behind he
decides to stay out there.

665
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,570
So the whole time when Lewis
was out there in first place,

666
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,490
Sebastian's behind him. All right.
So Louis is driving in the clean air.

667
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,510
It's like, you know, if you want
to fucking on a lake and you bring,

668
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:08,800
it's just still water. You could,

669
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:12,130
you could go way faster and you boat as
opposed to if the water was all fucking

670
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,770
choppy, you got to go slower
than, it's the same thing,

671
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:16,060
except it's what's with air.

672
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,660
I'm just saying this for everybody else
out there who's dumb like me in the fact

673
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,760
that air is invisible,
you don't understand it.

674
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,900
So no matter what this guy's
doing, Sebastian Vettel,

675
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:29,530
he can only get so close to a,

676
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,500
to Lewis Hamilton because all
the air coming off of him,

677
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,230
and I guess the tires are bigger this
year, which causes more turbulence.

678
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,363
It would actually,

679
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,900
he's going to use more fuel and chew up
more of his tires if he gets too close

680
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:43,270
to him, which is really fucking, I dunno,

681
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,310
I don't know if that's
a good or a bad thing.

682
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,120
So Hamilton was having problems
with the tire. He pits early.

683
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,690
So the Ferrari team takes a
gamble and says, fuck this.

684
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,010
We're going to stay out there.

685
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,420
So Sebastian now is in first
place driving into clean air.

686
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,670
He's got the nice smooth lake.
He's bringing the boat across,

687
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,250
except it's a car and it's going
through air. He's still with me.

688
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,560
And he stays out there
for one lap and they go,

689
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:09,580
he's definitely gonna come in for
the second lap. Meanwhile, um,

690
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,400
Lewis Hamilton came right back out
of the pits and then was, you know,

691
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:15,940
technically in fourth
place, but he's, you know,

692
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,430
but he already pitted the other two
guys in front of them at the pit.

693
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,860
And so does the other guy. So technically
it's like he's still in first place,

694
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:23,200
but now he's driving in
dirty air back there.

695
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,750
So Sebastian's flying around the track,
he goes around a second time and,

696
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,790
you know, the tires are getting chewed up.

697
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:34,610
He's driving like a fucking maniac and
the d comes around a third time and

698
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,860
they're like, he's not gonna, he's
not gonna fucking stay out there.

699
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,690
He stayed out there again and
now basically it was like,

700
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,900
this was the most exciting part of
it because this is the fucking race.

701
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,430
So basically what he's trying to do,

702
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:51,431
he's trying to get out so far ahead
that he has time to pit when he goes in,

703
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,670
get his tires and get back out on
the track in front of fucking, uh,

704
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,460
Lewis Hamilton. It was
like a fucking movie.

705
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,730
He pulls in his fourth
time around, comes in,

706
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,010
they fucking take the tires. You've got
to go so fucking slow too now. And he,

707
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,810
he got to slow down to like, like you're
driving a Prius when you're in there.

708
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,830
And as he's slowing down this
show and Lewis is coming around,

709
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,810
he's coming around, he's coming
around, he gets the tires,

710
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,810
fucking Sebastian's coming out.
It's like a fucking action movie.

711
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,020
And it was literally,
he just Sebastian, uh,

712
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,220
for Ferrari just get out in front of Lewis
Hamilton. And then that was the race.

713
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:29,810
He saw the Mercedes guy slammed his
hand down on it. The guy in the pits,

714
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:32,060
right? They had fucking guy, right.

715
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,910
The guy goes the eyes wide shut illuminati
parties at the end of the fucking

716
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:37,850
race right there. Probably on
some yacht that's like invisible,

717
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,260
like the air that they
drive through. Right.

718
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,700
He fucking slammed his hand down like
medium and then fucking slammed it down a

719
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:44,780
second time. And right there I was like,

720
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:48,440
this guy knows this fucking
race is over. And that was it.

721
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,720
Ferrari won the first race, you know,
backing up their lack of shit talk.

722
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,770
They were real quiet in the off season.
So, uh, I was actually really, you know,

723
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,470
I like the way my, I'm one
of those guys, I like both,

724
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,850
both team proceedings and Ferrari. I mean,

725
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,360
I don't know how you get mad at either
one of them, the fucking beautiful,

726
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,450
amazing cars that they've built all
this fucking, uh, over the years.

727
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,830
So I'm just happy that this seems like
there's going to be competition and if it

728
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:17,540
can be as exciting as that,
um, for the whole season,

729
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,260
uh, I think, um, maybe some more you
guys can get into it. Like I did,

730
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,230
I believe the next races
in China, in Indochino,

731
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,080
in China. Um, that's gonna
be the next one. But I was,

732
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,300
I was thrilled with the race. Um,

733
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:35,120
I don't know how many F1
fans listen to this shit. Uh,

734
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,410
I'd love to hear your thoughts
on it. Um, all right. What else?

735
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:40,670
What else does Celtics one,

736
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,730
the Celtics are technically
in first place right now,

737
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,460
but we got two games at
hands. We've one more,

738
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:51,320
one more game and lost one more
game than, um, the Cavaliers. But,

739
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,380
uh, I mean I don't, I don't see them,

740
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,500
not the Cavaliers not getting the number
one seed, let's say get real enough.

741
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,830
I don't know if somebody gets fucking
hurt or some shit like that. All right,

742
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:03,020
last announcement and then
I'm going to read the, uh,

743
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,800
your fucking emails for the week are in
my youtube channel that I'm slowly but

744
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:13,500
surely building up. All
right. I'm gonna. Um,

745
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,940
I'm gradually just transitioning
to the fucking Internet here.

746
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,030
My whole career is just going to be on
the Internet of the Internet other than

747
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:24,350
my live dates and f is for family
because everything else is drying up.

748
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:28,580
So my youtube channel, which I'm, I'm
serious about building up with content.

749
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,400
Um, I actually hired a,
a, an animator and, um,

750
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,090
hired a couple of people to start making
videos and putting content up there.

751
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,760
I'm going to be doing tours
of every city that I go to.

752
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:46,470
Now I'm bringing those things
back. Uh, I'm actually considering,

753
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:53,460
um, bringing on this guy that does drum
covers that looks like me, but you know,

754
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:58,020
isn't me, but maybe it's me. Um, so
anyways, what do we got here? Uh,

755
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,720
on Tuesday, the first
video from Alan Pailin,

756
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,110
pronounced Pailin on the
official podcast channel,

757
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,410
Alan Pale and is the guy
who edited it together. Um,

758
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,600
remember that one when I commentate
commentated basketball. Um,

759
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:12,690
he's the guy who did that. So,
um, we're going to have new, uh,

760
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,710
videos from him every
single week. Um, my, uh,

761
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,730
youtube page is
youtube.com/user/ it's backslash,

762
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,180
you know,

763
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,900
the one that starts further away and then
comes in towards you like a flare chop

764
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,460
. Um,

765
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,870
youtube.com backslash user
backslash Monday morning podcast.

766
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,380
Please subscribe to the
channel, check it out, and, um,

767
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,520
I'm going to start making some
videos and that type of shit. Um,

768
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,650
I don't know that I'll have a video tape
that podcast cause it's just me laying

769
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:46,950
here right now I'm wearing a tee
shirt. Pajama bottoms and slippers.

770
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,230
How interesting is that going
to be? And I, every time I,

771
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:52,950
whenever I saw radio shows
videotaped, they just,

772
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:56,910
something happened where it was boring.
I liked the fact that like podcast,

773
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:59,550
it's just like radio on the fact that
you, you, you're doing shit right now.

774
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,240
You drive it home from work. You're
on the fucking elliptical. You know,

775
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:04,440
you're pouring yourself a drink,

776
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,010
you cleaning the house whenever you're
doing whatever the fuck it is you do and

777
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:09,150
you can do other shit, right?

778
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,090
All of a sudden it's videotape you feel
you've got to watch somebody's talking

779
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:16,770
into a microphone. I don't get it. All
right, here we go. Internet privacy.

780
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:19,560
Everybody. Uh Hey Billy
thought you might like this.

781
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:24,561
A private Internet access provider took
out a full page ad in the New York Times

782
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:28,770
calling up 50 senators
who voted to monitor,

783
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,790
monitor the public's internet
activity for financial gain.

784
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,690
What people care a lot
about their public image.

785
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:41,460
And I think this should be done more
to combat assholes. Let me call,

786
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,940
let me click on this thing. I can't click
on it because I'm not on the Internet.

787
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,140
Hang on, let me try and find this
here. I gotta see who the cons are.

788
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,120
Who are the cons that signed
to the onto this. Alright,

789
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:59,730
we are the cons. We don't give
a shit. All right. Hello world.

790
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:02,450
These are the 50 senators who monitor,

791
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:06,600
who voted to monitor your internet
activity. Now Jesus Christ.

792
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,520
I can't read on the too fucking small.

793
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:10,973
Okay.

794
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,153
All right.

795
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,223
Okay.

796
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,290
Oh Jesus. Jesus. What
are they all Republicans,

797
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,950
dude, the way they vote, man.

798
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,560
Cause it was probably something
else that was pro conservative.

799
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,660
That's the only reason why
that fucking Democrats didn't

800
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,230
so fucking and McCoys. It's
basically they're all Republicans

801
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,910
representative from Tennessee.
Alexander representative from Wyoming.

802
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,080
Barrasso blunt from Missouri.

803
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:49,440
Boozman from Arkansas burn from North
Carolina. You fucking piece of shit.

804
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,243
Okay.

805
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,570
Ruining the name. Kaputo from West
Virginia. Cassie from Louisiana.

806
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,650
Car from, from Mississippi.
Collins from Maine.

807
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:05,400
Corker from Tennessee. You
know what? I'm just going,

808
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:10,190
I'm going to just retweet this fucking
picture. Jesus Christ, Republicans,

809
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,500
all Republicans

810
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:18,440
cruise from Texas, Crappo from
Idaho, some element names,

811
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,940
Danes from Montana,
another one from Wyoming,

812
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:29,130
NZ from Wyoming earns from
Iowa. This is all of this shit,

813
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,450
all that. Rubio from
Florida, Perdue from Georgia,

814
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,460
Portman from Ohio. This is all like,
this is all saying it's fake news.

815
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,600
It's all fake news. Do you
know it's basically, um,

816
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,260
you know whose kid new news is?
It's propaganda. It's bullshit.

817
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,310
It's bullshit. But what they want
is their bullshit in your brain.

818
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:51,810
That's what they want.

819
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:55,540
So what they want to do is gradually take
control of this shit and they're gonna

820
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,270
make fake news. Basically your
opinion of what's going on.

821
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,180
They're going to make that
like illegal to do. Um,

822
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,450
and they're probably looking over
at China going like, Hey China,

823
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,040
how the fuck did you do this? And
China's going like, all right,

824
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,210
this is how we did it. So
they gradually do that.

825
00:49:12,211 --> 00:49:15,090
Much like the Nazis were
looking at us going like, hey,

826
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:17,160
how did you do that shit
to the native Americans?

827
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,910
Because we want to do that to the
Jews. Now we're going to do that.

828
00:49:20,911 --> 00:49:22,200
Probably what? Look it, I bet.

829
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,260
I bet the fucking hire rub 1% cuts the
people who make profit off a war and

830
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:29,550
everybody's misery.

831
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:34,970
I bet they are envious of the Internet in,

832
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,960
in Red China.

833
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,760
The way you know Uri is
envious when somebody drives
down the street by you in a

834
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:46,410
fucking Ferrari, you
know, I dunno. Alright,

835
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,920
well I'm, I'm good for that
person that put that up there.

836
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,950
Um, that's fucking disgusting. I
wonder what was linked to it though.

837
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,190
You know what I mean? Cause
it's never just in defensive,

838
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,260
all of those fucking people.
It's never just one thing,

839
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,640
which is another bullshit thing. You
know, when, when they vote for something,

840
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,050
they shouldn't just be one thing.

841
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,420
Should we or should we not vote for solar
power? It should just be about that.

842
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:19,040
But then they tag all this other shit
onto it, onto the bill, which is fucking,

843
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,040
that's how they get everything through.
And then it's always like, yeah,

844
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:23,630
you know, something completely fucked up.

845
00:50:23,631 --> 00:50:27,260
And then when that person goes
to run for office, you know,

846
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:30,610
they voted for the bill because they're
into solar power. But then the, the,

847
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:34,490
the thing that they, the appendix that
they put onto it, they can be like,

848
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:38,450
this guy doesn't take, kids should have
ice fleet. They voted against that.

849
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,910
It's like, no, I voted for alternative
sources of energy to bankrupt the,

850
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,380
uh, the terrorist terrace. Um,
all right. Bullying manager,

851
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,530
dear bill, about a month ago,

852
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:56,420
a lady dairy Queen Manager in Missouri
was charged for involuntary manslaughter.

853
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:02,180
What did she get? The guy in ice cream,

854
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:05,570
headache pill. She did keep eating
ice cream. Then I'll blow you.

855
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,690
The guy fell for it and he stuck his
hand under the fucking smoothie machine.

856
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,420
The soft serve there.
All right. Allegedly,

857
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:15,410
the dairy queen manager was a
dick to one of its employees,

858
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,970
uh, filled with name, calling
and belittling day after day.

859
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:25,650
Is it a great to see women getting
like positions of power and just acting

860
00:51:25,651 --> 00:51:29,100
exactly is fucking ridiculous
as men, you know, most,

861
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,820
most people can not handle a position
of power. I mean, look at me.

862
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,530
Look at the power I
have with this podcast.

863
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,310
I don't have the decency to put on
pants. I mean pajamas and slippers.

864
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:43,080
I am part of the problem.
Um, one incident report lead,

865
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:47,310
the manager threw a burger on the floor
after he made it incorrectly and then

866
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:49,710
made the 17 year old clean it up.

867
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,860
The kid was also a victim of
bullying at school as well. Um,

868
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:59,410
none of this is going to justify this
kid harming this. This boss, you,

869
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,610
you quit the job, uh,

870
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:06,611
but voiced most of the
bullying but foist most.

871
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,660
That doesn't make sense. But
most of the bullying happened,

872
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,000
happened at work.

873
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,900
What happened to this person who wrote
the sentence they wrote but voiced most

874
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:22,830
of the bullying happening
at work and singling,

875
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:28,200
singling out his boss, his boss. Okay,

876
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:31,890
well eventually the kid ended
up shooting himself in the head.

877
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,060
Oh boy. He did not see that coming.
Yes, I know. It's a sad story that Oh,

878
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,690
that happens too often. Does it,

879
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,650
do a lot of people get bullied at dairy
queen and then blow their brains out?

880
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:47,640
I thought that was a happy place.
Oh, they've got soft serve ice cream.

881
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:48,474
What could go wrong?

882
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,930
But the town wanted to hold
somebody responsible for a suicide.

883
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:56,910
The authorities air quote investigated
and interviewed people and his stories of

884
00:52:56,911 --> 00:53:01,170
being teased and made fun of where
retold the cops ultimately came to the

885
00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:06,171
conclusion that his dairy queen boss was
the reason the kid is dead now by Jesus

886
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,920
Christ. Wait a minute. Hey, that's
a little bit of an overreach.

887
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,180
And she was charged with secondary
involuntary manslaughter.

888
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:17,840
Okay.

889
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,160
After me hearing this story,
is that proper English?

890
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,520
Should it be after I heard
this story after for me,

891
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,470
after hearing this story,

892
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,500
I'm waiting for somebody on TV to state
these. The obvious, this is bullshit.

893
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,920
How can you blame someone for
another person killing themselves?

894
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,460
It's not my fault. How other
people handled my insults.

895
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,910
You've been called Billy fat tits.
How many times? Well, first of all,

896
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:48,540
I'm not 17. All right. Um,

897
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,020
I think enough bullying
can drive somebody to it.

898
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:56,970
It depends on how it is and how
fragile somebody is, but uh,

899
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,800
there's just so many fucking variables
involved. Like, what had the person,

900
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,140
let's say this person was
a bully at dairy queen,

901
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:09,141
like what happened to them as a kid
that made them the way they are?

902
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,790
How old is this person?
Because, um, for me,

903
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,780
I just feel that, I honestly
believe that, you know,

904
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,090
people in their twenties, for
the most part, it's just, it's,

905
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:30,320
that is the most purest form of the
direct results of the parents that you had

906
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,810
is now you're out in the world. They're
not there to be like, hey, you know,

907
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,080
knock it off. You know,

908
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,710
and you have to make decisions for
yourself and you go around. Like,

909
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,350
I know when I was in my twenties, I took,
without realizing it, I was taking my,

910
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,380
everybody takes a childhood out
on people in their twenties,

911
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,650
cause you don't know what the fuck you
doing. So hopefully you had a good one.

912
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:55,650
So you take in and out on people is, um,

913
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,550
is you're actually a nice
person like Pete Holmes,

914
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,560
his character on crashing, by the way,

915
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:09,150
I fucking love that show. Um, TJ Miller,

916
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,640
um, rd Lang and I believe the
guy's name is George Bazell. Uh,

917
00:55:14,641 --> 00:55:18,180
I watched the first three fucking
episodes and they were killing me.

918
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,710
And their interaction with Pete's
character is great and I can't wait.

919
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,551
I love Pete Holmes.

920
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:27,360
I cannot wait to break his balls about
his character on that show though.

921
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,240
I really gonna break his balls like
Pete. Is that how you see yourself?

922
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,890
I'm just a nice guy who tries to
do nice things. It's like Pete,

923
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:38,130
you're a fucking lunatic.
Just like the rest of us.

924
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,970
Um, anyways, oh, I can't wait to, I, they,

925
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,230
one of my favorite things in this business
is teasing him cause he can fucking

926
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:51,090
take it. But a, you gotta
check out crashing. Uh, John
Apatow, uh, Pete Holmes,

927
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:53,980
uh, Joey Roses, Joe to Rosa, uh,

928
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,070
rode on the show to a Mike Birbiglia,
I believe, wrote on the show.

929
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,490
There's a bunch of people, a comics
and everything and comics on it.

930
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,740
I saw agree a bunch, dove Davidoff
all these comics, Marina Franklin.

931
00:56:07,741 --> 00:56:10,020
It's just fucking them.
It's a such an amazing show.

932
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,550
Cause I remember when
he came to New York, um,

933
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:20,550
as that wide eyed kid and I'd
actually worked with him. And, uh,

934
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,470
this comedy club in Peoria,
Illinois. That doesn't exist anymore.

935
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:27,130
I worked with him at Brewster's when
he was still married. I believe.

936
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,310
Maybe he'd just gotten divorced.
I can't fucking remember.

937
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:33,400
I've told this story before. We
went to go see the ring and we,

938
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,130
and we were the only two people in
the movie theater and I hate that.

939
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,850
That's that, that is the detail
because that sounds fake.

940
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,740
That's the only time that it's
ever happened. We walked in,

941
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,740
it was a shitty movie theater.
We were two comedians.

942
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,060
It was the middle of the fucking,

943
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,240
there was like two or the afternoon
when we saw the ring on like a Thursday

944
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,250
afternoon and a shitty movie
theater. And I swear to God,

945
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:53,980
we the only two fucking people there. Um,

946
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:59,200
that movie stayed with me certain
with Blair, which stayed with me.

947
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:03,460
That one stayed with me. Um,
some of them just too, just,

948
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,430
they just fucking creep me
out and they stay with me. Um,

949
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:12,370
for whatever reason, Jordan peals movie
when that, that guy comes running,

950
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,840
when the kids smoking the cigarette and
then the guy comes fucking just run it

951
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:19,060
up full speed at Adam.
That fucked with me.

952
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,200
That's for whatever reason that
fucking stayed with me. Um, anyways,

953
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,980
there's like shit I think about
when I go to my car at night,

954
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,060
even though I know it's not real.

955
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:31,000
I just think about what if that fucking
dude just came running just like that at

956
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:34,910
the last second. Made a right
turn in front of me. Um,

957
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:39,530
anyways, how the fuck did I
get onto all of that shit?

958
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,740
Talking about this poor kid who
killed himself. Um, anyways,

959
00:57:42,741 --> 00:57:46,460
he can send that throwing.
Uh, okay. What did he say?

960
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,200
You've been called Billy fat tits.

961
00:57:48,201 --> 00:57:51,080
How many times and by how many
peoples you kill yourself.

962
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:55,550
Over half of your listeners will
go to jail. How is this a law?

963
00:57:55,910 --> 00:58:00,260
How many times can you call somebody fat
before it's against the law and can we

964
00:58:00,261 --> 00:58:05,000
stop saying bullying? It's just being
teased and made fun of. That's not true,

965
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:09,200
man. That isn't, that's
not true. That's not true.

966
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:13,760
It depends on the level and it
depends on the intent. I'm in,

967
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:18,170
all of this shit will be really hard
to prove, but like, you know, there's,

968
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,130
what it is, sir, is you have to have
empathy here. And what I'm guessing is,

969
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,330
is that you are more the person
teasing than getting teased.

970
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:28,100
Um,

971
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:32,540
and maybe you are a little bit more of
a stronger person the same way somebody

972
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:37,460
else might've just been better at math
than you. Um, I know looking back,

973
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:41,560
you know, in my high school, I
know that there was, uh, you know,

974
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,420
there was kids that got
it really fucking bad,

975
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:49,610
really bad and uh, you know, one of them,

976
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,600
you know, killed himself a few years
later. And I remember thinking back,

977
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,520
I don't know what it was based on,

978
00:58:55,521 --> 00:59:00,470
but certainly did not have
a good experience in high
school the last couple of

979
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,100
years.

980
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,840
And it's one of those things because
kids are kids and they don't,

981
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,510
they don't understand it. Um,

982
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,190
it's a really common extinct.

983
00:59:11,191 --> 00:59:13,950
But I would say at this kid
was also bullied at school.

984
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,500
And then if this person was
a content at dairy queen,

985
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:21,040
I mean it's sort of an amalgam of all of
that. And then also the personalities.

986
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,540
People are born, they're
just really sensitive,

987
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:27,770
shy people and uh, they
don't know how to handle it.

988
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,790
And if you're prone to depression,
shit, I imagine that, you know,

989
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,110
that sort of the perfect storm. So, um,

990
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,761
anyways, he goes,

991
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:41,300
they throw this bullying word around
like it's an epidemic sweeping all these

992
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:45,200
heartless millennials. Uh, we've
all been made fun of before.

993
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:48,840
We've all been called names ever
since we were little kids. Um,

994
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,450
you sound like an older person
like me and you just doing the day.

995
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,020
These kids today, these
millennials and they'll make God,

996
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,080
they're fragile little flowers and
they're not all like that dude.

997
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:01,150
You think they still net them mean kid.
You still don't think there's this,

998
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,850
you know, the big guy
just fucking beaten on.

999
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,700
There's always going to be the bigger
kid beating on the younger kids,

1000
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:11,870
the smaller kids or whatever.
Um, we need to let this continue.

1001
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:15,560
It builds character. If you
were always given a trophy,

1002
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:19,670
you're all over the map here.
Dude. It only told compliments you,

1003
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:24,080
you wouldn't be a comedian. Um,
no. Now you speaking for me,

1004
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:27,470
you would still be working in the carpeted
area discussing which I never worked

1005
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:29,810
there. Your favorite route
to work in the morning.

1006
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:34,070
All I'm saying is that we're all becoming
weak pussies because of laws like this

1007
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,630
and nobody's addressing it.

1008
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,550
But you can bill with your soon
to be Emmy winning podcast.

1009
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,660
You can champion this cause
for all hours sake or whatever.

1010
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:48,350
I hope to see important suit. Thanks.
I have to be honest with you sir.

1011
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:54,440
All right. I think, uh,
the true sign of maturity,

1012
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,540
aside from on one side,

1013
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,830
being able to take a good ribbing and,

1014
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,160
and learning how to have more of a sense
of humor by yourself and also learning

1015
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,880
that whatever's happening today is
not the end of the fucking world.

1016
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,800
And that, you know, it's probably kids
listening right now. They get bullied.

1017
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,010
This is the thing, all of that shit. It's,

1018
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,340
you're not going to see any of those
fucking people ever again after high

1019
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:22,790
school.

1020
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:27,320
And your whole fucking life is going to
be determined by you and the decisions

1021
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:32,090
you make, and you have
100% control over that. So,

1022
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,381
um, you know,

1023
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:36,440
and I think a lot of times people get
bullied up the side from the fact that

1024
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,850
they're, that they're just smaller,
weaker. They just seem like targets.

1025
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:45,320
I think, you know, sometimes when
people see somebody that's talented, um,

1026
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,540
they'll go after him and, uh,

1027
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,120
so you've gotta make sure that you
kind of push all that shit away.

1028
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,140
But the other side, I think that really
shows that you're mature. His, uh,

1029
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:59,000
his empathy, you know what I
mean? Uh, it certainly helps.

1030
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:03,590
Like, uh, I mean, I can think it's
easy to do that. The rent that you did,

1031
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:07,040
I understand there's a lot of truth in
some of the shit that he's saying, but,

1032
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:11,720
um, you know, it's not all just like,
oh, I'll learn how to fucking take it.

1033
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:15,140
You fucking pussy stop wearing a
helmet when you ride bicycles and shit.

1034
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:19,040
And I'm guilty of saying stuff like that.
I understand where you're coming from,

1035
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:23,610
but like a, you know, so
what, what is, what, what,

1036
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,260
why do you think this kid killed
himself? You know what I mean?

1037
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,090
Do you think if that
shit wasn't happening,

1038
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:32,910
the kids still would have made it's
a possibility on our own fit kid had

1039
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,370
clinical depression? I have no idea.

1040
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:38,520
But I agree with you to try
from what you've written

1041
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,270
for the sentences where the [inaudible]
was spelled correctly. Uh, it

1042
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:47,920
seems like that kid was just having
a miserable experience. I mean,

1043
01:02:47,921 --> 01:02:52,030
I can't imagine if you were
getting bullied all day at
school and then you'd go,

1044
01:02:52,031 --> 01:02:53,860
okay, well now I'm going to get a job.

1045
01:02:53,861 --> 01:02:57,310
This might be a ray of light to
what the future is going to be,

1046
01:02:57,311 --> 01:03:01,420
where I'll be at work and maybe people
are nicer and then it just becomes

1047
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:05,710
somebody else screaming
at you. Um, you know,

1048
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:10,180
when you're 17 years old, if it sucks at
school and it sucks at the dairy queen,

1049
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:13,530
you work at that is your world and, uh,

1050
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,260
you don't have an ability to step out
of it and you can downward spiral.

1051
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,720
Like once again, I don't think that
they should put it all on this person,

1052
01:03:19,721 --> 01:03:23,110
but that's a a, it's a
fucking terrible story. Um,

1053
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:24,991
but I,

1054
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:29,991
I don't think this backlash to the two
to political correctness to then go the

1055
01:03:31,871 --> 01:03:36,871
other fucking go the all the way back
once again to what caused political

1056
01:03:37,931 --> 01:03:40,570
correctness. All you fucking guys
ain't pull you bootstrapped up.

1057
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,240
Stop being a fucking pussy.
You fucking millennial flour.

1058
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,430
It's guys like you that are fucking
ranting against fucking political

1059
01:03:48,431 --> 01:03:51,940
correctness. It's constant. Like you
that created a political correctness,

1060
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,810
you know, white guys
that tell it like it is,

1061
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,880
is there anything worse than
the white guy that I know.

1062
01:03:57,881 --> 01:04:02,110
I always say that I fucking, that's,
that is, to me, that is the most boring

1063
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,640
fucking mindset you could possibly
have. Hey, I'm a white guy.

1064
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:10,030
Everything's set up for me.
Let me tell you who, you know,

1065
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:14,890
just not have the advantages that I
have, why you need the toughen up.

1066
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,760
You know, as I slept in my
bunk bed and my Culdesac,

1067
01:04:18,761 --> 01:04:23,740
those were the years that I really
became a tough guy. Um, anyways, so,

1068
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:27,630
yeah, I mean I, that's just a terrible
story. I, I, I, I hope that, you know,

1069
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,860
something good can come out of it cause
that's, you know, it's very rare that,

1070
01:04:32,861 --> 01:04:35,410
you know, you bring up an ice cream
store and something like that happens.

1071
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:40,510
I was all excited. You know, I
love fucking dairy queen. You know,

1072
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,680
my wife loves dairy queen. We are
dairy queen people, uh, cleaning up.

1073
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:49,240
All right, dear bill t ability red
faced in, um, I'm 52 years old.

1074
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,051
Congratulations.

1075
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:53,840
Most people don't live that long or a
lot of people don't make it that far. Uh,

1076
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:58,990
I'm 52 years old, but a life of
drinking has made me look 62.

1077
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:03,670
I still drink and I smoke weed
all day. Jesus guys going hard.

1078
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,680
You drink and you smoke weed all day.
I wasn't there for my kids growing up.

1079
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:13,360
They had to go through a lot because
of my mine and my wife's addiction

1080
01:05:13,361 --> 01:05:16,720
problems. JZ. I imagine they did. Uh,

1081
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:21,040
let's say Jesus is two depressing ones
in a row. What does this doctor, Phil,

1082
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,890
you need to stop drinking, smoking,

1083
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:28,870
Wade and pay attention to your
children. Crowd goes crazy.

1084
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:33,010
Another episode in the can and he gets
more syndication money and then that

1085
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:37,720
fucking drunk walks out the door,
continues to do what the fuck he's doing.

1086
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,640
And Dr Phil Looks Great. Uh, let's
just say the fact that they turned out,

1087
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,370
let's just face the fact that they,

1088
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,710
the way they turned out
has nothing to do with me.

1089
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:50,500
I take no credit for the
people they are today. Well,

1090
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:55,120
nor should you with the exception
of any lingering anxiety. I May,

1091
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:56,050
I may have caused them.

1092
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,270
I mean if you're the kind of dad
that you're saying you were, yeah,

1093
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,930
you kind of own up to it, which is good
I guess. Unless you're doing that like,

1094
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:05,890
so everybody goes, no, no, you
are actually, you're good. Dad.

1095
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,590
All depends on what your,
your reasoning is. Um,

1096
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,610
I don't live close to my daughters,
but I am starting to miss them.

1097
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:18,150
Um, I feel like they'd be better
without me at this point. Nah,

1098
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,660
I'm at a fork in the road.

1099
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:24,490
I can either clean up and realize that
my life isn't over set my phone buzzing.

1100
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:30,830
Oh, and he spills his first glass
of water the day. All right.

1101
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:34,960
I can fucking call this back in a
minute. Um, all right. Where am I? Um,

1102
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:39,310
I can either clean up and realize that
my life isn't over and then I may have

1103
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:43,870
the grandchildren one day that I want to
have a relationship with or just enjoy

1104
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:48,430
my responsibility. Less
life, uh, responsibility,

1105
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:51,430
less life until I die. That
sounds morbid in the answer.

1106
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:54,010
May seem more obvious to someone else,

1107
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:57,190
but there was a good chance my kids
won't care either way at this point.

1108
01:06:57,191 --> 01:07:00,730
And I don't want to disrupt
them by being the annoying, hey,

1109
01:07:00,731 --> 01:07:04,000
can I come back into your life person
quitting won't be easy and I'm trying to

1110
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:06,940
weigh my options. What should I do? A,

1111
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:10,540
you should get clean and sober
and own up to everything.

1112
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:15,250
Apologize to your kids and then understand
that it's your kid's choice whether

1113
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:17,520
they want you back in
their life or not. And uh,

1114
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,240
that's what they decide that they don't.

1115
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:23,740
You have to be a man about it and I
wouldn't pao and go back to drinking and

1116
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:25,870
smoking. Um,

1117
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:30,880
you can totally clean your life up and
you can put years back on the odometer,

1118
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:35,080
you know, or you can be dead in 10
years. I mean, it's up to you. I mean,

1119
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:37,780
it's pretty a pretty easy, easy choice.

1120
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:42,310
But I would say the first thing you
should do is try to get help and, um,

1121
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,660
I dunno, I got to tell you, dude, not
drinking and all that type of stuff.

1122
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:50,080
You feel like you feel like
1 million bucks, you know,

1123
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,050
four days of not drinking alone.
When you wake up in the morning,

1124
01:07:53,051 --> 01:07:57,610
you're going to feel 20 years younger,
you know? So, uh, I don't know.

1125
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,100
You want to keep feeling
like shit. It's gonna.

1126
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,820
That's gonna be a brutal death bed dude.

1127
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,240
Just sitting there waiting
for someone to show up,

1128
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:08,170
hoping someone's going to show up. You
don't want that man. You're only 52.

1129
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,140
You know, you got a lot of years left.

1130
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:12,940
You got a quarter of
a century left if you,

1131
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:17,690
if you eat right in a exercise.
And all of that type of stuff. So,

1132
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:19,490
you know, it's up to you,
man. You're an adult.

1133
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,290
I hope you make a positive choice.
Jesus Christ. All Right, yogurt.

1134
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:29,630
Does anybody die in this one? Um, maybe
it's more than you want to bother,

1135
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:34,400
but it's really easy to make your own
yogurt. Uh, then you know what's in it.

1136
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,060
I'm not going to down going
to load you down with links,

1137
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:39,920
but this is a pretty decent start. Yeah.

1138
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:43,880
And they send me this fucking
video of this woman immediately.

1139
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:46,930
I'm envious of her cha of her kitchen
and the fact that she gets us,

1140
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:51,110
she can speak more than one language cause
I think that's cool as shit. But, uh,

1141
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,240
she's making yogurt and one of the things,

1142
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:55,430
one of the ingredients she
goes is very simple yogurt.

1143
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,870
One of the ingredients she makes,

1144
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,780
one of the ingredients
to her yogurt is yogurt.

1145
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,510
I'm going to show you how to make
chicken. All right? Get Salt and pepper,

1146
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:08,780
put it in a ball and then go to
the store and buy some chicken.

1147
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:12,680
Some already made chicken. I don't
get it. I don't get that video. Um,

1148
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:16,460
I'm fine with just the Greek
yogurt, probiotic. It tastes
fucking weird as shit.

1149
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:20,120
The plain stuff. And after a while you're
going addicted to and you love it. So,

1150
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:24,620
um, I appreciate it. I will post the
link. It's a great fucking steal.

1151
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:25,670
I love about that stove.

1152
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:28,850
It's got four burners and then it's
got the griddle in the middle. Oh,

1153
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,150
I love that. Oh, I want that
stove. So fucking bed. All right.

1154
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,250
Fun Car to drive Billy sports car. Uh,

1155
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,090
you were talking about cars on Thursday.

1156
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:42,800
The most fun car I ever drove
was a 1968 Alpha Romeo sedan.

1157
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,490
Not this spider. Google it.
Short throw, manual shift.

1158
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:51,380
My favorite fucking thing
ever handles greats. Um, yeah,

1159
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:54,420
I actually, um, I actually
looked up the car though.

1160
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:58,250
There was only youtube videos, pictures
of them. Nobody had this sedan.

1161
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,330
I'll tell you one of the best,

1162
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:04,220
most fun shifting cars I ever
drove was my older brother had a,

1163
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,990
had like a 1981,

1164
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:10,991
two door Toyota Tercel for
speed and that fucking thing.

1165
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:17,030
It was so tight it would do, you had
to move that fucking thing. Like,

1166
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:17,811
I swear to God,

1167
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:22,220
like an inch and a half and you
were in another gear and uh,

1168
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:25,100
even though it was a four cylinder
by today's standards, you know,

1169
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,430
it was a pretty goofy looking
car, sand high up off in shit.

1170
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:32,030
But it was funniest shit to drive. We
used to have these jobs with, you know,

1171
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:35,390
we had paper routes from the time we
were in third grade right up til ninth

1172
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:35,750
grade.

1173
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:40,750
And then when we got our licenses we
just delivered bigger routes and we drove

1174
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:43,940
around beating the shit out of our cars
and that was the most fun car to drive

1175
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:48,320
cause you could stack it the back
seat up with all the papers and um,

1176
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:51,890
and dude it was a Toyota and that's when
Toyota was really competing with the

1177
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:55,940
American shit. And um, the only
way that they were going to get it.

1178
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:00,110
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me too?

1179
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:01,670
This is how fucked up my houses.

1180
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,040
I just spilled water and I was just like,
you know what? On the hardwood floors,

1181
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:11,180
I'm going to finish the podcast.
I'm almost done. I got to take.

1182
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,360
I can't believe this just happened and
I'm thinking that's the fucking water.

1183
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,100
It's going to be on the floor.
It's just going to be a puddle.

1184
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,200
This is what just happened. I
just looked down at the floor.

1185
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:28,020
I feel I spilled a full glass
of water. It's all gone.

1186
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,160
It's not there anymore. Sorry.
I put the headphones back on

1187
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,500
the fuck out of here.
The floor isn't even wet.

1188
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:42,340
This is what happens and this
is only one part of my house.

1189
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:49,160
If the house is settled so much.
My house is 94 years old this year.

1190
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:51,350
It's settled so much that I swear to God,

1191
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,850
the water rolled down the
hill and the baseboard.

1192
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:59,480
This is space between the floor ports
in the baseboard and it just rolled into

1193
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:03,830
the cracks and disappeared.
This can't be fucking happen

1194
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,540
on fucking believable.

1195
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:16,100
Well, I've got it now. I'm
wondering where did that go?

1196
01:12:16,101 --> 01:12:19,100
Is the ceiling below now? Gonna
have all watermarks on it.

1197
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:23,830
I don't think that's enough water
to do it, dude. I'm telling you.

1198
01:12:23,831 --> 01:12:26,530
I'm telling you right fucking now. Okay.

1199
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,950
The next house I get
is going to be fucking,

1200
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,050
if it's an old house, it's going to be,

1201
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,690
we looked at one this weekend where we
should we just look into when it would

1202
01:12:34,691 --> 01:12:38,470
bullshit. You know what I mean? Um, but
just trying to see what's out there,

1203
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,740
what the prices are and that type of shit
do. We looked at one, it was turnkey.

1204
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:46,600
That's what I want. And for all
you people never bought a house.

1205
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:48,640
That means the whole fucking
thing has been redone.

1206
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:50,980
I don't give a fuck that
somebody flipping it.

1207
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,700
I don't give a shit that they're trying
to make fucking 500 fucking thousand

1208
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:56,410
dollars in two months. I don't care.

1209
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:00,760
The fact that they're going
to strip it all the way down,

1210
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:03,310
all the way down, all the piping,

1211
01:13:03,311 --> 01:13:07,390
the sewer line right out to the
fucking street. Everything's brand new.

1212
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,500
That's the house I'm getting.

1213
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,600
That's the house I'm getting
and that's the house I'm dying.

1214
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:15,940
And when I died,

1215
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:19,510
the fucking next person can deal
with whatever bullshit I did to it.

1216
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:24,540
I just spilled a full glass of fucking
water and it disappeared like a magic

1217
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:27,190
trick. All right, that's the
podcast. Go fuck yourselves up.

1218
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:31,150
Checking on you on a on
Thursday. Go, Bro. It's.
