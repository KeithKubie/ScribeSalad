00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.620
Fentanyl is not a new drug, but has seen such a dramatic increase in the past three years,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.240
that it has become a crisis in North and Shoth America.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.680
Simply touching it may cause you to overdose,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.100
so: What exactly does it do to your brain and body?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.200
Fentanyl is an opioid that can inhibit pain signals in multiple pathways along the brain and spinal cord.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.820
This is why it was initially prescribed for pain relief.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.580
It also causes your brain to make More dopamine, creating sensations of intense euphoria and relaxation.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.340
Essentially, fentanyl hijacks your body's built in system of endorphins,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.920
by binding to your opioid receptors, much in the same way your endorphins do,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.540
but at a significantly stronger level.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.400
This might sound fun, but activating these receptors can also suppress your brains ability to

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.040
detect COâ‚‚ levels in the body, potentially causing a person to stop breathing.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.580
On top of this, side effects include dizziness,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.080
chills, vomiting, fainting, difficulty urinating, and extreme constipation.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.300
In addition, fentanyl is much stronger than other opioids,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.100
100 times stronger than morphine, and 50 times stronger than heroin.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.280
For many drugs to work, they need to pass the blood-brain barrier,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.260
this barrier allows small, fat soluble substances to pass, and water-loving molecules to be inhibited.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.300
Both morphine and heroin are lipid soluble, but have polar, water loving groups

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.680
that make them pass the barrier much more slowly,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.260
where as fentanyl is extremely non-polar and fat soluble, entering the brain within seconds.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.180
This means you only need tiny amounts to get high. And that's where, in part, the danger lies.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.080
A lethal dose of fentanyl can be around two milligrams. In test tubes, that looks like two grains of salt.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.600
And since a high level of precision is needed to dose it effectively, it's very easy to overdose.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.720
In fact, there are some reported incidents of first responders ODing from simply touching fentanyl powder,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.120
or inhaling its dust.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.280
Though, some toxicologists doubt the accuracy of these cases.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420
If it can be administered in time, an injection of naloxone can be given to a person

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.820
which works to stop an overdose by blocking opioid receptors.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.300
But the science cannot keep up with rate of new fentanyl analogues being produced.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.500
Like carfentanil,  which is 10000,000 times more powerful than morphine,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.660
and has been cited in its possible use in chemical warfare.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.240
Today, drug overdose deaths in America are rising faster than ever,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.900
with 110,000 deaths in 2017, compared to 65,000 deaths in 2016,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.535
and opioid use is the crux of the problem.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.420
For context, this is than the peak gun deaths,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.640
peak HIV deaths, and peak car crash deaths.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.800
All evidence points toward the problem worsening by the end of 2018.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.800
The reason? Research points to widespread prescription of opioids for pain, which leads to addiction.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.365
There's also an ease of access for non-prescribers, causing millions of tablets to fall into the wrong hands.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:46.020
As the danger became more clear, doctors decreased prescriptions of opioids,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.680
but this didn't change the fact that thousands of people were addicted, causing them to seek out illegal markets.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.300
With an increase in demand, illicit drug markets turned to cheaper production solutions.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.660
Unlike heroin, which is synthesised from poppies, fentanyl is entirely synthetic and can be made anywhere for cheap.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.165
China has become a super heavyweight in manufacturing fentanyl, and North American law is working to seize supply.

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:13.600
However, the UK urges that solutions to the crisis will lie in persuading people not to use opioids,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.440
as blocking China's market may simply cause production to move to another nation.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.000
Several experts are calling for government for safe consumption sites

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.780
where people suffering addiction can be supervised, minimising risk of overdose,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.360
and can be supported with counselling and anti-withdrawal drugs, that can help people stop using.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.660
But can some drugs be good for you?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.260

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
