00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.240
Welcome back! Now,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.909
after the tragic events
in Orlando,

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.745
many politicians are rallying
around the LGBT community,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.581
including Florida
attorney general, Pam Bondi.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.417
And we are making it clear
anyone who attacks

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:21.188
our LGBT community, anyone
who attacks anyone in our state,

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:23.423
will be gone after with...

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.425
to the fullest extent
of the law.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.727
Yep, nice words.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.630
But unfortunately
for Attorney General Bondi,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.267
Anderson Cooper was there
to go all 360 on her ass.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.035
You basically had gone
after gay people,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.937
said that...
in court, that gay people,

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.872
simply by fighting
for marriage equality,

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.875
were trying to do harm
to the people of Florida.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.544
Do you really think you're
a champion of the gay community?

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.546
Oh...

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.949
snap!

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.618
Anderson's goin' off!

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.454
Damn, you do not want
to make Anderson Cooper mad.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.791
He will... respectfully ask you
some questions

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.160
about the cases you oversaw
against gay marriage.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.162
Are you saying you did not
believe it would do harm

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.497
-to Florida?
-Of course not.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.165
Of course not. G-Gay peo...

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.967
No, I've never said that.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.804
The only time that
much stuttering doesn't mean

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.907
you're lying is when
it's in a dance remix, right?

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.643
♪ G-Gay people ♪

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.413
I have never really seen you
talk about gays and lesbians

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.649
and transgender people
in a positive way until now.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.252
Um, I read your Twitter history
for the last year,

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.755
and I saw you tweeting about,
you know, National Dog Month.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.657
You never even tweeted
about Gay Pride Month.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.593
Wait, hold on. He read
her Twitter history for a year?

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.662
I don't know
whether he's a good journalist

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.932
or just a stalker at this point.
Maybe both.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.001
And, yes, she tweeted
about National Dog Month,

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.936
but we checked
and she never sent one tweet

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.005
about National Gay Dog Month.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:46.840
That's just wrong.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.645
But, but Pam had a solid defense
for that, too.

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.613
Well, actually, if you look
at my, um, Web site now

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.849
-we have hands clasped together,
-Mm-hmm.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.018
um, all different color,
rainbow hands and people.

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.220
-So you just put that up now?
-So... Yeah, I did,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.556
-after this horrible tragedy,
absolutely. -Right. Right.

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:05.892
(laughs)
"So you just put that up now?

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.328
Oh, you just put that up now?"

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:11.498
Absolutely. She will show
respect for minority groups

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.667
when there's
a stock image available.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.003
Except-- spoiler alert--

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.573
there are no rainbow hands
on Pam Bondi's site.

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.742
-(groaning)
-She didn't even do

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:26.346
the one bull(bleep)
political move she said she did!

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.316
(groans)
Here, Pam, let me help you out.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.184
(cheering and applause)

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.221
There you go.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:38.992
Okay. Now, it's been 24 hours
since the interview,

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.995
which apparently isn't enough
time to find some rainbow hands,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.731
but it should be enough time
to set the record straight.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.067
Or, well, you know.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.735
BONDI (speaking):

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.512
Yeah, you-you could have been
helping,

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.747
by clearing up your bull(bleep).

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:04.785
And, for good measure, she
doubled down on her non-apology.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:06.520
BONDI (speaking):

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.527
No, no.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:18.198
The Florida gay community
already hated you.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.100
They already did.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.869
You d...
It didn't encourage it, no.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.205
For... You know,
for the whole saying

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.040
gay marriage
would cause public harm thing,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.444
insinuating that gay parents
don't create stable homes thing,

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.612
and, of course,
the gay friends excuse thing,

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.381
when asked about gay marriage.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.882
Are you personally against it?

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.086
You know,
I-I have so many gay friends.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:44.091
Jason at Starbucks
is not your friend, okay?

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.326
And, and he's straight!

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.829
Stop judging guys with man buns,
all right?

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.597
Okay?

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.599
Not right.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.668
Now, I have to say this though,

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:57.671
guys, I have had my issues
with CNN in the past.

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.108
I'm technically not allowed
to appear on their network.

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:05.112
But, but I have to give credit
where credit is due.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:08.281
Anderson Cooper, for doing
what we should be seeing

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.950
on cable news all the time,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.686
I am giving you
a half-stand full clap.

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:14.588
(cheering and applause)

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.191
Way to do your job, man!

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:19.793
Way to do your job!

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.361
And I still got my eye on you,
Wolf.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.963
And Becky with the good hair.

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.197
We'll be right back.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.866
(cheering and applause)
