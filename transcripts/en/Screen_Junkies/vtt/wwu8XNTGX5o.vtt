00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.180
It's a tale as old as time,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.600
a song as old as rhyme;

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.960
an enchantress turning an 11-year-old into a feral monster,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.200
who 10 years later, traps a girl in a castle until she loves him.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.940
You know! That old chesnut!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.200
Welcome to this poor provincial French village,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
where everyone has an American accent.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.760
It's not right for a woman to read.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.720
What's wrong with her?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.800
She's crazy!

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.520
Marie! The baguette.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.860
And meet Belle,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.000
daughter of the local killing machine inventor.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.120
Belle, look out!

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.940
Belle longs for adventure,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.780
and she'll get just that when she's kidnapped by the Beast,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
a Prince who's so bad at this job,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.260
he's been missing for 10 years and no one seems to notice.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.960
What is this place?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.480
Watch romance bloom between her and Prince- ...

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.320
...uhhh, him.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.440
They never do say his name, do they?

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.280
In this fairy tale that teaches every kid it's what's on the inside that counts,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.580
but it doesn't hurt to be so rich you own a castle with its own library and some magic slaves.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.660
Cheer, as this strong, smart, independent woman rejects this

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.460
violent,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.220
controlling,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.380
bad-mannered,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.440
hairy dude,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.260
who imprisons her dad,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.760
for this

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.340
violent,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.340
controlling,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.580
bad-mannered,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.440
hairy dude,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.920
who imprisons her dad.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.220
Wait, why does he lock up her dad?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.800
The dude clearly wants to be left alone.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.680
I'll give you a place to stay.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.180
No!

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.920
Can't he just, you know,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.000
let him leave and get eaten by wolves or something?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.900
That seems a lot easier than feeding an old man for decades.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.140
But Belle isn't alone,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.780
she's trapped with dozens of living objects that raises dozens of uncomfortable questions like...

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.960
Did everything that moves used to be a person?

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Like are all those plates people?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.020
And what happened to all the actual stuff?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.500
Did it merged with the servants?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.940
Would they go to trial for murdering all those villagers?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.520
That bureau straight up crushes that guy.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.560
If the Beast were cursed,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.320
why did all the servants get deformed too?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.140
Man, this movie is messed up!

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.200
So be Disney's guest

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.500
at this tale as old as stockholm syndrome,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.200
which was the first animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.520
but lost to a movie with a very similar plot;

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.660
You will, join me for dinner.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.580
You rubs the motion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.380
and manage to distract us from its messed up story

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.980
with some of Disney's most beloved songs,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.740
Like...

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.980
The 'I'm Too Good For This Place' song.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.240
The 'Sucking Yourself Up' song.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.040
The 'It Sucks To Work Here' song.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.180
And, 'The Toxic Relationship' song.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.200
Starring...

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.040
His moustache tickles, mama.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.960
Ugh....

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.280
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.320
Uhohoho...

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.300
Hahehahaha!

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.180
You have 20 brothers and sisters, so

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.620
yeah, you probably do.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.400
Hey Screen Junkies,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.400
