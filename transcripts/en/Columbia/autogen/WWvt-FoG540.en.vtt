this what makes certain individuals more
likely to develop complicated grief and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290
likely to develop complicated grief and

of this Center I did my PhD work

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950
of this Center I did my PhD work
 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.190
of this Center I did my PhD work
studying social bonding in an animal

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200
studying social bonding in an animal
 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.560
studying social bonding in an animal
model and I can say that at this point

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570
model and I can say that at this point
 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.569
model and I can say that at this point
we have a reasonable understanding of

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579
we have a reasonable understanding of
 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.490
we have a reasonable understanding of
the brain mechanisms that allow us to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500
the brain mechanisms that allow us to
 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.530
the brain mechanisms that allow us to
form bonds with one another whether they

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540
form bonds with one another whether they
 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.350
form bonds with one another whether they
be people between mates between friends

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360
be people between mates between friends
 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.210
be people between mates between friends
between family members but we have

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220
between family members but we have
 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.850
between family members but we have
essentially no idea what happens when we

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860
essentially no idea what happens when we
 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.190
essentially no idea what happens when we
sever those bonds what happens within

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200
sever those bonds what happens within
 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.249
sever those bonds what happens within
the brain and so it's through the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259
the brain and so it's through the
 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.840
the brain and so it's through the
beginning of this Center and with my

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850
beginning of this Center and with my
 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.699
beginning of this Center and with my
colleagues that I hope to begin to

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709
colleagues that I hope to begin to
 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.860
colleagues that I hope to begin to
examine this question using a monogamous

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
examine this question using a monogamous
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.220
examine this question using a monogamous
rodent species so my background as I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230
rodent species so my background as I
 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.809
rodent species so my background as I
mentioned in social bonding was with

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819
mentioned in social bonding was with
 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.089
mentioned in social bonding was with
this same monogamous rodent species it's

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099
this same monogamous rodent species it's
 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.540
this same monogamous rodent species it's
in a new

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550
in a new
 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.790
in a new
usual laboratory animal the Prairie vole

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800
usual laboratory animal the Prairie vole
 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.070
usual laboratory animal the Prairie vole
so these animals will typically mate for

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080
so these animals will typically mate for
 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.410
so these animals will typically mate for
life they'll form strong selective bonds

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
life they'll form strong selective bonds
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.820
life they'll form strong selective bonds
with their mating partner and they'll

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830
with their mating partner and they'll
 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.260
with their mating partner and they'll
show a preference to spend time with

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270
show a preference to spend time with
 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.300
show a preference to spend time with
that partner they'll raise the offspring

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310
that partner they'll raise the offspring
 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.640
that partner they'll raise the offspring
together and sort of live this typical

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
together and sort of live this typical
 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.210
together and sort of live this typical
home on the Prairie lifestyle and this

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220
home on the Prairie lifestyle and this
 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.220
home on the Prairie lifestyle and this
is in direct contrast with the majority

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
is in direct contrast with the majority
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.050
is in direct contrast with the majority
of rodents that we study in the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
of rodents that we study in the
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.300
of rodents that we study in the
laboratory so both mice and rats the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310
laboratory so both mice and rats the
 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.160

ones that you read about read about in

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
ones that you read about read about in
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.480

the science section of the New York

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490
the science section of the New York
 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.520
the science section of the New York
Times don't form these bonds between

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530
Times don't form these bonds between
 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.830
Times don't form these bonds between
mates they're promiscuous and typically

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840
mates they're promiscuous and typically
 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.540
mates they're promiscuous and typically
just the mothers raised the offspring

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550
just the mothers raised the offspring
 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.900
just the mothers raised the offspring
and so we know the neurobiological basis

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910
and so we know the neurobiological basis
 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.790
and so we know the neurobiological basis
of this bonding behavior and voles and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800
of this bonding behavior and voles and
 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.010
of this bonding behavior and voles and
now what we hope to do is disrupt these

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020
now what we hope to do is disrupt these
 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.560
now what we hope to do is disrupt these
bonds as a way to begin to understand

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570
bonds as a way to begin to understand
 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.140
bonds as a way to begin to understand
what happens in their brain

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
what happens in their brain
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.630
what happens in their brain
mechanistically underlying the behaviors

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640
mechanistically underlying the behaviors
 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.310
mechanistically underlying the behaviors
that you see immediately following the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320
that you see immediately following the
 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.640
that you see immediately following the
loss of a loved one um as you can

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
loss of a loved one um as you can
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.960
loss of a loved one um as you can
imagine this wasn't pointed out earlier

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
imagine this wasn't pointed out earlier
 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.870
imagine this wasn't pointed out earlier
but it's difficult oftentimes to

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880
but it's difficult oftentimes to
 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.640
but it's difficult oftentimes to
convince people to be research subjects

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650
convince people to be research subjects
 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.260
convince people to be research subjects
immediately after they've lost a loved

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270
immediately after they've lost a loved
 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.580
immediately after they've lost a loved
one and some people consider it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590
one and some people consider it
 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.320
one and some people consider it
unethical to ask them at that time in

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330
unethical to ask them at that time in
 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.970
unethical to ask them at that time in
their lives to be part of a research

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
their lives to be part of a research
 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.180
their lives to be part of a research
study and for this reason to get it the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190
study and for this reason to get it the
 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.190
study and for this reason to get it the
most proximal mechanisms of what happens

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200
most proximal mechanisms of what happens
 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.540
most proximal mechanisms of what happens
when you lose a loved one I think that
