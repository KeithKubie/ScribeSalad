analyzing various models of negotiation

right before you need that big raise
always choose situations where you just

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040
always choose situations where you just
 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.670
always choose situations where you just
suggest it saying no urgency but I can

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680
suggest it saying no urgency but I can
 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.250

come back later by doing that you create

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260
come back later by doing that you create
 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.470

the situation where the other person

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480
the situation where the other person
 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.910
the situation where the other person
can't take advantage of your impatience

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920
can't take advantage of your impatience
 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.920
can't take advantage of your impatience
they can't give you a deal that is

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930
they can't give you a deal that is
 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.790
they can't give you a deal that is
effectively a take-it-or-leave-it deal

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800
effectively a take-it-or-leave-it deal
 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.530
effectively a take-it-or-leave-it deal
another important thing in negotiation

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540
another important thing in negotiation
 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.840
another important thing in negotiation
that can lead to better outcomes for you

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850
that can lead to better outcomes for you
 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.330
that can lead to better outcomes for you
is you always want to be in the position

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340
is you always want to be in the position
 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.309
is you always want to be in the position
to be able to offer take-it-or-leave-it

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319
to be able to offer take-it-or-leave-it
 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.890
to be able to offer take-it-or-leave-it
deals to the other person so if you can

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900
deals to the other person so if you can
 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.720
deals to the other person so if you can
say to somebody else here's the deal

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
say to somebody else here's the deal
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.040
say to somebody else here's the deal
take it or leave it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050
take it or leave it
 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.080
take it or leave it
now they're put in a position where they

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090
now they're put in a position where they
 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.090
now they're put in a position where they
take it where they get nothing

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100
take it where they get nothing
 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.070
take it where they get nothing
now it's tricky of course because I can

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080
now it's tricky of course because I can
 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.650
now it's tricky of course because I can
say to you take it or leave it but that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
say to you take it or leave it but that
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.030
say to you take it or leave it but that
doesn't mean that it really is that way

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
doesn't mean that it really is that way
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.790
doesn't mean that it really is that way
so by creating situations where it

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800
so by creating situations where it
 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.890
so by creating situations where it
really is a take-it-or-leave-it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900
really is a take-it-or-leave-it
 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.990
really is a take-it-or-leave-it
situation that can help you but it's

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000
situation that can help you but it's
 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.150
situation that can help you but it's
also nerve-wracking and dangerous so

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160
also nerve-wracking and dangerous so
 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.830
also nerve-wracking and dangerous so
it's a strategy that you have to be very

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840
it's a strategy that you have to be very
 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.260
it's a strategy that you have to be very
careful about but if you can if you can

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
careful about but if you can if you can
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.610
careful about but if you can if you can
be in a situation where you can offer

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620
be in a situation where you can offer
 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.830
be in a situation where you can offer
somebody a true take-it-or-leave-it deal

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
somebody a true take-it-or-leave-it deal
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140
somebody a true take-it-or-leave-it deal
that can oftentimes improve the outcomes

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150
that can oftentimes improve the outcomes
 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
that can oftentimes improve the outcomes
of the negotiation for you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160
of the negotiation for you
 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.360
