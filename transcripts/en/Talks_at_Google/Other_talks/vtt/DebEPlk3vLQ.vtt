00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.960
MALE SPEAKER: To introduce
to you Travis Metcalfe.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.910
He's the director of White
Dwarf Research Corporation

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.220
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.520
He will talk to us about
"Crowdfunding Astronomy

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.980
with Google Sky."

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.680
Here's Travis.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.210
TRAVIS METCALFE: Thanks so much.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.940
Thanks for the invitation.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.980
Our organization has been the
recipient of the Google Grants

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.150
program since 2005.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.980
And what I'd like to
tell you about today

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.310
is how we've used that to launch
one of the longest crowdfunding

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.540
campaigns in history.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.280
On Valentine's Day in 1990,
the Voyager spacecraft,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.590
out beyond the orbit
of Neptune, turned back

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.430
and looked towards
the inner solar system

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.550
and took this
portrait of the Earth

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.170
from the edge of
the solar system.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.260
And Carl Sagan, the astronomer,
challenged us at the time

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.600
to consider this pale blue dot.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.880
He said, that's here,
that's home, that's us.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.450
Everyone you love, everyone
you know, everyone you ever

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.220
heard of, every
human being who ever

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.170
was lived out their lives
on the speck of dust

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.570
suspended in a sunbeam.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.560
Of course, in the 25 years
since this image was taken,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.800
we've started to find pale
blue dots around other suns.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.900
And particularly, there's been
a revolution in the last five

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.144
years since NASA's
Kepler Space Telescope.

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:51.810
So I'd like to give you a little
bit of background on the Kepler

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.000
mission; tell you about
our crowdfunding program,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.230
the history and motivation;
and then end with a look

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.580
to the future.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.040
So the Kepler mission
was launched at night

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.550
from Cape Canaveral
in March, 2009.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.140
This image was taken about
a minute after launch.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.620
And you can see the trail there.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.950
And the red points are the solid
rocket boosters that had just

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.230
been ejected at that point.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.060
The telescope is about
the size of a small car.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.070
The mirror is not particularly
big as space telescopes go.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.980
It's half the size of the
Hubble Space Telescope.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.360
And it was launched into
a Earth-trailing orbit

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.170
around the Sun.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.720
So it just follows the
Earth around the Sun,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.060
rather than orbiting around
the Earth like other space

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.560
telescopes.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.830
By NASA standards, this
is quite a big mission,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.540
a Discovery-class mission,
capped at $600 million

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.870
for the hardware and
launch and an operating

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.890
budget of $20 million a year
for the first four years.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.570
Kepler's job was to look at this
100-square degree patch of sky

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.400
in the Milky Way galaxy,
in the summer Milky Way.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.710
Here it's shown near the
constellation Cygnus, also

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.110
known as the Northern Cross.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.830
Basically what Kepler did
was monitor the brightness

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.710
of 150,000 specifically
selected stars in this field

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.100
and just monitor their
brightness over time,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.410
very, very precise
measurements of the brightness.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.750
Because it's in an
Earth-trailing orbit,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.660
it's too far away to download
all these huge images

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.000
all the time because it's taking
measurements for those 150,000

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.890
stars every 30 minutes.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.270
So instead, it just sends down
little postage stamp images

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.800
around each of those
150,000 preselected targets.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.740
And for a small subset of the
targets, 512 at any one time,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.510
it would send more
frequent measurements.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.690
The brightness measurements
were done every minute.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.560
So you could do
additional science,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.730
that I'll tell you
about in a few minutes.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.750
So the basic
technique that Kepler

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.790
was using to try
and find planets

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.170
around these 150,000 stars is
known as the transit method.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.250
Now, some of the 150,000
stars will have planets.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.970
Some of those planets will be
oriented in just the right way

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.880
that from our perspective,
the planet will

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.140
cross the face of the star.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.190
And these typically
take some number

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.790
of hours, these transits.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.360
So for a certain
number of hours,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.520
you'll see the star just
get a little bit fainter.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.680
And then, if it's an Earth-like
planet in an Earth-like orbit,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.990
it might be a year
later you'll see

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.312
the same event for a few hours,
and then again a year later.

00:05:00.312 --> 00:05:02.770
So you have to have very precise
measurements of brightness

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.990
to be able to see such a small
dip from an Earth-sized planet.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.880
But also very
consistent over time,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.890
over a long period of
time, three, four years,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.670
in order to measure the
orbital period of the planet

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.670
and get out to those
range of distances

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.010
where planets have liquid
water, for example.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.680
Now, the fundamental weakness
of this method, the transit

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.570
method, is that
it only tells you

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.790
the size of the planet relative
to the size of the star.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.832
So you only know the
properties of the planet,

00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:37.790
as well as you know the
properties of the star.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.510
Despite that limitation,
you can lump the planets

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.640
into large groups, with
uncertainties on their sizes

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.430
of a factor of two or so.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.590
But even though
individual planets

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.420
you don't characterize
very precisely,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.280
you get a good characterization
of the distribution

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.290
of planet sizes from
this sort of census

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.100
that Kepler conducted.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.495
And this is the fundamental
result from the Kepler mission

00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:15.930
from 2009 to 2013.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.830
Before Kepler launched, from
ground-based observations,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.040
we knew that big
planets like Jupiter

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.720
were around maybe 1% of
the stars in the sky.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.090
And what we discovered from
Kepler in the last five years

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.800
was that Earth-sized
planets, smaller planets,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.370
are the rule, not the exception.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.000
They're very, very common.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.990
So in considering
planets smaller

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.510
than about four times
the size of the Earth,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.610
most stars in the sky
have at least one.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.940
That's a pretty
dramatic transformation

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.870
in our view of how
common planets are.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.750
So the focus of my
team is basically

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.540
to try and characterize the
host star of these planets

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.190
so that we can pin down their
precise sizes, and ages,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.040
and other properties.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.120
And we use a little trick
for stars like the Sun

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.540
to do that, that's called
stellar seismology.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.090
Now, every star like the
Sun has an outer layer that

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.300
sort of boils from convection.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.140
And these boiling motions
create sound waves, well

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.010
below the range of human
hearing, that propagate down

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.970
into the star and
set up standing waves

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.550
that you can view as brightness
variations on the surface,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.250
exactly the kind of measurements
that Kepler is already making.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.080
And that's the
motivation for Kepler

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.150
to be sampling at the
one minute cadence

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.150
because these
variations in brightness

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.460
due to the seismology
signal operate

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.610
on time scales of just a few
minutes in Sun-like stars.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.830
So this is a close-up
picture of an area of the Sun

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.740
with a sunspot, the Earth
superimposed there for scale.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.860
And you can see these
tiny little granules,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.750
bubbles of hot gas rising.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.960
Each of those granules is the
size of the state of Texas.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.600
But those bubbles
rise and the material

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.210
overflows and propagates
back down into the star

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.290
and creates these sound waves.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.030
So these sort of measurements
of the brightness variations

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.280
caused by the stellar
seismology signal

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.100
tell us very straightforwardly
the absolute size

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.600
of the star and also its age.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.169
And you can use
that absolute size

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.600
to convert the relative
size of the planets

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.640
that Kepler measures
from the transit signal

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.470
into that absolute
size of the planet,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.650
with a precision of only a few
percent, a very high precision

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.790
measurement compared to, say,
a 50% uncertainty that you'd

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.290
get for a typical star that
didn't have seismology.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.970
So I'm going to give you two
examples of planetary systems

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.860
discovered by Kepler where
the seismology team played

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.900
a significant role
in the result.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.620
The first is the discovery of
Kepler-37 a couple of years

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.290
ago, which is, in fact,
still the smallest

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.050
exoplanet discovered
by the Kepler mission.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.500
It's part of a
three-planet system.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.810
The largest of those planets
is about twice the size

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.620
of the Earth, here
over on the right.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.930
The middle-sized planet
is between the size

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.490
of the Earth and Mars.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.370
And the smallest planet is
smaller than the planet Mercury

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.810
in our own solar
system, almost as small

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.830
as the Earth's Moon, which
is just amazing that we can

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.650
pull out a signal that small.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.130
The second example is more
recent, just earlier this year,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.330
Kepler-444.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.680
It's an ancient planetary
system of, in fact, five planets

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.700
that are all smaller
than the Earth,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.200
tightly packed into orbits
that would comfortably

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.220
fit inside the orbit of Mercury
in our own solar system.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.340
The thing that makes this
planetary system exceptional

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.180
is that we were able to measure
the age of the star as well.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.330
And we found that the star
is 11.2 billion years old.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.600
Now for context,
the solar system

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.280
is 4 and 1/2 billion years old.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.220
So it's more than twice as
old as our solar system.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.560
And the universe itself
is 13.6 billion years old.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.200
And so this system,
at 11.2 billion years,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.310
is almost as old as
the universe itself.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.960
It suggests that only in
the first 2 billion years

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.760
or so of the
universe, you already

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.260
have the conditions that were
necessary to begin forming

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.840
rocky planets like the Earth.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.420
And this has a huge
impact on the likelihood

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.510
of intelligent
civilizations to develop

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:05.120
because you need, as far as
we know, a rocky surface,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.350
possibly with an ocean,
not on these planets,

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.750
but in planets that
were like them elsewhere

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.670
in the galaxy that formed
further way from their host

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.130
star.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.710
But the fundamental
result here is

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.450
that we were able to
measure the age of the star

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.030
and suggesting that
planets have been

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.670
forming since
nearly the beginning

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.960
of the galaxy in the universe.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.970
Now, Kepler has been
a spectacular success

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.370
by any measure.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.470
But people forget that
it almost got canceled.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.895
This is an article
from Space.com

00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:40.930
two years before the
Kepler mission launched.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.520
And the situation
at the time was

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.010
that the Kepler team was
behind schedule and over budget

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.573
by about $40 million.

00:11:49.573 --> 00:11:51.550
And so they went
back to NASA and they

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.700
said we're just going to need a
little bit more money to finish

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.540
the project and it might
be a little bit late.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:02.242
And at the time, Alan Stern
was a administrator at NASA.

00:12:02.242 --> 00:12:03.950
You might recognize
his name because he's

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.470
the principal investigator
of the New Horizons mission

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.690
that just went by Pluto.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.690
But at the time, he was
an administrator at NASA.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.600
And he said no, we're
not going to run missions

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.730
with an open checkbook anymore.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.420
Figure out a way to get
it done and come back

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.990
when you're ready.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.160
They came back
about a month later

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.680
and said, well, actually
we need $50 million.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.510
And he told them,
you have one month.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.090
Come back to me with
numbers like these again

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.922
and that will be the
end of the project.

00:12:38.922 --> 00:12:41.380
And so a month later, they came
back and said, oh, yeah, we

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.370
can do that.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.294
We can make it in
the original budget.

00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:47.960
And the way they
accomplished that, they

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.460
had to do to do two adjustments
to the baseline mission.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.976
One was originally they wanted
a four-year operating mission.

00:12:54.976 --> 00:12:56.600
And they scaled that
back to 3 and 1/2.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.310
So they just cut off
some operating costs

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.460
off the tail end.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.460
But the other big
thing that they did

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.190
was they outsourced all of
the stellar seismology work

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.950
to a European team so that
it would be done at no cost

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.320
to NASA.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.270
So this put US participants of
that European-led collaboration

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.570
in a kind of awkward
position because we

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.810
were in this bizarre situation
where Kepler was collecting

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.620
these beautiful
measurements, but there

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.020
was no support for US
scientists to analyze them.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.290
So that's what
motivated us to start

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.670
this crowdfunding campaign
to fund the work of the US

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.982
consortium of scientists
within that European-lead

00:13:39.982 --> 00:13:40.565
collaboration.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.790
And the concept
that we came up with

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.950
was basically an adopt-a-star
program for the Kepler targets,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:54.300
those 150,000 stars.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.080
Private companies
have been offering

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:03.290
sort of deceptive name-a-star
programs for decades.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.570
And what we wanted to do
was compete against them

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.090
and undercut their prices.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.400
And there were
three key features

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.610
to how we wanted to run
the program in what we

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.640
thought was an ethical way.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.290
First, we wanted to be honest
about what we were actually

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.100
providing.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.040
So we labeled it an
adopt-a-star program,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.920
rather than a name a
star or buy a star.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.370
So you can think of
it like it's analogous

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.140
to the adopt-a-highway system.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.570
It's understood that the person
who adopts a stretch of highway

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.410
does not own the highway or
get to restripe it or anything.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.256
But we post their name
on the side of the road

00:14:39.256 --> 00:14:40.630
to acknowledge
their contribution

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.150
to keep that section
of road clean.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.580
The second thing is that
the program is a nonprofit.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.296
100% of the proceeds
from the program

00:14:51.296 --> 00:14:52.670
would support
scientific research

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:58.050
on that same set of stars
that are in the program.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.890
And finally, we wanted there
to be a direct connection

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.780
between the fundraising
mechanism and the science

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.530
that it supported.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.300
So we limited the
adopt-a-star program just

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.450
to those 150,000 stars that
Kepler was actually monitoring

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.665
to search for planets.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.670
Oh, I should mention initially
we just offered every target

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.670
star for a $10 donation.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.940
But later, after a few
years, many of the stars

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.770
were value added.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.520
We discovered that
they were double stars.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.230
And so we started
offering those for $15.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.440
Or there was a suspected
planetary system

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.120
around the star, but that hadn't
been confirmed from follow-up

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.570
observations from the ground.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.290
We offered those for $25.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.160
And then if you wanted a
confirmed planetary system,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.000
it would cost you
a $100 donation.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:59.530
So after a donor submits
a donation by Paypal,

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.230
or in the early
days we were also

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.690
using Google Wallet
and Google Checkout,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.370
they get a certificate
of adoption by email.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.900
They can specify the time
of the donation, a name,

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.420
or a dedication that they'd like
to appear on that certificate.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.820
And by default, they are
given the brightest target

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.940
or brightest star of whatever
category they choose.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.460
But they can choose
a specific star.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.220
If they wanted to
choose a number that

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.240
signified a special date
or something like that,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.560
they could also do that

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.320
And in addition to sending out
the certificate of adoption

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:46.400
by email, we update our website
every five minutes or something

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.690
to put that name or dedication
in the database with that star

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.290
so that each star can
only be adopted once.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.840
Some of these
name-a-star companies

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.130
will offer the same star over
and over to different people.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.150
And we thought that
was unethical as well.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.069
So when we're done with
150,000 stars, that's it.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.660
We're out.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.220
Now, the centerpiece of
our crowdfunding campaign

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.550
was a representation
of the Kepler target

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.190
list in Google Sky.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.730
Now, there are 150,000 targets.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.690
And so the first
thing we tried to do

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.080
was just put them all in
a KML file and view it

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.570
through the Google Sky browser.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.890
And, of course, that
crashed immediately.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.890
But fortunately, Google
developed this regionater

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.300
software with a different
application in mind.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.530
It came with a
sample application

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.200
to display the Swiss
national rail network.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.130
The same sort of problem--
you have a big train station

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.870
with lots of connections
to other train stations.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.360
And when you're
looking from afar,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.710
you should only see those
busiest train stations.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.720
But as you zoom in
closer and closer,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.650
you'd see the smaller
and smaller towns,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.430
with fewer connections.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.490
So all we did was replace
the train stations with stars

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.152
and prioritize by
brightness, instead

00:18:10.152 --> 00:18:11.360
of the number of connections.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.070
Now, the green stars
in this representation

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.990
are available for adoption.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.220
And the red stars,
we change it to red

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.960
once they're adopted so people
know they're already taken.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.360
And stars with confirmed
planetary systems

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.350
get a special pale blue
icon in Google Sky.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.740
Now although it was a
fantastic outreach tool,

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.490
Google Sky proved to be a
frustrating technical obstacle

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.700
for many of our users.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.860
You had to have the Google
Earth plug-in in your browser.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.050
And that was only available
for Mac and Windows,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.650
and not for Linux and
not for mobile devices.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:00.150
And so for many people, they
just couldn't get it to work.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.480
And even those who did had
some difficulty browsing.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:09.850
So a Dutch software engineer,
who experienced this problem,

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.830
decided to try to make it
easier for other people

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.200
to adopt a star another way.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.330
And so he imported the Kepler
target list into a database

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.010
and made a simple
interface to query it

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.160
by the adoption name
or the star number

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.500
and to sort it by
different properties.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.160
And he made the
code available to us

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.870
and helped us integrate
it into our system.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.680
So one of the consequences
of this approach

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.130
is that each star then had its
own web page in the database.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.340
So he included there an image of
the star in Google Maps, which

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.780
was a little bit more friendly
for a broader range of users.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.640
And we included
basic information

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.030
about the star,
simple properties,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.300
coordinates in the
sky, and a link

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.630
to download the certificate.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.690
So this became a person's
individual star page

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.530
once they made an adoption.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.910
This is an example of one
of those individual star

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:20.950
pages, the most shared page in
our database on social media.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.894
Oh Se-hun is a member of
the Korean pop band EXO.

00:20:24.894 --> 00:20:31.120
And so a loyal fan
adopted this star for him.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.270
So by default, you see the image
of the star in Google Maps.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.150
But you see we can
switch into the Sky View

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.652
as well, if you have the
browser plug-in installed.

00:20:42.652 --> 00:20:44.110
And then we also
added this feature

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.690
that if you click and just
want a list of stars that

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.960
are close to the star
that you adopted,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.080
then it shows you
where your star is

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.020
and several nearby stars, making
it easy for family and friends

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.740
to adopt a star next to you,
trying to make it social.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.870
So this is a history from
the first seven years

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.690
of running our star
adoption service.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.490
So the weekly
visits-- a visit is

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:15.150
defined as a session with
at least one interaction

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.230
up to 30 minutes.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.400
And sessions that did not
involve interactions typically

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.730
exceed these by
a factor of four.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:29.730
So it's reading a lot of
traffic that just bounces.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.924
And on the bottom, the
corresponding number of star

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.340
adoptions during
that same period.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:45.160
Now, there are periodic spikes
and there are episodic events

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.720
in this time series.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.970
The periodic spikes come
during the popular gift-giving

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.740
holidays.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.510
So Christmas and
Valentine's Day primarily,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.110
where traffic goes up.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.730
And the episodic spikes are
when either social media

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.120
or a traditional media
coverage of our program.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.740
Traditional media,
typically when

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.820
our team was involved in
a scientific discovery

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.010
and we could issue
press releases

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:19.030
or talk with the press about the
story and how we supported it.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.480
Social media more typically
by enthusiastic donors,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.326
who wanted to share the
program with others.

00:22:26.326 --> 00:22:29.840
Now you see there's a fairly
strong, but non-linear

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.730
correlation between
visits and donors.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.710
And initially, we just
focused on driving

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.650
as much traffic as possible,
primarily through the Google

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.510
Grants program,
to try to increase

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.090
the number of star adoptions,
just by driving more traffic

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:45.970
to the site.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.180
But in the last few
years, we've focus more

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.640
on trying to turn more of
those visitors into donors.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.990
Now the three biggest
spikes in star

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.550
adoptions-- I mean
every spike has

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.520
an interesting story behind it.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.950
But let me just
briefly mentioned

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.390
the three biggest ones.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.050
This earliest spike
in 2008 corresponded

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:15.240
to a very short post on the
tech news website "Slashdot."

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.990
This was actually
before the Kepler target

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.460
list had been released.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.220
And so we were just
offering star adoptions

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.090
to early adopters, who could
then select a star later

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.559
once the target list
had been released.

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:30.350
So there were no
technical obstacles at all

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.680
during that early time.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.730
And nearly one in three
visitors during that spike

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.830
ended up adopting a star.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.590
The second spike corresponded
to a traditional press release

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:48.550
that we sent out to
the media in 2009.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.700
And it was picked up by
Space.com and a couple days

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.390
later by "New Scientist."

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:59.340
And it had actually
a bigger impact

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:04.070
overall because it was sustained
over a longer period of time.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.730
But the most interesting
spike happened just last year,

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:13.650
last summer, when Ukrainian
astronomers adopted a star

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.476
for a not so nice nickname
for Russian president Vladimir

00:24:17.476 --> 00:24:17.976
Putin.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.820
Now, as intended,
our star adoptions

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.350
were indeed undercutting
the prices of competitors. a

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:35.580
And this led to a situation
where third-party resellers

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.560
began setting up
in other countries,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.760
marketing the service
in a foreign language,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.220
and then adopting the
star through our website,

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.980
but then acting as a middle man.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.480
And then giving value-added
services, star charts,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.170
and images, that sort of thing.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.170
So this star adoption
came through one

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.540
of those third-party
resellers in the Ukraine.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.090
We've also had third-party
resellers in China, and Russia,

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.960
and Italy.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.500
After the Ukrainian astronomers
adopted the star in late June

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.020
of 2014, they
posted the image of

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.700
the third-party reseller
star adoption certificate

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.590
on Facebook.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.320
And it went viral
on social media.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.710
I could see that something
was going on just

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:32.620
by the traffic to the website
and the frequency uptick

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.440
in Ukrainian star adoptions.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.210
But I really became
aware of the situation

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.620
when I got a call on July 4th.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.490
The morning of July
4th, I got a call

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.400
from the "Moscow Times,"
asking me for comment

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.370
on the situation.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.580
And they asked, now
than we knew what

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.800
this Ukrainian slur
actually meant,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.670
would we allow
the name to stand?

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.660
And I told them free speech
is now written in the stars.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.050
We have no plans to censor
any of these star adoptions.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.440
We appreciate the
support for science.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.380
There were some Russians
who were not very

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.040
pleased about that decision.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.290
But so far,
nothing's come of it.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.490
Now when we started
this program,

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:22.070
we imagined 150,000
targets, $10 per target,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.970
we'd quickly raise
the $1.5 million

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.000
and have an endowment
for our research

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.130
through the life of
the Kepler mission.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.640
And then in another
universe, that

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.590
might have actually
worked out that way.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.630
And one of our early adopters
from the "Slashdot" post

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.160
in 2008 happened to know a
writer for "The Colbert Report"

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.860
and pitched an idea
to the show to do

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.380
a segment about our program.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.462
But unfortunately,
they never did it.

00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:50.170
I think they had a
hard time figuring out

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.450
how to make it funny.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.010
There was another instance
where we were contacted

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.430
by a British marketing firm.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.670
It getting ready-- this
was about five years ago--

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:04.410
getting ready to celebrate the
25th anniversary of the "Super

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.530
Mario Brothers" video game.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.680
And they wanted to
adopt a set of stars

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.312
in a constellation
shaped like Mario's head.

00:27:13.312 --> 00:27:14.770
That never came to
fruition either.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.029
The client didn't go for it.

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:18.820
But if either of those
things had happened,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.610
it might have given our
program enough exposure

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:27.720
to build that endowment early
on and support our research

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.330
through the whole mission.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.810
Nevertheless, it was
a moderate success.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.640
Over the first seven years,
we raised more than $100,000

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.940
through program.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.450
Now just to put
that in perspective,

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.520
a typical NASA grant to
an individual principle

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.520
investigator is more than
that in a single year.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.990
So we were just stretching
a little bit of money

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.200
over a lot of years.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.040
But even so, we were able
to cosponsor, five science

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.290
conferences of
our collaboration,

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.220
including support for students
and early career researchers

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.840
to attend those meetings.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.090
Dozens of students and
early career researchers

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.390
for each meeting were
supported by that.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.940
We also sponsored
public lectures.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.980
We paid publication charges
for our collaborators

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.440
in third-world nations.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:31.140
So even though it
wasn't the $1.5 million

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.390
endowment that we
had hoped for, it

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.800
did provide some useful
support for our team.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.650
So let me talk a little
bit about the future.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.790
The successor to
the Kepler mission

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:48.580
has already been approved
for launch in August of 2017.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.530
It's called the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.030
Satellite or TESS.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.800
And what TESS will
do is basically--

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.760
TESS will do for the whole sky
what Kepler did for this one

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.780
small patch of the summer Milky
Way, but for brighter stars.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.410
So it will try to
find-- now that we

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:14.480
know the Earth-sized planets
are everywhere, very common,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.730
it will try to find the nearest
examples around the brightest

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.820
stars in the sky,
where we can actually

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.770
have a hope of characterizing
those planets extremely well,

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.200
maybe even detecting
their atmospheres.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.420
This is a full-scale model
of the TESS satellite,

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.420
with the core
science team at MIT.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.270
TESS is quite a
bit smaller mission

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.750
than the Kepler mission was.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.160
It's a Explorer
class mission, which

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.700
is capped at a $200 million
budget for hardware and launch.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.970
There are funds in
the TESS mission

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:00.670
to build this spacecraft and
the instruments to launch it

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:06.850
and to operate it for
a two-year mission

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.670
and for limited
follow-up observations

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:16.550
from the ground to try to weed
out some of the signals that

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.100
could look like a transiting
planet, but aren't actually.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.190
They're due to something else.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.820
So at the end of
the TESS mission,

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.947
they will have a list
of planetary systems

00:30:27.947 --> 00:30:29.530
around the brightest
stars in the sky,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.869
identified and vetted
to some extent.

00:30:32.869 --> 00:30:34.410
But there's no
funding in the mission

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.970
to do science on those targets.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.400
It's kind of ironic.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.040
They'll just release the
data into a database.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.510
And they have a
similar arrangement

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.090
with this European team to
do the stellar seismology

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.640
analysis.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.945
I'm not sure how they're going
to get the exoplanet analysis.

00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:55.750
I mean just the transient
analysis itself.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:00.750
This is one of four telescopes,
really large cameras,

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.760
that TESS will use to
scan the whole sky.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:18.030
Each of these cameras
will basically

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:22.569
capture six times the
size of the Kepler field.

00:31:22.569 --> 00:31:23.610
And there's four of them.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.720
So at any one time, it will be
looking at 24 times the area

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.130
of the Kepler field.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.186
And essentially
what the program is,

00:31:34.186 --> 00:31:36.680
is to scan the sky in strips.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.470
So it will look at the
Northern ecliptic Hemisphere

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:43.004
in these strips, 13 strips
during the first year.

00:31:43.004 --> 00:31:45.170
And it will flip over and
do the Southern Hemisphere

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.636
in another 13 strips.

00:31:46.636 --> 00:31:47.760
So just a two-year mission.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.470
The cameras are arranged so
that they stack vertically

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.830
like this.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:32:01.840
And the one that's at the pole
more or less stays the same

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.920
during each of those years.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.850
So even though each
of these strips

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.820
is only monitored for 27
days, that highest latitude,

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.926
that ecliptic pole field, is
monitored for a full year,

00:32:14.926 --> 00:32:15.426
continuous.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.980
So the issue with that
is that much of the sky,

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.300
you'll only have
27-day time series.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.880
And so you will
only get the planets

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.500
that are relatively close
in and go around frequently.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.600
But at the pole, you'll discover
many planets in longer orbits.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.460
We expect TESS to discover
thousands of new planets,

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.910
including dozens of planets
that are similar in size

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.370
to the Earth and in the
habitable zone of its star,

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.645
where liquid water
could potentially exist.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:59.500
And again, there will be a
specified list of targets,

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.950
200,00 in the case of TESS.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.770
All of those targets
will be monitored

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.290
at that faster cadence of one
or two minutes, that will allow

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.520
you to do stellar seismology.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.200
But the orbit of TESS actually
allows for these full images

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.950
to be downloaded.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.860
And so there will be
a 30-minute cadence

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.540
for the entire sky,
where you will actually

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.390
get all of those images.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.060
And so some tens of
millions of stars,

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.720
that you don't
have to preselect,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.970
can be scanned for planets
from those full images.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.110
So as I mentioned,
the arrangement

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.350
with this European
team is the same.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.600
And they'll just release the
data, after each strip in fact,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:50.040
into the archive at the Space
Telescope Science Institute

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.890
and let people go with it.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.830
And it puts us in
this bizarre situation

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:03.690
where NASA is essentially
launching a mission

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.920
that primarily European
scientists, whose countries are

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.880
wisely investing
in science, will

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:17.030
be allowed to exploit, with
no support for the US science.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:21.900
Or little support beyond
the traditional programs

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:27.199
that NASA already does, nothing
specific to this mission.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.960
So that's what motivates us
to launch a new crowdfunding

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.210
campaign, specifically for
the TESS mission, based

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.440
more or less along the lines of
the one that we've done so far.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.770
We're trying to really get
the US community together

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.300
and behind this effort
so that we can maybe

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.339
get that endowment upfront
and get the science going

00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:50.130
from the beginning.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:55.889
So we have a consortium
of a dozen universities,

00:34:55.889 --> 00:35:01.040
research labs, and observatories
coordinating closely

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.110
with the science
team leaders at MIT

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:07.460
and the Harvard Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.080
And basically what we want to do
through this TESS astrophysics

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.450
group is to
characterize the host

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.580
stars of the planetary
systems that TESS identifies

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.380
during its two-year mission.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:25.730
So we have started a project
on the Benevity website.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:30.320
You may know that Google has an
employee gift matching program

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.910
through the Benevity website.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.640
And just with the
200,000 targets,

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.660
we expect over the
lifetime of the mission

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:45.450
to try to raise $2 million,
$10 per star again,

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.420
for the TESS mission,
to support our research.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:55.450
And that is typical of what
a large research group could

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.760
expect to get from NASA,
if they had any money

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.360
to give for a two-year mission.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.270
If that doesn't suit
your fancy, there

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:10.030
are some volunteer opportunities
for trying to scale this Kepler

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.970
adopt-star program up
to the task of dealing

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:20.900
with TESS, if we are successful
in creating a larger wave

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.390
upfront.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.150
One is we need to have
an integrated payment

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.540
system into our website.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.410
We're currently using
a third-party provider.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.730
And it's difficult
for our analytics

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:33.620
because people disappear
off of our website.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.590
And we don't know why or
what happened to them when

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.260
they don't come back.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.820
We need real-time processing
of the star adoptions.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.670
It's currently run by kind
of a kludge of shell scripts

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:49.440
and cron jobs, that if the
frequency of star adoptions

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:57.620
goes significantly faster,
that system would break.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:02.180
We could use some help
integrating social networking

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.790
into the website.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.060
We're scientists, not social
networking or marketing

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.130
experts.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:12.500
And we have limited mobile
adaptability to our website.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.990
But it could also
use some improvement.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:19.650
And finally, we anticipate
sometime in the next year

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.530
launching a Kickstarter
campaign to try

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.600
to get a little bit
of funding upfront

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.330
to begin hiring students
and raising awareness

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.260
about the program.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.620
So if you're interested in
helping us launch something

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.680
like that, get in touch.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.180
And with that, I would
just like to thank

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.790
the various sponsors
who have helped support

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.360
our program over the years.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.600
First and foremost, Google
for the sponsored advertising

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.680
through their grants program.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.250
We also get free
hosting from DreamHost--

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.160
it does that for all
nonprofits, as far

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.040
as I understand-- and
discounted donation processing

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.790
from Paypal.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.760
We've worked with a local
marketing optimization

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.050
team in Boulder and
a few individuals who

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:13.406
helped us refine our
tools and presentation.

00:38:13.406 --> 00:38:17.020
So with that, I'll thank
you, take questions.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.170
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that you're

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:25.190
looking for-- like in looking
for Earthesque planets,

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:31.470
that you were looking at some
of the largest suns or stars,

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.970
I guess, in the solar system.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:38.670
So I was just curious, to
have an Earthesque planet

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:43.677
does a star to be a certain size
and where does our Sun fall?

00:38:43.677 --> 00:38:45.510
Like how would you
locate it in the spectrum

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.104
of like small to large stars?

00:38:47.104 --> 00:38:48.020
TRAVIS METCALFE: Sure.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.240
Yeah.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.600
Well, there is a habitable zone
around any star, regardless

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.400
of its size.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.480
But smaller stars are cooler.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.520
And so you just have to be
closer for that habitable zone

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.560
where liquid water could exist.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.250
The Sun is a pretty
average star.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.996
There are numerous
stars that are smaller.

00:39:09.996 --> 00:39:11.620
But there are also
stars that are quite

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.703
a bit bigger than the Sun.

00:39:12.703 --> 00:39:13.760
So it's pretty average.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.690
Now TESS, for example, will
find-- because much of the sky

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:24.500
will be scanned in
27 days, they expect

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.140
to find many of those
habitable planets

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.310
around smaller stars, where
the orbits will be closer in.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.870
And that's just fine because
it actually turns out

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.470
that smaller planets are more
common around smaller stars

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:39.560
as well.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:44.110
And the smaller stars
are much less bright.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.410
And so once you
find those systems,

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.760
it makes it easier actually
to use the techniques

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.590
that you can use to probe the
atmospheres of those planets.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.490
It's actually easier to subtract
off the light of the star

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.870
and be left with light that
comes through the atmosphere

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.790
of the planet.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:07.910
So in many ways, TESS will
actually position us really

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.200
well to be able to
learn quite a bit more

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.120
about these planetary
systems that are discovered.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.820
In particular, because that
continuous viewing zone

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.500
at the ecliptic poles, that
corresponds to the place

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.010
where the James Webb Space
Telescope, the successor

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:27.640
to the Hubble Space Telescope,
will always be able to look.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.930
And so particularly if
you find those candidates

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:36.630
in those poles, with
continuous monitoring

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.480
up to a year remember,
those systems

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.550
will be accessible to
the James Webb Space--

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:47.407
AUDIENCE: Do you expect the
star to go away, to die?

00:40:47.407 --> 00:40:48.573
TRAVIS METCALFE: Which star?

00:40:48.573 --> 00:40:51.225
AUDIENCE: Remember, those
150,00-some stars that you

00:40:51.225 --> 00:40:52.010
have.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.145
TRAVIS METCALFE: Yeah.

00:40:52.145 --> 00:40:53.570
All stars will eventually die.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.720
I mean some with a bang
and some with a whimper.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.550
But only the most massive stars,
much more massive than the Sun,

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:05.510
like more than about eight
times the size of the Sun

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:10.120
or mass of the Sun, will
explode as supernova.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.030
So most of the stars that
Kepler intentionally targeted,

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.410
stars that are
more like the Sun.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:19.630
And those will sort of bloat
up into red giant stars,

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.170
lose most of their
outer envelopes,

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:27.860
as nebulae of hot gas in
space, and leaving behind

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:32.400
the exposed hot
white dwarf star.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.380
That's the namesake of
our organization in fact,

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.490
the remnant in the middle.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.070
AUDIENCE: Is it a long process?

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.300
TRAVIS METCALFE: So in
the case of the Sun,

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.360
this will happen about 5 or
6 billion years from now.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.070
So it's a middle-aged star.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.430
More massive stars, twice
the mass of the Sun,

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.200
go through that process
much more quickly.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.770
So their lifetimes are
quite a bit shorter.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.340
The lowest mass
stars, the ones where

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:04.950
TESS will find these
closely packed planets that

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.740
are still habitable,
those very cool

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:13.960
stars, their lifetimes
are very long,

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.850
longer than the age
of the universe.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.600
And so in some ways that
makes them a really nice place

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.870
to try to start life because
they have a lot of time

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.100
to take root.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:30.030
So a lot of factors determine
these issues of habitability.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:34.070
On the other side,
you've got the fact

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:37.530
that those stars actually
tend to be a bit more active.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:42.020
They eject material and harmful
radiation into the regions

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.524
around them.

00:42:42.524 --> 00:42:44.065
And those habitable
zones are closer.

00:42:44.065 --> 00:42:47.080
And so it actually
might be harmful.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.420
And so one of the things
we're hoping to do,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.080
in addition to
just characterizing

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.570
those planetary systems in
terms of their sizes and ages,

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.600
is to do ground-based
observations that

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.200
will establish how habitable
those planets are, really

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.620
beyond just the ability
of liquid water.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.700
MALE SPEAKER: So for
your 20% project,

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.880
can people work remotely
or need to be in Boulder

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.820
to work with you?

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:15.080
TRAVIS METCALFE: Oh, absolutely
people can work remotely.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.670
It's essentially a
virtual institute

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.840
already because our team is
scattered across the country.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.665
So it essentially demands
that we all work remotely.

00:43:24.665 --> 00:43:26.540
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.773
TRAVIS METCALFE: Thanks.
