00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.880
MALE SPEAKER 1: Nature Valley
always has had, for the past

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.120
three years, a great
relationship with

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.110
the National Parks.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.500
It seemed like a natural fit
for us if they're doing a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.280
Preserve the Parks Program,
why would we not actually

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.340
digitally start to preserve
these parks?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.210
So the notion of marrying Street
View with, what we're

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.600
calling Trail View, seemed
like a very natural

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.970
progression.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.420
MALE SPEAKER 2: We looked at
some other mapping engines,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.500
and most of them work
like a crab.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.080
So you traverse the world like
a crab in 2D view, and that's

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.250
not acceptable anymore.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.020
Right around October of last
year, Street View became

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.370
actually enabled with web GL and
it gave us a 3D view, and

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.920
that was actually exposing
the API.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.480
So I didn't look back.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.060
I just went ahead and selected
that as a platform of choice.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.710
I think the problem we
faced was just the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.105
massive share of footage--

00:00:59.105 --> 00:00:59.550
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.382
MALE SPEAKER 2: --is really
unconventional.

00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:06.070
And I would say, if you can
shoot that much and bring it

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.550
back to the lab, that's great.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.792
But take your diligence in
picking the right format and

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:13.410
be patient in producing the
highest quality anything, and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.200
the idea will be there to carry
you all the way through.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Overall we've
been working on this platform

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.280
in what will be two years in
February, and we're continuing

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160
to work on evolving
the platform.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.070
MALE SPEAKER 1: It's one thing
to have an idea, but it's

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.580
completely another thing
just to watch it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.440
sort of come to life.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.920
We had no idea if this was
possible, how to do it.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.545
And just surround yourself
with the best people and

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:36.170
that's what we did.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.102
