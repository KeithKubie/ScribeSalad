00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910
 
 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.100
 
Eugene you've asked one of my favorite

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110
Eugene you've asked one of my favorite
 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.870
Eugene you've asked one of my favorite
questions and a surprisingly deep one

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880
questions and a surprisingly deep one
 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.540
questions and a surprisingly deep one
the essence of it is how fast are we

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550
the essence of it is how fast are we
 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.780
the essence of it is how fast are we
really moving we are a solar system we

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790
really moving we are a solar system we
 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.150
really moving we are a solar system we
are planets going around the Sun but the

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160
are planets going around the Sun but the
 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.580
are planets going around the Sun but the
Sun has its own motion around the galaxy

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590
Sun has its own motion around the galaxy
 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.160
Sun has its own motion around the galaxy
the Milky Way and there are larger

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170
the Milky Way and there are larger
 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.320
the Milky Way and there are larger
motions still because the Milky Way

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330
motions still because the Milky Way
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.290
motions still because the Milky Way
galaxy is also moving through space so

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300
galaxy is also moving through space so
 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.910
galaxy is also moving through space so
I'm gonna try to break this down because

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920
I'm gonna try to break this down because
 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.470
I'm gonna try to break this down because
there are a number of different ways to

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480
there are a number of different ways to
 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.900
there are a number of different ways to
think about motion because when you get

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910
think about motion because when you get
 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.310
think about motion because when you get
to these scales one of the most

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320
to these scales one of the most
 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.440
to these scales one of the most
important questions you have to ask is

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450
important questions you have to ask is
 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.530
important questions you have to ask is
motion compared to what and I'll explain

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540
motion compared to what and I'll explain
 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.639
motion compared to what and I'll explain
that as I go along

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649
that as I go along
 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.549
that as I go along
so one of the most easy to understand

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559
so one of the most easy to understand
 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.530
so one of the most easy to understand
motions but a kind of a mind-blowing one

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540
motions but a kind of a mind-blowing one
 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.810
motions but a kind of a mind-blowing one
is that the Sun is orbiting around the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820
is that the Sun is orbiting around the
 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.430
is that the Sun is orbiting around the
center of the Milky Way galaxy

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440
center of the Milky Way galaxy
 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.290
center of the Milky Way galaxy
now the Milky Way galaxy is a huge

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300
now the Milky Way galaxy is a huge
 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.970
now the Milky Way galaxy is a huge
collection of about half a trillion

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980
collection of about half a trillion
 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.729
collection of about half a trillion
stars and it's about a hundred thousand

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739
stars and it's about a hundred thousand
 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.819
stars and it's about a hundred thousand
light years across end to end now we

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829
light years across end to end now we
 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.620
light years across end to end now we
actually orbit around the center of the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630
actually orbit around the center of the
 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.290
actually orbit around the center of the
galaxy the sum of the galaxy is about

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300
galaxy the sum of the galaxy is about
 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.630
galaxy the sum of the galaxy is about
30,000 light years away from us and we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640
30,000 light years away from us and we
 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.059
30,000 light years away from us and we
orbit around about once every 230

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069
orbit around about once every 230
 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.730
orbit around about once every 230
million years ok that sounds like a long

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740
million years ok that sounds like a long
 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.730
million years ok that sounds like a long
time so 230 million years to make one

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740
time so 230 million years to make one
 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.830
time so 230 million years to make one
orbit around the galaxy so how fast are

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840
orbit around the galaxy so how fast are
 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.529
orbit around the galaxy so how fast are
we going it turns out that the Sun and

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539
we going it turns out that the Sun and
 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.010
we going it turns out that the Sun and
us with it are going at about 560

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020
us with it are going at about 560
 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.160
us with it are going at about 560
thousand miles an hour that's over half

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170
thousand miles an hour that's over half
 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.279
thousand miles an hour that's over half
a million miles an hour just around the

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289
a million miles an hour just around the
 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.130
a million miles an hour just around the
centre of our galaxy so right now you

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140
centre of our galaxy so right now you
 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.020
centre of our galaxy so right now you
are moving at over half a million miles

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030
are moving at over half a million miles
 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.460
are moving at over half a million miles
an hour around the center of the galaxy

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470
an hour around the center of the galaxy
 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.139
an hour around the center of the galaxy
and if you want to think about it in

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149
and if you want to think about it in
 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.400
and if you want to think about it in
kind of a dramatic way you know the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410
kind of a dramatic way you know the
 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.499
kind of a dramatic way you know the
center of the galaxy has a massive black

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509
center of the galaxy has a massive black
 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.779
center of the galaxy has a massive black
hole at the middle about 4 million times

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789
hole at the middle about 4 million times
 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.479
hole at the middle about 4 million times
the mass of the Sun so right now you are

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:49.489
the mass of the Sun so right now you are
 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.820
the mass of the Sun so right now you are
orbiting a massive black hole at half a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
orbiting a massive black hole at half a
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.719
orbiting a massive black hole at half a
million miles an hour

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729
million miles an hour
 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.630
million miles an hour
that's kind of fun but there are larger

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640
that's kind of fun but there are larger
 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.460
that's kind of fun but there are larger
velocities as well and here's where

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470
velocities as well and here's where
 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.540
velocities as well and here's where
things start to get a little bit

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550
things start to get a little bit
 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.550
things start to get a little bit
complicated because the universe is

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560
complicated because the universe is
 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.800
complicated because the universe is
expanding and what that really means

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810
expanding and what that really means
 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.460
expanding and what that really means
that space itself is expanding it's not

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470
that space itself is expanding it's not
 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.499
that space itself is expanding it's not
really correct to say the galaxies are

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509
really correct to say the galaxies are
 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.150
really correct to say the galaxies are
flying through the universe with the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160
flying through the universe with the
 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.589
flying through the universe with the
expansion of the universe that's

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599
expansion of the universe that's
 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.240
expansion of the universe that's
actually not how it works at all the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250
actually not how it works at all the
 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.699
actually not how it works at all the
galaxies in that sense are standing

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709
galaxies in that sense are standing
 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.309
galaxies in that sense are standing
still but the space in between them is

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319
still but the space in between them is
 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.630
still but the space in between them is
getting bigger

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640
getting bigger
 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.070
getting bigger
it's a very strange thing to think about

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080
it's a very strange thing to think about
 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.470
it's a very strange thing to think about
but the expansion of the universe is not

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480
but the expansion of the universe is not
 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.080
but the expansion of the universe is not
galaxies moving through empty space and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
galaxies moving through empty space and
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.640
galaxies moving through empty space and
one of the reasons that this is

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650
one of the reasons that this is
 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.190
one of the reasons that this is
important is because the farther away

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
important is because the farther away
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.070
important is because the farther away
you look into space the more expanding

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
you look into space the more expanding
 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.410
you look into space the more expanding
space you look through and it's not that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420
space you look through and it's not that
 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.360
space you look through and it's not that
galaxy is very far away or actually

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370
galaxy is very far away or actually
 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.820
galaxy is very far away or actually
moving through space very very fast but

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830
moving through space very very fast but
 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.860
moving through space very very fast but
they appear that way to us there's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870
they appear that way to us there's
 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.600
they appear that way to us there's
something called the Hubble constant and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610
something called the Hubble constant and
 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.430
something called the Hubble constant and
what that means is how fast the universe

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440
what that means is how fast the universe
 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440
what that means is how fast the universe
is expanding for every amount of space

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450
is expanding for every amount of space
 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.090
is expanding for every amount of space
that you look through the Hubble

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100
that you look through the Hubble
 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.850
that you look through the Hubble
constant right now is about 75

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860
constant right now is about 75
 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.180
constant right now is about 75
kilometers per second per megaparsec and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190
kilometers per second per megaparsec and
 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.680
kilometers per second per megaparsec and
the mega parsec is about three million

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690
the mega parsec is about three million
 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.720
the mega parsec is about three million
light-years so that means that every

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
light-years so that means that every
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.370
light-years so that means that every
three million light years you go out

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380
three million light years you go out
 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.310
three million light years you go out
things are receding from you at an

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320
things are receding from you at an
 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.280
things are receding from you at an
additional 75 kilometres per second so

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
additional 75 kilometres per second so
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.720
additional 75 kilometres per second so
when you're three million light years

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730
when you're three million light years
 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.060
when you're three million light years
away a galaxy would naturally recede

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070
away a galaxy would naturally recede
 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.070
away a galaxy would naturally recede
away from you at 75 kilometres per

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080
away from you at 75 kilometres per
 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.770
away from you at 75 kilometres per
second now double that say that you're

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780
second now double that say that you're
 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.930
second now double that say that you're
now in six million light years away

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940
now in six million light years away
 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.310
now in six million light years away
double 75 150 kilometers per second so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320
double 75 150 kilometers per second so
 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.320
double 75 150 kilometers per second so
for every three million light years you

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330
for every three million light years you
 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.780
for every three million light years you
go out you put an additional 75

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790
go out you put an additional 75
 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.550
go out you put an additional 75
kilometres per second on to the speed

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560
kilometres per second on to the speed
 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.280
kilometres per second on to the speed
now that means that galaxies near to us

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290
now that means that galaxies near to us
 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.410
now that means that galaxies near to us
are not moving very quickly at all in

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420
are not moving very quickly at all in
 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.030
are not moving very quickly at all in
the natural expansion of the universe

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040
the natural expansion of the universe
 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.580
the natural expansion of the universe
but if you look at something billions of

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590
but if you look at something billions of
 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.500
but if you look at something billions of
light years away you're looking through

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510
light years away you're looking through
 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.990
light years away you're looking through
that much expanding space and it can be

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000
that much expanding space and it can be
 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.850
that much expanding space and it can be
receding away from us appearing to

recede away from us at a very fast
 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.960
recede away from us at a very fast
velocity indeed in fact when you

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970
velocity indeed in fact when you
 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.520
velocity indeed in fact when you
actually look at the very very edges of

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530
actually look at the very very edges of
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.380
actually look at the very very edges of
the universe things are receding away

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390
the universe things are receding away
 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.229
the universe things are receding away
from us close to the speed of light so

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239
from us close to the speed of light so
 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.060
from us close to the speed of light so
that's not anything moving at the speed

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070
that's not anything moving at the speed
 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.860
that's not anything moving at the speed
of light that's just the fact that

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870
of light that's just the fact that
 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.090
of light that's just the fact that
you're looking through that much

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100
you're looking through that much
 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.460
you're looking through that much
expanding space then it appears to be

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470
expanding space then it appears to be
 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.500
expanding space then it appears to be
going that fast away from you and this

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510
going that fast away from you and this
 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.110
going that fast away from you and this
is called the Hubble law it took a long

is called the Hubble law it took a long
 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.850
is called the Hubble law it took a long
time for people to realize that there

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860
time for people to realize that there
 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.250
time for people to realize that there
might be other motions besides just this

might be other motions besides just this
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.710
might be other motions besides just this
expansion of the universe and we have to

expansion of the universe and we have to
 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.539

difficult to detect over time we
 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.610
difficult to detect over time we
realized that yes indeed there were

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620
realized that yes indeed there were
 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.860

and that means that it's gonna collide

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820
and that means that it's gonna collide
 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.790
and that means that it's gonna collide
with us in a couple billion years so I

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800
with us in a couple billion years so I
 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560
with us in a couple billion years so I
wouldn't worry about that that's not a

wouldn't worry about that that's not a
 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.480
wouldn't worry about that that's not a

like the Magellanic Clouds so now let's
 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.680
like the Magellanic Clouds so now let's
go out a little bit further and think

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690
go out a little bit further and think
 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.850
go out a little bit further and think
about how the Milky Way is moving

about how the Milky Way is moving
 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.850

now is that we are falling in towards
