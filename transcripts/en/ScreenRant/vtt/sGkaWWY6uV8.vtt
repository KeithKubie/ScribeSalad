00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.330
With more and more superheroes lining up to
take a crack at the blockbuster box office,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.519
even characters and comic books that seemed
like long shots on the big screen are being

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.679
given a chance.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.770
Marvel and DC's biggest heroes are being reinvented
every year, but some of the most incredible,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.820
or riskiest ideas have already come and gone.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.449
Here are Screen Rant's Superhero Movies That
Could Have Been.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.830
Batman: Year One
After the Batman movies were killed in the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.489
late 1990s, the studio looked to director
Darren Aronofsky for a reboot - who decided

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.420
to team up with Frank Miller to adapt his
comic "Batman Year One" onto film.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.900
The origin story would have thrown everything
about Batman out the window, having Bruce

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.180
Wayne live on the streets after his parents
were killed, and learning martial arts from

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.330
books, being mentored by an auto mechanic,
not Alfred.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.080
The project was eventually seen as TOO different
from the version fans knew, but Aronofsky's

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.470
leading man stuck around: Christian Bale was
his top choice for Bruce, too.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.190
Green Lantern
The version of DC's resident ring-slinger

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.470
that fans got was less than a hit, but things
could have been worse.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.470
Or, maybe better.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.900
Before Ryan Reynolds took up the ring as Green
Lantern, the studio planned on casting Jack

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.870
Black in the part, in a lighter story written
by veteran comedy writer Robert Smigel.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.460
The movie would have followed the ring as
it found the wrong person for the job, sending

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.750
its hero into events way out of his reach.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.290
Since the Green Lantern movie that was made
was mostly criticized by following the superhero

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.250
formula too closely, who knows?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.320
Maybe a comedy would have actually worked
out better.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.680
Fantastic Four
Before he was chosen to take on Marvel's Ant-Man,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.300
director Peyton Reed was working to get a
Fantastic Four movie into production at Fox.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.350
The movie would have followed the comics to
the letter, set in the 1960s, with the movie

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.110
poster recreating the first issue's cover
in live-action.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.190
With the cast hoping to see Charlize Theron
as Sue Storm, Paul Walker as Johnny Storm,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.320
John C. Reilly as The Thing and Jude Law as
Doctor Doom, Fantastic Four fans would have

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.900
been in for a bankable adventure, if nothing
else.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.080
Justice League Mortal
No matter how satisfying DC's Justice League

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.390
may turn out, it's hard to forget that if
things had gone to plan, the super-team would

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.630
have hit the screen almost a decade earlier.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.140
Justice League Mortal was intended to be a
younger take on the heroes, starring actors

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.780
like Armie Hammer, Jay Baruchel and Adam Brody,
with director George Miller at the helm, and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.060
special effects from the minds behind the
Lord of the Rings.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.890
A writer's strike put the movie off track,
despite the cast having already assembled

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.030
to start production.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.700
Considering Miller's next try turned into
Mad Max: Fury Road, Mortal could have been

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.239
something truly special.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.730
Batman Beyond
When Warner Bros. was still thinking about

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.340
a new Batman reboot in the early 2000s, they
also got the wheels moving on a Batman Beyond

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.340
project.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.779
Calling in the series creators to help write
a script, the story was described as a dark,

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.450
cyberpunk version of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man,
with a teenage hero taking up the role of

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.790
Batman from Bruce Wayne decades in the future.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.010
The story is still a hit with fans in every
form, so there's no question Batman Beyond

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.090
was a missed opportunity.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.530
Superman Lives
The most famous superhero movie never made,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.860
it's hard to believe Tim Burton's take on
Superman didn't make it to shooting, after

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.599
he made Batman a big screen hit.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.419
But casting Nicolas Cage in the lead role,
and with a script that saw Superman killed

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.010
and resurrected, battling a Lex Luthor who
had fused with Brainiac, the studio got cold

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.010
feet.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.459
It was an outlandish idea, but even if the
movie turned out to be a disaster, fans still

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.379
wonder if the finished film would have been
worth it in the end.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.329
Doctor Strange
Marvel is finally getting around to making

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.139
a movie about their sorcerer Supreme, but
the version they almost had seems like a dream

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.139
come true.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.329
While "Sandman" creator Neil Gaiman had been
brought in to consult on a Doctor Strange

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.010
movie back in 2007, he mentioned it to director
Guillermo Del Toro on the set of Hellboy 2.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.859
The two joined forces, both with famous talents
for creating fantasy worlds.

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.120
But when Del Toro had to drop out to make
The Hobbit, Gaiman did as well - leaving fans

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.040
to wonder if the perfect creative team had
just slipped by.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.689
Wonder Woman
It was director Joss Whedon who kicked Marvel's

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:45.099
movie universe into high gear with The Avengers,
bringing comedy and action on a colossal scale.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.870
But years before, he had tried to get a Wonder
Woman movie off the ground at Warner Bros.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.680
He couldn't convince the studio that his vision
of a kickass heroine would work, and eventually

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.680
gave up.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.760
But The Avengers proves he might have had
a point - especially since he included his

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.230
top choice for the Amazonian princess, actress
Cobie Smulders.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.669
Spider-Man
Marvel's famous webslinger helped launch the

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.579
age of superhero movies, but he could have
gotten his big budget debut almost a decade

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.579
earlier.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.959
Director James Cameron set his sights on a
Spider-Man movie as early as 1992, looking

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.919
to cast Peter Parker as a smartass quipster,
who used the suit to turn the tables on his

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:17.919
would-be bullies.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.990
Since the director of Avatar, Aliens, Terminator
and True Lies doesn't have a dud on his resume,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.590
fans can only dream how good the movie might
have been, if the studio had gotten on board.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.100
The Batman
Long before Warner Bros. worried about making

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.780
Batman serious, or gritty, they were focused
on just making him successful.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.509
That meant bringing in Tom Mankiewicz, contributing
writer of Superman: The Movie and several

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.069
James Bond films, to craft a story capturing
both sides of the character.

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:45.889
With David Bowie as the Joker, and either
Eddie Murphy or Michael J. fox eyed for Robin,

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.780
director Ivan Reitman - hot off Ghostbusters
- already had his star in mind: Bill Murray.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.800
The studio eventually saw trouble in such
a strange direction, and pulled the plug.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.270
Even now, it's impossible to say if they made
the right call.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.490
Those are the superhero movies that came shockingly
close to being made, for better or for worse.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.490
Which ones have we missed?

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.590
Let us known the movies you wish had gotten
a chance, or had never been made at all, and
