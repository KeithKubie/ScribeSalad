00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.560
So overall, I think the interview
candidate marketed pretty well.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.472
He asked a lot of clarifying questions.

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:12.256
Asking the clarifying questions like
really trying to understand the problem.

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:17.262
A lot of times as an interviewer,
you have an idea of where you want

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:22.190
him to go, but getting him to
that point is his responsibility.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.767
He has to ask those questions
to get himself there.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:29.407
I think he also did a really good job
of following my lead like when I was

00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:33.247
trying to get him somewhere
of actually like listening to

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:37.167
the feedback that he was given and
going down those roads.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:41.004
Yes, so I think a little more white
board practice would have helped

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:41.553
him out.

00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:44.309
You tend to want to start in
the top left of the board.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.417
That way,
you have plenty of room to write.

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.300
You want to make sure that you
leave space between lines,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.811
because you're always going to have to
go back and add lines in the middle.

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:56.026
And then there were opportunities
where he would close out a tag and

00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:59.645
then he'd have to erase it and move
that closing down further and further,

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.441
as we progress through the problem.

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:05.545
So I would say,
give yourself more space for writing and

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:08.614
don't close the tag until you're done.

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:13.239
So the teach me something in five minute
question, I really like that one.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.656
Because as an engineer,

00:01:14.656 --> 00:01:18.103
you're constantly having to
teach your fellow engineers.

00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:20.801
There's not an engineer on the face of
the Earth that it was everything about

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:21.316
everything.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:24.040
So, they're constantly
helping each other and.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.280
Teaching someone something they don't
know in five minutes is actually

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.220
a really important part of the job
that you'll do numerous times per day.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.384
So I asked about what interested
in web development and

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.615
what he was excited about
coming down in the future, and

00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:39.597
that's a question looking for
passion and drive.

00:01:39.597 --> 00:01:41.611
This is a career field
that's constantly changing.

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.860
And if someone's not passionate about
the field or the product itself,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.111
they're not going to remain
on the cutting edge.

00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:49.238
So it's a question
designed to determine,

00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:51.313
if they're going to
be someone that will.

00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:52.098
Stay educated and

00:01:52.098 --> 00:01:55.190
remain at the cutting edge the whole
time they're with your company.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.200
So, the question about the palindrome is
a pretty typical programming question

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.320
you'll receive.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.326
The interviewer's not too interested
in whether you can actually solve

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:09.197
the problem, they just want to see if
you can think like a programmer and

00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:13.019
if you understand the basic syntax
rules of the language being used.

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.594
So the image carousel question is
another basic programming question

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.901
that's just trying, it's pretty simple.

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:22.102
So, we're just trying to get the
candidate warmed up at that point and

00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:23.629
get used to writing on the board.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.981
And once again, we're just trying to
see if they think like that a developer

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.506
would within the role
though be fulfilled.

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:34.996
So, the question on closures is actually
the one question that I was actually

00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:38.594
testing the candidate's
understanding of the language on.

00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:43.398
It gets pretty low level and we ask some
deep questions that really let me know

00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:48.146
whether the candidate knows what's
going on when they're writing code.

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:51.942
So the question about the technical
challenge and how did you solve it,

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:55.623
that's kind of a cool-down question
coming off of the whiteboard.

00:02:55.623 --> 00:03:00.262
And just let's me understand some of the
things that the candidate has challenge

00:03:00.262 --> 00:03:03.775
themselves with and
how do they approach that problem, and

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:05.751
their problem solving ability.

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:11.273
And I really want to see the candidate
get through a complicated problem and

00:03:11.273 --> 00:03:15.913
not say, well, I had this problem and
I just gave up or I went and

00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:17.771
asked someone for help.

00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.048
Overall, the tone was good.

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:22.008
Probably could have slowed
down a little bit and

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:27.250
thought about the response to a question
a little more before answering it.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.460
Particularly there were moments where it
felt like the candidate was going on and

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.570
on and on a little bit and they probably
could've just wrapped it up quicker.
