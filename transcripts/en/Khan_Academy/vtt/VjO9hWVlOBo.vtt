00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] In the
game rock-paper-scissors,

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.750
Kenny expects to win, tie,
and lose with equal frequency.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.740
Kenny plays rock-paper-scissors often,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.540
but he suspect his own games

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.470
were not following that pattern.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.910
So he took a random sample of 24 games

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.640
and recorded their outcomes.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.030
Here are his results.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.810
So out of the 24 games, he won four,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.930
lost 13, and tied seven times.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.790
He wants to use these results to carry out

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.190
a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.600
to determine if the
distribution of his outcomes

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.520
disagrees with an even distribution.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.930
What are the values of the test statistic,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.680
the chi-squared test statistic,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.160
and P-value for Kenny's test?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.910
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.290
Okay, so he's essentially
just doing a hypothesis test

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.830
using the chi-squared statistic.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.940
Because it's a hypothesis

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.240
that's thinking about multiple categories.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.610
So what would his null hypothesis be?

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.780
Well, his null hypothesis
would be that he has

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.190
that all of the outcomes
are equal probability.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.240
Outcomes

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.193
equal

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.580
equal probability.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.070
And then his alternative hypothesis

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.120
would be that his outcomes

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.790
have not equal

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.190
not

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.630
equal

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.630
probability.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.460
Remember we assume that the
null hypothesis is true.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.650
And then assuming if the
null hypothesis is true,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.960
the probability of getting a
result at least this extreme

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.380
is low enough,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.720
then we would reject our null hypothesis.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.650
Another way to think about it is

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.850
if our P-value is below threshold,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.470
we would reject our null hypothesis.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.380
And so what he did is

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.070
he took a sample of 24 games,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.750
so n is equal to 24.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.020
And then this was the data that he got.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.810
Now before we even calculate
our chi-squared statistic,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.010
and figure out what's the probability

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.520
of getting a chi-squared
statistic that large or greater,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.050
let's make sure we meet the
conditions for inference

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.070
for a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.360
So you've seen some of them,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.120
but some of them are a
little bit different.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.220
One is the random condition.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.330
I'll write 'em up here.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.563
The random condition.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.553
And that would be that

00:02:07.553 --> 00:02:09.540
there's truly a random sample of games.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.160
And it tell us right here,
he took a random sample

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.460
of his 24 games.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.260
So we meet that condition.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.250
The second condition,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.770
when we're talking about
chi-squared hypothesis testing,

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.690
is the large counts.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.650
Large

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.620
counts

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.453
condition.

00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:27.870
And this is an important
one to appreciate.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.020
This is that the expected number

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.270
of each category of outcomes

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.330
is at least equal to five.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.410
Now you might say, hey, wait, wait,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.500
I only got four wins.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.790
Or Kenny only got four wins
out of his sample of 24.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.060
But that does not violate
the large counts condition.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.940
Remember, what is the expected number

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.870
of wins, losses, and ties?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.240
Well if you were assuming
the null hypothesis,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.410
where the outcomes have equal probability,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.300
so the expected

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.500
the expected

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.840
I could write right over here.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.780
It would be that it's 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.220
And so 1/3 of 24 is 8, 8, and 8.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.910
That's what Kenny would expect.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.090
And since because all of these
are at least equal to five,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.400
we meet the large counts condition.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.130
And then the last condition

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.980
is the independence condition.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.010
If we aren't sampling with replacement,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.410
then we just have to feel good

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.680
that our sample size is no more
than 10% of the population.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.970
And he can definitely play more
than 240 games in his life,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.780
so we would assume that we
meet that condition as well.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.910
And so with that out of the way,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.890
we can actually calculate
our chi-squared statistic

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.040
and try to make some
inference based on it.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.000
And so,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.950
let's see, our chi-squared statistic

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.770
is going to be equal to,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.920
so for each category,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920
it's going to be the difference

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.940
between the expected and what
he got in that sample squared

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.680
divided by the expected.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.810
So the first category is wins.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.340
So that's going to be four minus eight,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.810
four minus eight,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.600
squared over an expected
number of wins of eight,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.200
plus losses, so that's 13 minus eight.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.950
13 is how many he got, how many he lost,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.390
minus eight expected, squared,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.620
over the number expected

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.430
plus he got seven ties,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.840
he would have expected eight, squared,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.610
all of that over eight.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.700
And so let's see what is this.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.460
Four minus eight is negative four,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.200
you square that, you get 16.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.610
13 minus eight is five,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.720
you square that, you get 25.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.880
Seven minus eight is negative one.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.750
Square that you get one.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.750
And 16 divided by eight
is going to be two.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.580
25 divided by eight is
going to be, let's see,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.470
that's three and 1/8th,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.207
so that's 3.125,

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.330
and then 1/8th is 0.125.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.240
0.125.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.890
You add these together,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.770
so let's see,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.584
it's gonna be two plus 3.125,

00:04:58.584 --> 00:04:59.417
5.125

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
plus another 0.125

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.820
so that's going to be 5.25.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.090
So our chi-squared statistic is 5.25.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.280
And now to figure out our P-value,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.930
our P-value

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.650
is going to be equal to the probability

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.470
of getting a chi-squared statistic

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.510
greater than or equal to 5.25.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.147
And you could use a
chi-squared table for that.

00:05:25.147 --> 00:05:27.600
And we always have to think
about our degrees of freedom.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.080
We have one, two, three categories.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.460
So our degrees of freedom is
going to be one less than that,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.960
or three minus one, which is two.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.300
So our degrees of freedom

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.180
is going to be equal to two.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.840
And that makes sense, because you know

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.940
for a certain number of games,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.240
if you know the number of wins,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.600
and you know there's a
certain number of losses,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.100
you can figure out the number of ties.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.130
Or if you know any two
of these categories,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.410
you can always figure out the third.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.530
So that's why you have
two degrees of freedom.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.960
And so let's get out
our chi-squared table.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.060
So we have two degrees of freedom,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.820
so we are in this row.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.130
And where is 5.25?

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.160
So, 5.25 is right over there.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160
And so our probability is going
to be between 0.10 and 0.05.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.310
So our P-value

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.183
is going to be greater than
0.05 and less than 0.10.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.470
And so for example, if ahead of time,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.810
and he should have done
this ahead of time,

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.780
he set a significance level of 5%

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.190
and our P-value here is greater
than 5% which we just saw,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.200
he would fail to reject in this situation

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.130
the null hypothesis.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.550
But they're not asking us that here.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.790
All they're asking us is
what is our chi-squared value

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.360
and what range is our P-value in.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.650
Well, let's see, 5.25
are both of these values,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.140
and we saw we got a
P-value between 5% and 10%.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.493
So it is choice A right over there.
