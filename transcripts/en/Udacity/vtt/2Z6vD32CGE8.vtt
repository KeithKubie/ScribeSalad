00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.000
Some research has shown an interaction between heart disease and depression.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.020
For example, depression can increase the risk of death from heart disease.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.584
However, for many of the studies on the relationship between heart disease and

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:18.008
depression, it's difficult to determine which came first. For example, was the

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:22.520
person depressed first and then acquired heart disease, or is it the opposite.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.067
In that the person had heart disease and then acquired depression. Here we can

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:31.400
refer back to what we learned in the research methods lesson, lesson two. These

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.420
studies on heart disease and depression were correlation studies, and as such,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.140
we cannot make causal statements regarding whether heart disease causes

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.906
depression, or depression causes heart disease. However, we can say that the

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.280
two are related.
