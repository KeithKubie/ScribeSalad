Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible] joining me today is the host of pseudo intellectual on blaze TV and the artist formerly known as roaming millennial. Lauren. Chad, welcome to the Rubin report.

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       Thank you so much for having me. I am so stoked to be here in person to see things in real life. It's unreal.

Speaker 1:          00:00:18       This is very bizarre because somehow we have never met in person before and people freak when they see you tubers on the street and now we're to youtube people meeting for the first.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       I know. I, I feel really weird seeing you in three dimensions. It's just unnatural. I feel like I need some sort of glass between us. Yeah, bring me back to my comfort zone, but it's, it's great.

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       I, I poked you in the shoulder before just to make sure you're real because people always want to touch me to be, if I'm real and we are real. Okay. There's a ton I want to talk to you about. Technically. You have done the Rubin report one time. Yeah, a little less than three years ago. We did a youtube week where I was just sort of reaching out to interesting youtubers that I thought were doing something kind of cool. And you had a small channel I think you probably had like, no, no, maybe you figured out for me like certainly thousand.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Yeah, I remember definitely before I had passed 100,000. So it was the early days. I remember I was so nervous about that call. I had to like put my dog in the other room. I was in my living room on my like dinky little laptop and it was, I mean, anytime, I hope you realize you help small youtubers so much when you do those types of videos because it makes a huge difference in our following.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       Yeah. Cool. Well I'm glad to do it and many people helped me before that. So, uh, so I had you on and you were sort of just, when we went through the list basically of who we are going to put on, uh, your name came up a couple of times. People had recommended you and I watched some of your videos. I thought, here is this young woman who's actually making sense saying some politically incorrect things and, uh, actually doing something good. So how did that happen? What got you into this crazy world? Thank

Speaker 2:          00:01:51       you. I appreciate that. Yeah. Um, and I think I started off the way a lot of youtubers nowadays are starting off kind of just as a hobby, something to do for fun because for all that we rag on social media, I think it has kind of created this atmosphere where people feel like their opinion matters and they want to chip in and they want to contribute even if they're not getting a lot of recognition for it or money for. So it was really just a way for me to feel like I was participating in, you know, the crazy amount of discourse we were having. And so this was, it'll be three years ago in May that I started, um, my first few videos for awhile actually, we're just like those slideshow presentations. My face wasn't in it. Um, and my first ever video I think was about transgenderism.

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       Uh, the whole idea of like transgender versus transgender, you know, the idea of many genders I think. Um, and for awhile I kind of put out a video or two or a month just for fun. And then eventually I started getting more and more subscribers. And after it wasn't even that long, maybe eight or so months I was able to make youtube my fulltime job through things like crowd funding. And it was, uh, it's been a pretty crazy ride ever since. And you've watched, you mature and I'm watching your ideas sort of come together as totally been a joy to watch. Truly. Yeah. Um, so you went, so first your name was roaming millennial. Did you just feel that you needed to have a moniker and not go by real name to the biggest introvert you could ever imagine? Like I'm the person in class who never really spoke up and less a, the teacher specifically called on me or you know, attendance was part of the grade cause I wanted to get the good grade.

Speaker 2:          00:03:28       Um, so I wanted to contribute, but I think for a lot of people who are maybe more shy, not to mention the amount that certain opinions get demonized nowadays. Uh, you know, I felt like kind of being anonymous at first it was safer. I was less embarrassing. People wouldn't really like attribute stuff to me. I wasn't necessarily worried about blowback specifically until like I got a little bit bigger and then I was like, oh, maybe it is a good thing that, you know, my real name isn't attached to it. But um, you know, roaming millennial come from, I just totally made it up. It was just like, cause I've moved a lot and I was doing some like HR research at the time from my main job. And so I was very entrenched in the whole like generational separations. Um, you know, millennials versus like baby boomers, Gen Xers, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       So had I known, I would end up going by that for like two years. I maybe would have put a little bit more thought into it, but yeah, people still call me roaming and I'm fine with that. You know, you can call me Romy or whatever. I don't mind. Definitely not the worst thing I'm being called right now. Thank God. Listen, I'm making this up, but I don't think I am. I don't think I even knew your name. Was Lauren until way after I interviewed you. I called you roaming and you just went by roaming and I was like, all right, look all around. You know what's funny? I feel like people who spend a lot of time online or kind of social media circles, that doesn't really bother us. Cause I, I don't know. You've had Rocka Rocka Alia on your show and you know, I'm a fan of his love, his stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       He's funny and a really smart guy. I think people who may be just know him for his music don't realize. But then I realized the other day like, wait, what is his real name? I just call him Rocca. Well, I truly do this very moment. I cannot remember what his first name that I'm fine with. [inaudible] I don't feel like I know him less as a content creator because of that. But, uh, you know, I started doing more like in person events and kind of, you know, I was on Fox News and stuff and that's when I was kind of like, for people who aren't in the youtube sphere, it is kind of weird to just go buy a moniker. Yeah. So were you always interested in politics? Did that, was it always saying that? I mean you're, you're a fellow political science graduate and political. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:31       So yeah, there's three people that are doing it, right. Shapiro was also political science, Matt Christiansen as well. So there's four of us that actually our degree in your face. Everybody. Yeah. I'm using my poly psy degree. Uh, yeah, I've always been interested in it. Um, I'm, I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I'm just interested in, I guess the way society functions and I think it may be stems from a desire to want to improve things. And uh, I feel like, you know, every, every job, every profession out there is valid and is making our lives better. I just happened to be interested in, you know, kind of systems, governments, family, stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       Yeah. So tell me a little bit more about just growing up before you were a youtuber and somewhat public person. You are half Asian. I'd been treating you as a full white person here. I hope that's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       You know, I have been noticing that there's been some microaggressions. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       Tell me all about your Asian privilege.

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       I am half Chinese. My father is from Hong Kong. I was born in Canada, but I, when I was only a few months old, moved to Hong Kong and that's really where I grew up. Aside from that, I've also lived in, uh, Shanghai, Singapore in London, and then I came to the states for university. So I've had a pretty like Kametra politan mixed background. Um, in addition to my like, racial heritage. And I think coming on to an American campus for the first time was the first time I was really made aware of my race in a very real way. Because growing up, you're Asian in like Asian expat circles is actually not that uncommon. I'm not gonna say that there's a lot of us, but you don't have like quite a few mixed kids in the schools that I was going to like the American, like kind of foreign ex schools. So I never really thought about it. I had friends of all different races growing up and we got along fine. I mean, I'm not gonna say that I was colorblind because I knew like, oh yeah, this person's Indian, this person's white. Uh, but it was never a point of contention or anything like that. But, you know, going on to an American college campus, it was a whole different story. And I think

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       that's maybe that, like when you first noticed that difference,

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       it was a little bit strange because I remember I was really excited to go to, I'd never lived in America before. I had been going to American schools all my life. And you know, I had so many friends that were American, but I never lived in America before. And I was really excited about it, uh, because in schools I learned American history and stuff like that, but never lived there. So when I started college, I was really excited to get the American experience because it was almost like a, you know, it was the, the place that movies took place in when we're celebrities were from where everything I read about in books happen. So I, I really like built it up in my head and I was excited to get that experience. But it's funny when I got there and I saw my dorm room assignment, um, USC, which is where I did my freshman year, they have this thing where they, they kind of segregate dorms a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       Um, there's like a gay floor, there is a black floor, there's like a Muslim housing thing. Um, and I went to look at my room assignments and every single other person that was in my dorm also had an Asian last name. So I was in essentially the Asian ghetto. Wow. So that was kind of like the first time where I was like, wait, what? Because I had never, I'd never really experienced being stereotyped in such an obvious way for that. And maybe it maybe was just an accident, but I all I know is that I never volunteered. Like, Hey, Yep, put me with all the other agents. Um, I actually was an accident can, right, right. Yeah. There's not that many Asians at USC. Uh, that it just like literally every other person in that suite, uh, there's like a thing, maybe like 15 other people.

Speaker 2:          00:09:07       Um, so I applied for a room transfer because I was like, well, I mean, no offense, like, I'm sure you're lovely people, but I, I didn't come here to just live among other agents. I want a, you know, just a general mixed American, whatever experience. Um, and so that was like the first instance. And then, you know, uh, aside from that, I had, I was approached a lot by people to join, like, you know, the Asians in film club or the Asians in this club. And that's when I started to notice that race was a lot, a much bigger deal in America than it was for me growing up in Hong Kong or Canada.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       So, I know you talk about identity politics a lot now, but what were your politics like before you realize that this whole thing was happening?

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Well, I mean, I was conservative going into college. I went to college, Republican you, sorry, I college republicans meetings when I was 17, so I didn't have really a moment where I was liberal then became conservative. But I, in terms of the race issue, if it's even an issue, I just wasn't thinking about it. Right. I was just for like, you know, uh, economic responsibility, lower the budget, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, I, I think it kind of, it made me feel in a way, I don't want to sound like an SJW, but marginalize the way that they were constantly bringing up my, my Asianess. And I think that's what made me more interested in cultural issues as opposed to just governmental issues because I was seeing how, how much of their philosophy was affecting me in my everyday life. And I mean, I have people who, you know, on my channel, they say, you're always talking about culture and social stuff. Why don't you talk about more policy. And I mean, frankly my viewership, I think it's 75% under the age of 35 and for a lot of these college students or people who have just graduated, this is stuff that affects them every day of their life. Like they, they are bombarded in like social media, pop culture with your races this versus uh, you know, your race did this, you can't talk about this because of your race. So for these people, and for me at the time, that was the biggest thing that was affecting us.

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       When you started doing the videos then were you like, holy cow, there is a world of people talking about this? Because I mean that's, even though I did come from the left, so I wasn't always let's say on this side, whatever that means. Like when I started talking about these things, I suddenly was like, Oh, I'm not the only one. There are that many yet. And now they're kind of growing. But yeah, pretty nice feeling to know some other people out there.

Speaker 2:          00:11:29       It was, and actually, you know, I grew up, well, I grew up from college, like late teens onwards, watching people like Steven Crowder, uh, how the world works. Ellie Dorian, he doesn't really make videos anymore. By the time he was one of my favorites, he did sort of the whole political like debunking commentary thing. Um, and I, I still appreciated that because for so long when I was in college, I felt like I was in a bubble and I was the crazy one. I was the only one with my, of opinions and everyone else thought the same way. So in making my videos, I did kind of hope that maybe for someone else out there, I could be that lifeline that was like, hey, you're not crazy. Someone else also believes this. You're not losing your mind. You're not a racist. You're not a sexist just for thinking differently.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       Yeah. What about, um, just generally what it's like to be a young person that's a conservative?

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       It's not the easiest thing. Uh, and I think in conservatives, especially right now, we're so against the idea of like victim hood culture, but I don't think it's playing into victimhood culture to say that it is, it is difficult. And you know, not only am I younger but also being someone who's half Asian. And you experienced this because you're gay and I have watched your Prager, uh, Prager u show with Kennesaw and it's like she experiences it because she's black. But when you are not even conservative but just not far left and uh, you know, one of these protected groups, uh, that doesn't like fit the mold of who they think should be disagreeing with them, you get even more of an attack. Right? Because then you're called, I'm called things like an uncle Chan, um, you know, kind of so on. This is called really terrible things, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       Well, what is it that they want you to believe as as a person with some Asian heritage? What is it that they want you to believe? Cause it's a little bit different than they were. They can say to gay people, Assay, we are the ones who got you right. So you better bow to us forever or black people, we're giving you this or that. What does it cause Asians have been by and large, extremely successful. Yes. Due to hard work and family and all those things. Yeah. So what is it that they want you to be?

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       They want us to believe that white people don't accept us. Still see us as other, uh, I've had, you know, progressive's tell me that the only reason that conservatives watch me is because they think I'm white or that I'm trying to be white or that they're tokenizing me and you know, they're propping me up as a way to say, see, I'm not racist, which is really what are the most racist things that I've ever heard. And that's, that is hard. And I think we see like with this, like our, our oppression hierarchy, um, you know, they still like to claim Asians as their own, but at the same time progressive's right now we're happy to throw Asians under the bus when it comes to something like affirmative action, which it's, it's been documented actually harms Asians and it's, it's really frustrating. Especially I did a re a video recently on colorism, which if you're, yeah, it's the idea that it's not just race, sorry, wait, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       Racism is like prejudice against different races plus systemic power according to them. And then colorism is like, we're talking more about skin tone so it can even apply to people within the same race. Um, so I did a video about that and you know, frankly, I didn't, I didn't even disagree with the idea that colorism exists and that there are some people out there who might prefer like a lighter skinned person to a darker skinned person because I don't think either of us would say that individual sexism or racism or whatever type of prejudice exist, right. Because people are jerks and bad people. Yeah, exactly. Be, um, but pretty much my video, I said that I don't think there's enough evidence to say that colorism affects something like prison sentencing, which is what the MTV video that I was responding to. Sad. And, um, also that I'm darker skinned black people get longer prison sentences than lighter skin black people because of their race.

Speaker 2:          00:15:07       Right. I'm not just like there, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm pretty much, I was just saying I don't think there's really evidence to back this up. And I think the conversations around colorism, just like the conversation surrounding racism, it's not so much a fight for a quality anymore as it is to try and bring down the oppressors or those more privileged, right. It, so the conversations surrounding race I think has evolved too, unfortunately, demonize white people in a lot of ways. And what we're seeing in the conversation with colorism is that lighter skin minorities are kind of being demonized in the same way. And that that's what my video is about. Uh, and I got a lot of people quite upset that they weren't, they weren't happy with that. Uh, you know, I was told to shut up because my opinion doesn't matter because I'm not dark skinned and so I wouldn't know what it's like to be experienced colorism, which is nice little bit of irony there that apparently they didn't get. And I, yeah, I was just, uh, attacked for being, you know, uh, uncle Chan equivalent, just a puppet used by white people to try and tear down darker skin minorities. And it's just, I mean, I've been watching your stuff. I don't know if you're feeling like this a little bit lately, but I'm, I'm getting really pretty fed up about it, fed up of being told that I'm not special enough in terms of diversity points to have my opinion, man. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       Well, it's funny because I think you know, this about me, my general disposition is I'm fairly agreeable and I try to be respectful and all those things. But there are these moments where I'm like, this thing is so dangerous. It's so out of control that there are these moments where I just want to like unleash hell on these people. Really like take them down. I'm doing it. I guess in a, maybe a more casual, slower. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       I completely understand. And it's funny when I started making my videos I was so under the impression where it's like, yeah, other people face controversy and backlash, but I'm, I'm so variable and like I'm going to explain it in a way where they can't misunderstand me, where it's like obvious that I'm arguing for more quality and stuff like that. Clearly not the case. And I'm still not a provocateur. My goal is never to upset people and I really do. I'm speaking out about these issues because I want more equality, but I am at the point now where it's like, yeah, there, there are some people who are just bitter and they're raging ideologues. They don't want to listen. They don't care what you say. They're just going to demonize you based on who they think you are and use your identity to, you know, call you a whole bunch of slurs. It's quite awful.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       It is quite awful. So I know we could, we could sit here all day long and talk about what's going on with the left and how, you know, the, the oppression Olympics and that whole thing. Do you see any things on the right that you're worried about?

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       Yeah, well I think, you know, politics, it's almost a game of like back and forth reaction and then action and then et Cetera, et cetera. And so on the right, I'm just worried that there are people on the right who are getting so fed up like I am where they're actually seeing it for the example in the issue of identity where they're saying like, yeah, let's, let's have our own identitarian politics, which is completely the other way of where I think we should be going. And Jordan Peterson speaks out about this too, where it's like if you, if you don't like a game that someone's playing, you don't respond by playing at yourself. You Stop, you stop the game. And I think there are some people on the right that right now are happy to start to, you know, buy into it. It's like maybe, yeah, we have like a black club.

Speaker 2:          00:18:27       We have a Hispanic club. Why not a white club where it's like, you know, you have most reasonable people. It's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, let's, let's calm down. Let's, let's stop this. Um, so that, that's something I'm worrying about on on the right. And just in general, there are people that are so entrenched in the culture where right now I got people mad at me. I lost subscribers because I said that the captain marvel movie was pretty good. That's all I said was pretty good. My brother said he was pretty good too. I was like, I was sort of wanting to boycott or just because of that stupid comment, but I know it's going to fit right in. I know. That's why I want to know what happens. Uh, yeah. So I said it was pretty good and new people freaked out and I just hope with all of this stuff that we don't lose sight of.

Speaker 2:          00:19:09       The reason why we oppose the authoritarian identity. Marion's, right. We keep things in perspective. It's not, so we can have our own group that does the same thing to other people. If so, we can move past this and try to maybe like calm things down where we can actually talk about issues and policies rather than calling everyone else and not see or like, uh, I dunno, whatever type of fascist. So interesting to me because you can watch videos that I was doing before the election where I kept saying, if you guys on the left, and when I was saying it was, that's right. I was like, if we don't stop calling your rotor racist and stop calling Trump a Nazi and the rest of it, we're going to create this on the road. And it's almost like in a weird way, that's almost what they want to do, which makes people like us our job.

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       I guess that was more important. Right. And I'm, the only hope that I have really is that the loud voices that you hear online are not representative of the average person, which I don't think they are. Right. You have that vocal minority. And I think most people who are just, you know, living their everyday lives, maybe they have a Twitter account to follow people they actually know in real life, not just like this whole political world that we're wrapped up and they look at both of these sides and they just think, wow, you guys are insane. You're crazy. Never stops. Right? Like every morning there's another headline about some gender related thing or you know, this reverse reverse racism, just like any old idiotic thing. And every day I'm like, Oh, here's another, here's another. And then it's like, all right, should we stop fighting it and just let it be or yeah, and you have to fight it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       I get people who say that all the time, like, why are you still out talking about like x issue? How about you harped on this enough? And I mean, on one hand I say like, yeah, I like, this is 15 video that I've made about it, but on the other they're still doing these things. So I, I'm personally not even sure what the best way to combat it anymore is. Do we ignore it? Pretend, pretend it's not happening anymore to not drive more attention to it, but would that just kind of be being complacent and letting them do whatever they want? It's a hard balance to strike.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       Yeah. So you mentioned the culture portion of this before. Yeah. Tagline for your show is, it's like your culture, the intersection of culture and politics, politics. Um, I find that I'm not that interested in politics anymore. That the culture thing has become much more interesting to me because the politics thing is after. Yeah. Well everyone says it's downstream, right? That was, I guess Breitbart's line. It's the politics of masters from culture. Um, but everything has become this,

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       right? Yeah. And it's, it's funny because, um, you know, I will have people who will ask me, what do you think about this bill or this policy? Why don't you talk more about, um, something like foreign aid? And you know, my, my background is in political science. I was a researcher for my professors when I was in school, so I am really interested in policy. Uh, it's not that I'm not, but I, I think that right now what's happening happening culturally, this is, we can't even begin to talk about what, for example, presidential candidates think about that. I don't know, domestic spending when everyone's being called a racist or a sexual Predator or you know, it, it's just, it's hard to get too political talking points when you first have to debunk that you're a white supremacist. Right. And I really want to get to the point where we can talk about those issues, but right now we have this huge block in front of us and I think especially when we're talking about younger voters, which are becoming a bigger and bigger influence in elections, so much of what younger voters, you know, what they choose to support is based on things like cultural aspects.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       So I don't think we can ignore that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       [inaudible] do you get a lot of emails or tweets from sort of young lefties? Cause I think every, by default most people are lefties. It's just when they're young. Yeah, it's media and it's uh, it's Hollywood. It's the whole thing. Sort of the default position is your left and right. I'm sure you're getting some 16, 17, 18 year olds that are watching your videos and going, Whoa, maybe I'm not

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       okay. Yeah, well I'm actually a pretty good it does. And at any time because you probably get the burnout too sometimes where it's like, oh gosh, I've said something and now people are [inaudible]. Um, it is really encouraging to get someone who says, Hey, I love your videos. I used to be really this way, but you've kind of opened my mind to things and I don't think identify the same way that I used to or even, and maybe not even that, but just someone who says, Hey, I'm, I'm a liberal, I'm on the left. But I still enjoy watching your videos for a different perspective. And that to me is what's so encouraging and why I keep making videos.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       Yeah. Yeah. So what are some of the issues that are on your mind right now? So I've seen you do a lot about the gender stuff, Austin, where are you at with the whole transgender movement at the moment?

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       Well, it's, it's funny because, uh, as far as I know, I am no way a transpo. I would never treat someone differently or withhold human rights from them based on how, on how they identify or anything like that. That's really clear about this. So when they click this video, so you don't have an irrational fear of trans? No, no, no. I don't. To be bigoted towards them. Were prejudicial towards, no, no I don't. Um, but I think the whole conversation around gender right now, it's coming to a point where we're not just saying, hey, you know, these are people with, uh, you know, this, this medical condition which had been diagnosed. Like let's try to support them in whatever way doctors think our best, you know, let's make sure they don't feel alienated. It's gone from that to, um, not only is gender not a real thing, but biological sex is also not a real thing.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       And also lets a, it's okay to give hormones to kids. So the conversation has really, really derailed from where it was, I think even just five years ago, which is, is scary to me. And we do a lot of videos on the show, pseudo intellectual about how the stuff is affecting young kids. Because I think a lot of people, they may watch a video that I've done about transgender issues or whatever, and think, why do you care? Why does it matter to you? Like this? Stop butting into other people's lives. And you know, I on a person to person level, like, I don't care what you do, your body or however you prefer to your life, go for it. But this matters because of systemic issues, right? It's, it's, it's gotten a lot bigger than that. We have, um, laws like in Canada, they'll see 16 that may criminalize speech if you don't use someone's correct pronoun.

Speaker 2:          00:25:14       Um, we actually have cases now where parents are having to go to court because they don't want their children to be given hormones. Um, so this isn't just, this isn't just affecting individuals. And this isn't just me being a jerk and not wanting to use this pronoun for you. Um, you know, I'm talking about this issue because it's affecting I think, individual freedoms and parental rights and mainly parental rights because we see this coming down into the school systems. So for someone that is paying attention to this, that's doing a lot of videos on these topics for that very reason, are you shocked how much trans stuff is the only way I can put it? Yeah. He's just constantly out there. Like it seems so disproportionately focused on it is absolutely disproportionately what you're saying. Yeah, no, it is completely disproportionate. And uh, you know, we did a video about rapid onset gender dysphoria, um, because a lot of us kind of just observing might think, wow, it seems like there are a lot more trans identifying people than before.

Speaker 2:          00:26:16       Maybe we're crazy. No, actually that's correct. Numbers have really skyrocketed, especially among young, younger generations. Um, so they, they've begun to do studies and they found that gender dysphoria actually manifests itself, especially among young girls in social clusters. Right. If there's a teenage or maybe early twenties girl who's now identifying as maybe not a girl, she believes she's trans, it's actually quite likely that in her social group there is another person that's doing as well. So this study I was actually looking at whether it's possible that gender dysphoria could be somewhat of a social contagion there. Their phrase not mine. Um, similar to things like bulemia anorexia and things like that. And they actually did found that yet there's a strong correlation. Um, what that means is that the people who are saying, hey, maybe we shouldn't be teaching this at such young age or maybe we shouldn't be, um, you know, glamorizing it as this like new trend because it might affect people. Maybe we are right. Maybe we're not just being crazy and bigoted and again, why, what's the big deal? So they identify as a different person. A lot of people might be asking, um, well, you know, becoming whatever you want when it involves things like hormones and potentially surgeries, it, this is a big deal. This isn't something we should be minimizing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       Yeah. Have you found it's hard to find people on the left to talk to these issues about

Speaker 2:          00:27:36       yes, yes. It's, it's very hard and the response that I've been met with is that, you know, you hate me, you're denying my humanity, uh, you want to erase me, et Cetera, et cetera. It's frustrating because that's no matter what someone may call themselves at the end of the day, they're another person and I, I would never wish them harm or want them to be deprived of life, liberty or property or anything like that. And I would like to think I would also want to be kind to them too. So it's, it is, it is hurtful. I like having all those doors close in your face.

Speaker 1:          00:28:05       Yeah. Are you as a sort of hopeful, would I, for what I would call it, sort of the new center, right? That I think is sort of conservatives like yourself. Like there's just a younger breed of conservatives that I think are a little more tolerant on some of the social stuff than the libertarian saved. A classical liberal is the x lefties that there really is something growing right now. They're, for all the reasons that everything feels crazy, it's actually something really nice taking root right now. If you could just sort of step away from the craziness for a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       Yeah, I think so. Um, you know, it's very encouraging to see how youtube as a platform has kind of played its own role in furthering political and cultural conversations among younger people.

Speaker 1:          00:28:44       Wait, so it's not making everyone part of the, Oh, no, no. Were you on that thing, by the way? I was on that thing, that alternative and alternative influence networks, which have no, this is from data and society. I mean everyone watching this thing, but you know, there was no scientific basis for that study. All they did, I've been, I'm sure you know. Yeah. We'll just draw pictures to all of our names. So you've been on my show. I've been on Rogan show Rogan, talk to Sam Harris. They drew all this picture and then the, the study basically said we're, we're turning people on the far right. Yeah. Uh, but there's been subsequent actual studies where people have shown that we've actually d radicalized a lot of people in ways. So just bananas. Yeah. And actually a temple. I know. I was honored to be on the chart with you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, I'm Tim Pool for, I know you've spoken to about, he was like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:29:26       my connections weren't even real. I didn't even appear on shows with these people. And you know, I didn't even bother to check my little connections. What are they like, they're not gonna care if I was or if I wasn't. I know that I'm not radicalizing people, so it's like, Eh, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:29:40       Um, what are you worried that when things

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       like that come out and then they put you on that, that then we see the way these things get escalated where then it's like, oh, Lauren talked to this person who's in a accused white supremacists and now Facebook says you can't be a white supremacist and be on Facebook, but now you're that much closer to them. Yeah. And Ruben talked to this one and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. So I know you've talked about, you spoke about social media censorship before, which I appreciate because I feel like more people need to be talking about this and the reaction that I get from some people is that like you're paranoid. Like you're just, you know, you're seeing a boogeyman where there's not, if people aren't watching your videos, because I don't want to watch it. Like people maybe just don't care to engage with your tweets, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       Um, you do get called paranoid when you talk about these things, but then you have these lists, right? There's a list literally linking you to actual white supremacists and then you know, someone like youtube comes out and say, they outright say, yeah, we are going to be, I'm not recommending extremist or conspiracy content. And you're kind of like, well, I'm on that list. Does that mean I'm mixed? Like I don't think this is just paranoia. Yeah. To worry about this. Um, and you know, part of me, like I said, they're going to say what they're going to say. The other part of me is like, wait, this does matter because this affects who can see my videos, my ability to get my message out there and never mind that. I don't want someone who doesn't know who, who I am, whatever being told that I'm a Nazi so they shouldn't watch my videos and just write me off entirely. That's not a good, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       Right. And you could also brush a lot of it off your shoulder, but you know, we're still people too. And it's like when you go to get a slice of pizza, if there's someone standing there that's looking at you and they heard that you're a white supremacist, that's, that's no fun.

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       No, no, for sure. And I think people who fling these words at people online, and I don't know if they really believe it, if they, if they're actually people out there who believe that I am a Nazi and a white supremacist or if they're just trying to be, you know, hurtful and inflammatory, but I don't think they realize how much damage that does. Like not just to a, you know, a platform or a career. But just like personally, like you, you kind of have to defend to people who maybe know you in real life. Like, hey, why people saying that about you? Because again, for people who aren't in our crazy online world, maybe they don't know that Nazi is just another word for disagrees with you. Right. Because I mean, if you told me 10 years ago that so and so was a Nazi, I'll probably been like,

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       oh my gosh. Oh, now it's the boy who cried wolf. Yeah. And now every time they say that about somebody or one of those things, I start having to really, I'd now, even lately I've been thinking about some of the people over the years that were really called this or that, and I'm like, man, did I really not understand what the actual truth was? And the answer probably is yes.

Speaker 2:          00:32:19       Yeah. And that's, that's a scary place to be in if when we're kids have lost their meaning, because I mean, I'm sure you feel the same way. I actually do think being a Nazi as a bad thing, like being a racist or a record. Yeah. Like full disclosure, not pro Nazi-ism, not pro sexism, not I'm, I'm pro good things, anti bad things. Uh, so like it, it's hard when people kind of just muddy the waters and it's like words don't mean anything anymore. And you were called the worst things imaginable on a daily basis.

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       Yeah. So how has been working for, uh, for Glen over at the blaze? Cause that's, that's all part of this conversation. It's like here's a guy who was I think unfairly demonized for a long time and who has also said that, you know, he was part of the sort of cable news problem in the outreach thing. Yeah. But he's kind of head is mia culpa about it and he's trying to build bridges now and it's like I give that guy a lot of credit. No, no one's perfect. And we've all done things in our past that we're not proud of.

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       Yeah, for sure. And I mean, the thing with blaze TV, what I love about them is that they give us so much freedom and just control over our product. So you know, anything you see on our show, which all the videos are up on youtube now, which is another thing, I'm happy for them there. They've given us the freedom to just give our content to the general public. Um, is that we from start to finish control what we want to say. I have never been fed a line. Okay, you have to take this position on, on this topic and you can't say this, don't like don't talk to this person. I've not been told that. Where, I mean, and if you're familiar with how like bigger networks operate, that's really rare. That doesn't happen all the time. And I don't think people understand that. And I still get people all the time who come to me.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       I'll be tagged like, hey, like this person who's also on [inaudible] said this and this. How could you work with someone that blah, blah, blah. Or did you see what x person said is like, I don't know what they say. Like, and they can say whatever they want. I'm going to say what I say. And I think there are some people who are so into purity testing that they can't even imagine a network or a, you know, a platform where that doesn't happen. We're not, everybody needs to tow the same line about the same issue. And I think that like it boggles their minds.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       Yeah. Do you hold any positions that are sort of outside of what general conservatives or cause I think of you a little bit more as a libertarian generally.

Speaker 2:          00:34:38       I, I actually did go through my libertarian phase in college. Um, I used to call myself a conservatory and um, but now like with issues like the, the border, which I know is kind of even among libertarians themselves are not really together on. So like I, I generally just call myself a conservative right now. I don't know if there are issues. Oh, I got one. The environment. Um, I think there are definitely people on the right who don't believe climate change exists at all. I am not one of those people. Um, and then, you know, going even further that there are some people on the right who do you believe that climate change is an issue but they don't think that government should be involved? Um, I wouldn't be against, um, I don't know. I'm trying to think of like a green initiative that I would support, but just in general, I am sort of public private combination. Yeah, exactly. Because I don't want the green new deal. That would be one of the worst things that could happen just for, for many reasons. I think

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       that a freshman senator never done anything

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       other than win reelection could write a document that would reorganize the entire economy is introduce ubi as like a footnote now. And you don't have to work in cow farts. Yeah. You don't think that's a good idea. Um, but yeah, that is what I would say that I'm more environmentally conscious than maybe other people on the right. Um, what else? Also a, the issue, I don't know if people on the right are against prison reform. I don't think they're against it, but I think we don't talk about it enough. Um, so I, I think maybe I put more importance on that than other people along on the right. Do we make this a Trump guy ever do this again? Yeah, I think I, I think I saw him on a tweet or something. You can, um, the tweeter. Yeah. So I'm one of those people who never thought that Trump would win and I was like unimaginable to me.

Speaker 2:          00:36:22       Um, but now that he has, I think he's done a lot of good for conservative values and I am someone who will never defend what comes out of his mouth in terms of what he said about Rosie O'donnell or, uh, who was that? Who is Horseface again? Which one was that? Someone was worse face. Stormy Daniels. Yeah. It's like, I'm not on board with that, but in terms of, I guess what his administration has implemented, I mean, right now in terms of the economy, black people, Hispanic people, women, their unemployment rates are at record lows. I think that's something that everybody, regardless of how you feel about Donald Trump as a person should be happy for. Yeah. For some reason the congressional Democrats couldn't applaud that at the state of the weird, yeah, that was, that was strange. It's like I thought you were for that. And you know, never mind like black entrepreneurship is also at an all time high.

Speaker 2:          00:37:10       And something that frustrates me is that I get called like anti black a lot and it's like, well, policies that I support have led to this, led to these people having jobs, being able to start their own businesses. Like that to me is the most pro black you could possibly be. Empowering these people to, you know, take control of their own lives and be able to be successful based on their own merit, which they absolutely have. Have you figured out any tricks to, to win over those young people who are on the fence? Like just the story that you can tell or just a tactic that you have? I think overall just being willing to really understand what your proponent is saying does go a long way with some people. Um, because I've had people comment that I'm glad you don't try to oversimplify things or you know, shy away from issues that maybe don't make your side look good.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       Um, and again, like I'll, I'll bring about the environment. I'm not saying that I absolutely do not believe that the government, uh, should be just putting all the money into solar and wind in the hopes that something happens. Um, but I'm, I going to deny that. I think we should be talking about the issue of the environment. No, I'm not. And I think just being able to have that goes a long way for some people. And then, I mean, of course there are these, these ideologues who you're never going to connect with and I, that's something that I've had to come to terms with that some people just don't want to listen and there's nothing you can say that was going to change their mind. But for a lot of people, I think they understand when someone's being, or at least trying to be rational and reasonable.

Speaker 1:          00:38:39       Yeah. So, even though you've bounced around the world and you've done your roaming thing, you're, you're based in Canada now. Is it weird to you sometimes to think how much of what you think about and talk about and focus on is actually all coming from another country?

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       Well, it's funny, I have people all the time we say like why you always talking about American politics? I don't really talk about politics that much. I'm kind of like you go to the culture. Yeah. I goes to the culture and I had someone, I made a comment about the Hashtag my white privilege thing that was going around and I was told to stay out of American politics in my, my sponsor was like, how is this American politics? Um, cause these cultural issues, they don't end at borders because the internet doesn't end up borders, right? This online presence doesn't end at borders. So especially when I'm talking about issues like a gender or race, where we have, are extremely liberal government that's actually putting these kinds of ideologies into law. I think I'm absolutely talking about something that applies to my country. And I think it's something that, it's funny like maybe some of these Americans who are on the left, they're trying to tell me to butt out.

Speaker 2:          00:39:45       Um, if I were perhaps, I mean this is like, it's all, all conversation, but if I were perhaps an undocumented immigrant, they maybe were, it wouldn't be so, uh, like anti foreign. Um, but also I just, I think that some people need to recognize that culture is, it doesn't stop at borders. And so like these issues affect Canadians. These issues affect Brits and my, my breakdown of who watches my show, it's like about 60% Americans. Um, but then I had like a good 10% Canadians, 10% of Brits, and you know, the rest of the angles sphere, the Australian. So these really are global issues.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       So basically you're in California right now. If we could get you to overstay your visa or something. Not Easy. You're just busy visiting. Yeah. We just get you to cancel your return flight and then just, you just hide out here. We'll make you an illegal immigrant. And then you could argue as an illegal and then maybe they will listen to me. You'll see how quickly they turn against. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That will be, I have thought about that before, but now I'm just, I'm just kidding. Yeah. That will, that will not go over well. Yeah. Um, what are some of the other, oh, so you mentioned that my white privilege Hashtag that was going around. So for people that have no idea for the people that are saying enough not to be on Twitter, why those people by white privilege,

Speaker 2:          00:40:57       this Hashtag that was started on Twitter and it ended up trending. Um, and it was metaphor, just white people to check their privilege to mention instances or maybe trends they've noticed that are due to their whiteness, a privilege that they know that a non white person would not get. Yeah. And the thing is like, I don't deny the idea of privilege exists. Like I coming from a two parent household, I've lived a lot of places. I've gone to good schools. I absolutely acknowledge that I've had privileges that a lot of people haven't had. You know, that's,

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       is that privilege or is that just life experience? You've had a life experience. They're

Speaker 2:          00:41:32       kind of, they're kind interchangeable. Like I don't have systemic privilege, but I've had, you know, things that afforded to me in my life that other people haven't had and life's not fair and I don't think anyone would dispute that life isn't fair. Um, and that's that. But I think, you know, the idea when other people mentioned white privilege, they're talking about the idea that for white people, um, you know, their skin color affords them certain privileges that non white people don't have. Um, and I think that's a very, very toxic mentality. And if you, I was reading some of those tweets and just like blood pressure just raising through the roof as painful to read some of them. It really is self flagellation. Yeah. Oh my gosh. It's like the, you can kind of like almost imagine these like white progressive's like on their knees trying to grovel down before they're non white friends and like, apologize for the whiteness of their skin.

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       It's, it's, it's depressing and embarrassing to watch, I think. And you know, they talk about, they like I got pulled over by a cop and then he didn't give me a ticket Hashtag my white privilege. And it's like, well, I mean sometimes cops, like I personally, I, I've never been pulled over and knock on a ticket. I've only gotten a ticket ones, but it's like I've never been given that kind of, you know, leeway a, you know, I've had teachers maybe who were a little more lenient for me. Is that because I'm white or is it because of my female or was it because I'm a good student? There's where we are so keen to attribute motive to people and like it just reinforces this idea that yeah, white people are privileged and it's annoying because now merely denying the existence of white privilege makes you a racist and a bigot.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       Do you think it's fair to say that these people are the new racist? Like if I was to really pick like, I don't like doing this because you said something before you don't want to become yeah. While you're fighting against. So I don't want to start walking around and, and labeling these people, read racists and all of the things that they have no problem labeling the rest of us. But if you were to ask me where does racism come from in America today, it is coming from the left. If were to sexism come from in America today, all CIS gendered White Christian men or this or white people are this, these are, these are leftist ideas that aren't just like ephemeral things happening on Twitter. These are things that they're, that the lefty politicians are talking about, the presidential candidates for, the Democrats are talking about. Yeah. So that's why it's so dangerous to me.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       Yeah. And I agree with that. And I wouldn't know. I have friends who are on the left and progressive, um, who are, who I do think at the end of the day want to quality. I think we have different ideas about how to get there. Um, so, you know, I wouldn't just base on someone being a progressive, call them racist. But I think if you, if you are someone who thinks that because of the color of their skin, someone is not entitled to have an opinion about a certain issue that is racist. If you, if you are someone who thinks that you know, this person because of their skin color is entitled to either more or less of a, of a starting point or a advantage or disadvantage, then you are a racist. And I think historically generally kind of been the agreed upon definition of racist. So yeah, like there's no reverse racism. It's just

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       racism. Yes. Racism. I was talking to somebody of a progressive, uh, who's a family friend and we were getting into it and I said, are you for affirmative action that she said, yes, we have to help minorities get more jobs on that. I said, are you for discriminating against white people? And she said, no. And I said, well, how do you do? How do you negotiate? How do you reconcile those two things? And I said, well, what about your kids? You, she has three kids. I said, well what about your kids? Do you think your kids happened to be white? Do you think that everything being equal, if they're going up against the minority, they should not get the job. And she was like, well no, because then you have to take it on a case by case basis. And I said, well you just made different first argument but they can't quite get over that sort of disconnect. And that's what I think we have to keep doing to, to get them there,

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       to make them realize. I think, I think you're absolutely right. And I think for a lot of progressives they do think that they're doing the right thing. Almost, maybe even a little bit of a white savior complex. I would say they need to come in and rescue them. But, um, when it comes to like affirmative action specifically, it frustrates me that so many people on the left are keen to conflate class with race. Um, you know, cause they'll say like, oh well, you know, for black kids they don't have the same resources growing up in schools. And it's like, well, hang on. I went to good schools, we had some black kids that were definitely richer than my family or you know, like vice versa and it's like sellout. Yeah. It's like if you want to have a conversation about class in school funding, then let's have that. Which I actually, you know, I think one of the privileges that is kind of undeniable is that some kids are afforded more luxuries in their schools or whatever than other kids, you know, in an inner city kid is not going to have the same education or whatever. So let's try to address that and say how we can improve the inner city schools and stuff. That's where you'd have the conversation. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       Mentoree school in Beverly Hills. Guess what? It's way more funded than the average school.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       The teachers have different classifications. So how do you deal with that? Okay, yeah. Then that's a good starting spot. But unfortunately that's not this. No, because then they want to make it all about race. And it's like that distinction matters because how we see the problem affects how we assault, how we solve the problem. Um, so it's like you and I can't just kind of go to them and it's like, Hey, here are, you know, proposals for like, uh, budgets or you know, how to deal with teacher's unions, whatever. For the schools when they see the problem as systemic racism, like you're not gonna get anywhere with people like that. And it's, it's frustrating because like that whole narrative and I, I get flack, I get accused of like, oh, you don't really care about, you know, the black community or whatever. You're just kind of like, you're, you just like to say whatever racist stuff you want.

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       And it's like, no, I am trying to [inaudible] I make videos trying to talk about, you know, the, the importance of fathers and families, you know, how important it is to have economic freedoms that really allow people to succeed. It's like, that actually is what I think would be most useful to vulnerable communities of whatever color. There's a ton of evidence that supports that. Yes. Yeah, yeah. But it's like they don't, because it doesn't feed into the narrative of systemic racism. They don't even want to hear it. And they, they accuse you of not wanting to help. How much of this

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       do you think is just for young people especially? Um, it's just the excesses of the West that we have. Things have gone so well for us now for so long. If you live in America, you're basically free. You are free, you may have problems, but you are free. You live in the freest society ever. And that young people now who can play fort night all day long or watch porn or whatever the hell else there is to do or play video games or whatever, it's like they now have to find problems with everything. And what's the easiest thing to do once you find the problem? It's just to burn the whole system down, not to actually acknowledge that, Whoa, this took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears of generations before you.

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       Yeah. That's such a good point. And not only are people free in the u s they are economically prosperous by any metric. You take someone who's living in poverty in the United States and you compare it to a global level is still doing pretty dang well. You know, someone who grew up in Southeast Asia, you know, Hong Kong and Singapore are very prosperous countries, but I visited to places like Indonesia and Thailand where they're like, that actually is structural poverty. So, you know, I'm able to recognize how privileged we are just to be in the west. Um, and I think a lot of millennials now, they been painted a picture where capitalism has failed, the American dream is dead. AOC says that all the time. Like we're living in of like, you know, all the billionaires have all the money, the working class, we're screwed. We don't have anything that's not true.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       And that's not to say that issues like high tuition don't exist and stuff. Yeah, absolutely they do. We should talk about it. But overall we are living in such tremendous affluence and prosperity and equality that the fact that there are people, you know, saying, no, this is so broken, we need to start all over and tear it all down. It like freaks me out. Can you move to New York, run against AOC and what do I, what do I have to do to him? I don't think the fund has some campaign finance. What are we talking? It would take a lot of campaign finance to get me to New York. I tell you that. Not my favorite city, but I mean I think even people are starting to wake up to the fact like we had the whole Amazon Toboco right? Um, and at the end of the day, like, yeah, people love the sort of like socialist, populous rhetoric, but you know what else they love is just actual jobs.

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       And so when, you know, when we had Amazon being chased away, we did have like, angry New Yorkers being like, okay, but wait, 25,000 jobs. Yeah. Like I, everyone loves Amazon. It's actually gets there fast. Even if you don't work for Amazon, you get to be part of like the growing economy surrounding and providing support to that, to that business. Uh, I think people are, at the end of the day, what they want more than anything else is jobs. And like, not necessarily the promise that I don't think is even possible to provide of like, oh, just all the, all this free stuff. At least that's what I'm hoping for a, but it is, it is really, I don't know, depressing, frustrating, sad, whatever negative. Where do you want to use a to see a generation of millennials, socialists or communists, whatever. Um, completely misrepresent the environment that we are living in now and not recognize how lucky they are.

Speaker 1:          00:50:50       Yeah, we got to wake these people up, but I guess I guess you're doing a pretty good job.

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       Well, I, you know, I've read people suggest we should have some sort of like internships study abroad program where we just send people, you know, these progressive mainly white, rich millennials to places like Venezuela or just like, you know, foreign places where they can maybe see a little bit more of the outside world beyond their bubbles or what they've been fed to really, really see how the u s stands or the West in general compared to other countries.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       W what do you make of the free college thing? I suspect you're not for free college generally, but what about just college as an institution because of the brainwashing that's going on or you even for young people going to college at this?

Speaker 2:          00:51:29       I have so many feet cause you know, I'm someone who I really, I worked my butt off when I was in high school to kind of get to the best college that I could. Um, I, I took it really, really seriously. When I was in college. I worked for my professors. Uh, you know, all my friends were in academia. Uh, it was kind of like assumed because I was in that world that I would go on and have my master's and stuff. And I have a lot of respect for academia. Um, but at the state, and I would never say that college is useless, but at the same time, I think we're reaching a point now where a, so, so much of what colleges do now is not really instruction, but it's indoctrination and be the return on a college degree. Especially if you're taking something like a gender studies or feminist theories degree or whatever it may be. The, the return is not worth it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       Can I get a job with lesbian badminton degree?

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       I mean, as buzzfeed hiring, that's essentially the only place that I would know what it would look at it. But I think we, we need to kind of reevaluate how we see college because you know, other countries they have really, they have things like a trade schools and things like that where, you know, it's not anti-education cause I'm not anti-education I'm always pro education. More knowledge is always good, but college is not the only way to get education. And I think colleges, if you look at where they're spending money on, they've really inflated the number of administrators they have. You have entire diversity boards and things now. It's like, where did you come from? Who's paying your salary while the students are, and I don't think it's worth it. I, you know, president Trump is actually taking measures now to try and enforce freedom of speech on canvases, which I think is really important. Um, but I am against the idea that everybody needs to go to college. The only way to be successful is to go to college. And I think by, by doing now we've kind of like, we've made the leftist in academia and touchable because they have like wave after wave of student who's, you know, willing to pay to get in so they can be indoctrinated.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       What is it that sort of the brilliance of it when you hear burns, sorry, Burns like, okay, free college for everybody. So what can we do? We're going to send them for free, which obviously is not free. There'll be indoctrinated into these ideas even further and then what does he do when you get out? Well now you're going to be guaranteed a federal job.

Speaker 2:          00:53:42       Yeah, that sounds horrible. Can you imagine anything that sounds worse now and it's like you can never get out and you're going to be some pencil pusher doing nothing. That's not for you. A cog in the system essentially. And what I think, I really haven't seen many people who are suggesting free tuition I talk about is okay, if it's all government subsidized, fine, but like how do we lower costs? Because it shouldn't just be about who pays it, but how much they're paying. And you know, costs in the United States have risen so much faster than inflation when it comes to college. And there are a lot of different factors. I, you know, like the student loans, the way that you can't get rid of a student loan debt with bankruptcy. There's a whole bunch of things, but I don't see enough people talking about how to lower those costs back down to what, what they used to be. Because I mean, you have people who, if you, if you go to some, somewhere like USC, uh, it's going to be like, what, 60 k a year. So that's like 240,000 by the time you're done. And it's like, it's ridiculous and it shouldn't, it shouldn't cost that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       I don't think I made $240,000 in all of my twenties if I took all of the money. Yeah, I'm sure I did all those years of struggling comedy at, it's like that's what you're paying to go to college.

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       It, nevermind the interest on that, right? Yeah. So no, it's a like, you know, I on the right and kind of like syndromes, we make fun of those people with $240,000 of worth of debt for their useless arts degree. Um, but I mean are they, I do think like, I'm not going to deny that there's a problem with college costs, it's just that I don't think the answer is okay. So just full on socialism. Government pays everything for it. I think we need to have a conversation about how to lower those costs again. And uh, I think right now students are paying for a lot of diversity and administrative faculty. They're paying for a lot of research done by their professors, which is, I mean, kind of great because American universities are really at the forefront worldwide of any type of research, but at the same time, it's like at what cost it's costing the American students. And I think community college is a great alternative. Uh, you know, cause obviously it's, it's a lot more affordable and heck, if you, if you still want that, that, you know, whatever name brand, university, Harvard or the Yale or whatever, you can always transfer after you get your associates.

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       Yeah. All right. A couple more for you. Sure. Let me ask you some, I'll turn identity politics on you. Uh, which would be, why aren't there more women in this space? You're one of the few alleys, Stuckey. There's a couple, um, book, but I wish there were more women, not, not for identity politics purposes, partly just a little bit for the optics of it. So that when we're all getting attacked for all this stuff, it's like, here's this, here's the low resolution part of this. Here's more women. Yeah. Even though it has nothing to do with your ideas and everything else, which is really what matters of course.

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       I think the reason why there aren't more women in this fear is kind of why there aren't more women in politics in general, is that this is a very aggressive sphere. It really is. And I think for, for me even it's, it can be overwhelming for a lot of people who, you know, aren't you, you put your ideas out there and then you're going to just get attacked like ruthlessly. So, and I'm not saying that men don't as well, but I think maybe, uh, as, as a, as a female identifying person, whatever the PC, you know, it for a, for a lot of women it might be a little bit harder to just say, okay, like, let me brush that off, move on and forget about it. And especially if you are a woman who's speaking out against progressive ideas, you're going to get even more attention than maybe a white male that's doing so.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       Because I think a lot of people figure, oh, oh, another white guy who hates feminism, who cares? But if you're a woman, then it's like you're, you're going against the grain. It's like error in the system and they really feel the need to double down. I mean, regardless of what you think about the Trump family, the way that Melania and Ivanka Trump are treated, I think most of us would agree is completely vile, sexist, the things that they are, they are called and it's a unfortunately kind of par for the course for conservative women or you know, someone who is gay and speaking out against the left or black, you get that much more pushback. So I think that alone unfortunately is enough for a lot of people to say, I don't know about this. I don't know if it's for me. So are you hopeful for the future?

Speaker 2:          00:57:43       Ooh, um, uh, you know what? I think my, my answer kind of goes back and forth for that. There are some days, you know, um, when, for example, I see people speaking out against maybe the Gillette ad and not, not being like totally irrational and, you know, wanting to burn cars down over a commercial. Cause that's all it is at the end of the day. But kind of saying like, okay, this is stupid. You don't need to do this to sell razor blades. Uh, you know, it stays like that where I think, okay good. Most people have kind of wanted to leave all of this identity politics in the, in the trash. Great. And then there are other days like I, I knew during the Cavenaugh hearing where I'm like, okay, nevermind just this was a mistake. Asteroid, just, we're ready, we're ready. So I, I go back and forth, but I think you've looking at Gen z, they're one of the generations most ready to like reject this whole like far left thing and that we've seen in a while. So I don't know about how hopeful I am from millennials, but I think maybe the, the next generation a little bit more.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       Yeah, that's actually exactly where I was going to end this. Then suddenly there's this now bursts of younger people. You're going to be, you're going to be old to these people. I hate to tell you, but that are now coming out and going, Whoa, we've seen the last five years of abject hysteria or lunacy and now they are becoming more conservative. And maybe that is the silver lining out of all.

Speaker 2:          00:59:01       Yeah. Well, cause I think and people make fun of this mean, but it's kind of true. Or it's like conservatism is almost counterculture right now. And a lot of people on the left laugh about that. But I mean, think about it. If you are a young person who's in school right now, like all of your teachers, you know, all of the media that you watch, the, the, the school books you're being given to that are given to you, they all push this progressive agenda. So what do you do if you want to rebel against that? Because let's face it, young people, if there's like tales all this time is that young people like to rebel. We like to be different. We like to like, I'm doing my own thing and we've all been teenagers. Yeah. Um, so how does a young person do that right now?

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       Well, it's not by kind of committing yourself to PC life and culture. That's not, that's not edgy. That's not against the grain. It's by saying no. Like, I'm gonna listen to this offensive comedian. I'm going to listen to like, you know, one of the, the people who I, I hear my professors or my parents or whatever telling me not to watch, you know, like the Jordan Peterson is the Dave Rubin's the real scandalous spicy one. Yeah. Um, and you know, I don't want conservatism to just become something people do to or believe in to get back at other people, but I'm hoping, you know, if maybe there's that little bit of like tantalizing, um, forced to get them there. Then once they start watching the videos, they'll see that, oh, this does make the most sense. So I'm not only doing this to get back at my teachers or my parents or whatever, but this actually does seem like an ideology, a belief system that can help people succeed by themselves and can promote a quality.

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       Yeah. Well, I just want to say that I think what you're doing is awesome and the fact that you've grown so much in the two and a half years since we did that little thank you two week thing. I mean, you're, you're becoming a star in this space and it's, it's great. We need people like you, and as homer Simpson said, you're a person like you. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:00:48       I am a person like me. I thank you. And, and you're just back at you watching you and Dr. Peterson go on, go on your tour and everything. It's, it's great because it's almost like this is becoming mainstream, right? It's not some like little internet niche to disagree with these people. Like there are real people and all of these cities who are attracted to these, these ideas in this movement, and it's really encouraging.

Speaker 1:          01:01:11       All right, let's keep going then. Yeah. For more on. Lauren, follow her on Twitter at the Laura Chen.
