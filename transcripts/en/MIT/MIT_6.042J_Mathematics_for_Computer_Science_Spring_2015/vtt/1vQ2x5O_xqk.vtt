00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
PROFESSOR: Independent events
are events that have nothing

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.080
to do with each other.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.900
And needless to say, it's a
lot easier to work with them

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.400
because you don't
have to figure out

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.810
some weird interaction
between two events that

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.480
do have something to
do with each other.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.200
Typical case where
independent events come up

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.160
is, for example, you
toss a coin five times,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.520
and then you're about to
toss a coin the sixth time.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.070
Is there any reason
to think that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250
what the coins did the
first five times is going

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.000
to have any
influence on the flip

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.720
of the coin for the sixth time?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.100
Well, it's reasonable
to assume not,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.780
which is to say that the
outcome of the sixth toss

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.690
is arguably independent
of the outcome of all

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.450
the previous tosses.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.170
OK.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.570
Let's look at a
formal definition

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.660
now in this short
video of just what

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.520
is the technical definition
of independent events.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.741
So what we said is that they
are independent if they have

00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:55.990
nothing to do with each other.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.820
What that means is that if
I tell you that B happened,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.220
it doesn't have any effect on
the probability of A. That is,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.350
the probability of A,
given that B happened,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.130
doesn't change the
probability of A at all.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.196
That's it.

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:11.320
Now this is one definition.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.153
Maybe this is the more
intuitive definition.

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:16.440
But another definition that's
equivalent and is standard

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.260
is that two events are
equivalent if the product

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.252
of their probabilities is
equal to the probability

00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:24.210
that they both happen,
that is, the probability

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.760
of their intersection.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.890
Now definition one
and definition two

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.800
are trivial equivalent,
just using the definition

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.239
of conditional probability.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.280
And if you don't see that,
this would be a moment

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.100
to stop, get a pencil
and paper, and write down

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.440
the three-line proof of the
equivalence of these two

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.220
equalities.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.260
In fact, the three-line proof
has this as the first line

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.426
and that as the second line.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:49.800
So you could argue it's
really just the middle line

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.120
that you're adding.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.070
OK.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.560
Definition two has the slight
advantage that it always works,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.720
whereas definition
one implicitly

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.390
requires that the divisor--
remember probability of A given

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
B is defined as the probability
of the intersection divided

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.789
by the probability B. It's only
defined if the probability of B

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.820
is positive.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.930
Whereas the second
definition always works,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.450
so we don't have
to put a proviso

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.827
in about the probability
of B being non-zero.

00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:19.535
So that's the definition
of independence.

00:02:22.637 --> 00:02:24.970
Looking at this definition,
what you can see immediately

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.087
is that it's completely
symmetric in A and B.

00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:28.545
Since multiplication
is commutative

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:31.735
and intersection is
commutative, which is A

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.320
and which is B doesn't matter.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.820
And what that implies then
is that A is independent of B

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.370
if and only if B is
independent of A.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.660
Now another fact that holds is
that if the probability of B

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.010
happens to be zero,
then vacuously B

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.550
is independent of
everything-- even itself.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.880
Which isn't important, but is a
small technicality that's worth

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.450
remembering by that definition.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.470
Now again, the intuitive idea
that A and B have nothing

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.100
to do with each other is that
A is independent of B means

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.600
that A is independent of
whether or not B occurs.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.630
That is to say, if A
is independent of B,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.400
it ought to be independent
of the complement of B.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.600
And that's a lemma that's
also easily proved.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.940
A is independent
of B if and only

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.890
if A is independent of
the complement of B.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.050
It's a simple proof using
the difference rule.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.370
And again, I
encourage you to stop

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.090
with a piece of
paper and a pencil

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.235
and convince yourself that that
follows with a one-line proof.
