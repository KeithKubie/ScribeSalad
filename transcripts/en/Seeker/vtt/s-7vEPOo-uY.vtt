00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.109
Before you reach for the energy drink, you
may want to reconsider.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.030
They may kill you.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.179
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.980
Energy drinks have become common in the United
States in recent years offering a quick energy

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.160
boost to match a fast-paced life.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.740
And they work because they’re packed with
sugar, caffeine, and other stimulants, none

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.810
of which are great for you in large doses.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.850
The sugar in energy drinks hits your system
first, giving you a spike of energy then a

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.850
crash.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.120
The crash is offset by caffeine, which stimulates
the central nervous system with a bit of a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.140
time delay.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.850
Peak caffeination hits after about an hour,
and the increased energy can last all day

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.340
as it slowly wears off.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.969
It’s safe to ingest about 400 mg of caffeine
per day if you’re a healthy adult.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.280
For perspective, a 16 ounce grande brewed
coffee from Starbucks has 330mg of caffeine,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.309
a grande Americano with two shots of espresso
has 225mg, a 16 ounce can of Rockstar has

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.679
160mg, and one 8.4 ounce can of Redbull has
80mg.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.659
Consuming caffeine is known to cause heart
palpitations, anxiety and insomnia.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.750
It's a diuretic, causing the kidneys to process
extra fluid into urine leaving the body severely

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.750
dehydrated.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.850
It can also become addictive meaning the body
will need more to feel the stimulating effect,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.330
and the cycle continues.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.390
Where energy drinks are concerned, the effects
of caffeine are amplified by stimulants.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.530
Ephedrine is a nervous system stimulant often
found in these drinks.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.420
So is guarana, a South American shrub whose
seeds contain more caffeine than a coffee

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.420
bean.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.780
And so is taurine, an amino acid that acts
as a neurotransmitter.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.030
But in moderation it's fine, right?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.220
Well, maybe not.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.220
A study from the Mayo clinic says that even
one energy drink can cause momentary health

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.430
changes that could increase the risk of heart
conditions over time.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.170
The study had adults abstain from caffeine
and alcohol before consuming either an energy

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.740
drink or a placebo.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.740
Those who drank the real thing showed a marked
increase in caffeine levels, blood pressure,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.500
and norepinephrine levels, the sudden spike
of which could predispose those people to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.580
cardiovascular problems down the line.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.460
We’re already seeing this happening; ER
visits related to the high caffeine and taurine

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.450
levels in energy drinks have doubled in the
last decade, particularly in patients between

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.850
18 and 25.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.300
Another study found a correlation between
energy drinks and traumatic brain injuries

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.360
in young adults.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.359
The EU Scientific Committee on Food found
that increased caffeine intake brought behavioral

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:13.349
changes including increased arousal, irritability,
and nervousness.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.590
One woman in the UK actually started losing
her sight because of an energy drink habit!

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.680
The sugar in the drink caused her to gain
weight, and at 364 pounds she developed Idiopathic

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.409
intracranial hypertension.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.799
Her optic nerves swelled, leading to temporary
blindness.

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.260
And it gets worse if you mix energy drinks
with alcohol, a common practise with devastating

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:48.590
consequences that Tara talks about in this

00:02:48.590 --> 00:03:04.709
