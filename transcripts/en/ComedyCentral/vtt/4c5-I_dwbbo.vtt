Drop some of that baby fat.

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:58.247
- Yeah Marty, you got
like a whole baby worth of

00:00:58.247 --> 00:00:59.475
baby fat right now.

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:01.067
- Fuck you guys, what's this?

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:03.635
- Stop, stop, dude it's not funny, dude!

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:04.945
- That's super mean Marty.

00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:06.252
Just come running with us.

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:07.455
You're not fat, alright?

00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:08.288
- I'm busy!

00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:09.121
- With what?

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:10.737
- Yeah, what do you even do Marty?

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.984
Other than ball us and
look fuckin' treacherous.

00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:14.400
- I'm a graphic designer!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.201
(men laughing)

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.065
- I thought you said you
were a divorcee looking for

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:18.898
a good time.

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:19.951
- That's no a job.

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.034
- She's so mad right now.

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:25.179
- What are you doing?

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.417
We're like conversing with you Marty.

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:28.250
- Voicemail.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.523
- Dude, that's fucking rude
you chunky garbage skank.

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:32.619
- You're fat.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.791
- Marty look, I said stop, so.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.698
- Seriously Marty, you
should come with us.

00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:38.424
You're looking haggard as fuck.

00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:40.061
- Yeah, that's not what you
said last night when I was

00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:41.330
sucking you little dick.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.342
(Anderson laughs)

00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:44.617
- That's fucking cold Marty.

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:46.092
- One, that's a good burn.

00:01:46.092 --> 00:01:47.733
Two, she sucked your dick last night?

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.795
She sucked my dick last night.

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:51.176
- Uh, I tried to suck your
dick, you couldn't get it up.

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:55.136
- Alright, fuck you Marty, very funny.

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:57.824
Although it is sort of weird.

00:01:57.824 --> 00:01:59.765
I've been having sort of
a hard time with that.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.932
Like ever since my girlfriend
died, (laughs and cries).

00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:14.408
I'm sorry dude.

00:02:14.408 --> 00:02:16.018
- Wait, backtrack, when
did she not suck your dick

00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:17.146
last night?

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:18.443
- Like right after we
got off from Pandawan,

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:19.992
you were taking your post panda shit.

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:21.928
- Oh, the best.

00:02:21.928 --> 00:02:24.514
- Wait Marty, I can't
believe you attempted to suck

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:27.087
two dongers in a 15 minute time window.

00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:28.756
I'm almost like not
even mad at you anymore.

00:02:28.756 --> 00:02:29.775
- Yeah dude, that's impressive.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.358
- I'm on the phone!

00:02:32.373 --> 00:02:34.041
I can't believe I fuck these children.

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.092
- What children?

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:37.379
- That was my doctor, fuck!

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.920
It wasn't a razor bump.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.911
It was herpes.

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.217
Sorry.

00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:43.404
- It's all good, I've already got it.

00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:45.550
- I also have it too.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.050
(theme music)

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:50.701
What's up?

00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:51.534
- What's up!

00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:55.024
Dude I fucking spent that
whole episode just like

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:56.834
dreaming of Marty's gazongas.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:58.388
(Zac laughs)
Like floating about me,

00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:02.027
like some sort of celestial
fucking ballet dude (laughs).

00:03:02.027 --> 00:03:04.376
- Dude for me, it's like I
can't stop thinking about

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:06.404
my fuckin' panda dump.

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:08.263
- Oh yeah dude, that's so nice.

00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:09.096
Oh, dude!

00:03:09.096 --> 00:03:11.072
Okay, so like, what's
your fuckin' favorite food

00:03:11.072 --> 00:03:14.785

passing of stool (chuckles)?

00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:16.138
- Shit dude, that's a good question.
