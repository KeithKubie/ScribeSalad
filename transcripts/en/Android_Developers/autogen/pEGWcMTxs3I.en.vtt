they're trying to do a bunch of things
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.990
they're trying to do a bunch of things
at once the other thing I'll quickly

point out is one of my pet peeves is

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
point out is one of my pet peeves is
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280
point out is one of my pet peeves is
when you throw up a loading dialogue

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290
when you throw up a loading dialogue
 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.220
when you throw up a loading dialogue
when switching tabs because basically

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230
when switching tabs because basically
 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.720
when switching tabs because basically
you switch to a tab maybe you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
you switch to a tab maybe you
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.150
you switch to a tab maybe you
accidentally chose that tab and now you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160
accidentally chose that tab and now you
 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.190
accidentally chose that tab and now you
have to wait for that tab to load to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200
have to wait for that tab to load to
 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.800
have to wait for that tab to load to
switch to something else so the solution

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810
switch to something else so the solution
 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.170
switch to something else so the solution
to this is really to try to use inline

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180
to this is really to try to use inline
 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.810
to this is really to try to use inline
loading spinners instead like in this in

better yet I just try to load data in
 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.290
better yet I just try to load data in
the background where possible so that

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300
the background where possible so that
 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.360

items and I go to the details and then
 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.720
items and I go to the details and then
it throws up that loading spinner then I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730
it throws up that loading spinner then I
 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.030
it throws up that loading spinner then I
hit back and I kind of go back to the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040
hit back and I kind of go back to the
 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.500
hit back and I kind of go back to the

that's blocking and I think that says

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070
that's blocking and I think that says
 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.220
that's blocking and I think that says
you have to deal with this first and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
you have to deal with this first and
 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.860
you have to deal with this first and
this is completely avoidable like

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
this is completely avoidable like
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.030
this is completely avoidable like

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040
unavoidable then try and avoid dialogs
 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.830
unavoidable then try and avoid dialogs
but especially learning dialogs get my

this up many times in a dia and this is

this up many times in a dia and this is
 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.750
this up many times in a dia and this is
definitely a recurring theme we see when

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760
definitely a recurring theme we see when
 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.460
definitely a recurring theme we see when
we're looking at apps so the first one

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470
we're looking at apps so the first one
 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.460
we're looking at apps so the first one
is small touch targets so really all

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470
is small touch targets so really all
 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.730
is small touch targets so really all
touch targets should be four

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740
touch targets should be four
 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.820
touch targets should be four
dibbs we did right here that could go

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830
dibbs we did right here that could go
 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.589
dibbs we did right here that could go
down to 30 dips if you absolutely need

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599
down to 30 dips if you absolutely need
 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.300
down to 30 dips if you absolutely need
to but really 48 dips is what you should

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310
to but really 48 dips is what you should
 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.059
to but really 48 dips is what you should
be aiming for why because that sort of

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069
be aiming for why because that sort of
 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.879
be aiming for why because that sort of
maps to roughly 9 millimeters or I think

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889
maps to roughly 9 millimeters or I think
 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.559
maps to roughly 9 millimeters or I think
somewhere between 7 &amp; 9 with a little

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569
somewhere between 7 &amp; 9 with a little
 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.140
somewhere between 7 &amp; 9 with a little
bit of variability which which really

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150
bit of variability which which really
 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.480
bit of variability which which really
you know ends up being the perfect touch

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490
you know ends up being the perfect touch
 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.490

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069
should really be shooting for 48 dips

here and then the second one and this is

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409

something we see frequently all the time

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750
something we see frequently all the time
 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.649
something we see frequently all the time
is no touch feedback and if you put an

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659
is no touch feedback and if you put an
 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.180
is no touch feedback and if you put an
app in front of any of us you'll

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190
app in front of any of us you'll
 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.290
app in front of any of us you'll
probably see one of the first things we

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300
probably see one of the first things we
 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.999
probably see one of the first things we
do is we actually go and touch something

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009
do is we actually go and touch something
 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.230
do is we actually go and touch something
and then we slide our finger off a

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240
and then we slide our finger off a
 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.879
and then we slide our finger off a
little bit just to see if there's any

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889
little bit just to see if there's any
 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.610
little bit just to see if there's any
touch feedback there so it's it's a

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620
touch feedback there so it's it's a
 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.140
touch feedback there so it's it's a
pretty common mistake to make especially

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150
pretty common mistake to make especially
 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.430
pretty common mistake to make especially
when you're not using the standard

when you're not using the standard
button components because you may have

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810
button components because you may have
 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.360
button components because you may have
to do a little bit of extra work to sort

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370
to do a little bit of extra work to sort
 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.730
to do a little bit of extra work to sort
of add that touch feedback but it really

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740
of add that touch feedback but it really
 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.649
of add that touch feedback but it really
means that your app feels much more

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659
means that your app feels much more
 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.050
means that your app feels much more
responsive and it's I think it's also

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060
responsive and it's I think it's also
 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.640
responsive and it's I think it's also
the no touch feedback as well as the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650
the no touch feedback as well as the
 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.610
the no touch feedback as well as the
previous anti-pattern it it really

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
previous anti-pattern it it really
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.129
previous anti-pattern it it really
changes the your apps feeling of

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139
changes the your apps feeling of
 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.260
changes the your apps feeling of
perceived latency when things don't

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270
perceived latency when things don't
 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.089
perceived latency when things don't
respond or you can't do certain things

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099
respond or you can't do certain things
 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.249
respond or you can't do certain things
there's an increased sense of perceived

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259
there's an increased sense of perceived
 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.170
there's an increased sense of perceived
latency or where users perceive that

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180
latency or where users perceive that
 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.870
latency or where users perceive that
your app is slower than it actually is

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880
your app is slower than it actually is
 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.159
your app is slower than it actually is
so it's one of the fastest you know

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
so it's one of the fastest you know
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.420
so it's one of the fastest you know
people talk about speed all the time

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430
people talk about speed all the time
 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.920
people talk about speed all the time
let's make her out faster faster faster

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930
let's make her out faster faster faster
 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.899
let's make her out faster faster faster
it's not just about raw speed it's

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909
it's not just about raw speed it's
 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:51.879
it's not just about raw speed it's
really about perceived speed yeah the

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889
really about perceived speed yeah the
 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.589
really about perceived speed yeah the
funny thing I think oh go ahead big

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599
funny thing I think oh go ahead big
 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.930
funny thing I think oh go ahead big
sorry I was going to say I think it's a

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940
sorry I was going to say I think it's a
 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.399
sorry I was going to say I think it's a
really important win so we move towards

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409
really important win so we move towards
 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.080
really important win so we move towards
like digital interfaces where we you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090
like digital interfaces where we you
 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.270
like digital interfaces where we you
know the holo style is all about

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280
know the holo style is all about
 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.589
know the holo style is all about
whitespace and typography and so on and

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599
whitespace and typography and so on and
 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:03.999
whitespace and typography and so on and
it's really important to communicate

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009
it's really important to communicate
 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.640
it's really important to communicate
what is capable you know what is you

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650
what is capable you know what is you
 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.809
what is capable you know what is you
know you can interact with and I think

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:07.819
know you can interact with and I think
 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.610
know you can interact with and I think
touch feedbacks going to instantly react

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620
touch feedbacks going to instantly react
 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.439
touch feedbacks going to instantly react
Steve and lights up the entire area

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449
Steve and lights up the entire area
 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.149
Steve and lights up the entire area
which you can interact with will kind of

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159
which you can interact with will kind of
 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:14.469
which you can interact with will kind of
communicate back to you and so you'll

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479
communicate back to you and so you'll
 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.120
communicate back to you and so you'll
know next time I this is you know the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130
know next time I this is you know the
 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.070
know next time I this is you know the
area have to play with it's really

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080
area have to play with it's really
 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.550
area have to play with it's really
important exactly cool all right so we

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560
important exactly cool all right so we
 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.149
important exactly cool all right so we
move on yeah so number eight visual

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159
move on yeah so number eight visual
 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.189

design I think this was I think this is

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199
design I think this was I think this is
 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.399
design I think this was I think this is
a the one I'll talk about so in general

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409
a the one I'll talk about so in general
 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:32.890
a the one I'll talk about so in general
design does not mean playing with

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900
design does not mean playing with
 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.190

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.020
Photoshop until
you know you use all of the effects like

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030
you know you use all of the effects like
 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.110
you know you use all of the effects like
until you you know use all the the layer

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120
until you you know use all the the layer
 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.580

couple of concepts here going on

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860
couple of concepts here going on
 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.260
couple of concepts here going on
basically you know when thinking about

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270
basically you know when thinking about
 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.630
basically you know when thinking about
visual design for your app focus really

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640
visual design for your app focus really
 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.630
visual design for your app focus really

developers don't use the right spacing
 

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.540
developers don't use the right spacing
so you know there's too little space or

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:23.550
so you know there's too little space or
 

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.060
so you know there's too little space or
there's too much space you know around

app so definitely you know focus on
these things and I think certainly we've

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520
these things and I think certainly we've
 

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.860
these things and I think certainly we've
covered most of these in Android design

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:39.870
covered most of these in Android design
 

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.560

in action in episodes past but
 

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.820
in action in episodes past but
definitely this is this is one of the

definitely this is this is one of the
 

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.090
definitely this is this is one of the
things you should focus on

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.100
things you should focus on

we've got on on the slide right here
generally point towards the fact that

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:20.370
generally point towards the fact that
 

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.800
generally point towards the fact that
you're not kind of updating your

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:21.810
you're not kind of updating your
 

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.869
you're not kind of updating your
application to move with the latest I

00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:23.879
application to move with the latest I
 

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:25.129
application to move with the latest I
mean it's one thing to look at the

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:25.139
mean it's one thing to look at the
 

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:26.509
mean it's one thing to look at the
platform from distribution stats and say

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519
platform from distribution stats and say
 

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.160

hey this you know some my users are on

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.170
hey this you know some my users are on
 

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.100
hey this you know some my users are on
all the devices but that's kind of not

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.110
all the devices but that's kind of not
 

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.230
all the devices but that's kind of not
really being fair to the users who are

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240
really being fair to the users who are
 

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.179
really being fair to the users who are
on newer devices or have these kind of

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:35.189
on newer devices or have these kind of
 

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:36.980
on newer devices or have these kind of
shiny new devices probably people who

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:36.990
shiny new devices probably people who
 

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.240
shiny new devices probably people who
are downloading installed on your

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.250
are downloading installed on your
 

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.559
are downloading installed on your
application more often so we really

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:42.569
application more often so we really
 

00:09:42.569 --> 00:09:44.269
application more often so we really
think you need to be kind of looking at

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279
think you need to be kind of looking at
 

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:46.400
think you need to be kind of looking at
you know maybe not the blazing latest

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.410
you know maybe not the blazing latest
 

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.990
you know maybe not the blazing latest
release but here we said you should be

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000
release but here we said you should be
 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.629
release but here we said you should be
targeting at least API 16 which is and

out at what Google i/o last year to over
a year old if you're not kind of

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040
a year old if you're not kind of
 

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.460
a year old if you're not kind of

targeting that newer version you're
 

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.929

probably like missing out some new

00:09:59.929 --> 00:09:59.939
probably like missing out some new
 

00:09:59.939 --> 00:10:02.600

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.860
functionality as well as probably
degrading some of the functionality

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:03.870
degrading some of the functionality
 

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.470
degrading some of the functionality
because some of the shims that this

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480
because some of the shims that this
 

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.389
because some of the shims that this

what I often see this is where spinners

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740
what I often see this is where spinners
 

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.870
what I often see this is where spinners
as well so you'll be using an

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880
as well so you'll be using an
 

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.670
as well so you'll be using an
application and they've set a style on

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680
application and they've set a style on
 

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.040

the on a progress but an indeterminate
 

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.900
the on a progress but an indeterminate
progress spinner often set the style to

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:14.910
progress spinner often set the style to
 

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.550
progress spinner often set the style to
indeterminate and they haven't used the

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560
indeterminate and they haven't used the
 

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.460

appropriate kind of theme default syntax

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:19.470
appropriate kind of theme default syntax
 

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.980
appropriate kind of theme default syntax
for it so you get kind of a gingerbread

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:21.990
for it so you get kind of a gingerbread
 

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.510
for it so you get kind of a gingerbread
style spinner it just looks completely

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.520
style spinner it just looks completely
 

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.460
style spinner it just looks completely
gross and out of place right the others

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:25.470
gross and out of place right the others
 

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.290
gross and out of place right the others
it the problem with the loading spinner

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300
it the problem with the loading spinner
 

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.180
it the problem with the loading spinner
is that the gingerbread arrow unused

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.190
is that the gingerbread arrow unused
 

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.950
is that the gingerbread arrow unused
frame animation so there are basically

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:30.960
frame animation so there are basically
 

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.370
frame animation so there are basically
eight frames ecliptic and so on and the

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380
eight frames ecliptic and so on and the
 

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.530
eight frames ecliptic and so on and the
hollow spinner is actually using a tween

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540
hollow spinner is actually using a tween
 

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.540
hollow spinner is actually using a tween
animation so it's a much smoother

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:38.550
animation so it's a much smoother
 

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.520
animation so it's a much smoother
rotation you actually see each

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:40.530
rotation you actually see each
 

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.680
rotation you actually see each
individual frame as it gets rendered or

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:42.690
individual frame as it gets rendered or
 

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.660
individual frame as it gets rendered or
not each individual frame but each point

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:44.670
not each individual frame but each point
 

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.120
not each individual frame but each point
in around the circle so it's much much

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.130
in around the circle so it's much much
 

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.530
in around the circle so it's much much
better to use the holo style

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540
better to use the holo style
 

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.590
better to use the holo style
indeterminate loading spinners yeah so I

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600
indeterminate loading spinners yeah so I
 

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.330
indeterminate loading spinners yeah so I
think I guess the takeaway from from

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:53.340
think I guess the takeaway from from
 

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.620
think I guess the takeaway from from
this what we're trying to say here is

this what we're trying to say here is
 

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.170
this what we're trying to say here is
use the latest and greatest and kind of

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180
use the latest and greatest and kind of
 

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.950
use the latest and greatest and kind of
like builds on top of it x1 moving on

the design guy called pure Android and
it is what it sounds like it's talking

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260
it is what it sounds like it's talking
 

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.170
it is what it sounds like it's talking
about don't borrow metaphors from other

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180

don't use kind of iconography or other

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:18.750
don't use kind of iconography or other
 

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.110
don't use kind of iconography or other
such from other platforms if you're if

you're building an Android experience

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140
you're building an Android experience
 

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.320
you're building an Android experience
for your Android users then build an

for your Android users then build an
 

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.170
for your Android users then build an
Android experience I think we did a

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180
Android experience I think we did a
 

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.670
Android experience I think we did a
whole show about branding and

you want other platforms for example so

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180
you want other platforms for example so

I guess this is no spatial metaphor

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:20.890
I guess this is no spatial metaphor
 

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.280
I guess this is no spatial metaphor
there especially with androids use of

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.290
there especially with androids use of
 

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.570
there especially with androids use of
the horizontal metaphor for moving

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:24.580
the horizontal metaphor for moving
 

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.730
the horizontal metaphor for moving
between content so like tabs for example

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:26.740
between content so like tabs for example
 

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.140
between content so like tabs for example
you might page between them like this

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.150
you might page between them like this
 

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.580
you might page between them like this
but then you know if there's a why arrow

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:29.590
but then you know if there's a why arrow
 

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.080
but then you know if there's a why arrow
does that mean I'm going down or I'm

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.090
does that mean I'm going down or I'm
 

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.520
does that mean I'm going down or I'm
going side to the other tab it just

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:32.530
going side to the other tab it just
 

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.610
going side to the other tab it just
doesn't work so respect that tabs

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:35.620
doesn't work so respect that tabs
 

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.160
doesn't work so respect that tabs
you know there's android on android tabs

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.170
you know there's android on android tabs
 

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.230
you know there's android on android tabs
go at the top so if you're doing tabs at

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240
go at the top so if you're doing tabs at
 

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.550
go at the top so if you're doing tabs at
the bottom basically you're going to

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560
the bottom basically you're going to
 

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.930
the bottom basically you're going to
look out of place and it's going to be

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:42.940
look out of place and it's going to be
 

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.040
look out of place and it's going to be
what why is this app doing this

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.050
what why is this app doing this
 

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.890
what why is this app doing this
differently and the last one we pulled

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:46.900
differently and the last one we pulled
 

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.450
differently and the last one we pulled
out is just like wholesale borrowing

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:48.460
out is just like wholesale borrowing
 

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.430
out is just like wholesale borrowing
from other platforms this is if you see

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440
from other platforms this is if you see
 

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.070
from other platforms this is if you see
say iconography from another platform or

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:53.080
say iconography from another platform or
 

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.450
say iconography from another platform or
you know a picker from another platform

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:54.460
you know a picker from another platform
 

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.100
you know a picker from another platform
which just looks completely out of place

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.110
which just looks completely out of place
 

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.800
which just looks completely out of place
just don't do it just use the defaults

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:58.810
just don't do it just use the defaults
 

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.510
just don't do it just use the defaults
it's what your users expect and doing

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:03.580
Paragon and aggressive towards them so
 

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.280
Paragon and aggressive towards them so
stick with what the platform gives you

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.290
stick with what the platform gives you
 

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.430
stick with what the platform gives you
yeah can that covers it well yeah let's

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440
yeah can that covers it well yeah let's
 

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.540
yeah can that covers it well yeah let's
move on all right I think was this me

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:12.550
move on all right I think was this me
 

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.610
move on all right I think was this me
this made me think this was me so uh

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:14.620
this made me think this was me so uh
 

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.830
this made me think this was me so uh
another and actually this is this plays

metaphors do you use which UI patterns

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:23.230
metaphors do you use which UI patterns
 

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.370
metaphors do you use which UI patterns
do you use this is the antipattern of

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:26.380
do you use this is the antipattern of
 

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.940
do you use this is the antipattern of
the navigation is my brand or you know

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:28.950
the navigation is my brand or you know
 

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.740
the navigation is my brand or you know
everything the entire app should be mine

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:31.750
everything the entire app should be mine
 

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.270
everything the entire app should be mine
right I should control everything and

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:33.280
right I should control everything and
 

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.500
right I should control everything and
generally that's the case you know you

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:34.510
generally that's the case you know you
 

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.180
generally that's the case you know you
should control you know visual styling

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.190
should control you know visual styling
 

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.860
should control you know visual styling
you should control you know the

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:37.870
you should control you know the
 

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.270
you should control you know the
information architecture and we did a

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:39.280
information architecture and we did a
 

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.090
information architecture and we did a
whole you know segment on this but there

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:42.100
whole you know segment on this but there
 

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.350
whole you know segment on this but there
are a few things that you should really

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360
are a few things that you should really
 

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.590
are a few things that you should really
try to to use from the Android design

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600
try to to use from the Android design
 

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.900
try to to use from the Android design
guidelines obviously I mean pure Android

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:48.910
guidelines obviously I mean pure Android
 

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.640
guidelines obviously I mean pure Android
that's very important but also anything

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:50.650
that's very important but also anything
 

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.310
that's very important but also anything
related to core app navigation so things

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320
related to core app navigation so things
 

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.490
related to core app navigation so things
like the action bar things like tabs and

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:56.500
like the action bar things like tabs and
 

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.930
like the action bar things like tabs and
also things like the navigation drawer

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:57.940
also things like the navigation drawer
 

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.810
also things like the navigation drawer
so this anti-pattern is it's basically

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:00.820
so this anti-pattern is it's basically
 

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.150
so this anti-pattern is it's basically
like you know apps that reinvent the

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160
like you know apps that reinvent the
 

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.790
like you know apps that reinvent the
wheel by creating a custom top bar with

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800
wheel by creating a custom top bar with
 

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.310
wheel by creating a custom top bar with
like a centered title and then like two

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320
like a centered title and then like two
 

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.690

actions one on the left one on the right
 

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.430
actions one on the left one on the right
or maybe kind of a very different

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440
or maybe kind of a very different
 

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.790
or maybe kind of a very different
looking navigation drawer indicator this

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800
looking navigation drawer indicator this
 

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.290
looking navigation drawer indicator this
this basically isn't an

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:16.300
this basically isn't an
 

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.320
this basically isn't an
I mean Android users expect an action

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.330
I mean Android users expect an action
 

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.940
I mean Android users expect an action
bar at the top the the title should be

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:20.950
bar at the top the the title should be
 

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.350
bar at the top the the title should be
left aligned there are certain things

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360
left aligned there are certain things
 

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.960
left aligned there are certain things
that should should exist in the action

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:24.970
that should should exist in the action
 

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.780
that should should exist in the action
bar navigation in the top left actions

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:27.790
bar navigation in the top left actions
 

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.780

implemented action bars and generally

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:32.620
implemented action bars and generally
 

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.900
implemented action bars and generally
this is because of the lack of I guess

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:36.910
this is because of the lack of I guess
 

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.640
this is because of the lack of I guess
the lack of a toolkit that allows you to

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:38.650
the lack of a toolkit that allows you to
 

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.080
the lack of a toolkit that allows you to
bring the action bar earlier versions of

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.090
bring the action bar earlier versions of
 

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.750
bring the action bar earlier versions of
the platform but you know

actionbarsherlock has existed for quite
 

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.740
actionbarsherlock has existed for quite
a while and that's the great great

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:46.750
a while and that's the great great
 

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.380
a while and that's the great great
choice but also actionbarcompat was

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:49.390
choice but also actionbarcompat was
 

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.810
choice but also actionbarcompat was
recently released so for designers and

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:51.820
recently released so for designers and
 

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.610

your own action bar just stop stop doing
 

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.190
your own action bar just stop stop doing
it and just use actionbarcompat but also

it and just use actionbarcompat but also

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:18.970
probably shouldn't go into navigation

full episode on this I won't go into the

full episode on this I won't go into the
details but if you're a developer you

details but if you're a developer you
 

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.680
details but if you're a developer you
should definitely be using drawer layout

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:25.690
should definitely be using drawer layout

I'm sorry one last thing I'm from a
 

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.910
I'm sorry one last thing I'm from a
development standpoint it's actually

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:03.920
development standpoint it's actually
 

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.650
development standpoint it's actually
much easier to use the system show

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:05.660
much easier to use the system show
 

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.750

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.680
yourself so I mean from a development
standpoint it's also a positive thing

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:11.690

it really works great so let's move to

it really works great so let's move to

it really works great so let's move to
some of the talking points so first

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:57.950
some of the talking points so first
 

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.890
some of the talking points so first
point it's not genuine it's kind of like

00:20:59.890 --> 00:20:59.900
point it's not genuine it's kind of like
 

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.850

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:05.180
really the the most positive experience
 

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.030
really the the most positive experience
especially if you're sort of taking up a

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.040
especially if you're sort of taking up a
 

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.690
especially if you're sort of taking up a
lot of the core UI with a webview and

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:10.700
lot of the core UI with a webview and
 

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.160
lot of the core UI with a webview and
falling from that you know the

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.170
falling from that you know the
 

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.600
falling from that you know the
performance is generally going to be

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:13.610
performance is generally going to be
 

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.700
performance is generally going to be
degraded you know if you have a drawer

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:15.710
degraded you know if you have a drawer
 

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.650
degraded you know if you have a drawer
that's built using a webview you're

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:17.660
that's built using a webview you're
 

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.030
that's built using a webview you're
going to notice that it's not as smooth

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.040
going to notice that it's not as smooth
 

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.740
going to notice that it's not as smooth
it's not as responsive it just doesn't

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:20.750
it's not as responsive it just doesn't
 

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.740
it's not as responsive it just doesn't
behave like the user would expect and

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:23.750
behave like the user would expect and
 

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.030
behave like the user would expect and
then from the example on the previous

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.040
then from the example on the previous
 

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.060
then from the example on the previous

web apps web apps work great on Android
but whether user expects them is in the

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:39.920
but whether user expects them is in the
 

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.320
but whether user expects them is in the
browser in the Chrome browser or the

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:41.330
browser in the Chrome browser or the
 

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.270
browser in the Chrome browser or the
system browser where they sort of

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280
system browser where they sort of
 

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.520
system browser where they sort of
understand that the UI conventions and

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:45.530
understand that the UI conventions and
 

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.640
understand that the UI conventions and
they're viewing a web page I mean also

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:48.650
they're viewing a web page I mean also
 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.350
they're viewing a web page I mean also
use web views at all right I mean a

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360
use web views at all right I mean a
 

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.790
use web views at all right I mean a
certain component where it makes sense

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:51.800
certain component where it makes sense
 

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.310
certain component where it makes sense
like Gmail for example renders HTML

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320
like Gmail for example renders HTML
 

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.600
like Gmail for example renders HTML
correct

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:55.610
correct
 

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.520
correct
you know email it makes perfect sense to

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:57.530
you know email it makes perfect sense to
 

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.590
you know email it makes perfect sense to
use a web view control there or if

00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600
use a web view control there or if
 

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.120
use a web view control there or if
you're rendering some like news content

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.130
you're rendering some like news content
 

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.890
you're rendering some like news content
and perhaps that make sense the other

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:02.900
and perhaps that make sense the other
 

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.690
and perhaps that make sense the other
thing don't build your whole application

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:04.700
thing don't build your whole application
 

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.820
thing don't build your whole application
of this exactly yeah so another good

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:06.830
of this exactly yeah so another good
 

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.580
of this exactly yeah so another good
example is pocket which uses a webview

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:09.590
example is pocket which uses a webview
 

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.160
example is pocket which uses a webview
or HTML to render the article views and

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.170
or HTML to render the article views and
 

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.780
or HTML to render the article views and
it actually works really well in those

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:13.790
it actually works really well in those
 

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.970
it actually works really well in those
particular cases we're really saying

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:15.980
particular cases we're really saying
 

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.799
particular cases we're really saying
don't just like throw a webview into the

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:17.809
don't just like throw a webview into the
 

00:22:17.809 --> 00:22:19.450
don't just like throw a webview into the
entire application and make it take over

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:19.460
entire application and make it take over
 

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.750
entire application and make it take over
the sort of standard core UI elements

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760
the sort of standard core UI elements
 

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.890
the sort of standard core UI elements
yeah one last point I wanted to make

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:23.900
yeah one last point I wanted to make
 

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.840
yeah one last point I wanted to make
about you know web apps and versus

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:25.850
about you know web apps and versus
 

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.370
about you know web apps and versus
native apps is you know there's a

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:27.380
native apps is you know there's a
 

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.320
native apps is you know there's a
tendency for brands to be like oh we

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:29.330
tendency for brands to be like oh we
 

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.000
tendency for brands to be like oh we
need to be on Android right and you

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.010
need to be on Android right and you
 

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.500
need to be on Android right and you
mentioned this right but we need to be

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:32.510
mentioned this right but we need to be
 

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.940
mentioned this right but we need to be
on Android so we need to make a native

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:33.950
on Android so we need to make a native
 

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.370
on Android so we need to make a native
app but you know a ton of Android usage

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:36.380
app but you know a ton of Android usage
 

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.159
app but you know a ton of Android usage
that's regular users most of them use

00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:39.169
that's regular users most of them use
 

00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:41.380
that's regular users most of them use
the browser quite a bit so that you're

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:41.390
the browser quite a bit so that you're
 

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.360
the browser quite a bit so that you're
not losing those users you're just gonna

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:43.370
not losing those users you're just gonna
 

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.490
not losing those users you're just gonna
they're going to you know access your

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:45.500
they're going to you know access your
 

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.600
they're going to you know access your
experience through a different mechanism

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:46.610
experience through a different mechanism
 

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.570
experience through a different mechanism
and if you're if you think that you know

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:49.580
and if you're if you think that you know
 

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.640
and if you're if you think that you know
a web-based solution is the best option

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:51.650
a web-based solution is the best option
 

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.340
a web-based solution is the best option
then that's going to work for a lot of

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:54.350
then that's going to work for a lot of
 

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.230
then that's going to work for a lot of
users so don't don't immediately jump

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240
users so don't don't immediately jump
 

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.419
users so don't don't immediately jump
into oh we to just you know have this

00:22:58.419 --> 00:22:58.429
into oh we to just you know have this
 

00:22:58.429 --> 00:23:00.549
into oh we to just you know have this
kind of hybrid thing where we just throw

00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559
kind of hybrid thing where we just throw
 

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:02.799
kind of hybrid thing where we just throw
our entire web app into into a native

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:02.809
our entire web app into into a native
 

00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:05.020
our entire web app into into a native
apk so that just doesn't work yeah and I

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.030
apk so that just doesn't work yeah and I
 

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.460
apk so that just doesn't work yeah and I
think you'll find if you if you do go in

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:06.470
think you'll find if you if you do go in
 

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.750
think you'll find if you if you do go in
through a webview and make it take over

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760

then I think you have bigger problems
there really are much better ways to

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:51.620
there really are much better ways to
 

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.320
there really are much better ways to
kind of provide branding to your

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:53.330
kind of provide branding to your
 

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.610
kind of provide branding to your
application like using the action bar

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:54.620
application like using the action bar
 

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.790
application like using the action bar
and your palate and so forth so I don't

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:57.800
and your palate and so forth so I don't
 

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.450
and your palate and so forth so I don't
accept that as an argument at all and

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:00.460
accept that as an argument at all and
 

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.620
accept that as an argument at all and
then conversely there's lots of things

you can use to actually ease the
 

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.920
you can use to actually ease the
onboarding process so for example and

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:07.930
onboarding process so for example and
