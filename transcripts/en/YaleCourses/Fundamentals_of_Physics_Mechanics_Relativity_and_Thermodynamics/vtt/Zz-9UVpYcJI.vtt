1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.470
Stable equilibrium.
Then if you disturb them,

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.780
bed rock back and forth and there's two simple examples.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.880
The Standard Textbook example is this mass in spring.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.430
This spring has a certain natural linked which I'm showing you here.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.680
It likes to sit there but if you pull it for the mass comes here,

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.600
you move it from x equals zero to the new location x.

7
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.590
Then that is a distorting force F which is minus Kx

8
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.470
and that force would it be equal to mass times acceleration by Newton's law

9
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.730
and so you have tried to solve the equation.

10
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.150
The two x over d d squared equals minus

11
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.760
K O and m

12
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.770
time sex and we used the symbol or may go square equalsK or whatever.

13
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.480
I'd Omega is quite okay with it and what's the solution?
This equation,

14
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.640
I think we did a lot of talking and said,
look,

15
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.080
we are looking for a function which when differentiated twice looks like the

16
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:20.370
same function up to some constants and we know their trigonometry functions.

17
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.770
Then we finally found the answer for most general answer looks like a co sine

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.150
Omega t minus five is the amplitude phase called the phase that tells you what

19
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:35.460
your clock is doing when x is a maximum.

20
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.530
And we can always choose fight to be zero.
That means we,
the time is zero X.

21
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:42.030
We'll have a biggest value a,

22
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.550
this is an example of simple harmonic motion,
but it is very generic situation.

23
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.630
So I gave you a second example.
Not we don't have a mass.
Uh,

24
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:54.010
we have a bar,

25
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:58.360
let's say suspended by a cable hanging from the ceiling

26
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.210
and it's happy the way it is.

27
00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:05.740
But if you come and twisted by an angle Taito give it a little twist,

28
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.690
then it'll try to untwist itself.
So no,
we don't have a distorting force,

29
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:12.130
but we have a restoring torque.

30
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.210
<v 1>Okay?</v>

31
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.530
<v 0>What can be the expression for the restoring torque?
When you don't do anything,</v>

32
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.670
it doesn't do anything.

33
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.860
So it's a function of data that vanishes when data is zero.
If data is not zero,

34
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.270
it'll begin as some function of paper with the leading trend would be this data.

35
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.830
But now you can put a constant here.
It'll still be proportional.

36
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.450
The data and you put a minus sign for the same reducing and put a minus sign

37
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.670
here to tell you is the restoring torque.

38
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.300
That means if you make the deposit to the torque will try to twist you the other

39
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:48.740
way to make that a negative and try to bring you back so you have to find this

40
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.960
kappa.
If you find this cap on,

41
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.990
then you can say minus cap four times data is I times Steve to take over DT

42
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.200
square mathematically equation is identical to that and data.

43
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.480
Then we'll look like some constant,

44
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.720
you can call it a core sine omega t minus fi and omega.

45
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.010
No would be the ratio of this cap on the moment of inertia because

46
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.190
mathematically that's the role played by cap and I [inaudible].

47
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.150
<v 0>No,
because someone tells you this is kappa,
then you're done.</v>

49
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.960
You just stick it in and mindlessly calculate all the formulas.

50
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.100
You can find data,
you can take directives and so on.

51
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.950
Sometimes they may not tell you what kappa is.

52
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.380
In the case of a spring,
they would have to give you a K odd.

53
00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:42.320
They may tell you in directly,
if I pull the spring by nine inches,

54
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.900
I exerted a certain force.

55
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.370
They'd given you f and that giving you x and you can find k but in rotation

56
00:03:49.371 --> 00:03:51.500
problems,
the typical situation is the following.

57
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.560
Let us take
the easiest problem of a pendulum.

58
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.480
The pendulum is hanging,
say a mass list ride with some mass and my the bottom

59
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.650
so it's very happy to stay this way.
If you leave it like this,

60
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:09.380
if you stay this way forever,
no tarp,
no motion.

61
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.720
Now you come along and you disturb that by turning it by an angle data.

62
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.850
If you do,
then the force is like this.

63
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.060
The separation vector are from the pivot point.

64
00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:28.061
Is this an autocross f we'd be non zero because the angle between them is not

65
00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:34.391
zero and did remember the Torque is equal to r f sine theta and I totally for

66
00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:40.730
small angles,
this can be sub r,
f theta

67
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.980
and art.
It happens to be in this problem,
the length of the pendulum,

68
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.000
so it's really minus m g l data,

69
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.330
so you have to do some work to find data.

70
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.430
It wasn't just given to you in a plate.

71
00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.010
You did this piece of thinking and you namely,

72
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:04.550
you disrupt the system from equilibrium and found the restoring torque.

73
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.440
Then you stare at the formula and say,
Hey,

74
00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:10.620
this guy must be the cap I'm looking for because that number times data is the

75
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:11.454
restoring torque.

76
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.630
Then the Omega here will be this cap.
I said January kappa,

77
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.540
that goes into whatever it is for that problem.
For our problem.

78
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.580
CAPRA happens to be MGL.
That's something you should understand.

79
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.050
It's not a universal number.
That's a known to everybody.

80
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:35.370
Like the spring constant of anything.
In the case of mass and this your lump,

81
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.100
it depends on how long the pendulum is,
how big the masses,

82
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.140
but you can work it out and extract kappa.

83
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.810
Don't stay as you need a moment to finish.
Yeah.

84
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.460
What a point mass m octa distance l from the point of rotation,

85
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.830
it just ml square.
So you can cancel the l,

86
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.470
you can cancel the m and you get Omegas root of g over F

87
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.060
and I didn't mind you guys.

88
00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:05.061
That Omega is connected to what you and I would call the frequency by there's

89
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:10.010
two pie f are what you and I would call the time period,

90
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.690
like two Pi over t.

91
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

92
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.100
<v 0>Okay,
so this is the situation.</v>

93
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:23.060
Let me give one other example than,
I don't know this at a homework problem,

94
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:24.740
but I wanted to give you a hint on how to do this.

95
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.890
Don't take a pendulum with all the mass concentrated there.

96
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.360
Fix some irregularly shaped object flat or object.

97
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.100
You drive a nail through it,
they're hanging on the wall.

98
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.580
It'll come to rest in a certain configuration and you can use your think about

99
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.100
where will the center of Mass B,
if I hang it like this on the wall,

100
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.480
Tetra Mass,
somewhere in the body here.
So I want you to think about it.

101
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.590
I'll tell you in a second.

102
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.470
The center of mass I claim will lie somewhere on this vertical line.

103
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.880
Going through that point,

104
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.620
I know that by default because the center of mass,
but here for example,

105
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.550
we know all the force of gravity can be imagined to be acting here.

106
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.430
Then if you do that separation and do the Torque,

107
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.670
then you will find this is able to exert a target on this point,

108
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.500
but that cannot be an equilibrium,

109
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.540
so the center of mass will always lie.
We'll align yourself.

110
00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:28.410
The body will swing a little bit and settle down the center of mass somewhere

111
00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:32.370
there.
If you're not,
disrupt the body.

112
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.310
I don't want to draw another picture,
but I'd probably fail.

113
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.510
This is rotated body off from its ideal position.

114
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.390
Then that will be a torque.
What would the tarp be?

115
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.740
It the same thing minus m g l sine theta with where did he place by Tara eldest.

116
00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:54.210
Now the distance between the pivot point and the center of mass,

117
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.250
that's your top
so you can read the cap way.
In fact,

118
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.990
it's just like the pendulum.
Another way.
As far as the Torque is concerned,

119
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.060
it's as if all the masks were sitting here.

120
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.090
The difference would be in moment of finish,
you want me to finish?
You have,

121
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.480
this is not emo squares.
Don't make the mistake.
All the masses not sitting here,

122
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.800
all the masters sitting all over the place.
So you should know that.

123
00:08:19.801 --> 00:08:22.050
If you want a moment to finish.
Yeah,
it is.

124
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:27.110
I did respect the center of mass plus this ml square back to the old paddle

125
00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:31.230
Alexis theater.
So take that moment of inertia,

126
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.690
put that into this formula here,

127
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.020
dig this Camba cappa and put it there and you'll get some frequency.

128
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:41.820
That's the frequency with your philosophy.
Every problem that you would ever get,

129
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.580
we look like one of these two,

130
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.390
eight that or something moving linearly with the coordinator that you can call x

131
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.070
audits,
rotating or twisting by an angle.
You can call data.

132
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.190
And if you want to find out the of vibration,

133
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.860
you have to disturb it from equilibrium,
either by pulling the massive,

134
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:04.500
by twisting the cable or displacing this pendulum from its ideal position here.

135
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.180
Then finding the restoring torque.

136
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.033
<v 2>Yep.</v>

137
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.670
<v 0>That's a very good point.</v>

138
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.940
His question is if I give you a cable and I twist the cable by some angle,

139
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.180
how about are we going to calculate restoring torque?
Here's the good news.

140
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.700
This problem is so hard,
we will give it to you.
In other words,

141
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.350
that is of course an underlying answer given a cable made of some material.

142
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.550
Andrew starshine would properties how much of a park you'll get if you twisted

143
00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:43.330
by some amount,
but it's not something you can calculate from first principles,

144
00:09:43.331 --> 00:09:46.690
so they will simply have to give it to you.
Okay?
In such problems,

145
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.560
the only time you will have to find the torque on your own isn't a problem like

146
00:09:50.561 --> 00:09:53.980
this where I believe you don't enough to figure out the torque.

147
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.850
Okay?
What you will find this,
if you leave it alone,

148
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.100
it'll go to a position where there is no torque.

149
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.530
If you move it off that position,

150
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:04.980
that will be a torque and the torque will always be proportional.

151
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:06.870
The angle by which you displaced it,

152
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.510
you read up the proportionality constant and that's your capital.

153
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.610
By the way,
this is not a problem.
You should look at the forces to,

154
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:17.990
which is pretty interesting.
This body,

155
00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:21.820
even there's hanging in its rest position has to forces on it.

156
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.850
The nail which is pushing up and the weight of the body,

157
00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:27.160
which is pushing down and they canceled each other.

158
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.650
The nail will keep it from falling.

159
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.140
The nail will not keep it from swinging because the force of the nail acting as

160
00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:38.410
a does at the pivot point is unable to exert a torque.

161
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.720
Whereas the minute you rotate the body mg is able to exert a park.

162
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.060
That's why if you twist it and you start rattling back and forth.

163
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.560
Alright,

164
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.560
so what I'm going to do now is to go over a more complicated oscillations

165
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.510
using some of the techniques we learned last time.

166
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.320
So here is the mega formula.
I'm going to give it to you guys.
You have to,

167
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.070
you're allowed to tattoo it on your face.
You can carry it with you.

168
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.860
I will allow you to bring it.
But you cannot forget this formula.

169
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.640
I think you know the Formula I'm driving at ready

170
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.000
eat the I x or 10 I don't care.
Let me call it data.

171
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:27.940
Here is consigned data plus I signed data.

172
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.230
That's the great formula from oiler

173
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.110
from this formula.
If you take the complex conjugate abode sites,

174
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.950
that means change every EIT to minus sign you would get either.

175
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
The minus I data is coastline data minus I assigned table.

176
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.280
That also you should know

177
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.880
if you got this in your head.
By the way,

178
00:11:56.881 --> 00:12:00.900
this is something you're not going to derive on the spot.
It takes a lot of work,

179
00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:02.220
so there's something.
If you,

180
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.090
if you tell me what are the few things you really have to cram that you don't

181
00:12:06.091 --> 00:12:09.540
want the caddy in your head.
Well,
this is one of them,
okay?

182
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:14.010
This is a formula worth memorizing.
Unlike formula number 92 of your texts,

183
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.850
it's not worth memorizing.
This is worth memorizing.
Once you got this,

184
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.570
you should realize that in any expression involving complex numbers,

185
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.940
you can get another equation where every I is changed to minus side that can

186
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:30.960
give you this one that's called complex conjugation.
Identical.
He said,

187
00:12:30.961 --> 00:12:35.640
if you have a complex number,
Z,
z scar is equal to x minus Y,

188
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.650
Z is equal x plus y.
So in our simple example,

189
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.420
this fellow here,
the Z,
this is the x and this is the why

190
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.980
not.
You should be able to invert this formula to invert the formula.

191
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.020
You add the two and divide by two,

192
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.220
then you will find co signed data is either the ITA topless in the minus I

193
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.290
theater over too.

194
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.580
If you subtract and divide by two I will find scientists.

195
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.460
Even the I data minus the minus I did over two I in other words,

196
00:13:11.461 --> 00:13:16.230
my claim is that this funny exponential summer to expeditions is the family.

197
00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:21.120
Of course sign,
it'll do everything.
Your coastline will do lansulate science,

198
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.650
square plus course and square would be one.

199
00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:26.550
It'll satisfy all the tech non metric identities like signed to Taylor's do.

200
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.360
Scientist are constituted.
Everything comes out of this expression.

201
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.270
So you should know.
Here's the main point.
You should learn.

202
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.080
We don't need trigonometry functions anymore.

203
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.240
Once you got the exponential function provided,

204
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.630
you will let the exponent B complex or imaginary.

205
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.490
You don't need trigonometry functions.
This is one example of grand unification.

206
00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:53.420
People always say,
Max will unify this and I am and try to unify this.

207
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.810
Unification means things that you taught but unrelated are in fact related and

208
00:13:59.811 --> 00:14:01.790
there are different manifestations of the same thing.

209
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.880
When we first discovered ergonometric functions,

210
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:08.620
you know we were drawing try right angle triangles and opposite side in our days

211
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:11.150
and site.
Then we discover the exponential function,

212
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.140
which by the way was computed by bankers who were trying to calculate compound

213
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:16.490
interest.
Everybody is second.

214
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.240
The fact that those functions that relate to this a marvelous result,

215
00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:22.310
but it happens only if you go to complex numbers.

216
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.810
So this is another thing you should know.

217
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.930
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

218
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.160
<v 0>okay.
Now armed with this,
we already
do anything we want.</v>

219
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:34.900
Let me just tell you that every complex number z can it and this is absolute

220
00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:39.900
value times some phase.
In other words,
if my complex numbers,
these,

221
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.060
here it is x plus y,
y,
that's one way to write it.

222
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.440
You can also write it as an absolute value.
You're the Ifi,

223
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.690
are you to the Ifi artists,
the length.

224
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.720
It also happens to be the length of the complex number.

225
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.100
That's called the polar form of the complex number.
Explicit.

226
00:14:59.101 --> 00:15:01.740
Why is the Cartesian form of the complex number

227
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.000
I may have called them out and data are in fight.
I just don't remember.

228
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.680
I'm going to use these symbols back and forth because people do use both.

229
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:16.370
The symbol,
which is why I am sometimes calling this angle is data.

230
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.180
Sometimes this angle is fine,
but the basic idea is the same.

231
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.570
This entity here can get and either in this form on in this one,

232
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.170
this is something you should know.
If you don't know or don't understand,

233
00:15:29.171 --> 00:15:32.020
you should stop and ask.
Everything is built on this,

234
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.760
so what I'm going to do now is to go back to this rather simple equation.

235
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.590
Two x over d t square

236
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.090
equal to minus Omega Squared X.

237
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.920
By the way,
today I'm going to call this Omega as Omega not.

238
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.400
It's the same guy.

239
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.780
I'm going to call it Omega not because we will find as the hour progresses that

240
00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:01.810
are going to be many Omegas in the game to more Omega [inaudible] going to come

241
00:16:01.811 --> 00:16:04.330
in,
so we gotta be able to tell them apart.

242
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.040
As long as there's only one omega in town,
you just call it omega.

243
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:07.874
If there are many,

244
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:13.020
you call this Omega not demean is the frequency of vibration of the system left

245
00:16:14.021 --> 00:16:16.270
to its own design and you pull it and let it go.

246
00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:20.830
What's the frequency or angular frequency?
That's what we call Omega,
not now.

247
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:22.210
How did we solve this equation?

248
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.910
The way I tried to solve with for you is to say trinity,
the word problem.

249
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.290
I'm looking for a function x of t with a property.

250
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:35.970
The two directors or the function look like the function and we rake the reigns

251
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.701
a bit remembered,
hey,

252
00:16:36.701 --> 00:16:40.720
science and coastlines are the property one day there's no good turn.

253
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.610
Sign it the coastline to derivatives bring back the function you started with,

254
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.460
which is why the answer could be science of course science,

255
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.220
but now I'm going to solve it in a different way.
My thinking is going to be,

256
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.470
I know a function that repeats itself even when a differentiated,
once

257
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.770
namely the function has a property.
It's first did a bit too.

258
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:07.750
It looks like the function itself,
it's obvious that is 90 secondary,

259
00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:10.990
but it will also look like the function because taking the derivative leaves the

260
00:17:10.991 --> 00:17:13.210
function alone except for pulling out some numbers.

261
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.200
So why not say I want an answer that looks like this.

262
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:20.590
X equals some a.
You're the Alpha t

263
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.120
that's certainly has the property that if you take do a little bit,

264
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:28.800
if it's going to look like you're the Alpha t on the left hand side and even on

265
00:17:28.801 --> 00:17:32.870
foot on the right hand side and then you can cancel them and you've got yourself

266
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:37.250
a solution.
Do you guys remember why I didn't follow this

267
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.460
solution for the oscillator?
Why was it rejected?

268
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.383
Yes.

269
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.243
<v 1>Sick.</v>

270
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.840
<v 0>Ah,
that's a very good point.</v>

271
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.320
So maybe I will take either the minus Alpha I bought that.

272
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.800
Will that give me a second bit of it.
Do which just negative.

273
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.800
You didn't fall for that,
right?
Because first time we get minus Alpha,

274
00:18:00.801 --> 00:18:03.650
but second time you'll get plus Alpha square that's connected.

275
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.930
This function is no good.
Also,

276
00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:10.400
it doesn't look like what I want even without being much mathematical physics.

277
00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:12.950
I know if you pull this spring is going to go back and forth,

278
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.550
but at these functions that exponentially growing,
that exponentially falling.

279
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.230
There's this don't do the trick,

280
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.910
but now we'll find that if you're willing to work with complex exponentials,

281
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.990
this will do the job.

282
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.660
So we just going to take the guess and put it in the equation and see if I can

283
00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:31.730
get an answer that works.
Okay.

284
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.900
This is called an anzacs on Zach,
something we use all the time.

285
00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:38.930
It's a German word.
I'm not sure exactly what it means,

286
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.770
but we all use it to mean attempted to guess.

287
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.140
That's what it is.
If you're lucky,
it'll work.
If I'm not lucky,
that's fine.

288
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:49.570
You move on and try another solution to.

289
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.580
We are going to say a solution of this form be found with a an Alpha completely

290
00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:58.850
free.
Maybe the equation will tell me what a and l four should be.

291
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.290
So let's take it,
put it here.
By the way,

292
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:05.810
I'm going to write this equation and a form that's a little easier.

293
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:11.120
Xw God is minus Omega Zero squared expert.
each.is a derivative.

294
00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.130
It's just more compact that way,
that rather than to write all of this stuff.

295
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.640
So let's take that guests and put it here and see what we get.

296
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.510
I get,
but I take two derivatives.
Uh,

297
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.721
you can say,

298
00:19:28.721 --> 00:19:32.830
do I want eat the alpha minus Alpha t you will find it doesn't matter because

299
00:19:32.831 --> 00:19:37.820
I'm going to take either the Alpha t and put a day.
No.

300
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.710
The beauty of the x function now is take one derivative X.
Dot.

301
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.220
I hope everybody knows the extra.
This is a,

302
00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.590
you're the Alpha t and x double doc is another alpha,

303
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.460
a Alpha squared.
It'd the Alpha p.
That's the beauty of the explanation.

304
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.730
The act of differentiation is trivial.
You just multiply by the exponent Alpha.

305
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.250
So this being the result of taking two derivatives,
uh,

306
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.990
let me write it here.
Now what do I get?

307
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.260
So I'm going to go to x double dot equal to minus Omega zero squared x into

308
00:20:17.411 --> 00:20:17.711
that.

309
00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:22.711
I'm going to put in the guest's x equals either the Alpha t and what do I find?

310
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.470
I find that it's a live,
in fact,
let me write the equation in a nicer way.

311
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:35.350
X double.plus Omega zero squared x has to vanish.

312
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.260
I just brought everything to one side.

313
00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.820
Not put either the Alpha t eight the Alpha t as your guests.

314
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.060
Then you find there's Alpha square a in the alpha.

315
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.230
Bless Omega zero squared a,

316
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.920
you're the Alpha t has to be zero.

317
00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.323
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

318
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.560
<v 0>so we know what to do.
Let's grow up a few terms.</v>

319
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.660
This means you get a Phams Alpha squared plus one ear to the Alpha t has to

320
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:11.230
vanish.
If you can make that happen,

321
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.810
you've got a solution because you satisfy the equation.
No one's going to say,

322
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:18.490
well,
you got it.
Big guess work well.

323
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:21.520
It turns out solving differential equations is only guesswork.

324
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.730
There's no other way to solve the equation other than to make a guess,

325
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.760
stick it in food with the parameters,
see if it'll work.

326
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.030
So we're not done yet because we want this to vanish.

327
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.550
How many ways are that to kill this answer?
You can say maybe a zero.

328
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.250
A zero.
You've got watch color.
Trivial solution.

329
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.270
<v 2>Yes.
Ah,
yes.</v>

330
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.860
Thank you.
Yep.

331
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.600
<v 0>Thank you very much.
This one is Alpha Square,</v>

332
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:57.240
Rose Omega Zero Square.
Does everybody follow that?

333
00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.830
Yes.
From here to here.
It's very clear what to do so we cannot kill a

334
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.893
<v 2>yup.</v>

335
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.920
[inaudible].

336
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:16.190
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I'm trying to rule out certain options.
I don't like the option.</v>

337
00:22:16.191 --> 00:22:19.250
I don't like to get this to be zero.
It's to say that the zero,

338
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.240
that's not happening either.
The outfit t is not going to vanish.

339
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.320
Maybe it advantage,
uh,
for some negative infinity time.

340
00:22:27.321 --> 00:22:29.360
But I want this to be true at all times.

341
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.520
The equation has to be obeyed at all times.

342
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.590
Will this guy certainly is not zero at all time.

343
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.960
The only way to fix that as to have Alpha Square was Omega Zero Square equals

344
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.830
zero.
That's the only solution which is not a trivial solution.

345
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.930
Well that's the simple equation,
right?

346
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:52.990
It's a quadratic equation that mean Alpha squared is minus Omega Zero Square are

347
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.680
Alpha is plus or minus I Omega Zero.

348
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.820
So when we were young and we didn't know about complex numbers,

349
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:09.190
we will come to this state and we will quit and say,
look,

350
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.030
exponentials won't work.
But now we're not afraid of complex exponentials.

351
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.890
So we embraced the solution.
So now I have got two solutions.
By the way,

352
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:21.190
what's the value of a think about this.

353
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.770
If this condition is satisfied,

354
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.740
you realize it can be whatever you like is completely arbitrary.

355
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.570
So what this equation has told me is the following.

356
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.680
Yes that our solutions of this form for a,

357
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:41.530
you can pick any number you like.
In fact real a of complex.

358
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:42.580
It doesn't matter the equation,

359
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:46.460
dissatisfied what your Alpha is not an arbitrary number.

360
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.100
It can be only one of two numbers.
Plus I omega zero minus Iomega zero.

361
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.620
So we got a problem.
Now that I look at one answer,
I got to.

362
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.830
So I a ride them both.

363
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.900
Let's say that's the solution x one of t we did some number a eat to the eye

364
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.500
omega zero t.
Then I got another solution x two FT,

365
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:17.190
which is equal to any other number B e to the minus I Omega is either t

366
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.520
no.
I think you guys can see in your head that if you take this and you put it in

367
00:24:29.521 --> 00:24:33.330
the equation,
it works and if we take this and put it into the equation,

368
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.360
that also works because when you take two derivatives Iomega whole square would

369
00:24:38.581 --> 00:24:42.660
be minus Omega Square minus,
Oh I Iomega not holds had also be minus.

370
00:24:42.661 --> 00:24:44.250
We'll make an arch queer,
so both will work.

371
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.160
No,
we have to ask,
how do I decide between that solution and that solution?

372
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.880
It turns out that we don't have to pick.

373
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.220
We can pick both and I'll tell you what I mean by we can pick both.
Oh,

374
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.021
this is a very,

375
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:06.470
very important property for all of you are going into economics or engineering

376
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:10.430
or chemistry.
This are other disciplines which are mathematical.

377
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.430
The property I'm going to mention off this equation is very important,

378
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.710
so please pay attention.
This is called a linear equation.

379
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.190
Linear equation.
We'll a certain property called super position.

380
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.310
I'll have to tell you what it is.
If I give you a differential equation,

381
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.650
you know 96 did ever do have x plus 52 times the 37 deliberate about bags

382
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.120
Blahblahblah adds up to zero.

383
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.710
What makes it a linear equation is that throughout an equation a that you find

384
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.870
the function x audits,

385
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:52.270
derivatives but never the squares or cubes that are higher powers of x or the
it,

386
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.640
okay,
the function appears the first power,

387
00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.130
not the second power,
but example,

388
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.710
if this were the question you were trying to solve,

389
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.490
that is not a linear equation.
That's called a nonlinear equation.

390
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.430
If you have a linear equation,
that's a very,

391
00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:13.050
very profound consequence and I'm going to tell you what it is and that lies at

392
00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:14.280
the heart of so many things we do.

393
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.100
So let me write down two solutions.

394
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.710
One of them will be is x one double doc,

395
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:27.120
let's Omega naught squared x one equals zero second one over x to double dark.

396
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.780
It was Omega notch squared x week with a zero.

397
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.310
Don't even have to look at these two solutions.
Take a dental problem,

398
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:39.311
but you have a linear equation that are two solutions at the two equations

399
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.740
on the lefthand side.

400
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.630
I get the second or the of x one plus the second day they will do a vix.

401
00:26:46.631 --> 00:26:49.890
Do I remember that is in fact the second did of it.

402
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:54.891
Do I like go back to the old rotation of x one plus x two this has to do with

403
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:57.240
the fact that database Dubois for Psalm,

404
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:59.380
it's a psalm of the databases and some of the data,

405
00:26:59.381 --> 00:27:00.870
but it was the date of it to the song.

406
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.450
<v 2>Yep.
So because you had these two linear solutions,</v>

407
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.730
does that mean you can sort of generate himself?
Yes,

408
00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.230
<v 0>I'm coming to that in a minute.</v>

409
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.490
I'm first doing a more modest goal of showing that there is some is also a

410
00:27:15.491 --> 00:27:18.400
solution.
The second term,

411
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.560
I get Omega Zero Square times x one plus x two equals to zero

412
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:30.190
your standard does equation look this plus this implies what I've written down

413
00:27:30.191 --> 00:27:33.730
simply by adding,
let's say in words what you've found out,

414
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.110
what you found out that of x one satisfies the equation extra,

415
00:27:38.111 --> 00:27:39.250
satisfies the equation.

416
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.120
X One plus x two let's call it x plus x one plus x two also satisfies the

417
00:27:46.241 --> 00:27:51.241
equation and the proof is right in front of you and the key was the did ever do

418
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.620
offer some somewhat the derivatives.

419
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.590
Now I'm going to generalize it more and say suppose that multiplied all of the

420
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:05.760
first equation by a all of the second equation by B.

421
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.230
Well that's certainly still true,
right?

422
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.530
You take z something equals zero multiply both sides bay,

423
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:15.240
it's still going to be zero.
Now imagine adding this to this,

424
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.330
add this to this and what do you get?

425
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.720
You will find these square over DT square off x one plus B x two last Omega Zero

426
00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:33.331
Square x one plus B x two zero

427
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.580
so here's the punchline.
You should give me a two solutions to this equation.

428
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.560
I can manufacture it.

429
00:28:42.561 --> 00:28:47.270
Another one by taking the first one times any number I like less the second one

430
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.170
times any other number I like,
so the story is a lot more detailed,

431
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.420
more complicated than it looked.

432
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.810
It looked like that or two solution actually there's infinite number of

433
00:28:56.811 --> 00:28:59.630
solutions because you can pick a and B any way you like.

434
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.690
So linear equations typically have infinite number of solutions and you build

435
00:29:05.691 --> 00:29:08.000
them up by taking a few building blocks.
They're like,

436
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.920
they're like unit vectors I.
N.
G.

437
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.270
You can take any multiple of this unit back to anyone over that unit vector and

438
00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:16.280
this combination but also solve the equation

439
00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.690
just so you don't think there's going to happen all the time.
Let me remind you,

440
00:29:22.691 --> 00:29:25.000
you don't have to write this down but at least follow what I'm saying.

441
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:30.100
Suppose this quantity here was not x one but the squared of x one and here,

442
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.910
okay,
don't have to write this because this is not a linear equation.

443
00:29:33.911 --> 00:29:34.840
We are not interested in this,

444
00:29:34.841 --> 00:29:38.320
but notice this is nonlinear and you guys should be able to pick it up.

445
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.600
It's not linear because I've got the square of the unknown.

446
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.430
Now can you see if I add these two equations,
but again a and B,

447
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:48.850
let them both be one.
I get x one squared plus x two square,

448
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.440
but that does not equal to x one plus x two the whole thing square.

449
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.760
So even though they did have it the second day to two of the summer,
the summer,

450
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.720
the second database to the sum of the squares is not the square to the sun.

451
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.700
So for nonlinear equation,
you cannot add solutions.
For linear equation,

452
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:12.370
you can combine solutions with arbitrary coefficients.

453
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:17.290
That's the lesson you have learned today.
So I would,

454
00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:19.840
harmonic oscillator equation is a linear equation,

455
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.200
so feel free to combine them and get the falling solution.

456
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.000
X of t is equal to a e to the I Omega is the Roti.

457
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:33.640
Less B minus I omega is,
you don't have t a and B or whatever you like,

458
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.220
but Omega zero is the original fruit of or whatever.

459
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.400
But if I gave you this solution,
uh,

460
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.910
we'll be happy to take it as a solution for the mass spring system.
And if not,

461
00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:54.960
what is it you don't like?

462
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:04.480
Yes.
Anybody have a view?
I mean,
would you take that as a good solution?
Yes.

463
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.200
<v 2>Um,
we need to figure out how to use the right Amy,</v>

464
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.640
<v 0>are you in order to achieve what?</v>

465
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.250
<v 2>Uh,
well,
because your system starts some</v>

466
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.330
sample too.

467
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:24.150
<v 0>Well,
he's raising a point,
let me repeat his point.
A and B of course,</v>

468
00:31:24.151 --> 00:31:26.940
cannot be in general are arbitrary for this mass.

469
00:31:26.941 --> 00:31:30.780
In this brain you can pick any a and B you like,
but on a given day,

470
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.160
when you pull it by nine centimeters and release it,

471
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:38.880
that answer has to be chosen so that our t equals zero x becomes nine and the

472
00:31:38.881 --> 00:31:42.200
velocity,
let's say was zero.
We released it.
So when you take the data,

473
00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:46.410
we'll do this in the last year,
should banish fatigue,
will dissolve art.

474
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.000
Maybe it'll have some other velocity when you can fit initial coordinate initial

475
00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:55.230
velocity,
the two numbers by picking these two numbers,
you understand that.

476
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.400
But that's not enough.
I got another problem.

477
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.160
<v 2>Yes,
it has imaginary numbers.</v>

478
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:04.800
<v 0>Yes,
that's your bother.
You</v>

479
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.453
<v 2>Great.</v>

480
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:10.590
<v 0>The answer it is manifestly not real.
Okay.</v>

481
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.620
And we know x is a real function that is not a mathematical requirement of the

482
00:32:16.471 --> 00:32:17.304
equation,

483
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.900
but the physical requirement that the venue Paula mass nine centimeters and you

484
00:32:21.901 --> 00:32:25.980
release it,
it's going to oscillate with some real x,
x and not a complex sex.

485
00:32:25.981 --> 00:32:30.420
So you gotta fix that.
So to say that x is real,

486
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:31.590
really means the following.

487
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.970
You remember in the complex world of complex numbers,

488
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.971
a complex number x plus y has a complex find to get explained to y and the

489
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:45.650
property of real numbers is that when you take the complex conjugate,

490
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.760
nothing happens because I goes to minus PSI.

491
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.510
If the number was purely real,
it satisfies the condition.

492
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.310
Z equals z star.

493
00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.890
Serial numbers are their own complex funding gates in general,
a complex number.

494
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.890
It's not his own kind.
You get out if you want me to draw your picture,

495
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.270
that's whereZ is.

496
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.200
That's where does he started is the fellows on the x axis have the properties.

497
00:33:10.201 --> 00:33:12.700
Z is the same as the star is.

498
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.390
He started said reflection or the z axis of the on the x axis of z and therefore

499
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.230
the number is real.
It's its own reflection,

500
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:24.770
so I'm going to demand that this solution in addition to satisfying the basic

501
00:33:24.781 --> 00:33:26.370
equation also is real.

502
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.240
The dude that I'm going to find the complex conjugate,

503
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.410
it's denoted with the x star of tea.

504
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.490
Now you want to kind to get everything in sight.

505
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.750
The complex ones you get at a,
I'm going to call a star,

506
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.880
appliques going to get an e to the I.

507
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.880
Omega t is either the miners Iomega zero t y because the eye goes to minus Psi

508
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.690
Omega Zito and Trel numbers.

509
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.720
Nothing happens to them and be becomes the star and this becomes either the plus

510
00:33:54.421 --> 00:33:55.410
Iomega zero t

511
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.430
and I demand that these two fellows at equal,

512
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.340
<v 1>yeah,</v>

513
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.450
<v 0>if they're both equal,</v>

514
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:10.020
then I take this exponential and demand that those be the same.

515
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:15.760
That means I demand that he be the same as B stock.

516
00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.550
If it's the same as B star,

517
00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.530
this will go into this and then I will demand that be it's the same as a star.

518
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.360
If these conditions are satisfied,
x will become x.

519
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.400
So the trick is to take the function,

520
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.970
take its complex con to get equal to itself and look at the consequence.

521
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.880
Now I want to tell you that it is equal to be star.

522
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.370
Then you don't have to worry about this as an extra condition

523
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.620
because I am your complex conjugate.

524
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:50.480
You are my complex going to get because the way it works is if it took a and

525
00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.590
change every eight to minus sigh right out.

526
00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:58.410
If it took be whatever it's complex form was Jane item minus I you get a but if

527
00:34:58.411 --> 00:35:01.530
it do it one more time,
you come back to where you are.
In other words,

528
00:35:01.531 --> 00:35:05.520
for any complex number,
if you started and you started one more time,

529
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:09.570
you'll come back to Betty.
What that photo of a is equal to be star.

530
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.210
Take the complex conjugate of the left hand side.

531
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.720
You will find a start is equally be star star,
which is B.

532
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.950
So you don't need these two conditions.
You do need a equal to be star.

533
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.960
Okay?
So you have to put that extra condition.
Now,

534
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.680
so in the real world or people who want a real answer,

535
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.960
you want to write it as a,

536
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:38.790
even the Iomega Zero t plus a star you can minus Iomega.

537
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.700
Other words be is not an independent.

538
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:44.040
Number B has to be the complex conjugate of a.

539
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.840
Then all of you can see at a glance that this is now real because whatever this

540
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:51.420
animal list,
this is the complex conjugate of that.

541
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.760
It's got all the ice turned into minus Ivan.

542
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:56.850
You add them all the ice cancer answered with video real,

543
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.710
but a is not necessarily real.
The complex number a,

544
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.660
which is some complex number,

545
00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:09.550
it has a length and it can have a face because every complex number can be

546
00:36:09.551 --> 00:36:10.384
written in this form.

547
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.210
<v 2>Okay?</v>

548
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.200
<v 0>So if you remember that,
then you find x looks like</v>

549
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.460
absolute value of a youth in the eye,

550
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:25.461
Omega Zero t plus Fi plus absolute value a the minus Omega Zero t plus Fi.

551
00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.470
I mean,
I didn't,
let me go see Dorothy.

552
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.220
Well,
maybe that's too fast for you.

553
00:36:39.221 --> 00:36:43.780
So let me repeat what I did in the place of a right.
The absolute value of times,

554
00:36:43.781 --> 00:36:45.640
either the IFI,
it,

555
00:36:45.641 --> 00:36:49.000
the I five will come by and eat the Iomega Omega t and formed this exponential

556
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.270
second trend would be just the kind you get of the whole thing.

557
00:36:52.271 --> 00:36:53.104
You don't even have to do

558
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.753
<v 2>no.</v>

559
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.790
<v 0>What does this function I have,
I want you to think about it.</v>

560
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:06.010
Do you recognize this?
Greeted here?
Is something familiar now?

561
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.580
<v 2>Yes.
You have any idea?
Yeah.</v>

562
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:14.773
Yep.

563
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.183
<v 0>Hello,
Dan.</v>

564
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.353
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

565
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.400
<v 0>You would remember this great identity.
Where is it here?</v>

566
00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.590
<v 2>Uh,
this one</v>

567
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.410
<v 0>[inaudible] e to the minus I it as two times square sign data.</v>

568
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.600
So this becomes

569
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:42.550
two times absolute value of a sin Omega t plus Fi and you,

570
00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:45.410
if you want,
you can call to a,

571
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.770
another number C corps saying Omega Zero T.

572
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.553
That's fine.

573
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.920
<v 2>The second one is,
uh,
not a,</v>

574
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.820
uh,
that stepdad representation is a star.

575
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.070
<v 0>Oh,
but put any complex now you can pull the,
certainly this number out of both.</v>

576
00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.660
Yes.
You pull it out.

577
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:12.350
Then you've got either the ice something plus e to the minus nine [inaudible].

578
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.990
So this is a long and difficult way to get back the old lancer.

579
00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:23.710
You got this by fiddling around and guessing and arguing physically.

580
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.740
But I wanted to show you that with exponential function you will have come to

581
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:31.090
this answer it anyway.
So your point of view is,
you know,

582
00:38:31.091 --> 00:38:33.940
we don't need this.
I've got no problems in life.

583
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.090
We're lean very well with core science.
Thank you.

584
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.160
Why do you bring this exponential on us?

585
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:43.210
Well now I'm going to give you a problem where you cannot talk your way out of

586
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:46.240
this by just trying to get into word problem.
The word problem,

587
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:50.340
I meant we asked the word question,
find me a function with a second.

588
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.860
Deliberative looks like itself and you can eat the star,

589
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:56.710
the exponentials and different twice or science and coastline.

590
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.110
So you don't need exponentials.
But look at the following problem.

591
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:05.610
This is a problem of a mass m forced constant k moving on a surface.

592
00:39:07.571 --> 00:39:12.460
But friction,
the minute you've got friction,

593
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.690
you have an extra force.

594
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.430
So you find an x double dot equals minus K x,

595
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.460
but to the old force due to the spring friction also exerts a force which has

596
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:27.520
got some coefficient B,
but it's multiplied by the velocity.

597
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.330
We know that it can move into the right,
the forces,

598
00:39:31.331 --> 00:39:32.860
the left we moving to the left of forces,

599
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:35.200
the right frictional forces velocity dependent.

600
00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.950
So the equation you want to solve when you got friction,

601
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:44.170
it's really Amex double.plus B x.
Dot.

602
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:49.000
Ah,
plus K X equals zero.

603
00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.780
I'm going to do write everything by em.
Take that avenue.

604
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.650
What did here and put it here.

605
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.280
Then I'm going to read it for us.

606
00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:05.720
The equation we want to solve with friction XW

607
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.580
plus Gamma X.
Dot.
Let's Omega zero squared.

608
00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:15.260
X equals zero but gamma this just be over there.

609
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:18.590
Let's take a question you want to solve.

610
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.000
Can you solve this by your usual word problem?

611
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:31.510
It's going to be difficult because you want to function,

612
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:33.010
which when I take two derivatives

613
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:37.880
looks like the function plus some or multiple zone database.

614
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:43.160
They cost Omega t it won't do it.
If he takes sign him.
I tea it won't do it.

615
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.270
So we can still solve it.

616
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.940
Because even this equation you solve by the same mindless approach,

617
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:59.570
which is to say,
let x look like a,
you're the Alpha team

618
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:06.230
and it'll work.
Let's see how it could work.
It has to work.

619
00:41:06.231 --> 00:41:08.960
You can see why.
Because when I take two derivatives of x,

620
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:12.290
I would get out for square.
Let me pull the air out of everything.

621
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.990
Plus Alpha Gamma Omega Zero Square,

622
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.600
you're the Alpha t equal to zero.

623
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.210
So what we learned is yes,

624
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.050
that our solutions of this form to this equation,
once again,

625
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.770
it can be whatever number you like because if a vanishes,

626
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.740
you kill the whole solution,
you'd,

627
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.390
the Alpha is not going to vanish should every instant in time.

628
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.660
So the only way is for this to vanish.

629
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.850
That means Alpha that you put into this yes is not any old number,

630
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.870
but the solution at this quadratic equation,
Alpha squared was alpha.

631
00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:58.880
Gamma Plus Omega not squared equals zero.

632
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.440
So do you want Alpha Square?
What does Alpha Gamma is?

633
00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.930
Omega squared equals zero Alpha must be the root of this equation.

634
00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.590
And we all know the quadratic equation.

635
00:42:14.591 --> 00:42:19.240
We'll have two routes and we will get to solutions and we can add them with any

636
00:42:19.241 --> 00:42:24.130
coefficient you like.
That'll also be a solution.
So let me write it down.

637
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.750
So in other words,
I'm going to explicitly solved this quadratic equation.

638
00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:35.130
So go back to the old days and remember that the solution of that equation will

639
00:42:35.861 --> 00:42:40.861
be alpha equals minus gamma less than minus square root of gamma square minus

640
00:42:42.221 --> 00:42:45.070
four Omega Naught Square over to,

641
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.200
I would like to rewrite this as minus gamma over two plus or minus square root

642
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:58.141
of gamma over to square minus will Megan r square

643
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.740
and let's call the two routes,

644
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.330
one with a plus sign in one with a minus sign as Alpha plus and minus.

645
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.060
This is a shorthand for this whole combination.

646
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:15.660
Do you understand that?

647
00:43:15.661 --> 00:43:19.950
If I gave you the mass and the spring constant and I give you the Coefficient of

648
00:43:19.951 --> 00:43:20.430
friction,

649
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:25.430
the number B Alpha plus Alpha minus that uniquely know you will get too precise

650
00:43:26.251 --> 00:43:30.210
numbers coming out of this whole game and your answer then to this problem.

651
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.840
But we accept t is any number a times e to the minus Alpha plus t any number v

652
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.980
times either the minus Alpha minus d,

653
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.500
but Alpha plus and minus are these two numbers.

654
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:53.230
I want you to notice what numbers are falling exponentials.

655
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:59.130
Very important because now I'm talking about a mass,
but I pulled the spring.

656
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.860
That's a lot of friction and I let it go.

657
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.910
I don't want an exponentially growing answered.
That makes no sense.

658
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.650
The extruder eventually vanish and that will in fact happen.

659
00:44:10.651 --> 00:44:13.950
Let's make sure you understand that.
Look at these two routes,

660
00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:18.930
minus gamma over two
plus and minus.

661
00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:23.520
Well that is this solution minus gamma warbird blue square minus Omega,

662
00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:24.354
not square.

663
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:31.100
I'm going to assume in this calculation that GAM over two is bigger omega not.

664
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.210
Let's do that first.

665
00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.990
Then you can see that that's a negative number.
That's a negative number.

666
00:44:38.991 --> 00:44:42.380
The whole thing is negative.
So Alpha minus is definitely,

667
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.080
<v 2>uh,
let me see how it worked.
It,</v>

668
00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.730
<v 0>oh,
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake here.
I think,
uh,</v>

669
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:57.710
these are called just plus and minus.
Alpha.

670
00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:02.360
Alpha is two roots and I have to write them as they are.
Okay.
I'm sorry.

671
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:07.390
So please remove this unwanted sign there because they are the two answers for

672
00:45:07.641 --> 00:45:11.660
Alpha.
So I put either the Alpha plus t so again,

673
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.230
I should change my answer here.
I'm really sorry about this one.

674
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.960
I should write the desk now.

675
00:45:17.961 --> 00:45:19.940
I'm going to write it below so you have a second chance.

676
00:45:19.941 --> 00:45:21.440
So here's what it looks like.
A

677
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:28.300
either the minus a Yam over two plus square root of GAM over to square minus

678
00:45:31.401 --> 00:45:33.120
omega,
not t square,
t

679
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.760
plus B e to the minus GAM over two minus a GAM.

680
00:45:41.451 --> 00:45:44.810
All were two square minus Omega,
not squared.
T.

681
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:49.420
<v 2>Yep.
Pardon me.
I've got the mind,</v>

682
00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:51.973
uh,

683
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.830
<v 0>I think I didn't mean this or did they get it wrong?</v>

684
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.030
These are the two values of Alpha.

685
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.520
So they both have the first number to be minus gamma over to,

686
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.510
and the square root comes to the plus sign for one of them and minus sign for

687
00:46:10.511 --> 00:46:13.630
the other one.
I probably have a and B mixed up.
Let me check that.

688
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:15.363
<v 2>Uh,</v>

689
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:17.840
<v 0>well I think even that's okay.</v>

690
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.410
Yes,
I'm willing to be corrected if I got a and B mixed up.

691
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:29.360
I know these are correct.

692
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.370
I want to make sure this is what I call B B as a coefficient Alpha minus,

693
00:46:34.371 --> 00:46:35.980
which would be this one.
Uh

694
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.520
Oh yes.
Yes.

695
00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.800
So what's your day to call this a call?
This be,
how is that now?

696
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.460
Let's see if that works out.

697
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:55.330
They should be be either the alpha minus t be the minus GAM over too.

698
00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.470
<v 2>Uh,
minus there.
Yes.</v>

699
00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.990
Pardon me.
Oh wait,
no.

700
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.320
<v 0>Okay.
The point of writing it this way is to show you that both these powers,</v>

701
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:24.060
this is clearly a positive number,
so it's either the minus a negative number.

702
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.370
I just want to show you that this object,

703
00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:30.220
that's all I wanted to emphasize inside the square brackets.

704
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:32.830
Also possible because this is game over to,

705
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.010
you can see this is a number of smaller than GAM over to square.

706
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.940
If you take this way too of that number will be smaller than GAM over two.

707
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:43.510
So this cannot overturn the sign of this.
It'll still be a positive overall.

708
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:45.850
Sandy be negative.
So if you draw the picture here,

709
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:49.750
it's a summer off to exponentials.
Really just die down after awhile.

710
00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

711
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:57.170
<v 0>And how do I find a and B to find a and B?</v>

712
00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:00.500
What have to do is to take extra data.

713
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.820
One of the maybe initial position x of zero is given to me.

714
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:10.760
Excess zero has given to me as some number.
I take the solution,

715
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:15.470
I'd put t equal to zero and have it matched this if a boutique will the zero.

716
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:21.250
Well all this exponential manage and I just get a plus B because either the zero

717
00:48:21.411 --> 00:48:25.970
is one
essay already had one condition on a and B.

718
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.350
There some must be the initial position.
How broad uh,

719
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:31.880
initial velocity,

720
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.460
go back to this x and dig Dxdt.
What do you get?

721
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.610
The XD t is Alpha blessed,
Eh,

722
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.480
you're the Alpha plus t plus Alpha minus v.

723
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.100
You're the Alpha minus t they did ever do with my answer is this evaluated at

724
00:48:52.161 --> 00:48:53.090
teak equals the zero

725
00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.890
Arctic zero 14 zero.

726
00:48:57.891 --> 00:49:01.310
Here you find x dot of zero

727
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.970
equal to Alpha plus a plus Alpha minus B.

728
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.440
So here are the two equations you need to find a and B,

729
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.970
solve these two simultaneous equations.
In other words,

730
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.720
I will tell you the initial position and I'll tell you the initial velocity

731
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:26.180
you will take.
Then this number Nolan and that number known,

732
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.270
these are linear,
simultaneous equation for a and B.

733
00:49:29.271 --> 00:49:33.590
You fiddle around in Salford NB,
yes.

734
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:40.490
Ah No.
We have to ask the following question
in this problem.

735
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.940
If everything is real.

736
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:48.290
See previously what happened is when I took the complex conjugate of this

737
00:49:48.291 --> 00:49:49.124
function,

738
00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.660
the kind to get turned in and the other function and the kind you get at that

739
00:49:53.661 --> 00:49:57.050
function turned back into this one.
That's why a and B were related by complex.

740
00:49:57.051 --> 00:50:00.380
My education here,
if I take the complex conjugate of x,

741
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.100
either the Alpha plasty,
if it's real domains itself,

742
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:08.090
so eight this goes into a star vehicles in the beast star and you want the

743
00:50:08.091 --> 00:50:11.630
answer to be on chain.
That requires a started be,
it could be stuff.

744
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.680
Thanks for pointing out that here we do want a equal to a star and be equal to B

745
00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:21.084
stuff.

746
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:27.730
So what I'm telling you is go take the solution conjugated and equated to itself

747
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:33.560
at remember that now that is exponential remains real to begin with.

748
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.050
So it doesn't go into anything remains itself.

749
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.640
And I compared this exponential before and after its coefficient that went from

750
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:45.410
a to a star.
They have to be equal.
So asa starting BSB store?
Yes.
Why?

751
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.740
Well look at these functions.
There is no complex numbers here.

752
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.450
That's why everything is real.

753
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.740
So what problems have I solved?
No.

754
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.910
First I put gamma equal to zero,
no friction.

755
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.240
And I just read the drive,
the harmonic oscillator.

756
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:14.980
Casa may got the minus five plus five then I took a problem with friction.

757
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:20.580
Then I got a solution that will just exponentially falling because even though

758
00:51:20.581 --> 00:51:23.100
it looks like Alpha plus,
that's a negative number.
That's a negative number.

759
00:51:23.101 --> 00:51:25.320
In the end,
both are falling.
So they will you,

760
00:51:25.321 --> 00:51:29.550
it says you pulled the mass and let it go.
It'll relax to its initial position.

761
00:51:29.551 --> 00:51:34.500
It'll stop.
But all of you must know that there's got to be something in between.

762
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:41.040
The one case,
have a mass that isolates whatever other cases have a mass.

763
00:51:41.041 --> 00:51:42.300
When I pull it out,
let it go,

764
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.590
goes back to the equilibrium and Rita's zero I'd infinite time,

765
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.940
but we all know that the real situation you run into all the time,

766
00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.350
when you pull something,
let it go,
it vibrates and vibrates less than,
less than,

767
00:51:55.351 --> 00:51:59.070
less than,
less than,
than eventually comes to rest.
Where does that solution,

768
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:05.950
it's got to come out of this thing.
Yes,
that's correct.

769
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:07.780
So you've got to go back to the roots.

770
00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:12.781
I found four Alpha minus gamma over to less than minus square root of a gamma

771
00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:18.190
over to square minus Omega,
Not Square.

772
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:21.040
I had taken GAM over to to be bigger than Omega,
not.

773
00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.180
So what I did was I turned on friction.
What?

774
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:26.950
I didn't turn on a small amount of friction.

775
00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.810
I turned on a rather hefty amount of friction so that the friction term was

776
00:52:31.811 --> 00:52:33.100
bigger than the Omega Nocturia.

777
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:37.660
But if you imagine the other limit where you had no friction in a turn on a tiny

778
00:52:37.661 --> 00:52:38.530
amount of friction,

779
00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:43.240
then the tiny gam over two will be smarter than this Omega not of course,

780
00:52:43.241 --> 00:52:46.600
then you've got the square root of a negative number,
right?

781
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:50.710
So you should really write it as a less take gam over to less than omega.

782
00:52:50.711 --> 00:52:53.850
Not then you will write this as minus gamma or were too.

783
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:58.480
But I said minus I
famous Omega Notch,

784
00:52:58.481 --> 00:53:01.450
square minus demo worked this way.
In other words,

785
00:53:01.451 --> 00:53:05.410
write this stuff inside as minus of this number now

786
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.670
and take the square root of minus one and write it as I.

787
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:22.100
So now what are the solutions look like?
They look like x equal to

788
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:28.690
a even minus GAM over to,
uh,

789
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.980
let me write the exponential.
They feel like a

790
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.250
either the minus GAM over to

791
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:41.010
t plus I will make up prime t,

792
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:44.190
but I'm going to call this combination as Omega prime.

793
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:48.840
That's why we at Omega not,
and I'll make up right
bless.

794
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.620
Be heated.
The minus GAM over two

795
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.770
minus Iomega plain tea.

796
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:01.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

797
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:05.450
<v 0>Oh,
eat at the minus gamma.
Gamma t over two is common to both the factors.</v>

798
00:54:05.451 --> 00:54:06.380
You can pull it out.

799
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.610
Imagine pulling this factored out common to the whole expression.

800
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.680
Then you just got to aid the Iomega prime plus B,
the minus Iomega frame.

801
00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.590
That's a pretty family or problem.
If you want that to be real,

802
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.020
you want a to be equal,
the complex conjugate of B.

803
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.870
Then you repeat everything I did before,

804
00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:26.870
so I don't want to do that one more time.
You will get some numbers.

805
00:54:26.871 --> 00:54:31.280
See spending either the miners gam over to t times square,

806
00:54:31.281 --> 00:54:34.550
sine omega prime t plus.

807
00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.740
You're can add a fi.
Good.
Nice.
Yeah.

808
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.983
<v 1>Okay,</v>

809
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:49.430
<v 0>so what does this look like?
What does this graph look like?</v>

810
00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:53.030
It looks like Casa Omega t,
but it's got this thing in the front.

811
00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.590
If gamma vanishes,
then forget the exponential completely.

812
00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.280
This is about oscillating mass.
If gamma is Sonata Zito,

813
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:06.490
imagine there's one part in 10,000 then for the first one second,

814
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.310
this number will hardly changed from one.
Meanwhile,

815
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:14.810
this word of oscillators some number of times,
but if you wait long enough,

816
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:17.150
this exponential rate start coming into play,

817
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:22.390
and the way to think about it is it's an oscillation who's amplitude itself

818
00:55:22.791 --> 00:55:26.570
falls with time.
And if you draw a picture of that,

819
00:55:26.571 --> 00:55:30.440
I think you will not be surprised that if you dry the picture didn't look like

820
00:55:30.441 --> 00:55:33.360
this.
It's called a damped oscillation.

821
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:42.500
So that's the method by which you describe the three cases.

822
00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.920
One is no friction and one is small friction or friction obeying this condition.

823
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:53.810
When you have oscillatory motion,
who's amplitude damped with time,

824
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:59.950
then you have the other case where gamma is crossed some threshold than Omega,

825
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:04.040
naught,
smaller than gamma over too.
Then you get to falling exponentials.

826
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:08.920
So what do you imagine the mass is doing with no friction?
If you pull it,

827
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.230
let it go white British forever.
That's not very realistic.

828
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.710
If you're trying a tiny amount of friction,
it will do this,

829
00:56:15.711 --> 00:56:17.810
which is very ubiquitous.
We see it all the time.

830
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.650
You pull a swing and you let it go.
After awhile it comes to rest.

831
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:25.900
This tells you never quite comes to rest because as long as the is finite,

832
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.480
this number is going to be non zero,

833
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:31.010
but it'll be very small at some point you just cannot see it.

834
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:36.430
Third option is over debt.
Over damped is when gamma is bigger than Omega,

835
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:41.431
naught over to then the asset is nothing that oscillates nothing oscillates.

836
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.660
Everything falls exponentially with time.

837
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.810
Daddy should imagine you pull something,
let it go.

838
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.390
It comes slowly and stops.

839
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.310
When you buy your shocks in your car,
the shock absorbers,

840
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.820
they're supposed to damp the vibration of the car.
It's got a spring,

841
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:02.560
but this suspending the tires,
but it's emerged in some viscous medium,

842
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.860
so that is vibration.
Variations adapt.
So when you hit a bump,

843
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.630
if your shocks are dead,

844
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.890
you vibrate a lot of time and slowly settle down that veneer shock set in this

845
00:57:11.891 --> 00:57:15.730
region when you bought them David and this ratio,

846
00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.880
when you bought them,
they were doing this.
Once you hit a bump in,

847
00:57:18.881 --> 00:57:20.530
you overshoot from your normal position,

848
00:57:20.531 --> 00:57:24.470
you come down to zero and you stay there.
Yes,

849
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.230
that's the ideal situation for damp.

850
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:35.920
All right,
so I'm going to the last topic in isolation,

851
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:40.720
but is there anything else?
Is there anything here that you need clarification?

852
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.030
<v 2>Yes.
Ah,
yes.</v>

853
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:52.430
<v 0>So Ben Gamla were two equals Omega not this thing vanishes.</v>

854
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:58.040
And you seem to have only one solution,
uh,
either the minus gamma t over to

855
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.280
you don't have the plus or minus.
Right.

856
00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:05.150
And we sort of knowing every problem that must be to solutions because we should

857
00:58:05.151 --> 00:58:07.730
be able to pick the initial position and velocity at will.

858
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:12.560
If a solution is only one free parameter,
you cannot pick two numbers at will.

859
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:16.400
No,
that's the piece of mathematics I don't want to do now.

860
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.380
But what you can show us in that case,

861
00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.800
the second solution looks like this.

862
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:27.320
It's a new function,
not an exponential but tee times than exponential.

863
00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.610
We'll solve the equation,
uh,

864
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:33.200
those who want to see that this is true can put that into the equation and check

865
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:37.760
other words.
Pick your gamma carefully so that the square root vanishes.

866
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:42.020
Only a gamma is left.
But that gamma is not independent of Omega.

867
00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:46.790
That gamma is equal to a two omega not for that problem.

868
00:58:46.791 --> 00:58:49.480
You can check that.
That's the solution.
So is that

869
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.910
that a nice waste and more debate that,

870
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.890
but I think I will don't have time to do that.

871
00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:56.143
<v 2>Yes.</v>

872
00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:04.140
<v 0>Why was the equal a start here?
I mean here.
Okay.</v>

873
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:09.040
Take this x demand that when you conjugate it,
nothing should happen.
Okay.

874
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:15.110
In this particular example,
when Alpha plus Alpha minus the real numbers here,

875
00:59:15.111 --> 00:59:17.640
the Alpha plasty remains EDF publicity.

876
00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:22.641
When you take you get that four h has to a star and be must also remain

877
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:27.410
invariant when you take the conjugation.
In other words,

878
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:31.130
if this was an imaginary exponential like in the other problem and you take the

879
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:32.063
conjugate,

880
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.510
this exponential becomes this guy in that exponential becomes that guy.

881
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.450
Then by matching the solution you can,
you will be able to show,

882
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:41.600
this must be the kind of get of that.
That must be the kind to get at this,

883
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:46.400
but if no imaginary exponentials appear each term a separately be real.

884
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.480
Now this is something you will have to think about.

885
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:52.700
I'm not saying maybe repeating it makes it any clearer,

886
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.320
so what I want you to do is take the x,
take the complex conjugate of x,

887
00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.520
equate the two sites.

888
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.840
That's the rule among functions that if you've got either the plus Alpha t,

889
01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:04.251
it's called vision.

890
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:08.390
Matt should match on both sides and even the minus Alpha t should have Matthew

891
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:12.080
corporations.
It's like saying when to have actors of equal.

892
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.620
The Coefficient of I should match in the coefficient of deer should match.

893
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:19.370
There's a similar theorem that if you take a summer of two independent functions

894
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.250
equated to some or to other in the same independent functions,

895
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.310
the coefficient must separately maths.
If you impose that,

896
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:29.210
you will find what I told you.
Okay.

897
01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:31.820
Now for the really interesting problem,

898
01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:36.440
really interesting problem is this,
I got the mass,

899
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.350
I got the spring,
I got the fiction,

900
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:44.450
but I'm going to apply an extra force f not cosine,
Omega t

901
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:50.390
this Scott,
a driven oscillator.
So far,
the oscillator that was not driven,

902
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:54.350
in other words,
no one is pushing and pulling it.
If you,

903
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.500
of course you pulled it in the beginning and you released it,

904
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:59.360
but once you released it,
no one's touching the oscillator,

905
01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:03.260
the only forces on it or due to internal frictional forces or spring force.

906
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:09.010
But now I want to imagine a case where I am actively driving the oscillator by

907
01:01:09.231 --> 01:01:12.650
my hand exerting a costly and Omega t force.

908
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:18.950
So Omega here is the frequency of the driving force.

909
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.690
Okay?
That's where that has so many Omegas in this problem.

910
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:28.310
The Omega Prime that you saw here,
it's not going to appear too many times.

911
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.730
It's a matter of convenience to call this Omega prime,
but this will make,

912
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:35.510
I will up here all the time when I write an Omega with no subscript is the

913
01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:40.511
frequency of the driving force and the equation we want to solve is x

914
01:01:40.521 --> 01:01:44.300
double.plus Gamma X.
Dot.

915
01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.670
Plus Omega nod squared,

916
01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:51.700
x equals f over em because I divided everything by am of course,

917
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.173
Saint Omega t

918
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:55.933
<v 1>yeah,</v>

919
01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.480
<v 0>so we've got to solve this problem.</v>

920
01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:07.900
No,
this is really difficult because you cannot get the answer to this by word

921
01:02:07.901 --> 01:02:11.580
problem.
No,
you can do the following.

922
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:16.620
If the right hand side had been eat the Iomega tea instead of costing me got
the,

923
01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:20.070
you'd be fine because you can pick an x.

924
01:02:20.071 --> 01:02:23.910
They look like either the Iomega t than men you take to deliver this to look

925
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:27.130
like the Omega t one day to look like Edi,
mega t exit,

926
01:02:27.131 --> 01:02:30.630
exit a look like Udi Omega t.
You can cancel it on both sides,

927
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.760
but what you have is costs Omega t
so here just what people do.

928
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.000
It's a very clever trick.
People say,

929
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.620
let me manufacture a second problem.
Nobody gave me this problem.
Okay,

930
01:02:43.621 --> 01:02:46.500
this is the problem you gave me.
I make up a new problem.

931
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.630
The answer to with is called why.

932
01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:52.873
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

933
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.800
<v 0>but why is the answer to the falling problem?</v>

934
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.830
The driving force is sine Omega t

935
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:03.570
this is what you give me

936
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:06.623
salt.

937
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.130
This is my artifact.

938
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.890
I introduced a new problem you did not give me,

939
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:18.770
but I want to look at this problem.
No,

940
01:03:18.771 --> 01:03:23.210
here's the trick.
You multiply this equation,

941
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.020
but any number is still going to satisfy the question.

942
01:03:27.021 --> 01:03:30.390
Let me multiply by what am I here,
put an I here,

943
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.470
put an I here than I here.

944
01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:37.330
Multiply both sides by and add them.

945
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:47.030
Then I have got x plus y double.plus Gamma at times X.

946
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.730
Dot.
Plus I.
Dot is Omega Notch quit and x plus y,
y.

947
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.740
Let's introduce a number Z which is x plus y.
It varies with time.

948
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.961
That is the question.

949
01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:02.961
By adding the tweak question look like z double dark plus Gamma Z.

950
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:07.310
Dot.
Let's Omega Not Square.
Z is f what?

951
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.380
M e to the I omega.
T

952
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:23.540
so I've manufactured a problem in which the thing that's vibrating is not a real

953
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:28.800
number.
The force driving it is also not a real number.

954
01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.410
It's the cause of Omega t plus Ice Sine Omega t,

955
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:37.520
but if I can solve this problem by some trick at the end,

956
01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.020
what do I have to do?

957
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.330
I have to take the real part of the answer because the answer will look like a

958
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:49.080
real part and an imaginary part.
I left her dump the imaginary part.

959
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.850
That'd be the answer to the question I posed.
Imaginary partner,

960
01:04:53.851 --> 01:04:57.570
but you put the answer to the fictitious bus question I post.
Now,

961
01:04:57.571 --> 01:05:00.750
why am I doing this?
The reason is the following.

962
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:05.250
If the driving forces eat the Iomega tea,
I can make the following.

963
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:06.900
Anzar said guests z,

964
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.530
some constant fames eat the I Omega t

965
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.270
I will show you.

966
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:18.270
Now solutions of this form do exist because let me take that assumed form and

967
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:21.940
put it into this equation.
Then what do I get?

968
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.570
I get minus Omega,

969
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:28.090
Square Z,

970
01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:32.170
not either the Iomega t because to deliver this of Edi,

971
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:36.190
Omega t give me Iomega Times Iomega then one day,

972
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:41.191
what is it gives me iomega times gamma timesi not eat the Iomega t and no

973
01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.260
derivatives just leaves it alone.

974
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.920
If the Iomega t equals f not over m the Iomega t

975
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.850
so let me rewrite this as follows.

976
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:03.430
Let me rewrite this as minus Omega Square.

977
01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.660
Let's I Omega Gamma Omega Notch Square,

978
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:13.580
I am z not eat the Iomega t is f over m either the Iomega t

979
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:21.220
this is what I want to be true.
Well,
Eddi,
Omega,
t,
whatever it is,

980
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:25.540
can be canceled on two sides because it is not zero.
Anything that's not zero,

981
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:29.050
you can always cancel and here is the interesting result.

982
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:32.920
You learn for this equation to be valid.

983
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:34.661
The Z,

984
01:06:34.661 --> 01:06:39.310
not that you pick here in your guests satisfies the condition.

985
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.830
Z not equals f over m divided by

986
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.160
Megan r squared minus Omega,
square,
bless,
Iomega gamma.

987
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.700
No parts of it may be easy.
Parts of it may be difficult.

988
01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.260
Easy part is to take the guests I met and sticking with the equation,

989
01:07:10.261 --> 01:07:12.090
cancel exponentials and get the answer.

990
01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:17.400
What you should understand is x was what I was looking for.

991
01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:21.220
I brought in a partner why and I solve forZ ,
which is exposite.

992
01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.790
Y andZ was assumed to take this form

993
01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.860
with the amplitude with itself could be complex times either the Iomega,

994
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.680
t z not it looks like this.

995
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:39.130
Then the Z with the z not eat of the Iomega t looks like f over m.

996
01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:46.310
If the Iomega t divided by this number in the denominator I'm going to call.

997
01:07:46.311 --> 01:07:47.660
I put impedance,

998
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.350
I it's called impedance

999
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:58.190
and there's the falling complex number or make an r squared minus Omega Square

1000
01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.310
plus I Omega Gamma.

1001
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:12.720
Okay.
We're almost done now,
so,

1002
01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.053
<v 1>okay.</v>

1003
01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:18.890
<v 0>TheZ looks like</v>

1004
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.480
f not over m e to the I Omega t divided by this complex number.

1005
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.890
I imagine this complex number I,
what does it look like?

1006
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.610
It's got a real part and an imaginary part.

1007
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.800
Imaginary part is I Omega Gamma.
The l part is Omega,

1008
01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:42.410
not square minus Omega Square.

1009
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.570
This is the complex number I

1010
01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:53.830
are told the answer to our problem is to find this number Z.

1011
01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:55.570
Then take the real part.

1012
01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:01.720
Everybody agreed that every complex number I get better than this is absolute

1013
01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:06.250
value times either the I fight five,
we're just going to be here.

1014
01:09:09.570 --> 01:09:10.403
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1015
01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:14.190
<v 0>and I'm going to write it that way because now things become a lot simpler if</v>

1016
01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:18.580
you write it that way.
If not over em,
they were the absolute value of I,

1017
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:23.090
you'd the Ifi,
the Iomega t

1018
01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:26.910
now this eat the Ifi.

1019
01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:31.680
I can delete it here and put it upstairs as minus Ifi.

1020
01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.970
So let me write it in that form.

1021
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Then it's very easy if not over m divided by the magnitude of this I times e to

1022
01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:47.710
the I Omega t minus five.

1023
01:09:48.190 --> 01:09:49.023
<v 1>Okay</v>

1024
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.610
<v 0>but I use this angle,
well now that I got Z,</v>

1025
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.900
I know how to find x.
X is the real part of Z.

1026
01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.220
No.
When I look at real pot,
all these are real numbers.

1027
01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:06.410
I will keep them as they are if not over m divided by eye.

1028
01:10:07.090 --> 01:10:11.260
The real part of this function I hope you know by now it's cost to make a t

1029
01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:12.843
minus five

1030
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.093
and that's the answer.

1031
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:26.780
The answer to the problem that had originally given to us is the following.

1032
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:30.830
You know the magnitude of the applied force,
the amplitude of the applied force,

1033
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:32.060
you know the mass of the particle.

1034
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:36.440
You need to find this absolute value of ion fi for that.

1035
01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:39.190
You construct this complex number whose real parties,

1036
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.020
this was imaginary part is Iomega Gamma

1037
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:48.580
than the absolute value of it is just by Pythagoras Theorem or r squared minus

1038
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.460
Omega squared squared.

1039
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.960
Plus we'll make a squid gamma square

1040
01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:03.540
and the phase fi or B is the condition 10 fi musical to Omega gamma divided by

1041
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:10.870
we're going to get an r squared minus Omega Squared Square [inaudible] Square,

1042
01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.720
Gamma Square.
I'm sorry.
Uh,

1043
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.520
it's just the imaginary part over real part.

1044
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.750
So this is the answer to the problem that was given to us,

1045
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:34.080
but there's one side point you should notice which is the following.

1046
01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:36.900
What are the three parameters in this problem?

1047
01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:44.060
Everything is determined in this problem,
fi absolute I all this unknown,

1048
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:47.420
but we know every equation should have two,
three numbers.
You know what they are?

1049
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:54.080
Anybody all,
okay,

1050
01:11:54.081 --> 01:11:56.660
let me tell you what the answer to that question is.

1051
01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.480
I'm saying I can add to this.

1052
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:05.150
The solution I got earlier on without the driving force

1053
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:11.720
because in this problem when I had the right hand side with a driving force,

1054
01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:15.020
let me add a zero to that.
That's harmless.

1055
01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.190
And by superposition principle,
if that force is produced,

1056
01:12:19.191 --> 01:12:23.810
that displacement zero will produce,
what would we have seen all morning?

1057
01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:25.320
That even when the right hand side,

1058
01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:29.300
the zero that are the solutions they got for you,
either the GAM over to,

1059
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:30.560
because omega,
prime,
t,

1060
01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:35.300
etc. So you can always add to this what's called a complimentary function,

1061
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:38.750
which is the solution of the equation with no driving force,

1062
01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.480
which is what we were studying earlier in the class.

1063
01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:47.390
But usually people don't bother with this because they all have in them either

1064
01:12:47.391 --> 01:12:51.470
the minus gamma t over two.
So if you wait long enough,

1065
01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.400
this will die out.
This is the only thing that will remain

1066
01:12:57.150 --> 01:13:01.520
so early times.
This is not the full answer.
You should add to this,

1067
01:13:01.521 --> 01:13:03.320
the answer to when there's no driving force.

1068
01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:09.730
And together they formed the full answer and the number's a and B that you have.

1069
01:13:10.101 --> 01:13:14.390
There will be chosen to match some initial conditions like initial position,

1070
01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:18.580
initial velocity.
Okay,

1071
01:13:18.581 --> 01:13:20.920
now it's time is up.
I'm going to stop.

1072
01:13:20.921 --> 01:13:25.030
So I have not been able to finish some parts of this,

1073
01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.360
so I'm trying to see what I can do.
Uh,

1074
01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:32.500
I had asked for you to give this problem set to me on Noah.

1075
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:37.120
What is this today on Wednesday,
right?
So you don't have enough time.
I mean,

1076
01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.620
I haven't taught you a few other things.

1077
01:13:38.621 --> 01:13:41.470
You need about five minutes more of works.
I don't want to keep you back.

1078
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.910
Here's what I will do.

1079
01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:48.210
I will post on the website some notes on just the missing part here so you can

1080
01:13:48.221 --> 01:13:50.620
read it and you can do one or two problems.

1081
01:13:50.621 --> 01:13:52.120
You may not be able to do without that.

1082
01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.290
Then I will come on Wednesday and I will teach that to you again,

1083
01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:57.910
but you'll be able to hand in your problems.
