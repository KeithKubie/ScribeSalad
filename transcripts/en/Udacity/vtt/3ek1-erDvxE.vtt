One thing I'd like to expose you really quickly is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.260
RSS, you've probably heard of RSS before. It's how you

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.930
read a website that has, you know, daily content, you

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.710
know, like a blog or a news site and you may

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.260
have a reader that is specialized for just reading the content. RSS stands for

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.210
RDF Site Summary, and, RDF stands for Resource Description Framework. Now

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.230
I'm not going to quiz you on this, RDF is, is an XML format for describing just

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.760
about anything. For basically representing knowledge in XML actually

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.692
in my first job I dealt with a lot of

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:33.900
RDF so, I don't want to spend any more

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.247
time on it. More commonly, RSS actually refers to Really

00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:39.956
Simple Syndication and that's kind of more of more

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.539
of the context of how we're going to be dealing with

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.647
it. You know, RDF was kind of conceived to solve

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:50.667
this grand data, you know, organize the world's information problems.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:55.010
And RSS was, you know, it uses RDF but really, its

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.586
just a list of, a list of content in XML. So

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:00.334
let me show you some more example of this in the

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:02.933
wild. I'm at the New York Times home page right now,

00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.057
and if we go down to the bottom of this page,

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:07.653
we'll see a link for RSS, so I'll click that link,

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:11.670
and I'll choose the New York Times global home page. Now,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.840
you can see in our URL, we have GlobalHome.xml. And so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.820
we've received an XML document. And most browsers will

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.798
actually display XML in a nice way. So, this

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:26.240
is an XML document. It's actually an RSS. And

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.770
so, what this basically means is there's a, a particular

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.400
namespace, kind of a tag space if you will,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.650
for the items in this list. You know, just

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.870
like HTML has, you know, opens with an HTML

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.040
and has a body and, you know, very specific tags.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.730
An RSS document will also, has specific tags. And

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.050
in XML, you can use as header area, to describe

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.526
what name spacing's used. So were using the atom

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:56.630
name space, and the RSS 2.0 name space. And that's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.820
basically what this is telling our parser, is you

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.400
can download a kind of descriptions of these tags from

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.660
these URLs. And then we know what tags to expect.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.130
We're not going to, I'm not going to quiz you on what

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.449
RSS actually is, so if you take a, a little peak at this

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.610
document, you can see it starts out with some header stuff kind of in

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.870
this channel section and then when we get down to this list of items.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.270
And so I'm going to collapse these first few and we can see we've got

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.260
an item and this is basically just a list of stories that are

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.360
in the New York times. So I can collapse and item and we can

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.040
see if there is another item. There's actually a whole bunch of items. And

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.300
each item has, you know, a title, and a link, and sorts of things

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.240
that you know, would power an RSS reader. You know, a little description.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.830
You know, this is, this is neat. This is for an RSS reader,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.560
or a program to download the contents of the New York Times without

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.700
having to parse all the HTML. Which brings us to our next quiz.
