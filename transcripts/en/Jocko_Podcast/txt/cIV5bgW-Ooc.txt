Speaker 1:          00:00          My wife and kids are quick to anger. Sometimes it's explosive like the Moab mother of all bombs. Other times it's a slow grinding war of attrition. Being a student of your podcasts, I've learned the worst strategy is to directly attack there four to fight emotional position. It seems like this is a good opportunity to employ the flanking maneuver. How do I effectively flank their anger without appearing weak? Okay, first of all, flank yourself cause that appearing weak thing. That's pretty much in your head really. It is slow generally in your head and that's the first thing you need to do is that's your ego talking when you don't want to, when you don't want to, when they hit you with something that they're angry at, the thing that's hitting back his ego, that's what's hitting back. So first thing you gotta do is, okay, I'm going to check my ego right now cause I'm going to win the long war.

Speaker 1:          00:51          In fact, you have to be careful when you stay calm, when everyone else is angry. You have to actually be careful not to come across as aloof or you know, arrogant. Yeah, yeah. Like when people are getting mad. Okay. Okay. For instance, if your wife is super mad about something and you show no emotions and you don't get mad at all, they get matter sometimes, right? Yeah. You don't even care about this, you know, so no, no. So you got up, you got to give a little bit. You know, I'm not saying it a little bit of hey I get it. Right, but then which one do is absorb? Oh they want to get mad. Cool. Absorb. Take the screaming, give the head nod of understanding in a more only marginally emotional way. That pretty much communicates that. I understand you're mad and I'm, I'm listening and I hear you.

Speaker 1:          01:43          You know I get it. And let them get it out of their system. This, let them get an honors system. Then let them calm down. And then after you've given them the time to kind of calm down and settle down and I mean it's a longer than you think. It's longer than you think. Let them let, let when you think they're calm, wait an extra 45 minutes if not two hours, probably two hours. Cause they're not called to be safe. They just stopped screaming. Right. They're all so, and then what you do is, and then what you do is you kind of take it on yourself. You're going to own it, right? And you say something like, Hey, you know that thing that made you mad. I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. Right. You don't walk. What can I do better to make sure that you don't get mad about that.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Right. You take, you take ownership of that. What do I need to adjust and what exactly is it that, that I did that frustrated. What is it that frustrates you? What can I do to stop it? Maybe it wasn't me. Maybe you're mad at the printer, but you know, how can we fix that? Because I don't want you to do. And then you know, so you have the, that kind of conversation and you know, you're going to slide something tactfully and their tactfully because again, you're still dealing with like, you know, possible flare up scenarios happening. So you know, but you, but you say something like that, you know, we both know that nobody benefits when people lose their temper. Right? I mean, we gotta be careful, you know, no one, it's not, it doesn't do us any good when people lose their temper, we, everyone knows that.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Right? So you slide those things in there. You're given that kind of like a little mini lecture indirectly about what's happening. And then when you have other conversations, now we're in just a normal day to day thing. You drop things about temper, you know, you talk about temporary being, well, you know, it's a weakness and it's no one makes good decisions when they have, when they lose their temper, everything. So some of the dumbest things I've ever done was when I logged, you know, everyone knows that you see, you start sliding those things in there that it's bad for your decision making. It's bad for relationships, it's bad for your health, it's bad for life. And again, you're not directly saying these things. You're subliminally saying even, you know, it's man, I remember one time I lost him. This little dumbest things I ever did when I lost my temper and I kicked the wall and I broke my toe and I put a hole in the wall and the landlord came.

Speaker 1:          03:59          I, that's when I, I hate when I lose my temper. And you start getting them in the, even thinking about it over time, and this is the thing, it's a long war and there's going to be relapses along the way, but you got to just hold the line, keep it steady, absorb and then f flank gently to get them to start self recognizing where they're at and what their temper does. Tone tempers crazy. Yeah. And you see people lose their temper. It's, it's a total loss of control. Yeah. It's a total loss control and it's just doesn't do anybody any good. And when you see someone that really loses their temper, you're like, what is wrong? Come on. Yeah. And when I was a kid and I used to lose my temper and at some point I just realized, I forget what it was. I forget what made me think there was something my dad said to me, there's something about, you know, something along those lines of like, yeah, you lose your temper.

Speaker 1:          05:03          It's like a little baby. Oh, loss of control. Okay. So you, you, when you realized it, that's because of something your dad, my dad said to me something along the lines of like, you know, I think he was referring to an athlete or something, someone that just had no emotions and how that was impressive. Yeah. And I was like, hmm, that is impressive. Massive control one, nothing is going to make me mad. Yeah. Doesn't matter what's going on around me. Yeah. Yeah. It is like a baby, you know, like I said, you know, like babies, they cry and they whatever, cause they don't know how to talk. So if they knew how to talk and control everything, just be like, Hey, I'm colt. Or Hey, I'm hungry. But they didn't know how to talk. So why do adults go crazy and cry because their babies, because they don't know how to talk if they, if they kind of for every little thing, they're babies. Yeah. They don't know how to talk. I said, actually, you know what under, um, and it depends. That depends how much controlling in all these little variables, but it's

Speaker 2:          05:58          like the front part of your brain that's a decision making like the conscious like okay, I'm going to make this dis this conscious decision, right? Which is the last part of your brain to develop that way. And it's like a conscious decision making by the front, the like frontal lobe Cortex, you know, something like this. And it happens and it fully develops around age 25 by the way. So if you're (242) 032-0220 one at all. And so put simply, it's like, okay, my actions now how do they affect the future? You know? So in one way or another, it's going to be kind of surrounded on that little premise, small little pro. So otherwise you're just going on straight auto mode, however you, however you feel that's going to influence, not totally control, but that's the thing that's going to influence your behaviors. So Times of stress, your frontal cortex start to shut down a little bit.

Speaker 2:          06:44          Hunger shut down a little bit. Uh, hormonal situations for guys and girls. Oh, so you lose your temper more. That's where angry comes from. Hangry is one of them, you know, and it's like all these things, loss, empathy, loss of like all this stuff where your decisions just aren't that dope. Yeah. And so, and when I say hormonal, like that's why you get roid rage. You don't look good. Cause like guys, if they're on steroids, that's their hormones are up. Or girls pms scene. It's like a real, you know, premenstrual syndrome. It's like a road. Their hormones are all still, I remember one time my wife started when she was pregnant, she started crying during an 18 and t commercial. Like legit. I was like, oh my gosh, what's wrong with her? Some of those are kind of sad, emotional nonetheless there. Why were you crying during Hawaii? Five O oh man.

Speaker 2:          07:39          I'm telling you. They're trying, they're trying to make it deep man, that show you're watching him. Nadise anyway, nonetheless. Um, it's back to losing your temper and stuff. It is a week thing. So it's kind of obvious, especially from the outside, to see that look, this losing your temper is not cool. And a lot of people, they think it's cool because it feels good. It feels good when you're a little kid, you respect it because you see someone lose their temper, you, you scared. It's like turning into superman. Right? [inaudible] mean he's feared, but right. You're not feared by you look stupid. Yes. If that's the message to convey to your kiss. Yeah. Losing your temper. Stupid. Yeah. And Man, some people there, you could tell they say that stuff with a little bit of pride, you know, it's just me and my temporary tempers going to get me in trouble and they're all like, yeah, you're not proud.

Speaker 2:          08:26          I'm a dead man. That's like me. That should be the guy I wish I didn't. That should be, if you say, Hey, I just have a temper, that should be the equivalent of you saying, I don't know how to read it should be that, hey, nothing wrong with it. You can get past it and you know, whatever. I'm not going to judge you for it, but it's not good. It's not a good state to be in boot. Someone who can't control your temper, just like it's not a good state to be in as a grown adult to not know how to read no judgment, but you solve that problem. That's a B. If you're having like if your kids have a temper and they're easy to anger, it's because chances are I don't know everybody of course, but chances are they got it from the parents.

Speaker 2:          09:08          Keep in mind you're one of those parents. I'm not saying, I'm not saying that you have a temper, I'm not saying you don't, but I am seeing sure kids have a temper. Your wife as a temporary, you got it. Really honestly, evaluate. Do I have a temper and understand that cause the kids, they're just these little seeds of beings who are like, hey, how do I act? I don't know how to act all act, how you know just how I feel. I'm going to cry. This is my default. I'm just going to cry when something's right. So you're saying that for the parents have a temper and show that knack, that way the kids will learn it from them. You're going to learn it. So there is some theory or something like genetic though I thought, well maybe I guess it could. We don't know if it's genetic or not, but there are some where you know the father has a bad temper and then the kid has a bad temper.

Speaker 2:          09:52          Yeah, temper gene. So what it is is there's the genetic situation for sure at that you're more apt to not be able to control certain parts of, or not not be able to control but control less. You know, certain parts of your brain or chemistry is going to make you lean towards certain types of behavior, like impulsive behavior or something like that. There is that for sure. But again, man, when you're a kid, you're just looking for how do I act? I don't know. I'm growing up. I don't even know how to act. So the first thing you're going to look at is the people, the Authority figures in front of you, the parents. If the parents aren't there, who are they looking to? I don't know. The guy next door, the guy on TV, the guy up the street, the guy in the music video, whoever. I don't know. Whoever's doing better than me. That's it. So if you're the parent and you're losing your temper all the time, kids going to lose their temper. That's how, what? They're going to learn how to act. So point there is if you lose your temporary or if your kids are losing the Internet, you start with yourself because you know the crime,

Speaker 2:          10:59          you know, kind of, there's certain things that's real easy to see when someone else does it or yeah, most things. But yeah. But it's really, yeah. You simply don't see, it sounds like this guy here that asks this question, he's saying his wife loses his temper and that could be where the kid is getting that, that modeling from. Right, right. And he's saying he doesn't. Now is there a chance that he does to private? I guess so. But it sounds like he's pretty together and he's saying, look, I just need to get them to calm down. Right. So yeah, in this situation, I'd say it's probably the wife who's losing her temper and then the kid is imitating or modeling, and then we have this scenario happening. So what we need to do is explain to everyone in the family that it's not good. We're not losing our tempers anymore. They, yeah. And the reason I say it to is, again, I, I'm not saying he does lose his temper, but I am saying that it is a possibility that because if let's say mean, and your husband and wife and I bought were just bruised. Yeah. Well we're worried, you know, it's life.

Speaker 2:          11:57          Me and my wife. Okay. If she loses the temper, her temper, and I'm taking the direct approach, right? Yeah. Which I understand you're now temper more all, I'm going to lose my temper back. I'm going to go fire. I'm going to fight fire with fire. You raise your voice. I'm gonna raise my voice. The kids over there in the corner. How do I act? Oh, that's how I act right there. That's a possibility. And kids will become antisocial. That's the thing goes on. It's one of the things, one of the many things anti social, I told you about that book called Mind Games. Small little book. I forget the author like pretty clearly and concisely laid out if you have anger issues like what up with that? It's an insecurity changed my whole life. Low self esteem.
