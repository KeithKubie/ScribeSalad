MAGGIE: Hi, I'm Maggie,
and I'm looking forward

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.890
to helping you get
started on your journey

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.340
to becoming a Google Certified
Mobile Web Specialist.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.960
You start your
journey on our website

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.010
by checking the certification
requirements page.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.309
Have a look at the other content
on the site such as the FAQs,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.196
then download the study guide.

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:19.820
Use the study guide
to make sure you're

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.070
ready to take the
certification exam.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.440
The study guide describes
what the certification exam

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.080
covers and contains links
to study materials you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.210
can use to help you prepare.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.030
When you're ready, sign
up to take the exam.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.280
You'll continue on our
exam vendor's site, where

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.960
you start with a
compatibility check

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.290
to make sure that you have
the best experience possible.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.200
The compatibility check tests
that your system meets the exam

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.080
requirements for things
like your monitor resolution

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.550
and connection speed.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.460
Next, you provide
payment information

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.350
using your credit card.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.360
To validate your
identity for the exam

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.330
and to ensure that your exam
results and certification are

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.310
only attributed
to you, you upload

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.380
your government-issued
picture ID.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.080
For most countries, you
need a current passport.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.269
To make it easy, have a
clear picture of your ID

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.550
ready to upload
on your computer.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.740
Then you take a
photo of yourself.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.830
After paying for your exam, you
schedule your exam for the time

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.254
and place you plan
to take the exam.

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:16.670
You'll have four
hours to complete

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.910
the challenges, plus 10 minutes
to take the exit interview,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.650
with a short break in between.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.450
So give yourself at
least 4 to 4 and 1/2

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.460
hours to complete
the exam in a place

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.010
with a consistent
internet connection.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.900
Be sure to pick
your time carefully.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.210
If you miss your scheduled
time by more than an hour,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.540
it will count as one
of your three attempts.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.191
After you schedule, you'll
be at your candidate portal.

00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.690
This is a place
where you can always

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.930
go back to see the status
of your certification.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.330
At your scheduled exam
time, you start the exam

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.070
from your candidate portal.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.830
You'll receive an email reminder
10 minutes before your exam

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.260
time with a link to the portal.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.480
After checking your system
and connectivity one

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.660
more time, you log into
a Linux exam environment

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.790
where a desktop is waiting
for you with coding

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.092
tools such as Atom and Chrome.

00:02:01.092 --> 00:02:03.300
Read through the instructions,
and then start working

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.220
through the coding challenges.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.200
Use the editor
provided to write code,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.419
then check the
results in Chrome.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.880
You may use the internet while
taking the exam to look up

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.880
resources, but be aware that
you cannot copy and paste

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.340
into the environment
from your own browser.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.680
Although you can use the
browser provided in the exam

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.270
environment, be
careful not to copy

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.090
and paste anything that could
be construed as cheating.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.190
Be sure to always save
your work before moving

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.720
to the next challenge.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.400
If you need to start
over, each task

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.470
has a backup folder
with the original files

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.870
that you can copy to
the working folder.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.990
A timer shows you how much
time you have remaining

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.920
to help you pace yourself.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.550
If after four hours you
haven't submitted your exam,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.440
any work that you saved is
automatically submitted.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.420
Even if you stepped
away from your computer,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.070
or there was a
network interruption,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.950
as long as you saved your
files, you don't have to worry.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.710
When you're ready to submit
your exam, open the Submit page

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.240
and click Submit.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.550
After you submit your exam,
you can take a short break

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.010
before you have to start
the exit interview.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.990
You must start the exit
interview immediately

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.720
after the break, or the
interview will expire and count

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.700
as one of your exam attempts.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.200
During the exit
interview, you'll

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.710
answer questions about the exam
in a 10-minute timed interview

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.140
using your webcam
and microphone.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.700
The purpose of
the exit interview

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.920
is to ensure that your
exam results are only

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.690
attributed to you.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.070
Before you attempt
the interview,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.040
be sure to remove any personal
belongings from your workspace

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.020
to protect your privacy.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.600
Next, answer the questions
to the best of your ability,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.370
and then click Submit.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.850
The upload process may take
some time, so please be patient.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.920
If the exit interview fails
to upload after a few minutes,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.640
be sure to contact
support immediately.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.350
After submitting
your exit interview,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.940
check your candidate portal.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.836
The candidate portal
tells you how you did,

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.210
and if you did
not pass, lets you

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.425
know when you're eligible
to attempt the exam again.

00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:50.550
Thanks for listening, and
good luck on your journey

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.680
to becoming a Google Certified
Mobile Web Specialist.
