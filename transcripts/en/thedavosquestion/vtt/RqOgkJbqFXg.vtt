00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.819
&gt;&gt; The big question that I think needs to
be answered is how can we

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:14.070
provide entrepreneurial education to the poorest
of the poor?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.420
Access to education as we know it is no longer
sufficient or valid,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.019
only access to education but education that
has no quality, does not

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.970
produce any tangible results.
Many of the world's poor have access to education

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.930
and, in fact, have
been to third, sixth, ninth grade.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.430
That has not changed anything, so what we
need is more practical

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.589
entrepreneurial education to everybody.
In order to facilitate the resources to provide

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.820
this education we think
that education should pay for itself or could

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.530
pay for itself by
income-generating educational programs on

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.580
campus with teachers and with
students.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.239
But we think that if we do not do something
with quality education

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.369
right now, we will not be able to overcome
the challenges that we're

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.619
facing right now.
Thank you very much.
