00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.000
The number of people that are against vaccinating themselves and their children has surged in recent years,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.940
and it can be frustrating listening to their claims.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.100
So we wanted to debunk and deconstruct the most common arguments one by one

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.580
to help you prepare and present the facts in your next encounter with an anti-vaxxer.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.020
Argument 1: "Why I Do Not Vaccinate My Kids"

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.060
Blog Entry 189.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.400
Vaccines contain:

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.440
MSG, antifreeze, phenol, formaldehyde, aluminum, lead, and mercury.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.640
It's true; vaccines contain chemicals.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.060
Vaccines have contained mercury, aluminum, and formaldehyde.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.220
Ingredients that can be toxic; what else can be toxic?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.700
Water (given a large enough dose), and same goes for apples, coffee, or too much of anything to be honest.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.020
The dose makes the poison, and the doses of the chemicals in vaccines are negligible.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.960
For example, vaccines that include aluminum (which is included to make the vaccine more effective),

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.060
contain about 0.125 milligrams per dose.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.389
But the average person actually takes in an estimated 30-50 milligrams every day through food and drink.

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.220
That's way more than one vaccination on a daily basis.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.340
And while some people warn about the presence of mercury containing compounds like thimerosal

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.020
(a vaccine preservative to prevent bacterial growth),

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.080
it's actually been removed from almost all childhood vaccines since 2001.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.980
This was done to ease public concern, even though no literature suggests it's harmful at doses present in vaccines.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.040
Argument 2: As a granola parent, my kids get everything natural.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.980
Quinoa crackers over Ritz any day!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.420
Because can't we just all agree that the natural root is better?

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.600
So let your child's immune system develop naturally and save them a lifetime of pain.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.080
Vaccines introduce a weakened form of the germ to your body so that the immune system can learn to recognize it.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.700
Your body then build its defenses so it's prepared to fight off a real attack later.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.420
And it's true; naturally newborn babies are immune to several diseases

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.520
because of the antibodies they receive from their mother's breast milk and the thousands of germs they're exposed from the moment they're born.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.000
But vaccines cover the diseases you don't have immunity against.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.720
It's why we don't vaccinate for every single disease possible; just those which are most dangerous.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.240
And children are given shots at a young age because this is when they're at the highest risk of getting sick or dying.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.780
Argument 3: But what about allergies?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.720
My second cousin Lisa got her kids vaccinated, and now, they have a peanut allergy.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.680
I don't my baby to get allergies!

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.060
In 1997, people began to question whether there was a connect between vaccines and allergies.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.500
And then a study of 2,100 participants ages 5-6 found that vaccines actually have the opposite effect,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.520
and instead have a protective effect against allergies.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.020
Argument 4: I mean, how bad are the diseases that these vaccines are preventing anyways?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.860
My ol' sport here, stuffed like a packed sausage. Got my genes, so he's built to last!

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.460
If he got the measles, what's the worst that could happen?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.100
Vaccines have done such a good job preventing so many diseases that many generations have never seen them.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.660
But here's what these diseases looked like without vaccines:

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:12.260
In 1967 smallpox was responsible for millions of deaths. By 1980 it was completely eradicated due to an intensive vaccine campaign.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.840
Before polio vaccine was available, 13,000 to 20,000 cases of paralytic polio were reported each year in the United States.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.660
This meant thousands of children had to use braces, crutches, wheelchairs, and ventilators to breathe.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.460
From 1964-1965, before the rubella vaccine, there were 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250 miscarriages.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:41.980
And of the 20,000 born with rubella, more than half ended up deaf, over 3,000 blind, and 1,800 with mental delays.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.640
As for measles, before immunization was available, nearly everyone in the U.S. got measles because it's extremely contagious.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:58.380
The World Health Organization estimates that regular vaccination has prevented 20.4 million deaths from measles worldwide from 2010-2016.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.320
Argument 5: Okay, but you still haven't covered--

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.420
*quietly* Autism.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.420
Much of the anti-vaccination movement is linked to one paper published in the late 1990s,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.320
which claimed vaccines caused autism.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.360
It suggested a link between the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine causing malabsorption of nutrients in the gut,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.800
thereby leading to increased cases of autism in children.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:25.340
The study was later proven to be fraudulent and was debunked by 25 international research papers involving large population studies.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:33.140
Furthermore, 10 of the 13 authors of this original paper have now refuted and retracted their original statements on the suggested link.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.800
And while it's understandable that parents want to protect their kids, the claim is not founded in any evidence.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.080
Argument 6: There needs to be a balance with the government.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.640
Parents should have a measure of choice about whether or not they should vaccinate their kids.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.980
No one knows their kid better than you do. So, vaccinating your kid only affects you and your baby.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.740
This is simply not the case. Vaccines protect you, and perhaps more importantly, it helps other people.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.940
If you're not sick, you can't spread the disease to those with weaker immune systems, particularly the very young or elderly,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.860
and those who have medical conditions in which they can't be vaccinated,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.480
for example, those undergoing chemotherapy.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.640
The more people that are vaccinated, the less available real estate for the germs, meaning its spreading ability is squashed.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.960
This principle is called "herd immunity".

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.180
For the vulnerable in our society, herd immunity is their best protection.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.980
Argument 7: The NSA, the CIA, the FBI, big corporations, big pharma,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.360
The amount of drugs they've taken off the market trusting those suits is practically a death sentence.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:43.740
Pharmaceutical companies do make money from selling vaccines. One recent estimate puts the vaccine market now at $24 Billion, which is huge.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.160
But if you want to talk money, a study found that in the U.S between 1994

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.160
and 2013, vaccine created a net savings of two hundred and 95 billion in direct costs and 1.3

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.210
8 trillion in societal cost.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.200
It's true, drugs have been pulled from the market after harmful side effects came to light. However, vaccines are among the most highly regulated

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.369
substances we can put into our bodies, in part because they're given to help people, usually children as a

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.240
preventative measure, rather than a treatment.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.160
They go through

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.440
multiple phases of testing

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.160
to see if they're safe, to find the correct dose, and to see if protection against the disease actually

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.799
works. In Canada and and the U.S, it can take 10 to 25 years of testing before a vaccine is approved.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.030
And once on the market,

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.820
there's continuous monitoring of it's effects. The likelihood of a severe reaction to the MNR vaccine is

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.149
approximately 1 into 1 million, which is around ten times less likely than being killed by a lighting strike.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.220
Thank you so much to Bill and Melinda Gates

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.459
for sponsoring today's episode. This video is meant to highlight the importance of vaccines which save millions of lives every year.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.620
Vaccines are a great example of how modern medicine and technology have decreased disease for a while.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.719
It's part of the reason why the number of children who die every year has been cut by half and continues to go down.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.299
Though sometimes it's hard to feel like it, there are many reasons

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.940
why we should be optimistic about our future. This becomes pretty clear when you focus on the brilliant

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.510
scientists, dedicated individuals

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.000
and new ideas that are solving some of the world's toughest issues.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.079
Head to Gatesletter.com to learn in the annual letter from Bill and Melinda gates

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.080
why they're so optimistic about the future.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.030
Thanks for watching, and if you haven't already, go out and get your flu shot, and please, parents please just vaccinate your kids, thanks a lot.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.030
and we will see you next week. Bye.
