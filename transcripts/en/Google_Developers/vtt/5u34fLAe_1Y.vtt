00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.510
Hi, I'm Greg DeMichillie.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.760
I'm a Director of Product
Management here at Google.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.026
And I work on the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:09.400
Today, we have
some exciting news

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.140
about Compute Engine we
want to share with you.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.350
Compute Engine is Google's
virtual machine technology.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.800
It allows you to run
any type of application

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.870
you want on top of Google's
infrastructure and data

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.430
centers.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.880
Now, the Cloud Platform
also includes App Engine,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.570
which is our platform
as a service offering

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.820
that lets you easily build and
scale web apps or mobile back

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.010
ends.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.380
We also have a variety
of storage products,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.180
from SQL to NoSQL databases.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.170
And all of these are
managed and operated

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.550
by Google using our
15 years of expertise

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.440
in building hardware and
software infrastructure.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440
And if you take it
all together, they

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.150
give you the flexibility
you need to build and deploy

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.690
virtually any type
of application.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.850
But today, we're here to
talk about Compute Engine.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.640
This is a big day
for Compute Engine

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.680
and for the Cloud
Platform, because we've

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.370
reached a new milestone.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.530
I'm excited to announce
that Compute Engine has

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.150
reached general availability.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.920
What that means is you now
have virtual machines that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.890
have the performance,
reliability, security,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.970
and scale of Google's
own infrastructure.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.410
In addition to customer
support and a high monthly SLA,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.300
this milestone represents
our internal and external

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.760
commitment to the service
and to delivering to you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.940
a great developer experience.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.900
We have over 1,000
engineers working

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.500
on continuing to make
the cloud platform better

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.100
for Google itself and
for you, our customers.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.990
Now, before we go too far
in looking at new features

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.070
that we're announcing,
let me give you

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.760
a tour of just what sort of
performance and reliability

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.400
you can expect from
Compute Engine.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.790
This is a little
app that will spawn

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.214
a number of Compute
Engine virtual machines.

00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:54.630
In this case, I'm
going to have it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.350
start 1,000 virtual machines.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.380
When I click Start, it's
using the Compute Engine APIs

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.210
to launch those
virtual machines.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.340
And it has a timer running to
keep track of how long it took.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.030
As the virtual
machines are launched,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.590
the boxes turn
from grey to green,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.070
indicating that the VM
has launched successfully.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.570
Now, this will take
a couple minutes

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.690
to launch these 1,000
virtual machines.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.700
So we're going to let
that run in the background

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.410
while I continue to
talk to you a bit.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230
Let's talk about some
of the new features

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.250
that we're announcing today.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.420
First, Compute
Engine now supports

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.580
transparent maintenance windows.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.890
What this means is that as we
do the maintenance and upgrades,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.650
whether it's software or
hardware or networking,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.010
in our data centers,
your application

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.060
continues to run unimpacted.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.200
We move your virtual
machine out of the way

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.090
while we're performing
the maintenance.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.570
You get the benefits of an
up-to-date, maintained patch

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.970
data center without having the
impact on your applications.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.060
This is available today in our
United States data centers.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.840
And we'll be rolling it
out to Europe shortly.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.080
In addition, we have
automatic restarts.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.960
This means in the event of an
unplanned event or a hardware

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.940
failure, your application will
restart as quickly as possible.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.630
This was a commonly
requested feature

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.670
from many of our
customers, including

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.450
some of our
enterprise customers.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.840
Now, turning to
operating systems,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.040
until now we've
supported Debian and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.230
CentOS-based virtual machines.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.120
Well, today we're
opening that up.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.120
Not only can you run FreeBSD,
you can run any out-of-the-box

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.420
Linux distro.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.020
And with one click
in the admin console,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.710
you can launch SUSE or Red
Hat virtual machines directly.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.020
SUSE and Red Hat are
in limited preview.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.550
And the other Linux distros
are available today.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.540
We've also added new, more
powerful Compute Engine

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.586
instance types.

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:53.210
We know there's
customers out there who

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.210
want to run even more demanding
compute-intensive applications.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.560
So starting today, you can
launch virtual machines

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.720
with up to 16 cores.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.370
These are available in
our standard, high CPU,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.310
and high memory configurations.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.330
This means you can bring
even more demanding loads

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.270
onto Compute Engine.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.410
Now of course, app
performance isn't just

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.390
about number of
cores and memory.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.750
It also is about
disk performance.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.060
We know from talking to
customers that Persistent Disk

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.930
performance is a key factor.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.280
So starting today,
Persistent Disk

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.710
is up to eight times faster.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.180
This means you can now bring
your more I/O-intensive

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.220
and disk-intensive workloads to
Compute Engine and have a great

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.070
experience running
those as well.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.200
Now, before we go
on, let's go over

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.450
and see how those virtual
machines that we started up

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.371
are doing.

00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:44.870
Here we are.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.760
We're back.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.730
And all the boxes
have turned green,

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.500
which means all 1,000
VMs are up and running.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.790
And if we look at the time,
it was 2 minutes, 41 seconds.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.570
That's a pretty quick
way to start 1,000 VMs.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.260
So in addition to
new features, we also

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.350
continue to support major
enterprise customers.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.900
We have 24 by 7 support,
a monthly SLA of 99.95%.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.990
So you have
guarantees of uptime,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.930
as well as important
certification,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.680
such as ISO 27001
or SOC 1, 2, and 3.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.730
Finally, we're continuing
to pass on the savings

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.159
from building and operating ever
more efficient data centers.

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.700
We're also reaffirming
our commitment

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.720
to offer the best compute
price performance.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.440
We're doing that
by lowering prices

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.380
on our most popular
instance type

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.610
by 10% across the
board in all regions.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.690
We've also heard from customers
that cost predictability

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.540
and I/O performance are key
factors for Persistent Disk.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.010
So not only are we making
it eight times faster,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.710
we're making it
up to 60% cheaper.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.560
We're also eliminating
any charge for I/O.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.550
You simply purchase
the capacity you need,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.960
and you get great I/O for free.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.710
You get way more performance at
a great and predictable price.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.740
Of course, when you're
building an application,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.395
support for partners
and ISVs is critical.

00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:08.200
The ecosystem around
Compute Engine

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.130
is large and growing quickly.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.170
The software you're
familiar with, whether it's

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.030
from RightScale or Scalr,
New Relic, MapR, MongoLabs,

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.885
all runs great on
Google Cloud Platform.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.360
Google Cloud Platform gives you
the performance, reliability,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.400
scalability, and
security that we

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.060
expect from our
own applications.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.960
You can get started today with
Compute Engine and the Google

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.330
Cloud Platform.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.680
Just go to cloud.google.com,
sign up for a new account,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.350
and you can start
creating applications.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.200
One of the most fun things about
working on the Cloud Platform

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.710
is seeing the amazing apps that
you, the developers, create.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.300
So I hope you'll go out,
create some great applications,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.240
engage with us on Google+ or any
of the other social networks.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.470
We love hearing about what
you've built with the platform.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.897
Thanks for listening.
