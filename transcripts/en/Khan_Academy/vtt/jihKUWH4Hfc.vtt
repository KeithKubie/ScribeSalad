00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:03.414
- We're asked what is the
constant of proportionality

00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:05.957
between Y and X in the graph?

00:00:05.957 --> 00:00:07.915
And just as a reminder,
when we're talking about

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:09.794
constant of proportionality,

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:11.099
it sounds like a very fancy thing,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.784
but it's not too bad.

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:16.631
If we're thinking about
any X-Y pair on this,

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:20.250
on this line, let's say, right over here.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.167
We have some X comma Y.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:27.413
If Y is proportionate,
or is proportional to X,

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:31.853
then that means we can say that
Y is equal to some constant.

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:34.853
Y is equal to some constant times X.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.930
And that constant, that is our
constant of proportionality,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.701
right over there.

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:44.285
Sometimes you'll see this expressed,

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:46.240
if you divide both sides by X,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.980
sometimes you'll see this as Y over X,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.647
is equal to the constant
of proportionality.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.912
It shows for any X-Y pair, if
you take your Y divided by X,

00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:00.393
what do you get?

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.529
That's the same, same thing.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.990
So with that out of the way,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.890
see if you can answer their question.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.531
What is the constant of proportionality

00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:09.528
between Y and X in the graph?

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:12.341
Well they very clearly give
us a point right over here,

00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:16.258
this point is the point
three, three comma two.

00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:21.520
And so we could set it up a few ways.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.736
We could say, look when Y is equal to two,

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:28.461
X is equal to three, and so
two would need to be equal to

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:32.926
some constant of
proportionality times three.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.272
And if you wanted to solve for this,

00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:37.247
you just divide both sides by the three.

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.598
So divide both sides by three,

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.673
and you would get your
constant of proportionality

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:43.147
is two-thirds.

00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:45.040
Another way to do it, right over here.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.890
Well here, we've kind
of already solved for

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.360
our constant of proportionality.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.892
When Y, or we could say, when X is three,

00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:54.809
when X is three, Y is equal to two.

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:57.949
In either case, our
constant of proportionality

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:59.714
is two-thirds.

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:01.797
Let's do another example.

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:08.850
So here we have which line has
a constant of proportionality

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.683
between Y and X of five over four.

00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:16.281
So pause the video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.586
So the key realization
is we should test points

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:22.040
on these lines, we should test X-Y pairs,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.534
and say, look if we
take our Y divided by X,

00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:26.594
do we get five-fourths?

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:29.384
Because that would be our
constant of proportionality.

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:33.551
So let's first try, let's
try line A right over here.

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:37.059
So line A, let me find
a point that sits on it.

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.466
so that looks like a
point that sits on it.

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:43.633
And so if I take, this is
the point two comma five.

00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:47.904
And so if I took Y divided by X,

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:54.412
I would get a constant of
proportionality as five halves.

00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:59.055
So A is not going to be our answer.

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:00.448
We wanna get to a constant
of proportionality

00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:01.781
of five-fourths.

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:07.540
Alright, let's try B. Okay
B, let me find a point on B.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.297
Looks like this is a point on B.

00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:13.464
That is the point four
comma five, four comma five.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.154
And so in this situation, K
would be our Y, which is five,

00:03:18.154 --> 00:03:20.280
divided by our X, which is four.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.098
So it looks like B is our choice.

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:24.538
For kicks, you could also look at the

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.847
constant of proportionality
right over here.

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:29.076
Now there is one interesting example

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:31.922
that I just wanna touch on
before we finish these examples.

00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:35.672
What about a situation
where Y is equal to X?

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.958
What is the constant of
proportionality then?

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.051
And what would it look like as a line?

00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:45.157
Pause this video and think about it.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:47.455
Well, there's really nothing new here.

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:49.131
It's just, you might not really see

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:50.647
the constant of proportionality

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.318
when you see it expressed this way.

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:54.502
But Y is equal to X, is the same thing as

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:57.064
Y is equal to one times X.

00:03:57.064 --> 00:03:58.701
And so then it might jump out at you that

00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:00.933
the constant of proportionality is one

00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:02.894
in this scenario right over here.

00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:06.452
Or if you took Y divided by X, Y over...

00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:08.647
Let me do it in that black color.

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:13.215
Or if you took Y over X,
you divided both sides by X,

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.657
you would be left with the
constant of proportionality,

00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:17.200
which would be equal to one.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.520
And if you wanted to graph it,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.674
well it would just look like this.

00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:23.591
Y would be equal to X, for all X's.

00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:29.516
So that's what when your
constant of proportionality

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:31.420
is one, you would...

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.489
Those would represent
points on this orange line

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:36.105
that I just constructed.
