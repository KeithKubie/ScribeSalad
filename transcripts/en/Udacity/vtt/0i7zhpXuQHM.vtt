00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.250
Let's imagine that your
product looks amazing.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.650
Everything's working smoothly,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.060
the colors are awesome, but
the revenue stream is low.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.020
What could be the problem?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.030
&gt;&gt; There could be a number of roadblocks
that prevent users from spending

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.590
money in your app.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.520
A roadblock could be a design issue
that discourage users, for example,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.420
a complex registration form, or
a user exceptions on particular devices.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.040
You can use the reports we've talked
about in the previous lessons

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.190
to help you identify the road block, and
more effectively monetize your users.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.490
Let's take a look at a few examples
that will help us investigate and

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.660
find the reasons.
