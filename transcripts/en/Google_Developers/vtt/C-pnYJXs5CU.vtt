00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.505
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, we're going

00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:10.000
to take a tour of Android
Experiments, next.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.122
I'm here with Rich and Ryan.

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:13.080
How are you guys doing?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.310
RYAN BURKE: Doing well.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.440
How are you doing today?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm doing great.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.510
I'm so excited to check out all
the cool stuff you have here.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.180
You've done some really
cool hacks with Android.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.230
And I'd like to
learn about them.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.530
RYAN BURKE: Totally.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Where
should we start?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.401
RYAN BURKE: We can start with
the autonomous Android Vehicle.

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.980
It is an experiment
by Al Bencomo

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.340
from San Jose, California.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.560
It has a 5x onboard.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.580
It is using OpenCV passing
the data over Bluetooth

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.930
to a IOIO board.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.610
It has four IR
sensors in the front.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.380
As you can see, it's programmed
to follow the color green.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.490
We have this demo ball here.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.530
This guy will go, literally,
to the ends of the earth

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.423
to chase anything that
is green, whether it

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:51.460
be a ball, in this
case, or if someone

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.960
walks by with a green t-shirt,
this thing is taken off.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.251
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.274
So Isaac, tell us about
this Android experiment.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:02.940
ISAAC BLANKENSMITH:
So this is a project

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.390
called the IOIO
Plotter, which was

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.870
developed by a guy named Ytai.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.440
And so in his spare
time, he built a plotter

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.740
that basically used an art easel
that was like 18 by 24 inches.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.190
And so he then open
sourced that project

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.532
on androidexperiments.com.

00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:17.990
And we got really
excited about it.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.520
And so we worked with him
to build this larger scale

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.040
version of it.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.330
So the way it works is
that, using the phone,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.860
we take a portrait of you.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.850
And then we run an algorithm
looking at contrast.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.430
And so once we
run the algorithm,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.690
it basically converts it into
a single vector line drawing.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.690
And then we send
that vector line

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.770
drawing to this microcontroller
here, which is called a IOIO.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.570
And this board was actually
developed by the same guy who

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.380
made the original Pen Plotter.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.870
And so what that
does is it tells

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.860
these motors exactly
how much to rotate

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.194
to let string in and out.

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:51.360
And depending on how much
string you let in and out,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.818
that repositions the pen on
the paper to draw the portrait.

00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:58.990
RICH HYNDMAN: That's a
very big yellow face.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.910
RYAN BURKE: Yes.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.230
Six foot emoji.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.624
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So Rich is
going to stand in front of it.

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.040
RYAN BURKE: What's
going to happen

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.250
is that this app is a
built open framework.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.331
So it has 68 unique
tracking points plus--

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:10.039
RICH HYNDMAN: 68?

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.650
RYAN BURKE: 68 plus a
little bit of mobile vision

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.610
to give props to our friends
over there on the Google side.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.840
And what it will do is it'll
send those facial tracking

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.610
points via JSON over Socket.IO
to a Mac Mini behind this wall.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.217
And then those are then modeled
into an emoji in Paper.js.

00:02:29.217 --> 00:02:31.800
So we got a little Android and
we got a little web development

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.681
all in the same sort
of thing going on here.

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:35.680
So if you want to step
on this mark, right here.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.460
RICH HYNDMAN: Step
on the marker.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.293
RYAN BURKE: Let me--

00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:39.050
RICH HYNDMAN: That
is 6-- look at that.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.780
RYAN BURKE: So there's a
couple Easter eggs in there.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.446
So if you hold--

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:42.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Haha.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.830
RYAN BURKE: Hold a big
smile for four seconds.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.709
RICH HYNDMAN: Haha.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.750
RYAN BURKE: Deal with it.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Nice.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.680
RICH HYNDMAN: There we go.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's very cool.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.190
All right, Ryan.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.960
Thanks for showing us around.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.310
RYAN BURKE: Absolutely.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.020
Thanks for stopping by.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.519
See ya.

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.416
RICH HYNDMAN: Thanks very much.

00:02:57.416 --> 00:02:58.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is us.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.070
RYAN BURKE: Look at that.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That is really cool.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.830
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm an
Android experiment.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.435
It's a piece of card.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So if there
are developers out there that

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.517
have fun doing innovative
and interesting things

00:03:07.517 --> 00:03:09.350
with Android, they can
actually get involved

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.220
in Android Experiments.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.520
Is that right?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.463
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:03:11.463 --> 00:03:13.746
They're all submitted through
androidexperiments.com.

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:14.870
You submit your experiment.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.995
The team will check it out.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.754
If they like it,
especially if it

00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:19.170
shows something
that's not already

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.220
in a current experiment,
then they can integrate it.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.835
And it might end up at
Google I/O next year,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.668
or Mobile World Congress,
or any of the many

00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:26.010
shows the team go to every year.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.418
Androidexperiments.com.

00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:30.710
