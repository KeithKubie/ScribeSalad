00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:03.338
If you wanted to build
or produce most anything,

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:05.857
I want to think a little bit about
what you would need to do it.

00:00:05.857 --> 00:00:07.126
I have some pictures here,

00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:09.035
just to get our imagination going.

00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:10.701
These guys are up to
making something with iron

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:12.284
or maybe making iron bars,

00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:15.618
or making some type of thing out of iron.

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:17.459
Right here is an old picture

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:20.126
of some planes being made in a factory.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:21.928
Let's just think, in very general terms,

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:25.035
of things you need to produce anything.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.459
First of all, you're
going to need some land.

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.459
That's definitely true
if you're running a farm,

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:32.793
or if you're trying to produce timber.

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:34.618
You definitely need land
even if you have a factory.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:36.325
Obviously, both of these factories

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:38.793
are sitting on top of some land.

00:00:38.793 --> 00:00:42.793
Then, you're going to
need a building, maybe.

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:44.619
Most probably a building.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:47.193
You're going to need
some tools and equipment.

00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:50.869
Tools and equipment.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:53.126
Then, you might need some raw material.

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:54.285
In this case it might be iron.

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.142
Over here too, you would need some metal.

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:58.194
You might need some
electricity or some oil

00:00:58.194 --> 00:01:01.060
to keep the production lines going.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.332
You're going to need some raw materials.

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:06.748
Raw materials.

00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:08.249
Then, you're going to
need people to actually

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:09.414
work in your factory.

00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:12.594
These guys putting these hot bars of iron

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:14.915
inside of whatever this
thing right over here is,

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:16.726
or the people working on the factory line.

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:17.998
You don't see any here.

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:19.526
This must be off time.

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:21.582
You need people to actually
work on the factory line,

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.326
to tighten bolts and
all the rest of things.

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:27.592
You're going to need labor.

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:32.527
If you put all of these
things together ...

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:34.461
Let me put them all together.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.331
If you put all of these things together

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:41.664
then you should be able
to produce your product.

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:46.410
You'll be able to output
whatever you set yourself to do.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.727
In the classical sense,

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:49.644
when you think about all
of these different things

00:01:49.644 --> 00:01:51.311
that you might put into production,

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:55.311
sometimes they're referred to
as the factors of production,

00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:56.316
they separate out ...

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.185
This is in the classical sense.

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:01.651
They separate out building
and the tools and equipment

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.935
as one of the classes.

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:04.053
You have land.

00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:06.718
You have labor and you have buildings.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:08.184
Sometimes, just to throw it in there,

00:02:08.184 --> 00:02:09.688
sometimes you'll throw in management

00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:11.317
or organization in here.

00:02:11.317 --> 00:02:12.251
Someone needs to figure out

00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:14.051
how to layout all of this type of thing.

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:16.687
This could also be a factor of production.

00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:18.916
Buildings and tools and equipment,

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:21.603
they're kind of separated
out from everything else.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:22.784
In the classical sense,

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:25.450
they're referred to as capital.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.318
They are referred to as capital.

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:30.118
They kind of have this
separate distinction,

00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:33.651
because these are things
that are made by human beings

00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:37.937
for the specific purpose
of producing other things.

00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:39.520
Obviously, there are other things

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.270
that are made by human beings.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.385
For example, you could have a ...

00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:48.117
Let me think of something
that's nicely ...

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:49.263
A hat.

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:52.184
A hat is clearly made by a human being,

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:56.653
but it's not produced
to produce other things.

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:57.919
It's meant for fashion.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.270
It's meant to kind of improve
someone's quality of life.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.651
It's not made to make other things.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.450
In this case, the building and the tools,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.603
the whole reason why they were made

00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:10.919
is to make other things.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.118
In the classical sense,

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:15.916
they are referred to as capital.

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:18.603
If we go to kind of more modern times,

00:03:18.603 --> 00:03:27.252
you'll hear words like "human capital"

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:29.937
or "financial capital."

00:03:29.937 --> 00:03:31.719
You'll see a lot of
different types of capital

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.269
that people try to talk about.

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.385
Human capital or financial capital,

00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:37.187
so what are they talking about?

00:03:37.187 --> 00:03:38.270
In the classical sense,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.450
capital were things that people made

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.935
so that those things can
help us make other things.

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:46.983
The analogy is, is human capital

00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:49.118
isn't just straight up labor.

00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:50.385
It plays a role in it.

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:52.985
In modern times, when people
talk about human capital,

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:55.186
they're trying to make the same analogy.

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:57.603
They're kind of
investments made in humans,

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:01.783
so that those humans are better
at producing other things.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.118
Human capital, when people refer to it,

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:11.603
they are things like education, skills,

00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:14.118
talents that someone might have,

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:19.652
talents, experience that someone
might have inside of them

00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:21.450
or that were invested in them,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.395
(if you think about the
situation of education)

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.311
that make them more productive.

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.728
They're things that are
thrown into a human being

00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:31.986
that make them able to
produce more output.

00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:34.917
This is what people refer
to as "human capital"

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:37.785
and how it's different than
just straight up labor.

00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:38.728
Labor is just ...

00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:40.651
Look, any human being can go there

00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:42.145
and move something from
one place to another

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:43.919
or pick something up
and put it on a shelf,

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.061
or take it off of a shelf
and put it on another shelf.

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.585
What human capital is, are
the investments in that person

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:51.994
that make them more
productive, more skilled,

00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:54.850
more able to do more interesting things.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.517
The same thing is true

00:04:56.517 --> 00:04:57.328
(just to throw it in there,

00:04:57.328 --> 00:04:59.049
just so you can kind of see this analogy)

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.922
is financial capital.

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:03.801
You could just say, "Look,
there's something â€¦"

00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.526
There's money for money's sake

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:07.941
that you could use to buy a hat,

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.276
or that you could use to buy

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:11.358
really almost any of these other things.

00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:13.185
When people talk about financial capital

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:15.027
they're talking about money

00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:17.984
that's being used for the purpose

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.785
of producing more output.

00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:22.191
You could view it as the money

00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:26.319
that you actually need to run a factory.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.451
For example, they'll
call it working capital.

00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:30.118
It's the money in the cash register,

00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:31.609
so that you can actually run your store

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:32.718
or run your restaurant.

00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:37.118
Or, it could be money that's
put to work by buying ...

00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:38.859
Kind of traditional capital,

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:40.275
for buying these capital goods,

00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:41.785
so that you can produce more output.

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:42.785
The whole idea here,

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:46.422
I just want to introduce
you to the idea of capital.

00:05:46.422 --> 00:05:50.231
It's central to the word
capitalism in it's classical sense

00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.184
and then maybe in the more modern sense.

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:53.451
Especially when people talk about

00:05:53.451 --> 00:05:56.067
something like human capital.
