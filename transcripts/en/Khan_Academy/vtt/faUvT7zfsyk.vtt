- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.879
Today I wanna introduce
the idea of the verb tense,

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.700
and the way I wanna do that
is to express the following,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.696
if you can master grammatical tenses,

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:15.595
you will become a time wizard,
a literal, actual time wizard

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:17.697
because tense is nothing
more than the ability

00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:21.481
of verbs to situate themselves in time,

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.792
specifically in three different times

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:28.075
so in the past, the present,
or the future it can happen.

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:29.011
When we're talking about a verb,

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.749
a verb can happen now,
a verb can happen later,

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:35.092
and a verb can have
happened in the past, then.

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:40.177
That's basically it, and
if you master tenses,

00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:44.821
you will be able to tell
stories that span all of time,

00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:49.337
and I think that ability
is kind of astonishing

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:52.635
that language can express
that sort of idea.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.223
To just give a very simple example,

00:00:55.223 --> 00:00:58.625
I'll just take the word talk and

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.178
put it in these three basic tenses.

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:03.941
Now, it does get more
complicated than this,

00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:05.614
sure, but we'll cover that later,

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:09.685
so if i take the verb to talk

00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:14.531
and I put it in the
present, I would just say,

00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.952
"I talk,"

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.514
the most basic iteration, "I talk."

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:24.228
In the future, "I will talk,"

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.764
and in the past, "I talked."

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:32.772
This is the simple form of every

00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:37.278
English tense, past, present, future.

00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:41.759
If you can command all of these,
you will be a time wizard.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.506
That's you, you can learn anything.

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:45.720
