Marty Johnson:
One of the things you're going to be doing today is creating a mini-farm. Trenton used to have

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.480 position:97%
Marty Johnson:
135,000 people. We're now down to just 82,000 people. So, we've got a bunch of vacant land

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.040 position:97%
Marty Johnson:
around. We have really one supermarket in terms of one market that is over 40,000 square feet.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.809 position:98%
Marty Johnson:
We have one other grocery store in the city for 82,000 people. Being able to grow

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.779 position:97%
Marty Johnson:
food close to where people are at is very important... very important for places like Trenton.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.329
Marty Johnson:
It's important across the planet.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.309 position:98%
Krystal Hill:
It's great to get out and sort of see beyond Princeton, even though this is only about 15 minutes

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.280 position:98%
Krystal Hill:
away. You could see where you could be yourself after college, and you can do things like

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.120 position:98%
Krystal Hill:
this and make a huge impact on the community, and I think it's really cool and it's inspiring

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.069
Krystal Hill:
at the same time.

00:00:54.069 --> 00:01:00.230 position:97%
Amada Sandoval:
The students here are incredibly focused, and they're really strong supporters of each other

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.940 position:98%
Amada Sandoval:
and that tightness -- the warmth in their community -- it's like a big family, and I really admire that

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.480 position:98%
Amada Sandoval:
and kind of envy that, but then I'm glad to be able to be a part of that.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.190 position:98%
Peter Farrell:
This is planting a seed, as far as I'm concerned. You're planting a seed for future involvement

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.000 position:98%
Peter Farrell:
on behalf of student-athletes later in life. The continuity is extremely important.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.030 position:97%
Peter Farrell:
Marty has been doing this for 30 years down here in Trenton -- a Princeton student whose project

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.710 position:98%
Peter Farrell:
became a realization here in helping the community out. You don't know which one of these kids will become another Marty Johnson.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.170 position:97%
Isaac Serwanga:
I mean, the community part was great, but I feel like one of the things I'm going to take from

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.110 position:97%
Isaac Serwanga:
this was the people aspect. They got to introduce the people who we worked with,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.300 position:98%
Isaac Serwanga:
and we got to see a lot about what people are doing to better themselves,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.850 position:97%
Isaac Serwanga:
so this is just another opportunity for a lot of people to have that second start, have that second...

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.720 position:98%
Isaac Serwanga:
second chance to really get something done. I mean, there are a lot

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.570 position:98%
Isaac Serwanga:
of people completing GED programs making sure they're getting a high school diploma

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.050 position:97%
Isaac Serwanga:
in order to better themselves, and that's really something that is good to be a part of.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.000 position:97%
Andrew Dixon:
Yeah, we're working out here with those guys that we met, with those girls we met, shoveling dirt.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.329 position:72%
Andrew Dixon:
That's a great way to connect with these guys.

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:21.329 position:97%
Laura Martindale:
Well, I think these programs are important because, for one, it helps us to step away from

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.209 position:98%
Laura Martindale:
the school for a minute and realize -- aside from all the books and all the studying --

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.909 position:98%
Laura Martindale:
there are some important things going on in the community and in the state that we're

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.170 position:97%
Laura Martindale:
spending these four years in. And so, being able to remove yourself from that academic

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.000 position:98%
Laura Martindale:
setting and do something that seems valuable in real life to people, I think, is really productive.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.000 position:97%
Jeff Kampersal:
The Princeton Varsity Club -- just what it stands for -- we try to instill that into our kids,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000 position:98%
Jeff Kampersal:
to know that it's a privilege to play at Princeton, and it's also almost like an obligation to give back,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.310 position:98%
Jeff Kampersal:
but I don't think they feel obligated. I think they do it on their own.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.299 position:97%
Bob Surace:
I think it's important for the alumni that were athletes to see the Princeton Varsity Club

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.579 position:98%
Bob Surace:
does a lot of great things, and we're able to put some practical experience

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.510 position:97%
Bob Surace:
on that and really accomplish some things that the players will remember for a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.329
Bob Surace:
long time after they're done here.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.629 position:97%
Meredith Taylor:
Having the help of volunteer groups is extremely important. The ability to bring in young people

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.719 position:98%
Meredith Taylor:
and those that are interested and able to help us get this stuff ready is... it's invaluable.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.950 position:80%
Meredith Taylor:
We couldn't do this without the help of volunteers.
