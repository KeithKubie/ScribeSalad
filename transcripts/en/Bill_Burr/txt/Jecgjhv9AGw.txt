Speaker 1:          00:06          like a boss.

Speaker 2:          00:08          So Oprah had an in depth interview with Lance Armstrong was a dumb, I was actually fucking hilarious. I was watching it with the lovely Nia and, uh, I was just laughing my ass off. It was, it was phenomenal. Like she's sitting there going like, um, so will you, will you basically injecting, you know, fucking horse Jizz steroids into you for every race? And he's like, yes.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Did you ever take banned substances to enhance your cycling performance? Yes. Yes or no. Did you ever use any other banned substances like testosterone, uh, cortisone or human growth hormone? Yes. In all seven of your Tour de France victories, did you ever take banned substances or blood dope? Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:05          For all tours. He's like, yes, I was. She's like, did you consider a cheating? And he's like, Eh, at the time, no. No, I didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Who said to me earlier, you don't think it was possible to win without doping? Not In their generation. And, and I'm not here to talk about others in that generation. It's been well documented. Um, I didn't invent the culture, but I didn't try to stop the culture. And that's that, that that's my mistake and that's where I have to be sorry for it. And that's what something in the sport is now paying the price because of that. And so I am sorry for that.

Speaker 2:          01:42          It's like a course he didn't, you know what pissed me off about lance? I guess it was kind of a good move on his part that he didn't go like Oprah. Did you do any research into this sport? Did you notice the top 20 guys? We're all fucking doing this shit to, you got to fight fire with fire. You can't bring a knife to a gun fight. If everybody else is jacked up, I gotta be jacked up too. For Fuck Sakes.

Speaker 3:          02:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:25          the worst thing. No, I didn't. I actually like the opera in interview and it was kind of funny watching her be dumbfounded by this guy's complete lack of, uh, you know, just not giving a shit when he was cheating. Um, and then the whole thing was funny to me, cause I, you know, I'm old enough to remember when Oprah used to interview fucking midgets who want to fuck their mailman's brother. You know, so I dunno.

Speaker 1:          02:49          They don't know where to go. They need a mother and, and unfortunately,

Speaker 4:          02:54          what about the father? [inaudible] you

Speaker 5:          02:59          don't necessarily need a mother. They need a parent. May Be, why can't

Speaker 2:          03:04          anyways, they do the whole interview and then they go on ESPN.

Speaker 6:          03:12          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:12          Rick Riley's talking about Lance Armstrong and I guess Rick Riley was backing Lance and he was just having this hissy fit about his reputation because he backed Lance Armstrong.

Speaker 5:          03:24          Sorry Dude. Oh sorry dude. 14 years he put egg on my face and I would even ask him off the record, Hey, just tell me off the record if you're doing this stuff, because it keeps coming up and up and every time he would be more and more adamant that he wasn't doing it, then you can defend me. Don't worry about it.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Like anybody gives a flying fuck about Rick Riley.

Speaker 6:          03:45          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:46          And when Lance Armstrong, when he finally, you know, came out that he did it, did anybody go like, oh my God,

Speaker 2:          03:53          now what happens to Rick Riley? Like he made that whole fucking thing about himself. You know, he made, he said they go, he made me look like a fool. I was typing things, supporting him. Rick, relax. Nobody's blaming you. Nobody gives a flying. Fuck this. This really isn't on you. This is about lance. This isn't about you. Okay, so why don't you just close your laptop, fucking relax. Like he felt betrayed. It's like, Rick, what are you fucking special? He lied to the whole world. He's not going to lie to you like a brick. You listen. I know. I just went on national television and said that I, uh, I, I don't cheat in those races, but I, I actually am cheating.

Speaker 6:          04:41          Ah,

Speaker 2:          04:41          I've cheated every race and I plan to continue cheating in the future. And now that you know that, um, I have to kill you.

Speaker 6:          04:50          You know, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          04:53          I was really hoping for more on all both of those subjects. I would, I was hoping that I was going to have something a little more funnier.

Speaker 6:          05:04          Kenny, we came back for me now, I never really left. It's illegal. We shouldn't have it just out.
