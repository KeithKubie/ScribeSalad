00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.300
Molten metal in a vacuum
chamber, what happens to it?

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.100
Will it bubble
and boil like water?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.760
Will it hold its heat
for a really long time?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.700
We're going to find out.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:19.320
[Music]

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.000
For years,
we have done experiments

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
using a vacuum chamber,
and we've done experiments

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.100
using molten metal,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.500
and today, for the first time,
we're going to see what happens

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.780
if we put molten metal
into a vacuum chamber.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.700
Here's what we're going to try.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.600
We've got two cups
of equal amounts of aluminum.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.100
We're going to melt
them both down.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.580
One of them will go
inside a vacuum chamber,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.900
and one of them will sit
outside the vacuum chamber.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.780
Let's find out what
happens differently.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200
We've got these two steel cups,
and we're going to put these

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.400
into our furnace,
and melt down

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.940
the aluminum inside them.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.600
They started off
as the same cup.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.200
We cut this one in half just
so that we can see

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.300
inside it better.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.600
We just want
to watch what happens

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.500
inside our vacuum chamber,
and visions going to be

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.200
a little bit limited.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700
This one's going to be
outside the vacuum chamber,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.580
so we should be able to see
into it just fine anyway.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.112
We've also got on the lid
of our vacuum chamber,

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:06.102
it's digital thermometer
that goes up to about 1900

00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:07.500
degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.320
or just over 1,000
degrees Celsius.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.640
What we're going to do
is tape that switch down,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.500
and set it on so that
as we pull out the vacuum

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.780
and leave it in a vacuum,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.600
it is giving us
a constant readout

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.380
of the temperature of the metal.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.200
Hopefully,
that will let us see how fast

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.102
or slow the metal cools down.

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:49.320
[Music]

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.480
I think we're going
to call that good.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.680
[Music]

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.620
Thermometer,
which is still attached to this lid,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.902
actually only showing a temperature
of about 500 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.500
A little bit more depending
on the angle I get.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.820
I think it's probably kind
of hard to read aluminum,

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:12.692
which is very shiny in places.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.160
It might struggle with that.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.720
Aluminum isn't liquid
at 500 Fahrenheit.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.800
So that's probably
not a perfect representation,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.712
but it is going to give us
a comparison between the two.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.800
Aluminum's definitely
cooling down.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.500
It's now at that stage
that's weirdly clay like.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.800
I can stab into it
with a little bit of pressure,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.580
but it's definitely not liquid.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:46.700
[Music]

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.580
Still showing a span
of around 350 to 400 Fahrenheit.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.220
Lets see if I get the same result with this one.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.400
Yeah, 35 to 410-450,
and this is only been going

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.300
for maybe five minutes
out of the furnace.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.900
Order of operations, I'm going
to tape down the trigger.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.780
I'm going to pull out the metal
cup full of molten aluminum,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.000
set it on the brick,
throw the lid on,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.772
and then turn on the vacuum.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.260
[Music]

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.592
Metal in the chamber.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.680
We're suddenly getting a very
high temperature reading.

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:32.500
All right,
we are lowering the pressure

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.480
in the vacuum chamber.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.880
Oh, no, our thermometer
just turned off.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:50.360
[Music]

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.100
The aluminum is putting off
so much heat, it heated up

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.700
the electrical tape,
which got loose,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.120
and let go of our button.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:07.500
[Music]

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.700
It's going to come off
again, I think.

00:04:13.582 --> 00:04:16.200
I think I even saw a couple
of bubbles coming up

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.322
out of the aluminum there.

00:04:17.802 --> 00:04:19.800
Our thermometer
did turn off again.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.300
It was reading about
435 when it turned off,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.160
but that aluminum
is bubbling, just a little bit.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.300
I'll admit, I did not think
we are going to get

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.800
any bubbling from our metal.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.100
I've never seen
molten aluminum bubble

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.300
the way it's doing right now,
as it cool down.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.700
So, I think this is the vacuum
that's causing that.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.700
The glass has actually
heated up a lot.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.340
It's really hot to the touch.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:56.980
[Music]

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.100
Oh no, see if it still works.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.100
Error.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.360
This whole thing is really hot.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:20.840
[Music]

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.900
Hello-- Oh man, that is bright.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.620
Okay, the--
Let's go in the shade.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.920
Didn't think this through.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.640
We're good.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.300
Okay.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.420
Hello!

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.360
Are people trying to steal
the data on your computer?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.200
We got to talk
about our sponsor real quick,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.760
and hang on, don't go away.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.900
This is something a lot
of you might actually

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.700
be interested in.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.100
Our sponsor for today's
video is NordVPN.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.700
That's a virtual
private Network.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.300
It's a company that secures
the data on your phones,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.800
computers,
your Internet devices.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.600
And along with security,
they offer some other really

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.300
cool features.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.200
My favorite thing about it
for example is the fact

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.500
that I can reroute my traffic
through kind of all over

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.700
anywhere in the world.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.800
So, if I want to see what's
on like some streaming services

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.400
outside of where I usually live,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.620
I can redirect my traffic
through a different country,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.600
and then my favorite
streaming platforms

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.000
will show different content
based on what country

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.600
it's going through.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.680
That's pretty cool.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.380
In addition to that,
it does provide security.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.700
If I'm connecting to a Wi-Fi
somewhere in public,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.100
like at a fast food restaurant
or a hotel or something like that,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.300
there are a lot
of people out there

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.900
who are trying to do bad things.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.900
They're trying
to steal your data.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.300
They want your information
off of your devices,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.600
and they're going to try
and do that.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.500
Well with NordVPN,
you don't have to worry.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.500
Your information is safe.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.252
It's secure.

00:06:35.252 --> 00:06:36.800
People aren't going
to be stealing stuff

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.692
off of your computer
because NordVPN provides

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.040
so much security for you.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.200
If you're someone
who likes security,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.000
or if you're someone who likes
to have your internet traffic

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.680
anonymous and untraceable,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.300
or if you're someone who
likes to stream content,

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.400
from other places,
NordVPN is something

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.640
you should definitely get.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.500
You can get a great deal
right now by going

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.100
to NordVPN.com/random,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.700
and using the promo code
RANDOM to get 75%

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.400
off of three year plan,
plus a free month.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.300
You want to stay safe online,
NordVPN has got you covered.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.500
Now, let's get back to checking
out our vacuumed metal.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.100
I want to try
and get both

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.500
of these pieces of aluminum out,
and see what differences

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.200
I can find.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.772
So, let's see
if we can separate them.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.800
[Music]

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.760
Here we go.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:35.700
[Music]

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.200
All right.

00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:36.900
So this is interesting.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.600
This is sort
of some pieces

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.000
of the aluminum that melted,
but I never stirred the aluminum

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.700
on top of it.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.100
So you can just sort of see
the stick formation left.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.400
This one seems
to have more pitting

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.040
and bubbling on the bottom,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.700
and again, this is
the one that was

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.200
in the vacuum chamber,
and this is the one

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.980
that was not.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.280
I think I want to cut both
of these in half,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.500
and see if there's
any difference

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.640
on the inside.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:30.820
[Music]

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.840
I would say on the inside,
they look pretty much the same,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.860
at least, when you cut them
in half with a hacksaw.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.200
So what did we get
out of putting molten metal

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.360
in the vacuum chamber?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.700
The surface definitely
cooled down differently.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.400
The one that we put
in the vacuum chamber

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.700
has a lot more pits,
a lot more strange angles to it,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.200
and overall,
just a very different texture.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.200
The one that was
in the vacuum chamber, is more

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.132
of a flat, silvery
aluminum color.

00:08:56.872 --> 00:09:00.200
Maybe we have a different sort
of aluminum oxide that's formed,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.900
different composition,
different speed that it formed.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.300
It's pretty much the same colors
on what's on the edge

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.100
of this one here.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.660
This one's the same color
pretty much all the way across,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.000
except for a little bit
of slag here in the corner.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.900
And then of course,
what surprised me the most is

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.240
that while it was
in the vacuum chamber,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.900
it seemed to have
bubbles rising up out of it.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.700
I was also amazed at how
much heat it put off.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.500
The outside of that vacuum
chamber got really hot.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.200
We did have, something
of a casualty of war.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200
This is the thermometer that
I was trying to use,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.300
and it seems to have
an issue scanning

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.000
the surface of aluminum.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.900
It wasn't really giving
us an accurate reading.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.600
It was only giving us a reading
of about 450 degrees Fahrenheit

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.400
while the aluminum
was still molten,

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.140
and aluminum does not melt
that temperature.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.300
So unfortunately,
this is not the best way

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.000
to measure the temperature
of molten aluminum.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.240
We're going to have to look
into that a little bit later.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.300
Maybe we can find
a thermocouple

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.000
that actually goes down
into the aluminum

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.862
to measure it there.

00:09:53.212 --> 00:09:55.600
So we may have to revisit
this experiment later

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.892
on when we have a little bit
more industrial equipment

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.860
that can handle some
of these temperatures.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.120

Guys, that's not all,
we've got more for you see.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.900
That box will take you directly
to our most recent video,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.940
and you check that out.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.500
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.400
you should be watching next,

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:20.400
and if you hit this bomb,
you'll be subscribe to our channel,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.600
so you never miss out
on a video.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.800
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.940
Talk to you then.
