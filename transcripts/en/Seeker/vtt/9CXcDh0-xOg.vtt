00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.690
Life seems to grab hold wherever it can.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.269
Deep sea vents, rocky cliffs, the underside
of my window sill, everywhere except for the

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.790
tippy tops of mountains.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.010
Why does nothing grow up there?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.290
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.040
The Tree line, is the elevation above which
trees can’t grow.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.510
From a distance the line can seem so extreme.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.779
But up close it’s a little fuzzier.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.660
Up close it’s more of a squiggly patch where
flora grows thinner and thinner until no trees

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.360
grow in a place called the Alpine zone.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.750
So some some scientists use the definition
“the elevation where tree density declines

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.020
or drops to zero”.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.390
But that elevation is different in lots of
different places.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.090
You might not be surprised to learn that there’s
a relationship between treeline and latitude.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.370
Treelines are pretty consistent between Between
30°N and 20°S. But the further you move

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.350
from that the lower the tree line is.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.960
But within latitudes, it can differ a surprising
amount.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.750
Like for example, the treeline in the Eastern
United States is lower than out West.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.619
The Tetons in Wyoming are at 43 degrees latitude
and the white mountains in New Hampshire are

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.179
at 44 degrees.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.310
In the Tetons, the treeline sits at a chilly
10,000 feet.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700
While in the White Mountains it sits at a
cozy over 4,500 feet.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.700
What’s going on?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.429
When we think of tree lines, we think of Alpine
treelines in the mountains.

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.530
Researchers have found that treelines seem
to follow the permanent snow line of mountains.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.329
Which might mean temperature is the major
factor.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.590
And temperature really screws up two main
things.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.649
It limits how seeds sprout and limits how
the tree grows.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.240
If the elevation is too high, it’s too cold
or if snow lasts too long into summer, trees

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.789
have a hard time growing.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.689
It seems trees have a hard time building cells
if the temperatures dip below 44 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.209
But SUMMER temperature matters a lot too.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.509
If the snow lasts too long, it might cut the
growing season short.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.969
Leaving trees struggling.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.909
Even on the same mountain it can vary!

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.719
Some rock faces get more sun, some get more
rain, some more wind.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.810
Ever been on a mountain and noticed how a
slope on one side seems to have more trees?

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.209
Well shadows sometimes stunt tree growth.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.810
In the Northern hemisphere north facing slopes
have a lower treeline, because the shade makes

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.360
that side colder than the other!

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.580
It’s the opposite for the Southern Hemisphere.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.510
But other factors matter too.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.989
If the tree line is caused by wind, it might
make the trees tiny, almost more like bushes.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.510
These trees are called a krummholz formation,
from the German word for 'twisted wood'.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.810
Since temperature and treeline are linked,
it’s no surprise that climate change has

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.810
an effect.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.810
Treelines could almost be seen as a water
mark for the warming world.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.810
As the climate changes, treelines are moving.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.810
So scientists are starting to keep an eye
on treelines.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.280
Just like stunning images of retreating glaciers,
moving treelines might be a striking visual

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.569
for the way our world is transforming.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.629
Alright guys, got any questions about how
our weird world works?

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:54.099
