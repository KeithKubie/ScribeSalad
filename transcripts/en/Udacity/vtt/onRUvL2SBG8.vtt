Hello, and welcome to CS 7637,

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:06.142
knowledge-based artificial
intelligence/cognitive systems.

00:00:06.142 --> 00:00:07.230
My name is Ashok Goel.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.460
&gt;&gt; My name is David Joyner.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.297
&gt;&gt; I'm a Professor of Computer Science
and Cognitive Science at Georgia Tech.

00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:15.190
I've been teaching knowledge-based
AI for about 25 years.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.650
I've been doing research
in this area for about 30.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.160
My personal passion is for
computational creatively.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.500
Breathing air agents that human like and
creative in their own right.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.990
&gt;&gt; I'm, of course,
developer with Udacity and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.970
I'm also finishing up my own PhD
dissertation here at Georgia Tech

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.760
with Ashok as my advisor.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.390
My personal passion is for education and
especially for using modern technology

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.170
to deliver individualized
personal educational experiences.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.020
It would be very difficult
in very large classrooms.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.050
As we'll see AI is not just
the subject of this course, but

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.420
it's all a tool we're using
to teach this course.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.930
&gt;&gt; We had a lot of fun
putting this course together.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.600
We hope you enjoy it as well.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.020
We think of this course
as an experiment as well.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.260
We want to understand how students
learn in online classrooms.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.210
So if you have any feedback
please share it with us.
