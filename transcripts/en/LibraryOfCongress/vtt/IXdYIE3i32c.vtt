00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.510
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Well good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.010
On behalf of all my colleagues and
in particular, Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.270
chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.380
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the Near East Section,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.770
and sponsor of today's program
on the Orthodox Church in Georgia

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.330
since Independence
by Dr. Paul Crego.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.900
Before we start today's program
and introduce our speaker,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.720
I'd like to give you a brief
overview of the division

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.280
and the resources in the
hopes that you'll come back

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.630
and use the collections and this
reading room for your research.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.920
This is a custodial division which
is comprised of three sections

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.010 position:56%
that build and serve the collections

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.690
to researchers from
around the world.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.730
We cover 75 countries
and over 22 languages.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.080 position:56%
The African section includes all
the countries of sub-Sahara, Africa.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.620
The Hebraic section covers
Judaica and Hebraic worldwide.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.050
And the Near East section
covers all of the Arab counties

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.700
of North Africa, the Near East,
all of the sections of Turkey,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.960
Turkey Central Asia,
Iran, Afghanistan,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.510
the Muslims in Western
China, Russia, the Balkans

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.850
and the people of the Caucuses.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.930
So you know, this is
quite an extensive region.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.400
And we're particularly pleased
today to be covering Georgia

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.840
in the former Soviet Republic.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.890
So before we get started,
there are just a couple

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.140
of things I want to tell you about.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.680
We also do programs and more
extensive programs than even this.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.400 position:56%
On June 10th, we have a very
exciting program with panels planned

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.180
from 8:30 to 3:30 over in
LJ119 on the Assyrians,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.790
and the ancient peoples all through
the Middle East going into Turkey,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.080
all of the different regions the
Assyrians lived and it's going

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.880
to be a very exciting program.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.020
And as a further incentive, it
includes breakfast and lunch, so.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.630
So, please mark that
on your calendar,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.990
if you can join us at
some point with that.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.810
Also another little housekeeping
thing, we'd like to invite you

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.470
to fill in the questionnaires
that you see in your seats.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.470 position:56%
This helps us to plan for future
programs to improve and see what you

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.150
like and what worked well for you.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.170
Then also, we invite you to ask
questions but if you do ask them,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.970 position:56%
since we're videotaping this, you're
giving consent to be taped just

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.510
by default, so just
please be aware of that.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.020
So, without further ado, I'd like
to invite Dr. Levon Avdoyan on here

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.850
to introduce our speaker.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.670
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: Thank you, Joan.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.540
It's wonderful to see so many
people here for this special event

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.730
and it is also a double pleasure to
introduce today's speaker to you,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.410
Dr. Paul Crego, who is the
Senior Cataloging Specialist

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.060
and Acquisitions Librarian in
the Israel and Judaica section

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.830 position:56%
with the Library of Congresses,
Asian and then Middle East Division.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.030
He has been my vital partner
in the acquisitions of Georgian

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.420
and Armenian materials for 17
years now and has brought all

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.290
of these formats of
these collections

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.080
under bibliographic
control for your use.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.500
Paul started at the
Library of Congress in 1999

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.300
and he's responsible for
books in Georgian, Armenian

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.570
and the languages of Ethiopia.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.970
He holds a BA in Soviet
and East European studies

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.860
from Syracuse University, an MA

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.900 position:56%

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.530
from the Harvard Divinity
School and a PhD

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.740
in Theology from Boston College.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.000 position:56%
His publications include an
article with Professor Stephen Rapp,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.180
the Conversion of K'art'li:
The Shatberdi Variant

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.290
from the Kekalazi [phonetic]
Institute a in Tbilisi,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.630

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.700
in Christianity and Politics in the
21st Century, Monks and Monasticism

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.750
in Georgia in the 19th and 20th

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.910
and Cultures of Eastern
Christianity.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.600
Now, Paul was a staff fellow on
the John W. Kluge Scholarly Center

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.650
in 2007 to 2008 and spent his
years studying the historical

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.840 position:56%
and cultural context of the
Aposean [assumed spelling] Conflict.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.640
During his fellowship year, he
delivered a number of lectures

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.890
on issues of language, policy,
ethnic identity and ethnic

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.120
and national identity
in religious context.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.180
He delivered papers at the
Manuscript Center in Tbilisi,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.540
Princeton University
and the University

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.710
of Michigan at Ann Harbor.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.890
In 2015, Dr. Crego presented
papers on the LGBT community

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.850
in the Republic of Georgia
including religious issues

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.590
in connections with that community.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.640
One at the Georgia and at
the Crosswords Conference

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.420
at Bailey University and the
other at the Annual Meeting

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.280
of the Association for
Slavic East European

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.580
and Eurasian Studies
in Philadelphia.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.690
Now, as you can see, he is
uniquely qualified to speak to us

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.050
on the subject of the
Orthodox Church

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.380
in Georgia since Independence.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Paul Crego.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:24.340
[ Applause ]

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.930
&gt;&gt; Paul Crego: Picture it,
Ikalto, a small village in Kakheti

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:39.090
that is the eastern part of the
Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:47.280
Saturday afternoon, July
7th, 1990, the church-- oops.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.590
There we go.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.070
The church of the transfiguration
[foreign language] also known

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.280
as [foreign language], that
is Divinity of Godliness,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.560
among the surviving buildings of a
famous medieval theological school.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.640
Some of the great philosophical

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.990
and literary figures had
studied here during the hay day

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.440
of Georgia's Bagratid Dynasty
and its United Kingdom.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.610
Not the least of it-- not the
least of these was the poet,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.790
Shota Rustavelli, author
of the epic poem,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.880
Vepkhist'q'aosani The
Knight in the Panther Skin.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:41.920 position:56%
The inside of the church was in poor
repair, water stains were visible.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.060
The frescoes had been whitewashed
likely during the imperial Russian

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.760
period when some Georgian
churches had their Georgian

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.130
identities erased.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:02.580
Icons of various styles had been
placed in a makeshift iconostasis.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:09.170
Boxes of sand in front of the
icons held thin beeswax candles,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:15.340
guttering in the soft,
warm, humid breeze.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.490
In response to a question asked
from among our group of students

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.130
in Georgia for the first summer
school in Kartvelian studies

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.410
at Tbilisi State University,
the intuitus [phonetic]

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.890
or foreign tourists
service guide said

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.950
that it was not a working church.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.290
Shortly after this
response, however,

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.030
the church bells began to chime.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.870
And efficient to some
priestly order,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.580
who appeared as if he had
been waiting in the very wall

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.740
of the church for his cue, placed
his service books on a lectern

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:04.300
and began to chant what was likely
the vigil of the resurrection.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.930 position:56%
We wondered whether we had witnessed
the first service in the new life

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.350
of this church of the
transfiguration.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.820
Certainly, it was among
the first and represented,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.330
iconified if you will the
transfiguration already well

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:28.410
underway in the Georgian Orthodox
Church and in the Georgian nation.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.070
We were witnessing the
beginning of a remarkable new era

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:39.670 position:56%
after nearly seven decades of
Soviet rule and its companion policy

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.660 position:56%
of official state-sponsored atheism.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.150
Although the Soviet Union did
not officially cease to exist

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:54.400
until the end of 1991, there are
two dates before the official end

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.550
that are essential starting points
for the concept of this paper.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:05.510
The first is December 25th, 1977.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.960
The Orthodox Church in Georgia
uses what's called the Old Calendar

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.020
so this is not Christmas,
but about two weeks before.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.390
This was the day when the
current Patriarch Catholicos

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:25.770
of the Georgian Church,
Ilia II was enthroned.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.320
Although that sometime-- although
it was some difficult times early

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:35.420
in his reign, these Catholicos,
Ilia II emerged in the 1980s

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.120
as the leader who would begin
to revive the Orthodox Church

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.040
in Georgia, he saw into a
future that held much promise

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.260
for a renewed church

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.410
when independence would
come again to Georgia.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:59.430
The second date is April 9th, 1989.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.220
It was on an early Sunday morning
when Soviet troops attempting

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.950
to disperse a demonstration
that had been developing

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.730
for several weeks fired
upon the crowd.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.010
Nineteen people were
killed, among them 17 women

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.380
and many more were injured.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:27.970
April 9th, 1989 was the day that
Soviet power died in Georgia.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.360
Huge funeral liturgies
soon became rallies

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.640
for the resurrection of the nation.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.440
Yes, there were political
structures that lingered

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.640 position:56%
and the Communist Party shambled on.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.630
For the Georgian people however,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.560
communist rule was
body-hawking corpse

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.630
that was left then
only further to decay.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.680
Within a year, there
was a box in front

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.560
of the Supreme Soviet Building, now
Parliament, and near the memorial

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.860
for the victims of April 9th.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.530
And on this box, there was
an invitation for people

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:15.810
to place their Communist cards
into the dustbin of history.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:21.220
In my brief time today, I
want to touch on a number

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.490
of different topics, the growth
of the Orthodox Church in Georgia,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:32.150
church-state relations, the
Orthodox Church in society

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.600 position:56%
and some publications of the church.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.330 position:56%
Let me pause at this point to thank
the African and Middle East Division

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:47.050
for inviting me to speak today
particularly Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:52.510
Chief, Joan Weeks, head of the Near
East Section and Dr. Levon Avdoyan,

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.880
my reference colleague in
matters Armenian and Georgian.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.300
And if anyone wants to know, I have
been studying the Georgian language

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.990
since 1977 and a great deal

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.900
of my research concerning
the Orthodox Church

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:14.910
in Georgia involves reading
Georgian language sources.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.670
The enthronement of Ilia
II as Catholicos Patriarch

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.210
of the Orthodox Church
in Georgia marked a point

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.920
after which this autocephalous
church began

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.680
to experience a reversal
of its fortune.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.200
Although still in the time

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.000
of Breshnev [assumed spelling]
conditions in Georgia,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.110 position:56%
were more favorable than in some of
the other parts of the Soviet Union.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:47.710
They continued to improve during
the Gorbachev years of Glasnost.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.310
And there's Pearl Lenin
with his head bashed

00:13:50.310 --> 00:14:00.930 position:56%
in near the Natakhtari beer and soda
bottling plant, north of Mtskheta.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.250
And what was Lenin's Square
when I was still there

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:11.180
in 1990 is now Freedom
Square with a statue topped

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:16.210
by a golden St. George
slaying his dragon.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.880
Sadly, I missed Lenin coming
down by only about a week.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.700 position:56%
There had been rumors all summer and
we even got on the bus to go to free

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.840
or well, Lenin Square at the time
to see it come down but we heard

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.540
that the Georgians
forgotten ropes and such

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.720
by which to haul it down, anyway.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.740
One of the most important
early events for the future

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:46.090 position:56%
of the church was the opening of the
Tbilisi Spiritual Academy in October

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:53.000
in 1988 across from the
Zioni-- or Zion Cathedral.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.230
This spiritual academy was
a companion to the seminary

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:02.450
in Mtskheta that had sometimes
been open during the Soviet period.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.490
Before his enthronement,
Ilia II had been rector

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:13.970 position:56%
of the Mtskheta Theological Seminary
from 1963 to 1972 and in 18--

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:19.640
1989, the ancient autocephaly
or self-governing status

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.900
of the Orthodox Church in
Georgia was officially recognized

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.090
by the patriarch of Constantinople.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:34.050
The pace of change picked up in the
1990s and into the 21st century.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:41.970
At his enthronement in 1977, only
five eparchies existed in Georgia.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.360
There are now 50 including
seven outside

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.010
of the Republic of
Georgia's territory.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.810
The first years of the new
century saw a great deal

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.410
of new church construction
and renovation.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:01.160
The numbers of working churches
has increased from probably no more

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.170
than a couple of dozen
to over 850 by 2007.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.110
We'll come back to that one.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:16.520
Political leaders got in on the
building, Eduard Shevardnadze

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.810 position:56%
who became the head of state in
1992 and was later elected president

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:27.060
after the 1995 Constitution
and served until the Revolution

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:32.430
of the Roses in November of 2003,
sponsored the reconstruction

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.370
of the Saint Nicholas Church

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:40.170 position:56%
in the Narikala Fortress
overlooking the old part of Tbilisi.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.630
He was by the way baptized
Giorgi [assumed spelling]

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.320
by the patriarch himself.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.650
From before 1990, the Orthodox
Church in Georgia had begun

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:55.080
to make plans for the
construction of a new cathedral.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.280
It was to be called, "The
Cathedral of the Holy Trinity".

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.200
A competition among architects was
held in 1990 but with the economy

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.810
in ruins in the 1990s,
it became impossible

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.760
to raise funds for
the new cathedral.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.330
Finally, in the opening
years of the 21st century,

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:20.880
earnest construction began
with a large contribution

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.090
from Bidzina Ivanishvili,
who had made his money

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:31.860
in Russia during the 1990s when
that country's economy was largely

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.570
unfettered by regulation.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.890
This is the same Ivanishvili, who
became Prime Minister of Georgia

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.830
after the Parliamentary
Elections of 2012.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:49.840
Churches were built in Tbilisi
and elsewhere, others repaired

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:58.330
and put back together literally
putting the stones back up in order

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.830
for the churches again to exist.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.930
This included the church
of St. David the Builder

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:10.240
who had been the ruler
of Georgia in its--

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:17.480
in the Middle Ages when Georgia
was at its largest extent.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.880 position:56%
This church was built on the
grounds of Tbilisi State University.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:31.810 position:56%
Let's look a little at the Church
of the Holy Trinity as it was built.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:41.230
This was in late May or early
July 2000-- early June 2004.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.070
You can see some of
the ornamentation

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.290
that was waiting to go up.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:50.070
Not all of the technology
was 21st century.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.280
This is an inside view
looking at the altar

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.490
where the iconostasis
now is and up on the top

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.360
of the apps overlooking the
altar, there are now tracings

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.580
in which a new mosaic of
Christ, the Pantocrator

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.140
or the Almighty will be put.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:19.710
Just a view to show you how much
this new church dominates the

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.520
landscape in Tbilisi.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.650
Another new church,
they're not all big,

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.720
is the small church
honoring St. Habo of Tbilisi,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.730
an the early medieval martyr who
had been a perfumer in Baghdad,

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.270
moved to Tbilisi, converted
to Christianity

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.430
and then was martyred
for this trouble.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:50.150
Monastery of the Holy Cross,
a 6th century establishment.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.000
It's actually a first
year to its 4th century.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.520
What's left there now is
as old as the 6th century.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.910
It's a common place for
wedding parties to come,

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:10.450
so that a couple can be blessed
by the priests who were there.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:18.870
Now, some of the women wear very
high heels and there's a slab

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.060
of concrete just down the
stairs from the church

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.960
that overlooks the Aragvi
and Mt'k'vari River or Kura

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.650
if you need a better
vowel to [inaudible].

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:38.910
But it's steep and they don't
want people wearing stilettos

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:43.870
to go over the cliff.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.630
Another of the churches is a small
basilica called the Antakya Church

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:56.430
which is also Mcxeta, part of the
complex of the women's monastery

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:00.260
at the Samtavro Church in Mcxeta.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.050
I'm afraid sometimes I
intrude the pictures,

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.710
that's Professor's Stephen Rapp

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.770
with whom I've done some
writing and editing.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:18.520
Inside the Antakya Church, some
new frescos, this is the scene

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.800
with St. Nino equal to the Apostles
and Enlightener of the Georgia's--

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.870
Enlightener of the Georgians when
she prays for the pagan idols

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.410
to be blown off the hill.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.440
So a significant part of her story.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.900
Saint John the Baptist Monastery is
out in the Eastern part of Georgia

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.600
where things get very
dry and actually,

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.850
that cliff on the side is
where the monastery is.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.800
There's a church inside
there and a refractory.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:22:03.670
And there are also monks' residence
that's cut into the cliff and yes,

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.530
it was that blue that day.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.850
My memory is giving to the
monastery, it was the feast

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:15.510
of Saints Helena and
Constantine so at 10 o'clock,

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.970
there was a festive lunch
and the red liquid coming

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:25.510
out of the coke bottles was of
course some good Georgian wine.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:31.000 position:56%
And they were at the time building a
new retreat center for the faithful

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.040
who would come on pilgrimage.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.310 position:56%
There's Saint Nino's Spring in Bodbe

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.400
and there is a large
tank of water here.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:54.620
If you want to be fully sanctified,
you dunk your whole body in it,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:23:00.100
I just kind of washed my head
but others were more exuberant

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.900
in their piety than I was.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.650
This is down the hill from
the main cathedral of Bodbe

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.330
which means it's a
long climb back up.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:16.660
And the Ananuri Church which
is as Georgian churches go,

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:22.150
a fairly new one, only
about the 17th century

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:28.870 position:56%
and this was along the Aragvi River,
North of Mcxeta by an hour or so.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:34.330
I couldn't resist this
picture of the little fisherman

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.460
who had a very ambitious project.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.410
If he had filled that fishnet,

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.100
I think he would have had
fish to equal his own weight.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.950
Another of the churches that
has been rebuilt and this one

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.930
to some controversy, this-- the
ruins of this cathedral were

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.790
on the UNESCO list and
former President Mike--

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:07.530
Mikheil Saakashvili as one of
his projects and also a project

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:14.070
of the church was to have this
rebuilt and it has not been rebuilt

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:22.290 position:56%
to the specifications of many people
and much controversy has ensued.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:28.410
An excursion into the countryside
reveals dozens if not hundreds

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.310
of small basilica churches
that have been cobbled together

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:37.510
like that Antakya Church
in the past generation.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.060
One of the measures on taken--

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.120
undertaken by the church in
recent years is the repatriation

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.060
of all church buildings in the
Georgian territory of Svaneti.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.750
This relatively remote part
of the country that stretches

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.960
into the mountains and
all the way to the border

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.860
with the Russian Federation
is covered

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.240
with small basilica type churches.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.380
Many of these churches often
in the possession of families

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.500
within the villages had become
sites of non-Christian rituals.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.880
The past decade, the patriarchate
has successfully recovered most

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.490
of these for Christian worship.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.540
One source has indicated to me that
this was met with little opposition

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.070
and that in fact, the residents
of Svaneti were grateful

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:32.240 position:56%
for the reestablishment of normative
Christian ritual and belief.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.740
This is one of those churches.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.850
A lot of these are about
900 or 1,000 years old.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.240
This is Nakipari which is on
the end of the Inguri River,

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.870
a church name for St. George.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:53.040
Svaneti is the only place
where I've seen churches

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.880
in honor of the prophet Jonah.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.980 position:56%
You will remember the whiney prophet
in the Hebrew Scriptures who--

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:10.040
whose famous line was, "Well,
God, I knew you'd change your mind

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.340
and you'd be nice to these people".

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.440
So perhaps, that is part
of the reason that Job

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.450
or Jonah gets churches
named for him.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:25.140
That's one of my favorite pictures.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.960
This is the Lamaria Church in
Ushguli which is just about as far

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.930
as you can get on the Georgian side
of the border as you're heading

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.480
into the Caucasus Mountains.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.390
There is a glacier around the
corner that feeds the Inguri River

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:47.310
that finally goes to the Black Sea.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.840
If you haven't been to
Svaneti, I recommend it.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.110
So, a little bit about
church-state relations.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.850
As noted above, when the Republic
of Georgia emerged from the rubble

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.430
of the Soviet Union as a
free and sovereign nation,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.460
the Orthodox Church found itself
in a new political context.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.860
After nearly seven decades
of militant and often crass

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.300
and bullying, government-sponsored
official atheism,

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.930
the Orthodox Church in Georgia
began again to exert its role

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:30.060
as a foundational institution
in Georgian society.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.660
This foundation was supported

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:37.430
by Georgia's first post-Soviet
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.990
who ironically was driven from
power nearly at the same time

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.860
that the Soviet Union
finally collapsed.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:51.150
He promoted a close relationship
with the Orthodox Church in part

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.490
as a guarantor of the Georgian
nation and its freedom.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.470
In the political speeches, he
reminded his listeners that Georgia

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:07.550 position:56%
as the lot, the word in Georgian is
[foreign language] of the Theotokos.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.360
This is a reference to the story

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.780
that the apostles including the
Virgin Mary had divided missionary

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:19.470
assignments up by casting
lots and Georgia fell to Mary.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.710
After a communication from her son
however, she came to understand

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.080
that she would not be able
to fulfill this mission

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.310
and Saint Andrew the
First-called took her place.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.750
This understanding of the
special protection of Georgia

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.540
by the Theotokos became an
important theme for the church

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.810
and its relationship to the nation.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.750
For the Orthodox Church in Georgia,
this has met not only a belief

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.880
in her protection but
a severe responsibility

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:58.670
to maintain the nation as worthy of
that protection in extreme cases.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.700
This is an issue for those who seek

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.410
to rid the nation of
its impure others.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:11.540
Gamsakhurdia's support had
been a little more than ironic,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:18.030 position:56%
steep as he was in the belief system
of Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:22.950
Articles in the Orthodox churches
press attacking Steinerism appeared

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.210
only years after Gamsakhurdia's
death.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.770
But it was clear that they
were kicking his corpse.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:36.750 position:56%
At first, the Republic of Georgia
operated under the 1921 Constitution

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.360
of the Democratic Republic
of Georgia

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.630
that had codified a
separation of church and state,

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.480
already in existence from the
early days of that republic,

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.300
a separation that have
actually been more separate

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.580
than the church had desired.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:59.650
Georgia adopted a new
constitution in 1995 several years

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.490
after Shevardnadze
had returned to power.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.370
This constitution enshrined
the Orthodox Church

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:12.610
as the first among equals,
freedom of religion is guaranteed,

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.250
but the constitution also speaks

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:20.810
of the historical precedence
of orthodoxy in Georgia.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.880
No other religion or Christian
denomination is mentioned

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.430
as having this sort of
historical relevance.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:34.340
Article 9 of the Constitution
as amended reads,

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:39.820
"The state proclaims the full
freedom of belief and confession

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:45.690
at the same time, acknowledging the
special role Georgia's apostolic

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.950
autocephalous Orthodox Church
has played in Georgia's history

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:58.310
and its-- and also recognizes
its independence from the state.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.230
The relationship of Georgia's state

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:07.150
and Georgia's apostolic
autocephalous Orthodox Church is

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:12.180
to be defined by a
constitutional concordat.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.170
The constitutional concordant--

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.740
concordat is to be
consistent in general

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:23.590
with all internationally-recognized
principles and norms,

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:28.680
specifically in the sphere
of fundamental human rights.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.320
This constitutionally-mandated
concordat between the government

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.400
and the church was eventually
signed on October 14th,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:44.060
2002 by President Shevardnadze
and Patriarch Catholicos Ilia II

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.020
at the Church of the
Living pillar Svetitskhoveli

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.570 position:56%
in the old capital city of Mtskheta.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.780 position:56%
This document provided details for
the relationship of church and state

00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:02.350 position:56%
in Georgia and ratified its primary
status above other religious groups,

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:07.930 position:56%
specifically the special status of
the church, included tax exemptions,

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.410
clerical release from
military service

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:15.860
and a special legal
status for the patriarch.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.260
A commentary on the concordat,
its title translated into English,

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:25.720
Commentaries on the Constitutional
Concordat between the Government

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:31.910
of Georgia and Georgia's Apostolic
Autocephalous Orthodox Church,

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:36.000
was written by Davit Cikvaize.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.490
He promoted the idea that the
concordat have made the Orthodox

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.700
Church in Georgia the
official state church.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.370
While, I do not believe
this is technically

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.600
so the Orthodox Church
is often operated

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.980
as though it had been made such.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.980
This is especially noted in
its reported interference

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:04.610
in the property rights of other
churches and religious communities.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:08.410
The ambiguity concerning the
status of other religions

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:12.660
and other Christian denominations
was somewhat nearly rated

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:18.710
with the religious law that
came into effect in July 2012.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.010
The first two readings

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:24.110
of this legislation had
included only what was referred

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:29.800
to in some documents as the seven
historic religious communities,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:35.540
orthodoxy, Catholicism, the
Lutherans, Baptists, Jews, Muslims

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.540
and the Armenian Apostolic Church.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.140
Jews have been present in Georgia

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.170
and other South Caucasian
territories since early

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:49.740
after the Babylonian captivity.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:55.720 position:56%
Muslims, since the second generation
after Mohammed and Armenian

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:01.190
and Georgian Christians have lived
intermingled since the early days

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.220
of Christianity in
the South Caucasus.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:10.710
Catholic missionaries were present
in Georgia in medieval times.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:15.570
Baptists and Lutherans have been
present since the 19th century

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.410
and as a result of
religious movements coming

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.030
by way of the Russian empire.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.640
In between the second and
third readings of the 2012 Law,

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.370
the Committee on European
Integration widely expanded the

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.260
number of religious
communities to conform

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.130
to those recognized by
the European Council.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:41.000
The Orthodox Church had not
been consulted on this change

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.620
and reacted adversely to the
broad expansion of the new law.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.350
After some reconsiderations
of its public stance,

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.080
the Senate of the Orthodox
Church in Georgia backed

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.310
down from its most severe
criticism of the new law.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.080
At this point, the church
seemed to have realized

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.530
that its overreach was
leading to bad publicity,

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:08.930
not only in Georgia
but around the world.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.630
At the same time, the
Senate insisted

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.350
that the parliament
should consult with it

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:18.650
when laws affecting religion
were under consideration.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:23.970
There is generally an ongoing
in complex relationship

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.860
of the Orthodox Church in
Georgia with not only its place

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.800
in the nation, but also its
relationship with the government

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.650
that promotes a European or a
Western orientation complete

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.670
with the promotion of
civil and human rights.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:45.800
The Orthodox Church in this time
of independence has been anxious

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.200
about the way in which they
understand how freedom can quickly

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.420
become a free for all sort

00:35:54.420 --> 00:36:01.130
of attitude toward
ethical and moral norms.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.610
There is no question that the
Orthodox Church is the most

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:08.190
respected institution
in Georgian society

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:13.660
and that Patriarch Catholicos Ilia
II is the most respected individual

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.580
in the Republic of Georgia.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.490
This has been so for
most of the years

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.650
since Georgia regained
its independence.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:26.970 position:56%
It is as much so now as the campaign

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:31.780 position:56%
for the October Parliamentary
Elections have revealed a widespread

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.210
disdain for many of the political
parties and coalitions currently

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.580
in the Georgian Parliament.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.980
On the other hand, it has been
difficult for the Orthodox Church

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:50.490
as for churches of many sorts
in post-Soviet states to adjust

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:55.110
to the new social and political
realities of the late 20th

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.320
and early 21st centuries.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.100
The effect of seven decades
of Soviet rule on Georgia,

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.720
in the Georgia on the
Orthodox Church

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.580
and other religious communities
cannot be overestimated.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.480
Once of the historical developments
or better, non-developments

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.250
of the Orthodox churches in
Soviet time and space was

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:24.100
that it prevented these communities
from the sort of modern discussion

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.860
and debates that characterized
Christianity in other parts

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.930
of the world in that century.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:36.050
In the few churches that
survived the Communist regime,

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:42.090
liturgy was preserved but talk of
modernizing liturgical language

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.420
or the education of
faithful or involvement

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.690
in social activities was forbidden.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:54.680
After the fall of the Soviet Union,
the Orthodox Church in Georgia,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.800 position:56%
in response to the dire economic and
social needs of the Georgian people,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.140
became involved again
in the social sphere.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:09.380
Since 1994, the church's Lazarus
Foundation has been a mainstay

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.700
of large-scale relief
work in society.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.160
One of the more difficult
adjustments

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.860
in this new time has
involved ecumenical relations.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:25.730
For a time, the church in Georgia
played a role, if only a small one

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.960
in the global ecumenical movement.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:34.990
Ilia II was for time a president
of the World Council of Churches.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.300
While this title did not mean
that he was involved in the day

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:43.970
to day operations of the council,
the position was a recognition

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:48.380
of Ilia II's important
and the revival of post--

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.870
of the churches in
post-Soviet space.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:58.510
In the 1990s, the Orthodox churches
in general and the Orthodox Church

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.830
in Georgia in particular,
began more closely

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:08.400
to assess their participation in
dialog with other Christian bodies.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.890
Some of the non-canonical churches
calling themselves Orthodox had

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:18.470
proclaimed ecumenism a heresy and
this notion began to be expressed

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:27.720 position:56%
in all parts of orthodoxy including
Georgia's two non-canonical Orthodox

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.920
churches that have
existed in Georgia.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.590
One of them styled at first as the
true Orthodox Church of Georgia,

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:42.120
was under the authority of--
the Metropolitan of Boston.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.680
Yes, Boston, Massachusetts,
at the Monastery

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.700
of the Holy Transfiguration
in Brooklyn, Massachusetts.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.690
The other was led-- the other was
a small group led by the violent

00:39:55.690 --> 00:40:00.120
and notorious Father
Basil Mkalavishvili

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.820
and under the authority of a
Schismatic Greek Church known

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.640
as the Synod of Resistance.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.180
Some of the monks of the Orthodox
Church were also almost in schism

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.670
from the main church over
the issue of ecumenism.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.010
Their influence was part of
the Georgian church's decision

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.120
to leave both the World Council
of Churches and the Conference

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.720
of European Churches in 1997.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.670
Officially, the Georgian Synod
cited that, "World Council

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:42.220
of Churches leaderships continued
efforts to endow the organization

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:48.180
with unified ecclesiological
functions", and the WCC's alleged

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:55.690
"failure to take interests of the
Orthodox Church fully into account"

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.530
as reasons for their action.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.840
Many of the anti-ecumenical
monks were disciplined

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.910
for their rebellion
despite the fact that some

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.870
of their agenda was enacted
and has remained the position

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:13.250
of the Orthodox Church
in Georgia ever since.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:18.850
As an example of this in
the preliminary meetings

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.800
of the Orthodox churches
for the Holy and Great Synod

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.490
of the Orthodox Church
soon to take place on Crete

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:32.660 position:56%
and in subsequent articles, Georgian
authors have been very critical

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.490
of any ongoing dialog
with other communities

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.200
who call themselves Christian.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.880
Their first point and
really their only point is

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:49.220
that there can only be one holy
Catholic and Apostolic church

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:54.370
and that all the heterodox
are therefore not the church.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:42:00.560
They have also encouraged the
designation of ecumenism as heresy.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.210
This of course has
also repercussions

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.370
in how the Orthodox Church
deals with the other Christians

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:13.390
and non-Christians in
the Republic of Georgia.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:18.860 position:56%
One of my sources said well, they're
actually doing business for Moscow,

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.650
the Moscow Patriarchate

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:26.010
and the Russian church while
the Russian church can look--

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:32.350
can have its hands clean from
disrupting the Great Synod.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.850
Another large conflict
of the Orthodox Church

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:39.680
in Georgia has involved a
small LGBT community there.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.600
This conflict came to a
head on May 17, 21013.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.150
A small group of demonstrators,
only a couple of dozen

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.880
at the most had gathered in Tbilisi

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.770
to observe the international
day against homophobia.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:02.030
They were besieged by a huge
counterdemonstration led

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:06.370
by Orthodox priests
all of whom priests

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:10.080
and other demonstrators
were breathing violence

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.660
against the first group.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.830
Those observing the Idaho
Day as its called fearing

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:22.980
for their very lives were
hustled on to buses by police.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:28.990
The Orthodox Church has since named
the 17th of May to be Family Day.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.540
This year, it was observed by the
presence of the World Congress

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:37.760
of Families, a group founded
in the United States encouraged

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:43.680
by official Russia and a group that
has been designated a hate group

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.160
by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:53.500
Now, I recognize that this issue is
one of no small controversy and one

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.950
that cannot be dealt
with at length here.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:02.040
I would drop one observation
however into the mix.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.820
Some officials of the
Orthodox Church referred

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.560
to homosexuality as a disease.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.760 position:56%
They do not necessarily however
mean this as an individual's disease

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.540
which would then elicit
a pastoral response

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.890
but rather they consider the
disease of the body politic,

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:27.560
that must therefore be
eradicated from the nation in order

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.040
to avoid apocalyptic consequences.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.580
That's another talk altogether.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.500
But since we are at the
Library of Congress,

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:44.430
I thought it would be appropriate
to do some bibliographic work,

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:47.390
specifically to speak of some
of the resources published

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.680
by the Orthodox Church in Georgia.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.920
Periodical literatures slowly
began to become available

00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:01.750
in the late 1980s and early
1990s published by the church.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:07.240
There were also other pub-- also
other religious publications,

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.030
there was something called
the Old Orthodox Union

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:16.800
that was publishing newspapers
in the summer of 1990.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:23.660
They were off the charts
obscurantists.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.150
Where the first journals was
called [inaudible] is the Cross

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.890
of the Grapevine will reference
to the cross of St. Nino

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:36.830
that is described in hagiography,
first published in 1989.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.890
An important newspaper Motley
[assumed spelling] or Grace

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:44.920
as you here, appeared
first in April 1990.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.810
These and other publications
has this primary goal,

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:52.580 position:56%
the basic education of the faithful,
who had generally been prohibited

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.410
from learning much of
anything about their faith.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:46:01.720
Some had been baptized along the
way, a phenomenon not unknown

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.790
in other churches across
the Soviet Union,

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:08.330
but were still ignorant
of the fundamentals.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:12.040
As the Georgian economy
strengthened at the beginning

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.720
of the 20th century, and
into its second decade,

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:22.640
the number of magazines and
journals proliferated in Georgia.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.940
One of my acquisition goals has
been to acquire serial publications

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.460
of all sorts but especially
religious ones.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.810
I have been able to buy issues
of the periodical published

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:41.250
by the eparchy in Svaneti
in farthest Ushguli

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.550
at the Lamaria Church that
was in the picture just

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:48.000
in the shadow of the glaciers.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:57.810 position:56%
And certainly, this is a sign of the
revival of the orthodoxy in Svaneti.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.530
Just a sample of the others,

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.580
there's something called
Erti Kadageba, Once Sermon.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:08.770
As the title indicates, it's
One Sermon by the patriarch

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:12.830
or by an archbishop or a
bishop or a priest or a monk

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.590 position:56%
and these come out quite frequently.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:24.060
At one time, there is something
called Kvakutxedi or cornerstone.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:29.790
This builds itself as a
national religious journal

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:36.360 position:56%
and so it's a little bit more on the
conservative side wherein the church

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.490
and the idea of church and nation,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.230
church and state is
much more tightly held.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:45.790
Some of these, I don't know if
they're in publication anymore,

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.880
I didn't-- I certainly
didn't see all of these

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.950
when I was there earlier
in May this year.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:56.060
Maxvili Mesiisa, the
Sword of the Messiah

00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:07.020 position:56%
and this is the official publication
of the Urbnisi and Ruisi Eparchy

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:11.840
which is Northwest of Tbilisi.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.700
I'm sorry, Mcqemsi Keteli,

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:23.030
Good Shepherd which is
just a general publication.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:28.640 position:56%
Krialosani or Prayer Beads,
another publication that tends to be

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:34.440
on the conservative side, Pudze or
foundation, and this is especially

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.190
for Georgians who live
outside of Georgia.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:44.870
This and another one of-- with the
same goal could be found generally

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:50.020
only at the big Church of the
Holy Trinity with the idea

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.490
of the pilgrims visiting
the homeland,

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:55.530
would certainly visit the
new cathedral and there,

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.780
they could buy these publications.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:02.340
I didn't see either
one of them last month.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:15.330
Natlia or godparent, Axalgazrdoba,
especially for youth, Tanamemamule,

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:20.800
which means compatriot
was another publication

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.120
for Georgians living
outside of Georgia.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.900
And as some of the
Georgians will know,

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.390
the any Georgian living outside

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:39.510
of Georgia is only temporarily
living outside of Georgia.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:45.470
His holiness and the attitude, Ilia
II and some of his pastoral letters

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:49.330
in the long list of
people he is addressing,

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:54.750
will refer to those Georgians
temporarily living outside

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.050
of the homeland.

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:03.900
This is Gza da Cheshmariteba,
The Way and Truth

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.270
which is the official paper of
the Alaverdi Diocese that is

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:14.860
in Eastern Georgia, you can buy
some of the monks' honey here.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:21.740 position:56%
The church has been-- has been
redone since the first time I saw it

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:28.260
in 1990 when it was-- the inside
was all taken up with scaffolding

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:33.380
of the sort that made my fear
of heights much exaggerated.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:43.800
Aliluia, a children's
publication and Maqvlovani.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.370
This refers to the bramble bush

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:53.530
under which St. Nino lived during
her early years in Mtskheta

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:59.160
but it's also the word that's used
for the bramble bush in Exodus 3

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:06.300
where Moses encounters the
Divine Being in the burning bush

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:13.130
and as we know, the burning bush
is a type of a prefiguration

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:15.730
of the Virgin Mary,
that is something

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:24.560
in which divinity was enclosed
but was not consumed by divinity.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.080
So, we've got Saint Nino and Moses

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.300
and the blessed Virgin Mary
all expressed and the title

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:37.680
of this journal put out by the
women's monastery in Mtskheta.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.880
This then has been a very short
précis of the Orthodox Church

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:47.270
in Georgia in some of its growth
into the leading institution

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:53.540
in Georgian society and a brief
introduction to some of the issues

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:58.130
that this church has faced
in this first generation

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.540
of Georgia's new independence.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:06.590

a few minutes for questions.

Part of it is architectural, I
didn't show you the backside of it

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.770
which has some modifications
that basically,

00:52:54.770 --> 00:53:01.760
I think what they did was they put
a part of the old ruins on the side

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:08.280
of the church in an enclosure that
doesn't match anything, in a dark--

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.070
I think mostly glass
enclosure, right.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:17.770
But it looks out of place and
of course, on the UNESCO list

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:23.030
of things, rebuilding things
from ruins is essentially a no-no

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:28.280
but I suppose I do side
with the church on this one

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.080
that the most important thing about
a church is that you can use it

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.870
and being ruins, you can't
use it so you fix it.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:42.360

better but that's the principle.

assessment of people who don't

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:32.050
like the church at all but there
is a problem with education

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:37.110
because the theological educational
institutions just weren't there.

on ecumenism.

Oh, by older people sometimes but
it's so different from what it was.

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:27.320
I mean, having been there in
1990 and having returned 10 times

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:34.620
after that, I would never go back
to the empty shelves of 1990.

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:38.770

difficult years in the early '90s

in Georgia but-- and
there's still difficulties

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:47.520

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:57.080
like former Prime Minister Bidzina
Ivanishvili who have so much money

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:03.610 position:56%
that in his well, I can only call
it a palace and my reference is too,

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:11.660
well, if you watched the Jetsons
and if you wanted to design a house

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:14.420
of a rich man on a
hill that would fit

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:17.240
into the Jetsons, this would be it.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:23.960 position:56%
He has a shark at least, and a
zebra and penguins in this building.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:29.910
And he also has a place out in
Western Georgia and recently,

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:33.910
there were pictures of a large tree

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:43.070 position:56%
that he had uprooted somewhere being
taken on a barge over the Black Sea

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:46.890
to wherever it was going
to be transplanted.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.210
But that's Bidzina.

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:51.630
&gt;&gt; Levon Avnoyan: Yeah?

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.190
Stay here.

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:57.420
All right, this has
been as I said for me

00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:02.550
to introduce Paul who's not only
a valued colleague but a friend.

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:09.450 position:56%
I think he will agree with me when I
say that Georgia is a place you want

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:16.990
to visit, you have to visit and
you will always remember visiting.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.590
It's-- It is special place
along with Armenia and Georgia,

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.160
special place in both our hearts.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.850
I want to thank Dr. Crego
for a superb lecture.

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:28.410
I would love to thank
you for coming,

00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:31.720
especially on this hot holiday week

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.560
and I hope you'll consider
visiting the African

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.190
and Middle Eastern
Division to do your research

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:39.280
or just to visit in a few trips.

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:43.930
And on June 10th, please
consider attending these--

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:48.170
the all-day seminar
conference on the Assyrians,

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:51.000
the modern day Assyrians
and Paul, thank you so much.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.800
&gt;&gt; Paul Crego: You're welcome.

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:58.870
[ Applause ]

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:02.530
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
