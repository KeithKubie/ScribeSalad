00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.590
 Hello Android Developer Program engine in Android Develles 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.660
 Today, we will introduce the action bar compact library. 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 We will. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.279
 As you know, the action bar is the most important element in Android ears 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.239
 But it is only available in later versions of Honeycomb 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.410
 As a result, many developers use Action Library external libraries 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.309
 There is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.570
 ActionMAX Compact uses Action Foot 3 in Android 2.1 and later versions 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.020
 It is the official library of the Android team that supports the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 Is designed to be as close as possible to the most up-to-date api 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.420
 If you use this, you can easily wear the horse in the previous version of Honeycomb 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.240
 There is 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.410
 First of all, how do you add ActionMac Compact to your project? 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.040
 I'll see. 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.059
 If you are using the latest version of Android Studio, 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.950
 If you check the action bar of support mode when you create it, 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.210
 You can use rival 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:11.050
 If you are adding an action machine in an existing project, 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.610
 If you are using a sdk manager, 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:19.000
 Once you've installed it, you can add the following line to the build file: 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.590
 Or you can add it directly to your library project 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.899
 If you install Soft Live via the stk manager, 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.490
 The compact library project is installed 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:34.210
 You can add this library project to your shell project 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.619
 Let's take a look at an actual example of using the action bar compact 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:42.009
 This very common one has a sdk value of 14 and already uses action words 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.649
 You can also use the Action's computer library 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:49.240
 Imagine you want to modify it to work 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.429
 The bosses would like it very much. To apply the action bar com bat, 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 I need to do some chores for that. 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.939
 First, how to change the news file expressed in xml format 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.549
 Let's take a look. 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.270
 First you need to change the activity theme 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.270
 If you want to use Action Only Compact, 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.799
 You must use one of the following three themes 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.780
 The AppCompact theme is a dark theme with background color and action bar mode. 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:21.910
 Light Theme is a background color action bar mode is a bright theme fit light dark 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.750
 The action horse theme surprisingly has the background color, but only the action is the dark theme 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.799
 Theme can be applied to modify 2 def test 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.110
 Existing hall will find the designated part of the theme, 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.920
 You can modify it as applied. 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.790
 One thing to use when designing an app compact theme is not to use the Android namespace 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.450
 not 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.600
 The App Compact theme is not included with the Android platform, 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:48.960
 The theme that is included in the support library project to be added directly. 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:53.550
 This is because you are defined in the plate squirrel you are working on 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:58.650
 So let's look at some more complicated cases to make a cool app with a default theme 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:02.070
 There are many cases where you have used an extended custom theme. 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 Theme is a custom theme that changes the color of the action bar slightly. 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.440
 Let's modify it to Action compact type theme. 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.190
 Action Bar To create a compact theme, remember that in fact, 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.660
 It's possible 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:19.560
 First, use one of the three themes described above as the parent theme 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.280
 Second, all property values ​​depend on the Android version, and the Android namespace 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.090
 Repeat two times with and without 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.080
 So let's modify the theme file in principle. 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.510
 The first principle is that instead of the Hollywood Night theme used in the existing theme 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.800
 Modify to use the Compact Light theme 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.870
 The second principle is to use version 10 of Sculpire, 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.530
 Create a style file 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.480
 If you are already on the Android platform with action level 14 or higher 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.140
 All attribute values ​​are defined 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.080
 So for version 14 2 4, use the Android namespace 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.220
 You can specify the attribute values ​​associated with the action 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.990
 However, if you are at api level 24 or earlier, 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.190
 Property does not exist 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.650
 To convey this, the ActionBar compact includes the attributes supported by the latest platform 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.640
 An attribute with the same name is defined 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.420
 These properties are the name of the project, 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.459
 You can use totem space without specifying space 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.789
 can 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.320
 Next, you can see how the menu item can be defined as a mother compact 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.520
 Let's take a look. 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.259
 In general, an action button is an action button. 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.919
 You can add 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:31.169
 In ActionMac Compact, you can also use the menu item 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.009
 o Plum action can be added 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:39.090
 One thing to note, however, is that the action 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.050
 The unique properties used only in the action bar are available in previous versions of Honeycomb 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.070
 Because there is no 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:48.330
 You need to use the attributes defined in your machine. 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.930
 Similarly, instead of the Android namespace, the default namespace or your m 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.160
 You need to leverage the namespace. 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:00.270
 Next, let's take a look at the variations in the actual code 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.610
 First of all, by default, how application activities should be changed 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.570
 Let's take a look at it. 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.400
 First, instead of the active activity class, 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.810
 Must be inherited and implemented 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 This class includes the Cat class provided in the latest activity class for high compatibility 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.790
 Action barstart The same action mode as the action bar action bar the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.080
 It is given the same name as the often mode 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:29.280
 In order to actually add an action button only to an action, 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.170
 In the callout function in the crate options menu, 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.350
 You can plate 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:38.730
 There is no big difference when you use an action bar computer 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:43.560
 However, as in this example, 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:48.060
 Action View 2 Suddenly, like the action provider, the ice cream sandwich 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:52.110
 Because it is added to the reason, it can not be used in the previous version 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:56.760
 To support this, the fashion magazine compact library has a menu item compact 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.970
 A helper class is provided, and the class is a static method of 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:04.650
 Methods like can action provider are defined 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:08.639
 If you are using an action bar computer, please use this method 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.710
 If you display the action bar fix foot or use the church window feature 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.940
 I need a little fix 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.660
 First of all, in the request bin duffy point provided by the default activity, 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:23.190
 You must use the Forty Quest in the feature method in your activity 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:27.300
 In order to display the progress bar, 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:30.509
 Vindindine vitamin app house instead of team 3 support progras 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.380
 The bind terminator can be used with the get get method 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:38.370
 In addition, ActionMaine has a variety of support 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.470
 Series methods are provided, so take a look at the documentation before development. 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.280
 It seems good 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.889
 Next, when you use fragments, 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.800
 You can use fragments in place 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:54.210
 If you want to pursue an action bar action button etc. through the frame 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:57.930
 On the concrete pipe line, call the 3-legged option menu and press the on 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.449
 Override crates option 2 or on-pre-pair options 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:04.190
 You can add any menu item you want. 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:07.430
 There are no major differences from existing activities. 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:11.000
 In addition, the action bar supports various functions. 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.220
 See how the Actions bar compact can take advantage of these features 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.940
 Let's take a look. 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.039
 First, the action bar activity is one of the new Android design patterns 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.909
 Support for navigation 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:27.259
 Just like in the case of using the key m in days, 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:31.250
 Use the number of turns to toggle the x field included in the packaging support library 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:33.889
 After you create the class, you come in to listen to the generated auto-layout 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:38.569
 So you can register. 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:40.669
 The navigation of the relief is largely divided into the encyclopedia which goes into the previous screen 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:44.780
 You can buy it back 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:49.039
 Platform navigation related to platform api from 4.1 onwards 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:51.229
 Although it is supported, the action bar is convenient even in the previous version if you use the compact rival 

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:55.370
 MOM can implement navigation 

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:59.629
 First, in order to use moth navigation on the activity, 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:03.770
 If you invoke the connectable method on your home and you are on a platform higher than version 16 

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:04.849
 Newly added to the Manifest's Kim Tae-hee, 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.539
 Please specify 

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:10.969
 This child platform has the same name metadata 

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:15.529
 You can add 

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:18.080
 Next, the share action provider can easily 

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:22.250
 A widget to help you share 

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.240
 Click the Share button, a pop-up appears, and the user 

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:27.820
 can 

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:31.270
 You can easily find it in various Android apps including gallery elle 

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.080
 The chair action provider is also available with ActionMac Compact and Rogue versions 

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.770
 There is 

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.360
 Surfer tribal library spreads Hair action prominer to be included in SEVEN 

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:41.650
 You can use the class 

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:46.450
 When defining menu item properties on exem, 

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:50.830
 Instead of the namespace, you can use the default namespace defined by your app 

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:54.130
 It is usually part of the following related code: 

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.450
 You can use the action provider methods to add additional functionality to the auction provider. 

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.720
 I will implement it. 

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:03.040
 Since two major action providers are available methods after honeycomb 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:07.060
 If you are using an action bar computer, 

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.860
 Using the action method of the action action action provider of the compact f class 

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:13.090
 You must 

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:17.410
 Split action As with many portrait modes, 

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:20.500
 If an action does not have enough space to display the damage action button, 

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:24.610
 Create action words and show remaining actions 

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:29.140
 To use the Spring Action Bar feature, you need to do two things 

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:31.210
 First of all, for API devices after version 14, 

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:35.170
 Add optional attribute values 

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:36.970
 This attribute is meaningful only in later versions of the ice cream sandwich, 

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.810
 Ignored in version 

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:46.290
 Next, to support previous versions of Android, 

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:50.579
 It adds support for Metadata to Activity 4 by option. 

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:52.980
 Search b is a widget implemented so that users can input a search word. 

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:56.459
 Seven Surfer Tribe is implemented 

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.389
 Super compact is also implemented version Seven library, so you can easily apply 

00:09:56.459 --> 00:10:01.649
 can 

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:05.490
 However, in case of punishment in search b class, api level 8 or higher 

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:09.209
 Please note that you can use 

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:11.459
 Finally, let's look at some useful tools that can be used with ActionMac computers. 

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:15.149
 I'll do it 

00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:19.139
 Action bar style Zen Light is an action foot customizer 

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:22.079
 You can change the color of each item to your desired color 

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:26.100
 You can download the results at once 

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:29.810
 At this time, when claiming assoc compact in the style com family t item, only action 

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:33.710
 A compact style file is created. 

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:37.660
 Action Marf Story Flash is a program that pushes down the list to update its contents. 

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:41.840
 This is an open source project that implements the Android design pattern. 

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:46.100
 I can check it in the latest Google apps, including updated luggage and labs. 

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:50.250
 Sharp let live also supports action compact, so your 

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:54.060
 You can easily apply the Bay pattern 

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:57.990
 So far, I've just introduced the action bar compact. 

00:10:54.060 --> 00:11:01.050
 You do not need bugs or extra features when you use them. 

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:04.920
 Please leave a bug report on the calcareous site 

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:09.890
 And inside the inner make-up action bar, including the Android design guide 

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.890
 Thank you for your reference.
