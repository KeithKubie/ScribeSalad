1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,370
That were worried about ecosystems
that we really are, that's fine.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,920
That's where we're worried about
invasive species on when new species get

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,600
introduced to new ecosystems.

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,030
It's like we were just
talking about this yesterday.

5
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:17,031
A everglades like people
are doing whatever the fuck
they can to get the pythons

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,960
and the African roots.
They,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,460
these assholes have released pythons and
there's a real fucking redneck Jurassic

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:28,080
park going on in the middle of Florida.
Yeah, we care. Yeah. I lived in Miami man.

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:31,610
And at the time I lived in Miami. Talk
about did radio out there, right? Yeah.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,620
Why 100 miles after fear factor after
fear factor lay into me that big gig after

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,280
all dog food back there. Well radio was
radio back though. Oh, he's real. It was,

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,610
it was like huge man.
Uh,

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,650
but I remember they had these lakes and
if you go back like 10 years ago and

14
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:49,854
look up Florida,

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,510
people were just jogging around lakes
getting snatched by alligators. Yeah.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,050
Alligators did not give a damn. They
would just snatching people. Yeah.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,190
And I was like, why are
people jogging? Like,

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,440
really? I like stopped jogging. Well,
definitely don't jog near the water. No.

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,460
And that's the thing,

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,720
like I believe like eight people
within six months got snatched.

21
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:17,310
Just jogging my real, oh, 100%.
Probably about eight to 10 years ago,

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
just jogging.
I didn't know that.

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,080
That there was that many
deaths ever from alcohol. Yeah,

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,610
there were getting snacks.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,640
One of my favorite ones was a guy who
was running from the cops near Miami and

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,490
he was in a stolen car,
parked his car on a bridge,

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,410
jumped off the bridge and landed
on an alligator. Alligator.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,700
Jacked him in front of the cops and they
were just sitting there going, well,

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,920
there you go.
Guilty.

30
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,000
Imagine that jumps off the bridge.
Splash.

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,400
That would be this. Oh my God, Dude. Oh,

32
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,400
that guy I didn't even notice until
last minute. No, that's what I'm saying.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Like that happens in Florida at that time.
That is so crazy.

34
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:02,910
That is such a big thing that
eats deer and shit. Look at,

35
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:07,140
it opens its mouth on him, but meanwhile
it tries to get away from people. Well,

36
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:11,760
what's interesting to do,
didn't even speed up. Yeah.
Like, I'm just gonna talk off,

37
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,290
probably really tired.
He was on it for a while

38
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,300
to fuck these things,
man. Fuck these things.

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,440
But the craziest thing is we were showing
it yesterday that pythons eat them

40
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,490
alligators hole but not dude one python
eight this fucking big ass alligator and

41
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,590
it blew its body apart.

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,220
Apparently another aligator came along
while it had it in its body and tried to

43
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,090
eat the python.

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,830
And so then it was like this disaster of
a python with an alligator inside of it

45
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,960
with no head.
Oh yeah man.

46
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,810
But the whole thing was that this python
at eight the I'll get and then once

47
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:49,050
they eat it, they can't move cause
they gotta fucking 900 pound alligator.

48
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:53,490
But you love that shit. I can't take that.
I know you do. You do problem with, um,

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,730
I just,
I do lots of animals eating other animals.

50
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:59,740
Like think it's important to
recognize that we're, we're,

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,150
we're very insulated from what the
fuck is going on by cities. Yes.

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,010
And that in houses and cities and
even towns, even if you have a town,

53
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:10,570
it's rare that a fucking wild Predator
makes its way into your town, but man,

54
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,960
that's the whole rest of the world. That's
the whole world, including the ocean.

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,250
Everywhere is all just predators and prey.
Predators and prey. Predators and prey.

56
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,980
We've figured out a way to
insult, but, but in insulation,

57
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,320
the problem is when
we're isolated from it,

58
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,270
we neglect it as an aspect of nature.
We put it in some weird box like,

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,230
oh my God, this is weird. No, that's not
weird. That's normal. That's normal life.

60
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,640
Normal life is big things.

61
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:37,780
Eating littler things you don't respect
it got really don't respect it when you

62
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,440
don't see it. Like, yeah, my
parents want to go to Africa
on a safari. I'm like, man,

63
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,870
you can have that. Yeah, I
would go if I got one of them,

64
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:47,730
like Jurassic Park mobiles that
they have with, it's all a circle

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,220
roll around the [inaudible].
Can you say that?

66
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,710
You see these people are
just in regular jeeps,

67
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,810
jeeps where lions just walking
by. I was like, how dumb are you?

68
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,690
And most of the time nothing
happens. No most, most of it.

69
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:06,400
But it could be one or two times where if
you're in it, you know until years ago,

70
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,170
a woman who worked on game of Thrones,

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,110
she was there on vacation and she got
pulled out of her fucking cuss. Right?

72
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,470
She rolled down the window to take a
picture in the cat came and snatched her

73
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,740
out of the car. But don't you think
people kind of liked that deserve it?

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Like people that roll down
windows and not safer?

75
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,250
Like that's like people jumping in the
pit at the zoo the other day to take a

76
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:28,120
selfie. The roll down the windows
thing I think is really just,

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,660
it's what we're talking about that
you're not around it enough so you don't

78
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:34,420
understand what it is. But do you
have to be around it to know that hey,

79
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:37,480
these are wild animals and think
they can get away with shit.

80
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,570
They've never had anything happen to them.
Like if they've never been punched,

81
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,930
oh this, this, this is a cheetah.
Cheetah's are actually not.

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,320
They're actually very curious
and then not dangerous to people.

83
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:51,550
So this dude has no idea this thing is
in his backseat. No, he's filming it. Oh,

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,270
he's filming it. So that's why he's
not moving. The tool don't move.

85
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,660
I think so man.
I think the move is don't move.

86
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,590
You don't want to scare them.
You definitely don't want
to go, hey man, no fuck.

87
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,160
You don't want to do that and
have a fucking rip your face off.

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,090
They don't have flaws.
They don't have claws like a cat does.

89
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,910
They're more like a dog. Yeah. You
know, there are a weird animal.

90
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,440
They're like a weird cat dog thing.
You know, there's super, super fast.

91
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,630
Like I've never seen one run in real life,

92
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,420
but apparently people who I
know that I've seen it say,

93
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:26,470
you can't believe how fast it is. You
know? One thing that blew me away,

94
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,370
I was reading about it,

95
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:31,720
that hippopotamuses kill more people
a year than all the animals combined.

96
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,700
All of them. All of
them. Yeah. All of them.

97
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,130
It's just like people
just like don't respect.

98
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:41,131
Hippopotamus is they're fast and they're
strong and they'll rip you apart.

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,350
They're like a giant pig.
Yeah.

100
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,740
They're in the pig family cousin
to a pig or some shit. Yeah.

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,720
And they're vegetarians. Yeah.
Like they're just killing people.

102
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,880
Estimated 500 people per year. And
that guy, they killed five, 500 a year.

103
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,030
They're aggressive and they're very
sharp teeth. And not only that man,

104
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,410
people think there's 750
kilograms. What? What is that dude?

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,350
What's that in pounds. That's more than
5,000 pounds. 2.2 times that. So, yeah.

106
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,590
Oh my God. That's as well. People don't
respect cause they think they're slow to,

107
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,520
so when they see them,

108
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,730
I think they run like 24 25 miles per
hour were like a a hundred a person that

109
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,570
runs a 100 yard dash in the Olympics.

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,720
I think average around like 29 to 30
miles per hour in a way is hippos.

111
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,290
Oh 19 okay. So that's still
fast. Yeah. You're barely
getting away. Well that's me.

112
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,590
I probably can't run 90 miles an hour.
I know I could. I'll probably get eaten.

113
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,810
[inaudible] fuck.
Can you imagine?

114
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,090
You're like 20 yards away from
this thing and you're like, ah,

115
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:40,590
it's not going to be, and then
it just runs up on you. Well,

116
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,730
they say if you ever get chased by an
alligator too, the thing is to Juke them.

117
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,630
Go left and go. Right. I know.
Yeah. That picture's terrifying me.

118
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,750
That scares the shit out of me. That
scares the shit out of me. I mean,

119
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,880
look at that guy. He's, he's,

120
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,510
he's launching himself in the air trying
to get away from not look at that.

121
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,580
Yeah. They chase after boats in
the water. They swim fast. Yeah.

122
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:08,270
They try to fuck you up, man. They
try to fuck 500 people a year, dude.

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,740
Hippos husband sees hippo
bite out wife's heart. What?

124
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,760
Oh my God. Oh my God. You Mad.

125
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:21,500
You wife falls into the water and you
see the hippo rip open the rib cage. Oh,

126
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,390
I would be a hippo.
Punisher.

127
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,440
I would go back to Africa every year and
kill out every one. Every one of them.

128
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:31,070
I'd be responsible for hippo extinction.
They'd be like, you can't do that.

129
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,850
I'm like, but I'm Gunna stop me.

130
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,980
I'm killing all the hippos.
Why not?

131
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,230
I'm killing all the snakes
for if everybody and anyone
knew got killed the first

132
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,930
day that something gets killed
by a fucking python in Florida.

133
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,290
When a human gets jacked,
we should send in the marines.

134
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,830
Just go through the fucking
swamp and killed them all.

135
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,420
Just like they're the enemy.

136
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,160
You just get a giant line of human
beings go through and kill those fucking

137
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:03,020
serpents. They're in the Bible. Okay?
They're in the Bible. Snakes elite,

138
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:07,460
your baby, they will go
through your patch. Them all.

139
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,720
I mean are they get cocky with monsters
living in your fucking neighborhood?

140
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,570
Is there any purpose of them
though? Yeah, they kill rats,

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,560
but the problem is in that area,
it's not established for them.

142
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:22,190
So there was this rich ecosystem of
mammals and reptiles talking about

143
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,310
everglades right now.
Okay.

144
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,050
It used to be there was some snakes
like cotton mills and stuff like that,

145
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:28,340
and there's alligators,

146
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,420
but then there was like march
hares and raccoons and skunks.

147
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,800
God, they're all gone. They're
gone. There's nothing left.

148
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,190
There's just anacondas look at
the pythons and Nile crocodiles.

149
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,780
Now if this got, let me have
the one eating a fucking, well,

150
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,930
let me ask you some alligator
and be honest with me. If,

151
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,740
if that guy got eaten like a guy
that actually tracks reptiles,

152
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:55,380
do you feel sorry for him? Like if
you putting yourself in harm's yeah,

153
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:59,070
because I want that guy to be out there.
One don't can to kill those. Yeah.

154
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,400
Monsters. If you ever look into
an eye of a snake and you go, oh,

155
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,820
this thing doesn't give a fuck
about anybody. It's like it doesn't.

156
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,630
I was watching this video
of a crab and it's a crowd,

157
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,090
a mother crab just sitting
there eating its babies.

158
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,800
It had like thousands of babies all
around it that had just hatched like a

159
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
couple of weeks ago and it's just sitting
there eating it's babies and I'm like,

160
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,490
yeah, yeah. Fuck you.

161
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,070
You're going in the boiling water
and I'm going to crack you open your,

162
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,350
if I heard him scream when
they go in and dream. Oh yeah.

163
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
I don't think they're really screaming.

164
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:31,920
I think it's probably air
escaping their body. Look at this.

165
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:36,690
Can either look good or she's
eating her kids. This is crazy.

166
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,260
I was,

167
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,690
I was at a friend's house and they'd
caught crabs and they would throw them at

168
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,210
and I think they scream,
man. I think it's like, no,

169
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,920
I forget who had the vocal cords.
This is like, what does this,

170
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,320
what does Alan is video Jamie for people
to just listen. It says a monster.

171
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:52,770
Red Crab eats babies. The
dark side of nature. Yeah.

172
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,610
She's an asshole telling you Joe, you
think they scrape? They make a noise.

173
00:09:56,611 --> 00:10:00,870
When you put them in a hot boiling pot
of water. What is the bottom of her?

174
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,210
She's just got a charcoal
briquette stuck under her.

175
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,890
Doesn't that it looks like one of them.
The babies go there.

176
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,730
They can't see some in that.
Come right back out. So gross.

177
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,180
She's such an asshole. She was sitting
there eating her kids. He like that.

178
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,910
Anybody would give a fuck about crabs.
Oh No.

179
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,420
I'm going to sound like I don't
want them to go extinct, but I,

180
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,580
that's one animal that we in our house
kill ourselves and no one has a problem

181
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,840
with it. It's like if they
brought him a rabbit and you,

182
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,080
you gotta throw it in the water,
like fatal attraction.

183
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,890
If like that was the only way to keep,
nobody would eat wrap. No, no, no, no.

184
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,210
And we throw them in
like a lie. A lie, a lie.

185
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,300
I'm telling you, they're in the
water that most of the time,

186
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,900
most people don't even bother taking
off the mother. Lobsters. Lobsters.

187
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,820
We do not give a shit about lobster.
You

188
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,280
get in there,
get in there fucking bug you.
