00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.170
Sex and not dying. 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.730
That's what biology
is all about.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.510
And while the sex part is,
I'll grant you,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.000
a little bit sexier,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.690
not dying is
also really fantastic...

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.300
something that I, personally,
like to do every single day.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.610
I, personally, like to not
die in all sorts of ways.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.400
Like, I don't jump out of planes,
I don't go into active combat zones,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.110
I don't do heroin, but I can,
however, spend time wallowing

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.820
in filth with my cute
bacon-producing friends here

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.230
and not have to worry about dying.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.029
Because, somehow,
my body can handle a lot

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.050
of little devils on my hands,
in my air, in my food,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.920
little things that
literally want to kill me.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.829
There are more potential
human killers in this pig pen

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.300
than there are in all
of the world's prisons,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.059
but I don't have to worry about
it because of the elite team

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.829
of microscopic assassins
that live inside my body.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.129
My immune system.

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.059
Ahh! That was really
close to my hand!

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:57.089
You've heard of some of these
little ninjas, others maybe not,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.369
but everyone knows the work
they do by the trail of dead

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.739
that they leave behind.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.570
Pus, being the most
disgusting example.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.160
And the work these guys
do is pretty hardcore.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.150
They not only identify incoming
enemies, they eliminate them,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.190
and then they keep files on them,
in case their kind ever comes back.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.360
I don't want to freak
you out, but you, and I,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330
are covered in pathogens right now.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.790
And you really can't
blame them for wanting

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.760
to get a piece of your action.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.210
Your warm, high-energy, nutrient-
rich, salty, watery action.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.890
Your body is a theme
park for these guys,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.920
and although the majority
of organisms living inside you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.990
actually make your life more comfy,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.800
there are some less-helpful
viruses and organisms,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.570
from here on out
referred to as pathogens,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.960
that will want to turn your body
into a factory for their children.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.100
So let's avoid that!

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.960
We have two basic ways of doing it:

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.370
innate, or non-specific,
immunity that responds to all kinds

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.040
of pathogens the same
way and very quickly,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.560
whether your body has seen
that pathogen before or not.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.670
And your acquired, or adaptive,
immunity which develops

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.020
more slowly and requires
your body to learn the wily ways

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.210
of the pathogen
before it defeats it.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.720
Every animal has an innate
immune system, even sponges!

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.049
But only vertebrates
have the acquired kind.

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.709
You were born with your
innate immune system.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.629
And from the second you
wriggled your way out

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.780
of the sterile environment of
your Mom and into this germy,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.310
disgusting world, that system
has been protecting you.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.879
The thing about the innate
immune system is that

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.379
it doesn't care what it's killing.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.659
It doesn't worry about
whether it's offing a virus

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.790
or bacteria or fungus.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.779
Its job is to just keep
the enemy from getting in,

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.370
or once it's in,
to sneak up behind it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.389
and break its neck, ninja style.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.909
The first line of defense in
keeping sketchy characters out

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.159
are the skin and mucous membranes.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.870
The skin has so many
excellent functions,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.950
like keeping your organs in,
that it's easy to forget

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.389
that its primary purpose
is to keep things out.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.480
It's oily and kind of acidic,
and really not easy to penetrate.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.689
And I'm about to rock
your world with this,

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.310
but your digestive tract is also
technically the outside of you.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.519
Remember how our whole
bodies are basically

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.079
just a built around a tube, right?

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.540
Well, the inside of that tube
is exposed to as much weird,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.469
grody stuff as the
outside of the tube.

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.419
So, your body treats the digestive
tract like the front lines

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.879
of this war, which is one of
the reasons why your stomach

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.279
takes no prisoners with the
whole stomach acid situation.

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:17.159
In addition to things like skin,
we've also got mucous membranes

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.139
providing another barrier to
microbes trying to sneak in.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.269
Mucus membranes line all of
your internal surfaces that are

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.090
exposed to the outside like your
lungs and the inside of your nose,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.049
as well as some other parts
of your body like the inside

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.419
of your mouth, and your
eyelids and your sex organs.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.549
Mucous membranes unsurprisingly
produce mucus,

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.459
which is a viscous fluid,
you've probably heard of it,

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.999
and it traps microbes and
helps sweep them away.

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.079
This is why illness is so often
associated with such awe-inspiring

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.879
amounts of goop.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.019
Your second line of defense
is your inflammatory response.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.889
The honchos here are specialized
cells in your connective tissue

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.730
called mast cells that constantly
search for suspicious objects,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.189
usually unknown proteins, and
then release signaling molecules,

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.939
like histamine when they find them.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.709
Histamine makes your
blood vessels more permeable,

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.329
which allows a whole bunch of
fluid to flow to the affected area.

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.409
And that is what
causes inflammation,

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.359
but it also brings in a
crap-ton of white-blood cells,

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.340
infection-fighters, to go
all Balrog on whatever's

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.260
trying to make its way in.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.849
Now, this is great if you
get a splinter in your toe

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.470
or a bunch of viruses in your face,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.410
but sometimes something gets into
you that's not actually dangerous

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.640
like pollen or dust or,
like, a peanut

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.200
and your innate
immune system triggers

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.260
an inflammatory response anyway,
even though it's not a big deal.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.280
This is what we
call an allergic reaction,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.350
and you know what those are like

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.810
with the swelling, redness,
mucus production, itching,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.960
and occasionally a
little bit of death.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.570
So that is why we take
antihistamines to suppress

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.180
the histamine trigger so our
immune systems stop freaking out

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.720
about nothing, also,
that is why you should always

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.040
tell people when there
are peanuts in your cookies.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.330
Most of the immune system
activity that happens inside

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.810
your body's fortress is done
by white blood cells, or leukocytes.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.910
Leukocytes are awesome
for a lot of reasons,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.060
but one reason is they've
got full VIP access to anywhere

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.310
in the body that they want
to go, with the exception

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.610
of the central nervous system:
the brain and spinal cord,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.770
which are, for obvious reasons,
super high security areas.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.490
Leukocytes can move
through the circulatory system

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.360
and when they get to a
place where they're needed,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.000
they can basically send a
signal to ask the capillary

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.410
to open a gap between it's cells
and then it oozes through that gap

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.740
to the site of the infection,
this is called,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.930
get ready for it, diapedesis.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.380
From the greek for
"oozing through."

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.960
There are lot of different
kinds of leukocytes,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.700
like different branches of
your own personal microscopic army.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.940
The kind specific to the innate
immune system are phagocytes,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.440
more greek, this time
Phago, meaning eating.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.270
And they're just any cells
that ingest microorganisms

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.740
through the process
of phagocytosis.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.100
Phagocytes are pretty cool.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.430
They can literally chase
down the invading cells,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.540
grab them and then
completely engulf them.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.710
And some, like the
super-abundant neutrophils,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.900
move around the bloodstream,
and can quickly get

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.140
to where the action is.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.800
Once a neutrophil kills
an invading microbe,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.880
they basically just
roll over and die.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.680
Dead neutrophils collect together
into what we lovingly call pus.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.750
The biggest and baddest of the
phagocytes are the macrophages,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.710
the "big eaters," which
don't generally travel a lot,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.670
but instead hang out like
bodyguards in your various organs.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.580
Not only do they
kill outside invaders,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.390
they can also detect when
one of your cells has gone rogue,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.550
like a cancer cell,
and kill those, too.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.290
And they, unlike the neutrophils,
don't die once they've

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.980
killed a bacterium.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.250
They can eat up to
100 before they die.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.560
BIG EATER!

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.880
Of all the grisly stuff that
goes on in the never-ending

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.280
street war that is your
immune system, some of the most

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.250
gruesome stuff is done
by a kind of cell called

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.350
"Natural Killer Cells"
which reminds me,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.930
I think it's time for
our very first Open Letter.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.710
An open letter, to 1973.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.360
Dear 1973,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.480
You had a lot going on, the
Vietnam war ending, Roe v Wade,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.020
Watergate...it was
a tumultuous time.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.110
But part of me wishes that
you, 1973, had an opportunity

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.660
to name everything in biology
because you got one chance

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.200
to name a new type of
immune cell, and you named it

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.960
"The Natural Killer Cell"
and I freaking love that.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.050
I look around at today's script
with all of it's dendritic cells

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.890
and macrophages and
dieapudeesises and I think,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.670
what if we let 1973
name all these things,

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.900
would we have Spikey
Death Cells, Devourerers,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.590
and Oozing Action instead?

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.740
I don't know...maybe you
would have screwed it up,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.090
but I don't think you
could have done any worse

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.100
than all of this GD greek we
have to deal with all the time.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.310
Thanks for the Endangered
Species Act!  - Hank

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.950
Ok! Natural Killer Cells,
more than just a great name,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.420
also the only phagocyte in
the innate immune system

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.440
that destroys other human cells.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.350
When your cells are healthy,
they have a special protein

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.460
on their surface called MHC I

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.400
MHC for major
histocompatability complex.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.590
But when your cells are
infected, say with a virus,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.610
or when they're cancerous,
they stop producing that protein.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.430
So the Natural Killers are
always going around checking up

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.860
on each of your cells, and when
it finds one that's not normal,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.040
it pulls out it's AK47 and unloads.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.980
Actually, it just binds
with it and then secretes

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.280
an enzyme that dissolves its
membrane, but still. Killing.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.800
Finally, dendritic cells
are a type of phagocyte

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.940
that hangs out on the
surface of much of your body

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.740
that comes in contact
with the environment

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.050
in your nose, on your skin,
in your stomach and intestines.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.910
They eat up pathogens and then
carry information about them

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.270
back to the spleen or lymph nodes,
where it passes intelligence

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.300
about what's going on on the war
front to the acquired immune system.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.680
I actually studied dendritic
cells in my undergraduate thesis

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.100
and I kinda fell in love with them.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.280
They're lethal...
but they're also intelligent,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.090
great heroes for any
Robert Ludlum novel.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.300
To be fair though,
macrophages can do this too.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.300
The activity of these cells
give us a chance to transfer

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.830
from the innate immune system
to the acquired immune system,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.630
which is going to make
things a little more complicated.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.960
The acquired system has to learn
as much as it can about every

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.020
pathogen it interacts with,
store that information,

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.640
and then use it to invent
defenses against them.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.080
It's your super-elite,
double-secret strike force delta.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.000
You get to work building
your acquired immune system

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.410
immediately after you're born,
harvesting bacteria and other stuff

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.160
not just good bacteria that
can help your guts out,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.529
but also harmful ones that
your body learns from

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:01.130
and stores information about.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.310
That system keeps an eye out
for any foreign substance:

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.870
a toxin, a virus, a bacteria,
even parts of those things

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.130
that could be tell-tale
signs of a bad guy.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.140
We call those signs antigens,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.710
a word that comes from
antibody generator.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.970
An antigen is anything that
causes your immune system

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.750
to ID a pathogen and then
create an antibody against it.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.240
Now antibodies aren't cells,
they're highly specialized

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.790
proteins produced by B cells
to recognize and help lay

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.720
the smack-down on intruders.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.920
But antibodies can't
kill invaders themselves.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.890
They're just little
proteins after all.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.779
The best that they can do by
themselves is just swarm all over

00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:37.230
the invader, making it
harder for it to move,

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.370
and to excrete toxins, or otherwise
infiltrate healthy cells.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.779
But more often,
antibodies serve as "tags,"

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:45.320
attaching themselves to the
scumbags and then releasing

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.470
chemical signals to
nearby phagocytes,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.350
alerting them that
it's dinner time.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.110
Your acquired immune system
also has its own type

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.200
of white blood cells.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.029
Not phagocytes, which go
after everything that looks

00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:56.800
a little bit sketchy,
but lymphocytes, which go after

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.040
specific things that
they already know about.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.450
There are two major
types of lymphocytes:

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.839
the T cells, which form
in your bone marrow

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:05.620
and migrate and mature
in the thymus gland,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.610
behind your breastbone,
and B cells,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.570
which originate and mature
in the bone marrow.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.290
What T and B actually stand
for is a long story,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.620
but if it helps you to remember:

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.720
T's mature in the thymus,
B's in the bone marrow.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.380
We have two different types of
lymphocytes because our bodies

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.010
have two different
types of acquired immunity,

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.750
the cell-mediated response which
is for when the cells are

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.660
already infected,
and the humoral response,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.970
for when the infection
is just in the humors,

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.060
the body's fluid,
not in the cells.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.580
First, let's look at the
cell-mediated response.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.300
This process mainly
involves T cells,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.270
and there are quite a number
of different types of them.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.060
Helper T cells have
a cute-sounding name,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.190
but in a lot of ways they call the
shots for the whole immune system.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.980
While they can't kill
pathogens themselves,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.230
they activate and direct
the cells that can.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.990
If 1973 had named them,
they might have been called

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.470
"Admiral T Cells" or
something more awesome.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.630
Helper T cells get their
information from other immune cells

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.940
that are out cracking skulls.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.160
Say, for instance, a macrophage
finds a pathogen and destroys it.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.240
After the deed has been done,
it has the ability

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.510
to shred up the proteins
from an invader,

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.580
and put a bit of that antigen
on its membrane surface.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.790
This is called antigen-presentation
because the cell is...

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.830
presenting antigens!

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.890
A helper T-cell can detect when
this happens and it comes over

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.360
to attach itself to
the presented antigen.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.880
The two cells talk to
each other chemically.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.250
The antigen presenting cell produces
a chemical called Interleukin 1

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.330
which basically tells
the Helper T cell,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.810
"Uh, boss, I found this guy over
here and then I broke his neck

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.140
and then I stuck his guts
all over my cell wall."

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.900
And the Helper T cell gives it a
look and then releases a chemical

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.110
called Interleukin 2,
which is like a bullhorn,

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.360
an alarm that tells all the
lymphocytes in the area,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.060
"THERE ARE PROBLEMS HERE!

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.210
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM OVER
HERE IN SECTOR 15!"

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.720
This alarm activates a couple of
different things all at once:

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.920
First, the Helper T cell
starts making copies,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.960
tons of copies, of itself.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.810
Most of those copies differentiate
into effector T cells,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.680
which travel around
secreting signaling proteins

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.450
that stimulate other nearby
lymphocytes to take action.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.660
Most of the rest of them
become memory T cells.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.130
They're the ones that keep
a record of the intruder

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.260
and provide us with future
immunity against it.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.410
And now for the saddest
story of the day.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.930
What happens when a
cell gets infected.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.310
SO infected that it knows
that it's a goner,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.120
that it, in fact, is being
converted from a healthy,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.279
useful part of the body,
to an evil zombie farm,

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:25.620
pumping out viruses or bacteria,
suddenly co-opted

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.850
to help destroy
everything it loves?

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.610
Well, with its last bit
of strength, it'll start

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.800
presenting antigens,
not asking to be rescued,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.250
but instead asking
for a mercy killing.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.920
The cytotoxic T cell has the
job of granting that request.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.240
Once a cytotoxic T cell gets the
message from the helper T cells

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.850
that there's an
infection to deal with,

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.820
it starts patrolling the area for
normal cells presenting antigens.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.980
When it finds one, it latches
onto it and releases enzymes

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.670
that create holes in the cell's
membrane and eventually

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.890
breaks down the whole cell,
killing the cell and the pathogen

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:58.960
in the process.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.640
A human cell killing
another human cell.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.750
Now for the Humoral Response.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.089
The humoral response is
designed to catch pathogens

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.170
that are floating around
in your body that haven't

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.230
actually invaded any
of your cells yet.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.160
The primary players are B cells,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.040
which are constantly
patrolling your bloodstream

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.890
like cops walking the beat
until they get a signal

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.920
from a Helper T cell
that something's wrong.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.320
B cells are covered in
antibodies that can detect

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.180
and bind to a specific antigen.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.800
A single B cell can be covered
in a forest of up to 100,000

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.180
antibodies, say, for the virus
that causes the common cold,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.220
and the B cell next to it will
have just as many receptors

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.480
for a different antigen,
for chicken pox or something.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.390
When a B cell bumps into a
pathogen that it recognizes,

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.470
it attaches to it and starts
cloning itself like crazy.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.380
Suddenly there are tons of that
B cell with the same receptor

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.100
but during the cloning process,
the clones differentiate

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.440
into new versions of the original
just like the T Cells did.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.950
Most turn into
plasma or effector cells,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.500
which use the antibody as a
blueprint to creating a crap-ton

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.589
of antibodies for
that specific pathogen

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.510
like 200 antibodies per second!

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.200
Once these antibodies are released,
they bind to the pathogens

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.990
like crazy, marking them
for death until a phagocyte

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.850
can come along and
do the dirty work.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.200
The rest of the cloned B cells
mostly become memory cells,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.600
which have the same
receptor and stick around,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.500
providing future
immunity from this invader.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.770
And we are now very out of time,
but I really love this stuff,

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.850
so I didn't want
to gloss over anything.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.870
Mucus, natural killer cells,
macrophages killing things,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.200
breaking them up and sticking
them on their cell membranes,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.600
effector cells spewing out
antibodies, and memory cells,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.220
making sure that our immune
systems hold that grudge,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.270
all because my absolute
favorite thing to do

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.020
every single day is not die.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.959
If you want to review anything
we discussed in this episode

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.860
there's a table of
contents over there.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.140
If you have any
questions for us,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:49.149
we'll be down in the comments
or on Facebook or Twitter.

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:56.149
And we'll see you next time.
