00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.279
Behavior is action in
response to a stimulus.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.450
My cat Cameo is now responding
to both an external stimulus

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.480
the sound of a bag of treats,
and an internal stimulus

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.480
her hunger, or at least her
insatiable desire for treats.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.380
Sometimes animal behavior
can seem really far out,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.350
but if you look closely enough,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.289
you can see how all
behavior serves a purpose

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.550
to help an animal mate, eat,
avoid predators, and raise young.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.910
And since behaviors can come
with advantages like these,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.160
natural selection acts on them
just as it acts on physical traits

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
ensuring the success
of animals who engage

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.600
in beneficial behaviors, while
weeding out those that do stupid,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.649
dangerous or otherwise
unhelpful stuff.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.030
The most beneficial behaviors
are those that make an animal

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.460
better at doing the only two
things in the world that matter:

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.160
eating and sex.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.620
Still, that doesn't mean
all behavior is about

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.040
just looking out for number one.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.899
It turns out some
advantageous behavior

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.110
is actually pretty selfless.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.460
More on that in a minute.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.430
But first, behavior is really just
a product of a pair of factors:

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.130
Morphology, or the physical
structure of an animal

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.400
and physiology, or the
function of that morphology.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580
Now, an animal's behavior
is obviously limited

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.000
by what its body
is capable of doing

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.220
for example, Cameo does
not have opposable thumbs,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.900
so, much as she would like
to get into the treat bag,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.540
by herself, she cannot.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.310
This limitation is
strictly hereditary

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.340
no cats can open treat
bags with their thumbs

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.280
because no cats
have opposable thumbs.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.420
Though some cats do have thumbs.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.700
In the same way that a penguin
can't fly to escape a predator;

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.930
or a gazelle can't reach the
same leaves as a giraffe can.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.710
Similarly, behavior is constrained
by an animal's physiology.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.530
Like, Cameo's built for
chasing down little critters

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.600
and eating meat,
not beds of lettuce.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.580
This is because her physiology,
everything from her teeth

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.659
to her digestive system,
are geared for eating meat.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.600
If she pounced on and ate every
blade of grass she came across...

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.220
let's just say I would not want
to be in charge of that litter box.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.900
Now the traits that make
up an animal's morphology

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.880
and physiology are
often heritable,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.890
so we generally talk about
selection acting on those traits.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.890
But as natural selection
hones these traits,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.450
it's really selecting
their associated behaviors.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.310
It's the USE of the trait,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.480
using wings and feathers
to escape predators,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.700
or using a long neck
to reach leaves,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.430
that provides the
evolutionary advantage.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.590
Still, that doesn't mean
all behavior is coded

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.390
in an animal's genes

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.080
some behaviors are learned.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.420
And even for animals that
learn how to do things,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.340
natural selection has
favored brain structures

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.660
that are capable of learning.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.560
So one way or another,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.250
most behaviors have
some genetic underpinning,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.970
and we call those
behaviors adaptive.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.470
Problem is, it's
not always obvious

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.569
what the evolutionary advantages
are for some of the nutty things

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:42.819
that animals do.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.959
Like, why does a snapping turtle
always stick out its tongue?

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.420
How does a tiny Siberian
hamster find its mate,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.700
miles across the
unforgiving tundra?

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.879
Why does a bower bird
collect piles of garbage?

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.260
To answer questions like those,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.890
we have to figure out what
stimulus causes these behaviors,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.800
and what functions
the behaviors serve.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.519
To do this, I'm going to need
the help of one of the first

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.670
animal behavior scientists ever,
or ethologists, Niko Tinbergen.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.360
Tinbergen developed a
set of four questions

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.450
aimed at understanding
animal behavior.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.030
The questions focus on
how a behavior occurs,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.830
and why natural selection has
favored this particular behavior.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.160
Determining how a behavior occurs
actually involves two questions:

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.209
One: what stimulus causes it?

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.170
And two: what does
the animal's body do

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.510
in response to that stimulus?

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.090
These are the causes
that are closest

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.239
to the specific behavior
we're looking at,

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.780
so they're called
the proximate causes.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.989
In the case of the
male Siberian hamster,

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.260
the stimulus is a delicious
smelling pheromone

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.750
that the sexy female hamster
releases when she's ready to mate.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.489
The male hamster's response,
of course, is to scuttle,

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.640
surprisingly quickly, over
several miles if necessary

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.409
to find and mate with her.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.099
So the proximate cause
of this behavior

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.700
was that the girl hamster signaled
that she was ready to knock boots,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.080
and the male ran like crazy
to get to the boot-knockin'.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.849
Asking the more complex question
of why natural selection

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.620
has favored this behavior requires
asking two more questions:

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.569
One: what about this behavior
helps this animal survive

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.099
and/or reproduce?

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.840
And two: what is the evolutionary
history of this behavior?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.049
These, as you can tell,
are bigger-picture questions,

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.430
and they show us the ultimate
causes of the behavior.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.299
The answer to the first
question, of course,

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.769
is that the ability of a male
hamster to detect and respond

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.759
to the pheromones of an ovulating
female is directly linked

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.139
to his reproductive success!

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.949
As for the second question, you
can also see that male hamsters

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.729
with superior pheromone detectors
will be able to find females

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.969
more successfully than
other male hamsters,

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.449
and thereby produce more offspring.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.069
So natural selection has honed
this particular physical ability

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.979
and behavior over
generations of hamsters.

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.909
So, who would have thought to ask
these questions in the first place?

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.930
And where's my chair?

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.809
Niko Tinbergen was
one third of a trifecta

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.180
of revolutionary ethologists
in the 20th century.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.889
Along with Austrians Karl
von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz,

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.300
he provided a foundation
for studying animal behavior

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.259
and applied these ideas to
the study of specific behaviors

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.930
and for that all three shared
the Nobel Prize in 1973.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.069
You may have seen the famous
photos of young graylag geese

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.789
following obediently
in a line behind a man.

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.059
That was Lorenz,
and his experiments

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.999
first conducted in the 1930s
introduced the world to imprinting,

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:24.009
the formation of social
bonds in infant animals,

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.439
and the behavior that includes both
learned and innate components.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.039
When he observed newly
hatched ducklings and geese,

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.349
he discovered that
waterfowl in particular

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.639
had no innate recognition
of their mothers.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.569
In the case of graylag geese,
he found the imprinting stimulus

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.969
to be any nearby object
moving away from the young!

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.800
So when incubator-hatched
goslings spent

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.689
their first hours with Lorenz,

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.110
not only did they follow him,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.300
but they showed no recognition
of their real mother

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.469
or other adults in their species!

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.990
Unfortunately, Lorenz was
also a member of the Nazi party

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.259
from 1938 to 1943.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:56.619
And in response to
some of his studies

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.669
on degenerative features
that arose in hybrid geese,

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.849
Lorenz warned that it
took only a small amount

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.300
of "tainted blood" to have an
influence on a "pure-blooded" race.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.449
Unsurprisingly, Nazi party
leaders were quick to draw

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.710
some insane conclusions from
Lorenz's behavioral studies

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.539
in the cause of what
they called race hygiene.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.649
Lorenz never denied
his Nazi affiliation

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:20.399
but spent years trying to
distance himself from the party

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:23.469
and apologizing for getting
caught up in that evil.

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.559
Now how exactly does
natural selection act

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:27.520
on behavior out
there in the world?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.819
That's where we turn to
those two types of behavior

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.569
that are the only things
in the world that matter:

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:33.949
eating and sex-having.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.629
Behavior associated with
finding and eating food

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.339
is known as foraging,
which you've heard of,

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:42.259
and natural selection can act
on behaviors that allow animals

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:43.770
to exploit food sources

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.179
while using the least
amount of energy possible

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:49.259
this sweet spot is known as
the optimal foraging model.

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.479
And the alligator snapping
turtle has optimal foraging

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:52.499
all figured out.

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.949
Rather than running around
hunting down its prey,

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.610
it simply sits in the water,
and food comes to him.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.439
See, the alligator snapping
turtle has a long, pink tongue

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.169
divided into two segments,
making it look like a tasty worm

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.360
to a passing fish.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.889
In response to the stimulus
of a passing fish,

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:10.129
it sticks out its tongue
out and wiggles it.

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.199
Natural selection has,
over many generations,

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.669
acted not only on turtles with
pinker and more wiggly tongues

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.990
to catch more fish, it's also
acted on those that best know how

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.199
and when to wiggle those
tongues to get the most food.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.550
So it's selecting
both the physical trait

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.589
and the behavior that
best exploits it.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:30.379
And what could be sexier than
a turtle's wiggly tongue dance?

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:31.529
Well, how about sex?

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:34.309
As we saw with our friend
the horny Siberian hamster,

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:36.569
some behaviors and their
associated physical features

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:38.909
are adapted to allow an
animal to reproduce more,

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:41.119
simply by being better
at finding mates.

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:43.899
But many times, animals of the
same species live close together

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:47.209
or in groups, and determining
who in what group gets to mate

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:49.949
creates some interesting
behaviors and features.

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:52.669
This is what sexual
selection, is all about.

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:55.729
Often, males of a species will
find and defend a desirable habitat

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:58.449
to raise young in, and
females will choose a male

00:07:58.449 --> 00:07:59.489
based on their territory.

00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:02.349
But what about those species,
and there are many of them,

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:05.029
where the female picks a
male not because of that,

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:08.529
but because of how he
dances, or even weirder,

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.939
how much junk he's collected?

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:12.099
Take the male bower bird.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:15.360
He builds an elaborate hut,
or bower, out of twigs

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.119
and bits of grass, then spends
an enormous amount of time

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:22.119
collecting stuff, sometimes
piles of berries,

00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:26.159
and sometimes piles of
pretty, blue, plastic crap.

00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:28.499
Ethologists believe that
he's collecting the stuff

00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:31.589
to attract the female to check
out his elaborate house.

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.000
Once the female's been
enticed to take a closer look,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.589
the male starts to sing
songs and dance around,

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:41.349
often mimicking other species,
inside of his little house for her.

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:43.269
Females will inspect
a number of these bowers

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:44.949
before choosing who to mate with.

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:47.610
Now, doing more complex dances
and having more blue objects

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.779
in your bower scores
bigger with females.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.980
And ethologists have shown that
a higher level of problem solving,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.970
or intelligence,
in males correlates

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.240
to both of these activities.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.139
So yeah, it took some
brawn to build that bower

00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:01.060
and collect all that junk,
but chicks also dig nerds

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.529
who can learn dances!

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:04.829
So the bowerbird's brain
is evolving in response

00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:06.920
to sexual selection by females.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.160
This intelligence
likely also translates

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.899
into other helpful behaviors
like avoiding predators.

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:13.430
So thanks to the
evolution of behavior,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.100
we're really good at taking care of
our nutritional and sexual needs.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.889
But what's confused
scientists for a long time

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:21.060
is why animals often
look after others' needs.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.870
For instance, vampire bats
in South America will literally

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.519
regurgitate blood into the
mouths of members of its clan

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.120
who didn't get a meal that night.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.810
How do you explain animals who
act altruistically like that?

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.850
We actually did a whole SciShow
episode on this very subject

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.240
but basically, we can thank British
scientist William Hamilton

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.720
for coming up with an equation to
explain how natural selection

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.980
can simultaneously make
animals fit and allow for

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.660
the evolution of altruism.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.420
Hamilton found that the
evolution of altruism

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.480
was best understood at the
level of larger communities,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.410
especially extended
animal families.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.240
Basically, altruism can evolve
if the benefit of a behavior

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.790
is greater than its
cost on an individual,

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.209
because it helped the
individual's relatives enough

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:02.139
to make it worth it.

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:04.250
Hamilton called this
inclusive fitness,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.110
expanding Darwin's
definition of fitness

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.540
basically, how many
babies somebody's making

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.149
to include the
offspring of relatives.

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.079
So I guess the only
question left is,

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.720
if I forget to feed you two,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.139
who is going to regurgitate blood
into the other one's mouth?

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:20.759
Yeah, there's probably a reason
that only happens with bats.

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:22.829
Thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Biology.

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:24.899
Thank you to Cameo for
being such a good kitty.

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:26.139
Yeah, she finally gets her treats.

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:27.230
There's a table of
contents, of course.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.029
