00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.860
 Would you like a folk remedy? 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000
 no problem. What should I do? 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 You only have to answer the questions. 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.220
 Several years ago, 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.219
 I and a friend of mine went to the Scientology Complex in Los Angeles to see what this doctrine was; we were curious. 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.760
 I spoke about the trip in one of the first episodes of this channel. 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.189
 They toured us around the facility and introduced us to some of its nice members and we were given 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.468
 Tests to determine personality, the test is called: the Oxford test for capacity analysis, 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.809
 But it has nothing to do with Oxford University or any prestigious institution, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.869
 Was more than I imagined, 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.200
 It contained 200 questions, including what appeared in this scene of the film 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.819
 Director Paul Thomas Anderson: The Teacher (2012) 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.449
 "Do you spend a lot of time at the bus station just for fun?" 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.299
 "Do you have muscle spasms for no reason?" "Do you want to do what you are ordered to do? 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.980
 Are you interested? Are you jealous? Are you scientific in your thinking? Are you honest? Are you unpredictable? 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 This treatment of the film looks to me better 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.089
 The scenes in one of the best movies last ten years. Simple, brilliantly performed, and charming. 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.850
 Which in turn is not wrong for filmmakers. If you are interested, the scene touches some of the real ideas of a method 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 Doctrine of Scientology 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 Anderson always stresses that the film was not an accurate re-cutting of the founding of Scientology, 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.389
 The similarities between characters, sense and style are hard to overlook. For example, this scene 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.889
 Reflects a fundamental activity in the science, called "listening". This word comes from a word meaning 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.939
 "To listen". In this listening phase, the person who runs the session is called the listener, and the future person is called imperfect. 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.739
 Because he himself did not get rid of his mind associated with a certain shock. In the teacher's film 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 The character of Lancaster Dodd was portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the listener, and Freddie, who was Joaquin Phoenix 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.510
 Minus purity. The character of Dodd plays the role assigned by the student to the listener asking the imperfect questions in order to save him from 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 "Agrams". A term that means traumatic memories that are stored in the reactionary mind. Helps the listener minus the serenity to cheer him off 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.889
 Traumatic experience. When he has a lack of clarity, or awareness 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.959
 Positive awareness, the meeting ends. If this is somewhat like psychoanalysis for you 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.529
 This is because it is. When the founder of Alamogia. Ron Hubbard, these methods in his book The Dianetics 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.600
 I think that in his own mind he believes that he has embarked on a new approach in psychotherapy, 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.839
 Something scientifically accurate and effective. Certainly, as we know, Dianetics is not an exact scientific book. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.890
 He has been rejected several times by all societies concerned with mental health, which has been classified as a fake science, and so is. But as we saw in the film teacher 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.200
 There is no doubt that this listening process can give effect. "where is your mother?" 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
 "I do not know..." 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.139
 "again." 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.210
 In this treatment scene, Dodd makes Freddy recognize several previous psychological trauma: the death of his father, 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.630
 His mother's confinement in a sanatorium, his forbidden relationship with his aunt, and the times when he was killed in the war. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.059
 These shocks are used as a means of influencing 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.670
 Ingram in the session: 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.769
 Freddy is deserted for his love. As in psychoanalysis, Dodd achieves this 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.369
 By initiating a process of reciprocity that tries to liberate the repressed or difficult to confront. 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.160
 But the methods used are different. As critics have long believed, the method of listening that in theology goes beyond 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.850
 Which in psychoanalysis, or therapy by talking, because it uses a form 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.749
 hypnosis. "Say your name." "Freddy Cowell." 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
 "again." "Freddy Cowell." 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.459
 "again." "Freddy Cowell." 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.469
 During this scene, Dodd works to make Freddy under his command. In the first part which was largely organized 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:12.879
 Like a personal test, ask him several yes-or-no questions, making Freddy get used to this style of 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.689
 The call and answer, staff repetition to urge Freddy to relax and focus. "Did your previous concerns bother you?" 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.199
 "No." "Did your previous concerns bother you?" 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.110
 "No..." 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.329
 "Did your previous concerns bother you?" 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.849
 "Um ... no." "Did your previous concerns bother you?" 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.130
 Repetition is also important. Dodd tries to make Freddy 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:46.599
 Concentrates on your previous failures. After this short session ends, Freddy insists on more and Dod agrees 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.669
 But this time with Freddy warning not to blink, otherwise questions will start over. 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:59.259
 This excess condition has a Freddie mind and with answers to the questions from the first part, begins to answer 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.609
 "Have you had a sexual relationship with a relative?" "Yeah." 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.620
 "Have you had a sexual relationship with a relative?" "Yeah." 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.260
 "From?" "My aunt." "Did you kill anyone?" "No." "Probably?" "no not me." "Did you kill anyone?" 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.280
 "No." "How many times have you done with your aunt?" "three times." "where is she now?" 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:20.169
 "I do not know." 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.744
 "Would you like to have it again?" "No!" 

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:23.499
 With the style prepared by Dodd 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.099
 Plus intensity, plus intensity, plus severity 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.259
 What an escalation that made Freddy tense, and at the most charged moment, 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.139
 Dodd interrupts Freddy's liquid style and closes his eyes. 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.129
 The resulting feeling at this moment is real. Just like real hypnosis 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:57.019
 As psychological therapy and psychoanalysis are real, because cognitive activity is essentially real and can be judged, 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:04.549
 Manipulating it, and displaying it from several angles. Listening is the center of the science; it produces 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.530
 A feeling of assimilation that convinces people that these roads are necessary for health. 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:15.949
 This is the danger of science as well. I mean hypnosis for people looking for it. 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.290
 But she flatly rejects hearing that employs hypnosis altogether. 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:28.129
 For this reason, the people, like Freddy, who tried it without their knowledge are vulnerable to compulsive ideas, whether it is done 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.340
 Maliciously 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:36.320
 Or by someone who has not been trained properly; they can be persuaded that the church is absolutely right 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.079
 They deserve the money and time they asked them to give. 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.029
 "To clarify, all you have to do is show the other that he is able to ridicule his abilities or difficulties 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.389
 Not to be completely aimless. Here you have memorized it. 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.989
 I think that listening, as we saw in the teacher, is the best way 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.810
 To "filter every person on earth." When this is your goal, there is no place to doubt your methods 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.609
 When doubt is the essence of all forms of mental health. 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.800
 We do not understand all the ways the mind works, and probably will not understand. 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.640
 But psychotherapy and psychiatry, which work within a scientific society, has its ethics and protects against abuse, 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.649
 Progress to be helped who can not keep pace with life. 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.030
 They are not perfect, but they are much better than 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.250
 Theology.
