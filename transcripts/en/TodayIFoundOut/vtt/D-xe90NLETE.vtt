00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:16.880
Although you’d expect people tasked with
going to space to be a fairly rational lot,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.040
astronauts and cosmonauts are noted as being
an exceptionally superstitious group, many

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.350
of whom conform to a number of seemingly arbitrary
and often unusual rituals before each flight.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.039
While there is a perfectly reasonable explanation
for most, if not all, of these traditions

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.730
and customs, usually dating back to the early
days of the space race, many of them can seem

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.320
quite peculiar without context.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.760
For example, every time the workers at NASA’s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (usually abbreviated

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.170
to JPL) launch a probe or satellite, they
will eat peanuts.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.530
curiosity-peanutsThis is a tradition that
started in 1964 after the successful launch

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.610
of the Ranger 7, a spacecraft designed to
take pictures of the Moon.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.950
Prior to the Ranger 7, unsurprisingly, there
was Rangers 1 – 6, all of which failed at

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.790
their missions for various reasons.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.970
However, on the day they launched the Ranger
7, a random engineer brought some peanuts

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.930
into the control room as a snack and shared
them around.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.750
The launch was successful; as a result, it
has been a tradition amongst JPL staff ever

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.690
since to snack on peanuts in the control room
for luck.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.700
kremlin-wallWhen it comes to these superstitions,
there are likely very few people working for

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.510
NASA who truly believe that bad luck will
befall them or the mission if they fail to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.060
shovel handfuls of peanuts into their mouths
immediately after launch; it’s just a nice

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.619
way of acknowledging the work of those before
them and fostering camaraderie between staff.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.990
However, there are some traditions that people
take deathly seriously.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.950
For example, in Russia no launch is ever permitted
to be scheduled for October 24th.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.950
Why?

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.729
Well, not one but two missiles set to be launched
on this date in 1960 and 1963 exploded before

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.799
launch, killing 92 people in 1960 and 7 in
1963.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.740
In the same vein, before any cosmonaut is
permitted to fly to space, they must first

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.229
visit the Kremlin and pay their respects to
Yuri Gagarin, Sergei Korolev (a famed Soviet

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.790
rocket engineer), Vladimir Komarov (the first
known man killed during a space mission) and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.030
the three cosmonauts who perished during the
Soyuz 11 mission, Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.600
Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev, all of whose
ashes are buried within the Kremlin’s wall.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.370
Anyone wishing to fly to space via a Russian
rocket is expected to honor this tradition,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.819
regardless of their nationality.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.560
tree plantingOther traditions expected to
be adhered to include a walk along the “avenue

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.680
of heroes”, a name given to a path flanked
by two rows of trees located at the Baikonur

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680
Cosmodrome.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.910
Shortly before their own mission, astronauts
and cosmonauts alike are expected to plant

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.561
their own sapling along this avenue to continue
the tradition.

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:41.780
The origins of this custom, like many in Russian
space travel, are attributed to Gagarin who

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.410
did the same thing before his flight in 1961.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.720
As a result, Gagarin’s tree is unsurprisingly
the oldest.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.569
peeing-on-busPerhaps the most unusual and
famous custom attributed to Gagarin though

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.739
is the one that involves urinating all over
the bus that takes you to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.510
more specifically, it’s right rear wheel.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.989
Gagarin is said to have done exactly this
shortly before climbing into the Vostok 1

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.819
capsule as he really needed to pee and couldn’t
do so in his space suit.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.030
(See: How do astronauts go to the bathroom
in space?)

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.099
To honor Gagarin, it has been customary ever
since for cosmonauts and visiting astronauts

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.310
to do this too.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.019
Female cosmonauts and astronauts are excused
from this particular tradition if they so

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.100
choose, though some have been known to bring
a vial of their urine along with them so that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.100
they can take part.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.849
Funny enough, there’s some debate about
whether or not Gagarin actually did stop his

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.670
bus to pee prior to launch as the only evidence
to say he did is anecdotal in nature, which

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.590
hasn’t stopped cosmonauts doing it anyway.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.629
guest-bookAnother cosmonaut tradition not
necessarily inspired by Gagarin, but still

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.239
linked to him in some way is a visit to his
office, which hasn’t been altered since

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.409
the day he died.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.900
While loitering in Gagarin’s office, cosmonauts
will sign his guestbook and, if several persistent

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.470
rumors are to be believed, some ask his ghost
for his permission to fly to space.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.269
Immediately before the launch, Russian cosmonauts
will also be played a selection of Soviet

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.510
era love songs as a final tribute to Gagarin,
who shortly before the launch of Vostok 1

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.319
requested some music to lighten the mood and
was similarly played a selection of love songs.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.580
Out of respect for everyone’s comfort, the
individual crew of each particular flight

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.780
is free to pick out a selection of their own
music to play, leading to quite an eclectic

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.739
playlist for launches with an international
crew.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.740
white-sun-of-the-dessertOther traditions that
are generally observed prior to a cosmonaut’s

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.869
flight into space include a viewing of the
Soviet era movie, “White Sun of the Desert”,

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:31.490
a custom started in the late 1960s when this
was apparently the only movie available to

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.990
cosmonauts for a few years, and signing their
name on their hotel door.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.289
As cosmonauts leave their hotel, they will
be traditionally do so while listening to

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.669
the song, “Trava u doma” by the band,
Zemlyane.

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.349
The song’s title roughly translates to “Grass
by the Home”.

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.930
A final ritual that is commonly upheld is
the attaching of a small talisman to the command

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.370
console, just in front of the on-board camera.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.729
The idea behind this being that when the craft
finally reaches orbit, the talisman, which

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.290
is attached by a small length of string, will
begin to float around giving the ground crew

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.009
visual confirmation that the launch was a
success.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.309
Russian ground crews similarly have a number
of traditions they like to uphold before each

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.499
mission, the most famous of which is putting
coins on the track used to take the capsule

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:16.050
to the launch pad.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.819
Cosmonauts are forbidden from taking part
as it’s believed to be bad luck for them

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.240
to see the capsule arriving.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.479
Instead, this day is traditionally the day
on which they all get a haircut.

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.479
Despite standing at a relatively small, 5
feet 2 inches tall, Yuri Gagarin was reportedly

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.479
a very skilled basketball player and is said
to have spent much of his time training for

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.479
the Vostok 1 mission playing pick-up games
with his peers.

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.139
Gagarin was also noted as being incredibly
charming and likeable, with many commenting

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.479
on his magnetic personality and attention
grabbing smile.

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.870
Gagarin was so likeable that in an anonymous
survey of the 20 men being considered for

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.289
the Vostok 1 mission, in which candidates
were asked to say who they felt should go

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.849
to space if they weren’t chosen, only 3
candidates chose someone other than Gagarin.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.330
Gagarin had a small scar on his face caused
by a fall from a second story window.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.340
How?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.340
He jumped.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.729
You see, while Yuri was at a resort at the
Black Sea, at one point he was spending a

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.620
little time with a nurse called Anna in his
room when his wife arrived.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.449
Rather than face the music, Yuri tried escaping
out the window.

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.220
According to an eye witness of the leap, “He
hit a kerbstone with his forehead.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.830
It was not a good landing.”

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.349
Beyond presumably having an unhappy wife on
his hands, he was left with a scar above his

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.610
eyebrow.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.580
steak-and-eggs2Although American astronauts
are notably less superstitious than their

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.189
Russian peers, one particularly popular ritual
is a breakfast of filet mignon and eggs before

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:24.189
a mission.

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.319
This custom was started by astronaut Alan
Shepard back in 1961 when he ate the same

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:33.159
breakfast prior to the Freedom 7 mission,
which was such a success, most astronauts

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.300
since have eaten the same breakfast.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:51.520
Although, it should be noted that some have
had little appetite for food on launch day

00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:00.979
and abstain.
