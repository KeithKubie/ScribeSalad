us these safe projects we never get the
 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.789
us these safe projects we never get the
other projects what do we do how do we

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799
other projects what do we do how do we
 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.139
other projects what do we do how do we
fix this and I knew I couldn't go back

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149

rescue project doesn't work but this is

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659
rescue project doesn't work but this is
 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.209
rescue project doesn't work but this is
example of something there's nothing to

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219
example of something there's nothing to
 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.679
example of something there's nothing to
do with precision this is the up my

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689
do with precision this is the up my
 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.569
do with precision this is the up my
other side which is the wheeling and

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579
other side which is the wheeling and
 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.659
other side which is the wheeling and
dealing site and so I said right a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:36.669
dealing site and so I said right a
 

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:38.459
dealing site and so I said right a
person and I thought of this immediately

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469
person and I thought of this immediately
 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.659
person and I thought of this immediately
I said right a personal business plan

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:41.669
I said right a personal business plan

personal business plan what's that I
 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.690
personal business plan what's that I
said put a horizontal line on a piece of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700
said put a horizontal line on a piece of
 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.349
said put a horizontal line on a piece of
paper put down a number which is the

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359
paper put down a number which is the
 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.539
paper put down a number which is the
value of Majan that your project

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549
value of Majan that your project
 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.709
value of Majan that your project
whatever is your going to do is a

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719
whatever is your going to do is a
 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.809
whatever is your going to do is a
success and give it a number could be

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819
success and give it a number could be
 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.589
success and give it a number could be
dollars or years of your life I give

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599
dollars or years of your life I give
 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.879
dollars or years of your life I give
five years if I'm going to say your

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889
five years if I'm going to say your
 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.949
five years if I'm going to say your
medical student I give 10 years of my

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959
medical student I give 10 years of my
 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.809
medical student I give 10 years of my
life to cure cancer or whatever it is so

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819
life to cure cancer or whatever it is so
 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.909
life to cure cancer or whatever it is so
you get a number multiply it by the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:05.919
you get a number multiply it by the
 

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:09.899
you get a number multiply it by the
probability and divide it by the cost so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909
probability and divide it by the cost so
 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.580
probability and divide it by the cost so
if that's a big number do it's a small

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590
if that's a big number do it's a small
 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.899
if that's a big number do it's a small
number don't do it well it turned out

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909
number don't do it well it turned out
 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.000
number don't do it well it turned out
that's a very imprecise thing to do and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
that's a very imprecise thing to do and
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.050
that's a very imprecise thing to do and
nobody knows exactly what the value is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
nobody knows exactly what the value is
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.369
nobody knows exactly what the value is
and nobody knows exactly what the cost

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379
and nobody knows exactly what the cost
 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.270
and nobody knows exactly what the cost
isn't you don't know what the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280
isn't you don't know what the
 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.130
isn't you don't know what the
probability is every one of those that

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140
probability is every one of those that
 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.670
probability is every one of those that
guess but in the process of doing is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
guess but in the process of doing is
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.020
guess but in the process of doing is
they first went to the department and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
they first went to the department and
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.670
they first went to the department and
the partment has came back and said we

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
the partment has came back and said we
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.589
the partment has came back and said we
don't know its value so I said go ask

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599
don't know its value so I said go ask
 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.300
don't know its value so I said go ask
the customer who is it who has been a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
the customer who is it who has been a
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.160
the customer who is it who has been a
benefit go ask the beneficiary of this

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
benefit go ask the beneficiary of this
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110
benefit go ask the beneficiary of this
how much it's worth to the beneficiary

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
how much it's worth to the beneficiary
 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.940
how much it's worth to the beneficiary
so we don't know who the beneficiary is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
so we don't know who the beneficiary is
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.069
so we don't know who the beneficiary is
and all the women began to say you mean

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079
and all the women began to say you mean
 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.080
and all the women began to say you mean
you're giving me a job whose value you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
you're giving me a job whose value you
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.580
you're giving me a job whose value you
don't know who the beneficiary isn't

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
don't know who the beneficiary isn't
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.259
don't know who the beneficiary isn't
don't know they started asking that

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269
don't know they started asking that
 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.390
don't know they started asking that
question and within three years I think

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
question and within three years I think
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.550
question and within three years I think
we had five or six or ten promotions and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
we had five or six or ten promotions and
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.039
we had five or six or ten promotions and
then my job today is held by one of the

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049
then my job today is held by one of the
 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.140
then my job today is held by one of the
women that got promoted at that time so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
women that got promoted at that time so
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.270
women that got promoted at that time so
that's another side in some way that's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
that's another side in some way that's
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.039
that's another side in some way that's
that's an example of what you do when

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
that's an example of what you do when
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.860
that's an example of what you do when
you're later

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.930
you
