[Background voices]

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:06.720
&gt;&gt; So, I think the one thing that companies,
individuals, governments can all do this year

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.740
is bring some optimism to the international
system. This has probably been the gloomiest

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.099
Davos I've ever attended. You would think
we were back in the 1930s with environmental

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.800
catastrophe thrown in and I think the situation
can and will be managed. So bringing optimism

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.179
and hope to people, I think, is the most crucial
thing all of us can do so we can think about

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.039
a better future for our children.
