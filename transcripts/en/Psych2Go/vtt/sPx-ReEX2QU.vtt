00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.000
Twelve things introverts are best at doing

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.379
There's somewhat of a negative stereotype around introverts. People say that they're too quiet to have fun or be social..

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.389
Well that is a blatant lie.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.910
Just because introverts don't feel comfortable walking into a room full of strangers or making friends with everyone in a room

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.580
Doesn't mean they don't like to be fun or social

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.040
Introverts have some of the best personality traits. They just usually keep to themselves

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.400
Here are just some of the things introverts are great at doing.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.960
Number One: Having Thought Provoking Conversations

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.080
Introverts don't like small talk. The whole "How are you?" "Can you believe this weather?" "Did you see the game last night?"

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.920
Chitchat is worthless

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.609
Due to their disdain for the idle chatter, they're seen by most as unsociable and this is not the case

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.920
Introverts want to get straight down to the meat of things. They want to hear your deepest thoughts, your desires, and dreams

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.860
None of that "I'm fine. How are you?" talk.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.700
Introverts know that you have a story to tell and they want to hear it. They want to know your opinions and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.680
questions and answers to questions that are infrequently spoken about because of their deep topics

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.140
Introverts have a therapist guidance counselor mentality and charisma

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.690
causing us to make you feel more comfortable with speaking your mind and soul. This is good for everyone around

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.580
Introverts get the satisfaction of having a meaningful conversation with someone without having to fill the empty space with chit chat

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.780
And you get a part-time therapist. Someone who will really listen to you and your thoughts

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.120
Number Two: Being Effective Sales People

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.260
I know what you're thinking. "What? What in the world? An introvert excels at a profession that requires constant visa vie interaction.?"

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.640
Yes. Introverts pay attention, care, and are comfortable in familiar situations

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.000
So they can be confident in their daily jobs even as salespeople. Being highly cognitive people, introverts take time to fully

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200
understand their product, customer, and outcomes.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.680
From this, introverts are highly prepared for any unexpected events such as objections, crankiness, and touchy questions.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.800
They might not be happy with it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.900
But they can handle it effectively nonetheless.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.460
Number Three: Taking Care of Animals

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.260
Introverts love to be swaddled and love and affection by those close to them especially when it's our furry friends

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.980
So they do enjoy to return the favor

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.480
Introverts are professionals at taking care of animals especially when they do it alone. You need a dog sitter? No problem.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.540
You need someone to take care of your cat while you're away? Enough said.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.880
Introverts have no problem snuggling up next to a dog, cat, bunny, or goldfish and spending a nice day together

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:48.012
They enjoy the company of animals more than humans in most situations

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:54.232
They sympathize with animals. Introverts can calm a troubled pet since they're experienced with calming their own troubled minds.

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:58.352
They have a lot of energy and want to have fun, eat, and get their belly rubbed

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.520
But when all is said and done they need their rest

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.700
Same, Dog. Same.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.620
Four: Being Observant

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.660
Introverts aren't quiet without a purpose. They observe. While you're over there talking about the latest fad or your weird dream last night,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.440
they're listening and watching

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:20.796
They see the way your forehead wrinkles when your grandpa's mentioned, and they notice when there's a new painting hanging up in the office

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.220
Introverts spend time watching and memorizing their surroundings and environments

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.100
so they feel comfortable enough to interact with them. Who would jump into the darkness without a flashlight?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.260
Introverts prefer to analyze their surroundings rather than focus on biases so that when they finally voice out their misgivings

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.380
these should be taken seriously

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.660
Introverts are the first to notice anything slightly out of the ordinary

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.060
And they're also the ones to be the devil's advocate and notice flaws in ideas and concepts

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.800
Introverts usually spend a lot of time thinking about the worst possible situation and how to get of it so trust them

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.620
They know what they're talking about

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.180
Five: Being Great Leaders

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.320
As are many of these points, this one is notably surprising.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.260
How can someone who dislikes abundant social interaction be a great leader when a leader's job is to lead others?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.600
A recent poll shows that not all successful leaders are extroverts

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.660
Outgoing individuals use their charisma and spunk to command attention and get things done

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.760
while reserved bosses lay low and observe their underlings and always know what's best for them, the person, and the situation.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.980
They never speak just to be heard or because they're the boss. They speak to assist and help others because introverts imagine themselves in quite

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.200
every situation just to be prepared. They're careful and attentive,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.500
humble and prepared, and they're comfortable working alone, showing that good leadership isn't always flashy.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.080
So if you ever have a boss that is more on the shy or reserved side

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.020
This doesn't mean that he or she dislikes you or thinks they're better than you

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.740
It could be that they're an introvert as well and don't have anything to say about your performance since you're doing a good job without them.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.380
Six: Being Great Workers

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.120
Alongside being great leaders, introverts also know very well when to take a step back and get the work done.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.500
They're attentive, wholehearted, determined, and motivated to always do their very best.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.180
Since introverts usually don't use their words a quick wit to talk them out of sticky situations

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:28.250
They use their intellectual prowess to provide an answer rather than an excuse. Hand them an extended project, let them work alone in a comfortable

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.340
environment, and you'll get incredible results.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.660
Introverts need a little supervision because they're always triple checking

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.020
themselves, seeing the flaws in everything and preparing every argument that could be made against their work, and working around it to avoid said

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.620
confrontation. These qualities make them effective followers as well, being dedicated to the completion of their

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.820
responsibility, provided their solitude is undisturbed.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.400
Seven: Listening To Your Troubles

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.460
Have you ever needed to vent, confided in a close friend and felt like they weren't really even listening to you?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.540
That's the opposite of an introvert

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.530
Since introverts know how hard it is for them to express their emotions verbally, if a loved one

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.600
expresses feelings to them, they will listen hard and well.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.800
Introverts are perfect for when you need a shoulder to cry on or just someone to hear your story.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.350
As said earlier, introverts hate small talk, so if you go straight to the meaty deep talk,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.920
they'll provide an impeccable set of ears and even some incredible advice for you to follow.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.480
Introverts are sensitive to pain, their own and others.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.809
They can tell when you're really upset or when you need to get something off your chest. If a reserved friend

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:40.400
asks you if everything's all right, there's no need to hide behind another "I'm fine. I'm just tired."

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.200
Go ahead and tell them what's bothering you. There's no better support than that of an introverted friend

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.680
Eight: Counseling

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.100
In addition to listening, introverts excel at helping you cope with your worries.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.360
They can easily read people. While others are just listening, an introvert analyzes and interprets the speaker's thoughts, actions,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.020
choice of words, and preconceptions. They can notice little body expressions you don't even realize you're doing.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.180
They can help you pin down exactly what's bothering you and even suggest how to resolve it

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.600
Unfortunately, many introverts are familiar with pain and suffering, so they're quite experienced on how to alleviate any emotional pain you're going through.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:27.960
Furthermore, calming someone down isn't all about talking. It's about understanding and making deep relationships built on trust.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.820
Being empathetic is what introverts do

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.310
Having someone there, listening and supporting you in a time of need, is just as comforting as a nice warm

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.460
hug which many introverts may often initiate in moments like these.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.500
Nine: Thinking Before Acting

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:52.020
Introverts don't speak quite often, so when they do, every single word was chosen very carefully ahead of time.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.960
Sometimes, due to this, introverts may take a while to get a sentence out,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.040
since they're mentally preparing and rehearsing each word before they say it.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.580
Since introverts take a while to express themselves, many extroverts just ignore them and talk over them.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:13.140
This can cause introverts to become even more shy so that they don't get ignored again, as this is traumatic and embarrassing.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:20.180
So if you're introverted friend speaks up, pay close attention, because what he or she has to say is probably important

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.960
Ten: Knowing Themselves

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.440
We all know that quiet persons have the loudest minds

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:32.520
Introverts spend a lot of time in their own heads. From this, they know themselves pretty well.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.380
Aside from being silent critics, introverts are constantly having inner monologues,

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.140
evaluating themselves and their choices in everyday situations

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:47.720
Thus they rarely have any existential crises and can easily figure out their strengths and weaknesses. They know who they are,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.400
what they want, and what is important to them. They might just not tell you all of that information.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.480
You could say that they're silent, but confident.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.800
Eleven: Being A Source Of Wisdom

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.200
By nature, introverts love

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.200
information, learning, and discovering new things.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.800
They might not be the first to go mountain climbing

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.640
But they'll definitely be all over a new NASA discovery. Their minds are constantly

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.000
urging for more facts and things to ponder over in the silence of their daily lives.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:21.000
Not only that, but they use these interesting facts and information to share with others when the time is relevant.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.020
So you never know when your small voiced friend might know the exact answer to your problems after reading about a similar situation months ago.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.980
Twelve: Being A Loyal Friend

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.020
Introvert friends will not betray you. They have no reason to.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.200
They would never talk about you behind your back or lie to you in a harmful way

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.940
Every secret desire or dream you've ever shared with them will always be safe whether or not the friendship lasts.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:52.020
Introverts cherish friendships and no matter the circumstances would never betray someone who once confided in them

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.820
They value relationships and try hard to keep them, which makes them some of the best friends you will ever have.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:05.140
Introverts have quite a lot of skills in those quiet little bodies. If you're an extrovert, don't be hesitant to communicate with silent peers.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.760
You'll be surprised at what they're capable of and if you're an introvert, be proud.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.080
You have nothing to feel inferior about, since behind that shyness lies a storm of talents

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.800
