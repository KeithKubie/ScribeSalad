Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we're going to talk

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.389
about the single most important document in
America, one that we'll be talking about a

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.080
lot over next few months. No, I'm not talking
about O Magazine - it's the United States Constitution,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.240
and what we're really gonna focus on is how it got made
and how it became the foundation of our government.

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:28.129
[Theme Music]

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.580
Those of you who watched the U.S. History
series with John Green probably remember that

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.940
the government set up by the Constitution
is actually the second attempt at an American

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.829
government. Also, as pointed out in the comments,
you probably noticed that I am not John Green.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.930
The first American government, which was in
place during the Revolutionary War and for

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.520
almost 10 years afterwards, was the Articles
of Confederation. Like many first attempts,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.199
the Articles government had some good ideas
and it meant well, but it was poorly executed.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.149
Give it a break, it never did this before!

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.149
So when delegates gathered in Philadelphia
in 1787 to revise the Articles, they ended

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.289
up scrapping the whole thing and creating
a new Constitution. It's probably not because

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.219
they didn't know what revise meant. So, the
delegates from the various states each had

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.860
their own agendas at the Constitutional Convention,
and that made it difficult for them to agree

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.350
on what the new government should look like.
In order to hammer out a Constitution, they

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.810
had to do something you don't see very much
of in government these days - compromise.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.770
Oh, let's compromise, I'm sorry, eagle, I
didn't mean...

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.829
Before we get into what those compromises
were, it's kinda necessary to look at what

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.619
was so bad about the Articles government in
the first place. The main thing was it really

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.039
couldn't govern. There was no executive branch
or president and no judiciary to settle disputes.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.180
It was basically just a congress where each
state was equally represented and they all

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.390
pretty much had veto power and could sink
legislation they didn't like. All decisions

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.630
were collective, which meant that very few
decisions were actually made, because it's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.990
really hard to get 13 people to agree on something
that will be in the interest of all 13. I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.070
can barely agree with Stan on anything. Right,
Stan? He said wrong.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.189
Most important, the Articles government had
no power to levy taxes, which meant that if

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.570
it needed any money to do, well, anything,
it had to ask for the money from the states,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.200
which were free to say, "No, I don't think we'll be
giving you any money today. ...or tomorrow. Or ever."

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.780
As I remember from my college years - and
I don't remember much - living without money

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.840
is awful. Without money, it's pretty much
impossible for a government to do anything,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.640
except buy ramen noodles. The Articles government
was able to accomplish one notable thing,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.630
though. One of the big issues it had to deal
with was Americans moving out West, which

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.960
in the 1770's and 80's meant to places like
Ohio and Indiana that weren't states yet.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.970
The government managed to set up rules for
these settlements in the Northwest Ordinance

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.840
of 1787, which set up a system for eventual
statehood. But most importantly, it forbade

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.270
slavery in these territories, which, as students
of American history know, was kind of a big

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.820
deal. You wouldn't know that, you're not a student
of American history. You're a symbol of America, bird!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.280
I'm not gonna punch you.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.760
Other than that, though, the Articles government
was a flop. And the very thing that made it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.350
so ineffective threatened to screw up any
attempts at new government, too. This was

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.990
the issue of competing interests between different
states, more specifically the states with

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.810
large populations and the smaller states.
Basically, a state with a large population

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.780
like, say, Virginia, had different needs than
a state with a small population, like Delaware.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.010
More importantly, large states might stand
to benefit more from any government spending.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.700
When the delegates decided to make a new congress,
these large population states wanted the number

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.290
of representatives to that congress to be
proportional to the states' populations, which

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.130
would mean that the larger states would have
more representatives than the smaller ones.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.150
This idea, a large congress made up of many
delegates, was called The Virginia Plan. Because

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.290
it was put forward by the delegates from Wisconsin.
Just kidding...Virginia.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.620
The delegates from small New Jersey put forward a
plan that would have a congress where each state would send an equal

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.340
number of representatives. In other words, something
that looked a lot like the Articles government.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.420
This New Jersey Plan would prevent smaller states
from being dominated by the larger states, and also

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.120
ensure that the large states wouldn't be able to vote
themselves a bigger share of government spending.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.230
These two opposing interests threatened to
scuttle the whole new government thing until

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.420
Roger Sherman from Connecticut proposed The
Great Compromise, that gave us the bicameral

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.140
legislature that we talked about in episode two,
and we've all come to know and love, sometimes.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.480
So The Great Compromise meant that we would
have a two-house legislature, but this wasn't

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.900
the only issue related to how the seats in
Congress would be apportioned. The membership

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.390
in the House would be based on the state's
population, but at the time there was an issue

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.060
about how to count that population.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.640
The issue was slavery. More specifically,
how to count slaves as part of a state's population.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.900
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.380
The states with large slave populations, like
South Carolina and Virginia, had a pretty

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.830
big interest in counting these slaves for
the purposes of determining representation.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.980
And the states with few slaves didn't want
them counted at all. Because this would mean

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.600
that the white non-slave people in those states
with lots of slaves would effectively be better

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.780
represented than the white non-slave people
in the states with few slaves.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.290
The delegates at the Constitutional Convention
solved this problem with another compromise

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.730
that was decidedly less great. Article 1 Section
2 of the Constitution includes the following

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.480
clause: "Representatives and direct taxes
shall be apportioned among the several states

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.960
which may be included within this union, according
to their respective numbers, which shall be

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.690
determined by adding to the whole number of
free persons, including those bound to service

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.990
for a term of years, and excluding Indians
not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons."

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.900
If you're looking for the word "slave," you
won't find it. They're the ones described

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.200
by the phrase, "three-fifths of all other persons."
This is the notorious Three-Fifths Compromise.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.880
What it means is that in order to determine
how many representatives a state has, you

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.570
count the number of free people in the state,
including indentured servants, and add to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.630
that number three-fifths of the number of
non-free persons, otherwise known as slaves.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.470
So in terms of counting, each slave was
worth three-fifths of each free person.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.700
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.220
Anyway, this meant that states with large
populations of slaves would be disproportionately

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.860
represented in Congress, but not quite so
badly that most northern states with small

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.960
numbers of slaves wouldn't vote for the Constitution.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.370
What this also did was enshrine the idea that
slaves, who were mostly black, were worth

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.450
less than free people, who were mostly white.
And it embedded slavery into the Constitution.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.660
So before this constitution of compromise
could go into effect, it had to be ratified

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.620
by at least 9 of the 13 states. So each state
had a special convention where delegates could

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.570
vote on whether or not to adopt the new constitution.
These conventions were more open to the public

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.030
than the Constitutional Convention itself,
and the ratification process is the reason

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.130
why some people say the Constitution is based
on the will of the people.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.420
But not everybody wanted the Constitution,
and they needed convincing. This is where

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.700
things get a little confusing. Did you want
the Constitution? Did ya?

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.180
In 1787, public opinion about the Constitution
was pretty evenly divided. Those who wanted

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.510
the Constitution were called Federalists,
largely because of the Federalist Papers,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.240
a series of articles written by Alexander
Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.990
They wrote the Federalist Papers to convince
voters in New York to ratify the Constitution.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.540
And since New York did eventually ratify the
document, I guess they worked. But we should

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.140
listen to both sides of the argument...in
the Clone Zone.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.320
So joining us in the Clone Zone today will
be Federalist Clone and Anti-Federalist Clone.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.920
Let's hear from Federalist Clone first. Feddy?
Can I call you Feddy?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.040
No. The Federalists were the incredibly intelligent
Americans who thought that a strong central

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.150
government would benefit the country as a
whole. They tended to come from cities, and

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.430
often they represented commercial classes,
especially wealthy people, who had lent money

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.320
to the government during the Revolution.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.170
They liked the new Constitution because they
felt that a strong national government would

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.450
pay its debts, and this was good for business.
They also tended to want stronger ties with

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.080
England, again because England was a good
trading partner. Given the raging success

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.920
of the Articles government, it's pretty clear
that the Federalists were right.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.680
Okay, now let's hear from Anti-Federalist
Clone. How do you respond, Anti?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.550
I'm not your aunt! Sure, Federalists were
right to believe in tyranny. Anti-Federalists

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.770
were right to be skeptical of a large government
that would trample on our individual liberties.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.120
They didn't want a big government that would
tax them to death, and possibly take away

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.280
their slaves. In general, Anti-Federalists
felt that states would be the best protectors

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.750
of people's rights and liberties, because
being smaller, they would be more responsive

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.700
to people's needs. Okay?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.160
The Anti-Federalists published pamphlets and
articles, too. But we weren't quite as organized,

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.830
so we didn't have a coherent set of Anti-Federalist
Papers to push on government students.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.080
Okay, okay, you seem really mad about this.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.860
I am.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.240
But you eventually lost the debate.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.960
I did.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.871
Huzzah!

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.400
How come he got to shoot fireworks--

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.540
--I didn't know he was gonna--

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.460
--I wanna shoot fireworks--

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.180
Okay? I'm sorry, I'm sorry--next time. You
can have fireworks.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.430
So the Federalist position won out and the
Constitution was ratified. And that's the

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.090
government that Americans have been living
under ever since. Hooray!

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.180
Because the Constitution was passed, we tend
to think that everyone loved it. But it wasn't

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:53.000
nearly as clear-cut as hindsight makes it
appear.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.420
Eventually, the Federalists had to offer another
compromise, promising a Bill of Rights in

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.930
the first ten amendments. This isn't called
one of the constitutional compromises because

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.330
it happened outside of the Convention, but
it was yet another example of how different

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.980
interests had to give a little in order to
get a Constitution passed.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.360
It's very important to remember that compromise,
the idea of balancing interests and giving

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.790
a little to get a lot, is embedded in the
Constitution. While today it seems like a

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.919
political dirty word, compromise is the basis
of the American government itself.

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:20.680
Thanks for watching. I'll seeya next week.
Well, I'll compromise. Seeya in a week and

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.240
a half. Let's face it; Stan's probably not
going to get this done in time anyway.
