00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.571
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.540
- Welcome to our
conversation with history.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.640
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.780
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.910
Our guest today is Mary Ann Mason

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.330
who is a professor and co-director

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.170
of the Center for Economics
and Family Security

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.810
at the University of California
Berkeley School of Law.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.100
Her most recent book
co-authored with her daughter

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.110
Eve Mason Ekman is
Mothers on the Fast Track:

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.110
How a New Generation Can
Balance Family and Careers.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.293
Mary Ann, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.113
- Thank you Harry. (laughs)

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:22.880
- [Harry] Well you're
already at Berkeley, sorry.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.850
Welcome to the program.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.120
- Nice to be here in this room.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.923
- Thank you, welcome to our program.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.890
Where were you born and raised?

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
- I was born in Minnesota,
Hibbing, Minnesota.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.223
Bob Dylan country.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:38.230
One of the coldest places
in the world. (laughs)

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.410
And then we moved quite a lot.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.630
Went to college and graduate
school on the east coast

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.430
and then came to California
where I've been happily here

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.970
for more than 40 years.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.410
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.560
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.794
- Ah, that's a good question.

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:55.840
My father's an immigration officer.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.170
They were not intellectuals.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.203
They were very good, decent people.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.720
I think they shaped it in
part because we moved so often

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.580
that we were always new places,
moving, seeing new things.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.090
And as an only child I spent a lot of time

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.360
observing what I was seeing.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.430
So in some ways it was
a very good preparation

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.080
for anyone to be a student of the world.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.110
- And so in traveling did you
met a lot of different people

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.220
at a very young age and
different sets of friends?

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.170
- Yes, very much.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.240
I think the most memorable
probably was a convent school

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.700
in Winnipeg, Canada, very strict

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.890
where the nuns were very strict

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.310
mainly boarding students and
some commuters like myself

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.760
and it was always dark in Winnipeg

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.690
'cause it's so far north, so I'd start out

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.050
with my three buses at
seven in the morning

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.180
and then I'd take the three
buses home in the dark

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.680
in the dark and it was in
many ways a bleak time,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.340
but I made such good friendships

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520
and I got to really admire the teachers.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.980
I saw a whole different culture, in a way,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.250
that I wouldn't have if
I'd been in a regular,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.947
fun high school and having
a good time. (laughs)

00:02:56.947 --> 00:03:00.330
- Was there discussion
around the dinner table

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.730
about world issues and
also women's issues?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.940
When did that first
enter your consciousness?

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.060
- Not around my kitchen table.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.520
Most of the discussion
was what did you have

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.210
for lunch today, and I think
the basement needs fixing

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.310
or something of that nature.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.520
Very good people, but as I
say, it wasn't very worldly

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.500
inside the house, very supportive.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680
- And any teachers along this--

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.870
- Yes.
- Circuitous route.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.510
- Yes, in terms of the
women's movement, I mean,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.900
I graduated from Vassar in 1965,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.870
which is really just on the cusp.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.070
When I was a senior in college I remember

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.400
I was reading both Bride Magazine

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.010
'cause maybe like half of my classmates

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.640
was going to get married
right away on graduation

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.353
and I also picked up Betty
Friedan's The Feminine Mystique.

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:48.480
It was just amazing the juxtaposition

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.844
and it really was that time in history.

00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:54.883
I had one professor at
Vassar, Carl Degler,

00:03:54.883 --> 00:03:57.750
a wonderful historian and a great mentor

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.810
and I did my thesis with him
and he was very encouraging.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.420
He said you must go to graduate
school, you must get a PhD.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.880
And they were very good at Vassar

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.070
because they encouraged women to do things

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.010
that wasn't so common at that time.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.140
If I'd been at another school

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.630
I would not have gotten
that encouragement.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.737
And I said, "Well thank
you Professor Degler,

00:04:13.737 --> 00:04:17.057
"but I'm sorry, I'm getting
married this summer.

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:19.847
"I'll go back to school sometime perhaps,

00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:22.250
"but I have to go where my husband is."

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.367
And he asked me where my fiance was.

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:25.247
And he said, "Oh, well,

00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:26.947
"they have a wonderful history department.

00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:29.837
"You can go there and I'm
sure you can get a fellowship,

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:32.217
"a national fellowship,
why don't you apply for it?

00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:33.237
"I'll help you."

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:34.580
"Oh, thank you Professor Degler."

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.100
And then he actually, he didn't stalk me,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.517
but every time he saw me on
campus he'd come over and say,

00:04:38.517 --> 00:04:40.957
"Miss Mason, have you
applied yet, Miss Mason?"

00:04:40.957 --> 00:04:43.440
"Oh Professor Degler, I'm
getting around to it."

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.020
So finally I applied and I got it

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.030
and so I started a PhD program
where my first husband was

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.140
getting his PhD and I knew we'd be there

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.120
just for a short time,
but because I'd started

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.775
and really loved it I continued

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.150
when we moved out to Berkeley.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.050
And he made all the difference.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.269
- And what drew you to history?

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:06.830
- Well I was a history
major as an undergraduate

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.440
and it was, now that I think about it,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.100
it was kind of like my
early days of traveling.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.700
It was seeing the world
from different perspectives.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.590
It was just to me opening up all,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.860
more interesting than novels

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.770
'cause it was whole civilizations
and whole governments

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.400
and just all of world's
knowledge was there.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.980
And then I loved, loved, loved,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.330
those were the days when
you spent time in the stacks

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.150
just with your nose in the primary sources

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.690
reading letters from
the French Revolution.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.038
Just very exciting.

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:39.610
- And so talk now, let's relate this

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.800
to your emerging consciousness
about women's issues.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.490
You mention reading Betty
Friedan as an undergraduate.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.720
So I get the sense in reading about you

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.720
that the life you were living
and the movement around you,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.770
the women's movement
really opened up your,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.930
so there was an interaction there

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.160
between the life you were living

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.300
and what the women movement was saying.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.520
- Right, I came out to Berkeley in 1967

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.330
and that will raise anyone's
consciousness about everything.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.800
It was the days of the
riots and the free speech

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.960
and the anti-Vietnam, is
was really quite thrilling

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.140
and all your suppositions
and understandings

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.340
of everything are just up for grabs.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.670
So it was very active,
and the women's movement

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.480
was very nascent then, this
was just the end of the '60s.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.100
It started to grow and I joined

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.380
the consciousness raising
movement like many women.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.580
And then we started, I was teaching

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.270
while I was a graduate
student at a small college,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.660
Holy Names College in Oakland

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.430
and we got together all
the women in California

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.820
who were teaching history
at four-year colleges

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.660
and there were eight of us.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.650
It was really a very tiny band
and a lot of closed doors.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.920
Only 1.3 women historians
in all the UC campuses,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.800
in all nine UC campuses.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.340
So I think that raised my consciousness

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.540
more than anything else to know

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.890
that it still was such a closed door.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.220
That there was a lot of
talk, but very little action

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.450
in terms of opening the doors.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.680
When I finally got to Berkeley
as a professor in 1989

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.200
things had changed dramatically

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.897
and I think at that time about
15% of the faculty were women

00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:28.670
but it was only 2% of
all the faculty in 1972.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.050
So it was a huge shift
during that period of time.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.770
- As a historian, what was your focus

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.970
and how did that focus change over time?

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.640
- Yes, it was American labor history,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.500
which is part of American social history.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.920
So in some ways it really
didn't change over time.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.480
It's always looking at the
masses rather than the classes

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.390
and what they're doing
and what's happening.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.630
And I did my dissertation
in The Bancroft Library

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.340
on a California labor
leader and I loved it.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.750
I loved every minute
of being on this campus

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.050
during my dissertation.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.360
I didn't get back for many years,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.830
but I really loved being here at the time.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.252
Like graduate students,
these were the best years

00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:04.583
of my life. (laughs)

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.000
- At a certain point you decide

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.350
that you want to move beyond history

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.710
and undertake a law degree.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.040
- Well, I don't know that people's lives,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.300
certainly women's lives
are not that, I think,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.120
clearly guided from within.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.310
What happened is a small
college that I was teaching at,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.100
they didn't go coed, but Saint Mary's,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.400
which was the men's college.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.950
A similar thing happened in the east coast

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.840
when men's colleges went coed

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.280
and a lot of the women's
colleges lost their,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.880
basically lost their students.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.060
So they let go all of
their lay faculty one year

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.060
and I had just actually
had a child by this time.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.490
He was just a year and a half, I think.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.500
And I just didn't want
to be a gypsy scholar

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.040
or a sort of, I just didn't know.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.233
So I went to law school
just because I didn't know.

00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:51.130
And I continued to teach history

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.240
while I was in law school actually.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.770
So I actually went over three
years, three and a half years

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.790
and was always teaching history

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.430
first at San Francisco
State and then actually

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.823
full time at Saint Mary's.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.910
Again, looking back you
make patterns of your life

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.910
retrospectively I think
rather than the time

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.560
you just sort of move with the flow.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.240
But I did like law a lot, it
was very interesting to me

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.420
and still is.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.420
- And several of your books
are actually on family law

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.044
and divorce and the rights
of children and so on.

00:09:26.044 --> 00:09:27.490
- Yes, rights of children
and child custody

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.340
are my specialties, and step
parents to some extent as well.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.887
So I did spend many
years teaching children

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:37.350
and the law and family
law, juvenile court law.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.665
- And how do you account
for this particular focus,

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:42.393
or do you?
- Ah, that's a good question.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.920
Yes, actually I know exactly why I did.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.220
I wrote a book in 1989
called The Equality Trap

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.870
which was about basically
opening up the doors to women

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.870
but not leveling the playing field

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.100
so that you're kind of
setting women up for failure.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.370
And women themselves at that time

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.330
did not want to be accommodationist.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.400
So they were not asking for
any kind of mommy tract.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.560
Paid leave or flexible time,
this was considered to be,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.290
in fact my book was
considered to be a little bit

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.440
of a traitor to the movement
'cause I was talking

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.900
about accommodations, and then I realized

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.210
when I came to Berkeley that
the way that you can do that

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.250
is actually through children.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.960
You can think about women's
issues through children

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.660
and get a lot of the
same structural changes

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.310
that you might have if you
had just focused on women.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.120
And at that time, to be honest, I suppose

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.220
I was playing it a little
more safe than perhaps,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.570
just in the sense that
being a feminist anything

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.010
was not necessarily a popular thing

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.630
in terms of getting
tenure at Berkeley then.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.450
But more than that, I really
was interested in children,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.510
who were very, very understudied.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.600
Even now, there are so
few books about children

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.320
and children's history
and children's culture.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.810
We've actually started,
Paula Fass here on campus

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.470
has really begun this
movement and many of us

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.020
are doing the history of
childhood in various ways.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.260
- It's interesting
because it is very clear

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.260
that central to your work is
kind of a focus on the family.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.510
- Yes.
- And you just suggested

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.260
that in a way that the
early feminists my have been

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.070
overly dismissive of the
family in their efforts

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.230
to get liberation and equality for women.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.900
Is that a fair assessment?
- Well, yes.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.210
I mean I think it's an
understandable assessment

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.210
because women have always
been so closely stereotyped

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.600
and caught in the family
that there was no opportunity

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.360
for them to change or grow,
so I certainly understand

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.950
why there was a rejection of the family.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.440
In fact in my years when
my children were born

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.838
it was kind of the don't
ask don't tell years.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.590
You didn't bring them to school.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.529
You didn't even tell your professors

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:01.720
or the professors, I remember
when my son was born,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.700
I think I was finishing
my PhD and professors

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.040
kind of looked at your pregnant self

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.050
and never mentioned it
and you didn't mention it

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.950
and that was the way it was.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.810
So it wasn't considered an advantage

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.260
and it was considered something
that was your own problem.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.560
It was not a social or
a workplace problem.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.520
- You probably have thought a lot about

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.460
how the women's movement
have had to evolve.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.520
And I assume you bring a
kind of a sense of history

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.290
and a historian's way of looking at that.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.610
Talk a little about that evolution

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.220
where as we do this
interview we're celebrating

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.810
the anniversary of Betty Friedan's books.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.780
So there's a lot in the
press and this new book

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.780
by the CEO of Facebook Sheryl
Sandberg on leaning in.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.320
So reflect a little on what you've seen

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.240
of the women's movement and how
it's impacted you and so on.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.750
- Of course when I think
of the women's movement

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.227
as a historian I think of 1848
and Seneca Falls Convention,

00:13:07.227 --> 00:13:08.777
the first women's rights convention

00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:12.530
and the suffragettes and
mainly in those first years

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.100
women tried so hard to get
just very basic rights.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.250
And those rights were really
voting rights, not so much,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.420
and to some extent divorce,
but the women's movement

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.380
actually was always very
mixed on the divorce issues.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.030
But the current women's
movement has really been focused

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.710
on economic gain and in
entry into the workplace.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.470
And it's really not coincidental
that it's the same time

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.170
that the family wage is no longer possible

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.300
and can't support women and children.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.740
My father did on an
immigration officer's salary

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.220
and bought a car and a little
house, but not possible today.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.600
So the workplace opened
up not because the women

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.570
banged on the door, it opened
up because the economy shifted

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.940
and we needed two incomes to do it.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.850
But it also opened up for
women going into professions

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.524
and fields that had been
very dominated by men.

00:14:02.524 --> 00:14:05.790
So that's the thrust of this
current women's movement,

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.310
which was not the case for
the older women's movements.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.840
And because the thrust was

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.760
to get into the economic structure

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.670
I think the first wave felt strongly

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.600
that they had to do it on men's terms.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.150
It was the only way they're
going to be able to make it.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.220
And to some extent there's
still a truth to that,

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.560
a strong truth to that.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.900
So there was really a fear of recognition

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.510
that there would be
anything holding them back

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.300
or anything that would possibly
tie them still to the family

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.770
either psychologically or
structurally or whatever.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.370
And that really began to change happily.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.740
As I said, I wrote this book in 1989

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.720
that talked about accommodation
in the workplace, nyet.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.650
And then in 2000 when I started
working on this issue again

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.470
as graduate dean I was
really pleased to hear

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.100
that it was a welcome
voice, my voice was welcome

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.350
and people were looking at
structure, structural change

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.190
and not just on doing it like the men.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.993
Children and families had
been noticed in the meantime.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.180
And that was very good,
although I have to say

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.090
the younger generation, my
daughter and her friends

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.000
never knew that there'd be any problem

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.620
because they assumed that,
although they had no children

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.420
and had no family,
because they were raised

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.070
in such an egalitarian
atmosphere they didn't recognize

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.700
that they might run into bumps at all.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.100
So I asked her to write the book with me

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.000
so she could interview a lot of the women

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.930
like Dianne Feinstein,
women who had been there

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.543
and done that with families.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.740
It was a very, very
strong experience for her.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.220
- You're suggesting in your work and now

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.970
that really both the
family and women's issues

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.970
sort of feel the pressures
of the changes in society

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.770
both internationally and nationally.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.650
So globalization enters
into this discussion.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.030
Inequality enters into this discussion.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.840
And also the divisions
within the women's movement,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.710
namely working class
women who have to work

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.710
versus professional women
who, say, can hire a nanny

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.050
to do some of the functions at home.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.100
- In The Equality Trap I called
it women who worked to live

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.850
and women who lived to
work and to some extent

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.610
that division was even clearer then

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.550
than it is now I think
because the first group

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.040
of feminists who got into
professional organizations

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.530
were very, very strong and
organized and brought suits

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.580
and they opened the doors.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.350
And the second group now, I think,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.170
is wondering why it all didn't
turn out like they wanted.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.040
Like Anne-Marie Slaughter's
book on how hard it is

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.770
you can't have it all, et cetera.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.140
I think this is very good that
this debate is raised again

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.000
because I think it was quiet for a while

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.280
and now they're raising it
with kind of different stakes

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.380
but a lot of the same old arguments.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.690
- Do you think there's
a better conversation

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:04.690
within the women's movement
between the different classes

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.327
within the women's movement so that

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.270
professional wealthy women
can understand the situation

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:19.010
of working-class women
who really have to work?

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.390
- No, and I think that's
never been the strength

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.370
of the women's movement.

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.890
It's always been very
articulate, well-educated,

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.040
professional or at least
certainly college-educated women.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.570
Often authors or journalists, et cetera

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.610
who have run the conversation.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.240
Not much attention to the most women

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.260
who are the low-income
workers and have to work.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.520
The only thing I can say about that,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.700
which is kind of interesting.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.700
In the last 30 years,
the great time divide

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.410
that women who are lower income

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.420
actually are working
fewer hours partly 'cause

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.029
they don't have enough hours.

00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:59.170
They're working hourly rates often.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.300
And women who are
professionals have shut up

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.040
in terms of the number of
hours that they're working,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.820
many more hours than the women
who are more low-income jobs.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.859
So we're essentially
working harder all the time

00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:14.280
if you actually shattered
that ceiling anyway

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.653
or got even into any kind of profession.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.240
- So you are a lawyer, you are a historian

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:28.130
and then you become
university administrator.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.760
- Yes.
- And so talk a little

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.770
about that before we
get into one of the way

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.073
you try to address the women's
issue as a graduate dean.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.570
What's the difference
in the skills required

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.960
for each of these professions?

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.360
- Well, they are different skill
sets, no question about it.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.300
I mean, this university
system has a tradition

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.920
of taking people from the faculty.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.680
And the strong part about that

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.250
is that you're on the side of the faculty,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.320
although people say you've
gone to the dark side

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.900
and you understand the
inherent problems with faculty.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.730
You understand the structure
of the university, probably.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.210
But many people who are
pointed at these jobs

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.540
with these huge budgets,
they have never looked

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.700
at an accounting sheet or
have much sense of that

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.410
or have worked with personnel before.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.270
And any kind of manager,
those are the two big things.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.210
The budget and the personnel.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.380
So that is kind of a steep curve for many.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.210
Actually I had some administrative jobs

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.930
when I was a lawyer, so
I had a little experience

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.550
on a smaller scale.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.040
Berkeley has as you know more
graduate students than anybody

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.210
so it's a much larger
scale in terms of budget

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.850
and personnel, but also the good part

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.200
about large institutions
like this you just say, well,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.710
send it to legal, to some extent.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.910
You have to manage it, but
you have a lot of people

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.190
to help you as well, and very talented

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.280
mid-level administrators
at this university.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.930
The reason I wanted, well
actually I was kind of surprised

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.310
that they wanted me to be, and honestly

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.530
I'd been active on the campus

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.120
and I was acting associate dean

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.837
for a period of time and I enjoyed it.

00:20:01.837 --> 00:20:05.090
The thing I liked most
about it both in terms

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.727
of faculty-centered kinds of service

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.850
and also being the associate
dean is that you get to see

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.590
the wide breadth of this
incredible university.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.440
Most of us are just
stuck in our departments

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.730
and you just see the same
limited number of people,

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.140
but this is such an
incredibly fabulous place.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.470
105 graduate programs.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.930
I always said, I could
recognize the name if I saw it,

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.450
but I couldn't rattle
it off, there's so many.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.430
And each of them has got
just a wealth of information,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.880
brilliance, discovery, innovation

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.200
and it's just breathtaking,
that was the most wonderful part

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.460
about being dean to be able to all of it,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.920
the whole scope of it.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.920
- So in this new position,
how did you come to identify

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.600
the problem of women, their
careers, and the university?

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.920
Was this just a natural
choice given your background?

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.340
- Well, it was a natural choice.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.530
It was made a lot easier
because when I first arrived

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.280
there was a small research unit

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.790
that had been put in
place by my predecessor

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.910
Mark Golden, who's been
my partner in research

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.750
all these years was a staff person

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.017
and he came to me and he said,

00:21:24.017 --> 00:21:26.110
"I know you're interested
in family issues."

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.180
I guess he knew something
about my background.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.017
He said, "We have this great database

00:21:30.017 --> 00:21:33.187
"and it's got all the PhDs
that ever got their PhDs

00:21:33.187 --> 00:21:36.427
"since 1973 and it's longitudinal.

00:21:36.427 --> 00:21:39.417
"They follow them through
every two years, 10%.

00:21:39.417 --> 00:21:41.767
"I can ask questions
for you like I can say,

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:43.597
"look at your graduate students now.

00:21:43.597 --> 00:21:46.027
"Who is going to fall out,
who's going to stay in?

00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:48.670
"What affect does family
formation have on them?"

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.230
I was thrilled because this
is the kind of information

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.250
that I knew could really
make a difference.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.220
I mean, data speak.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.100
If you've got numbers and you've got,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.070
I knew that much about the university.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.236
The only things that change things

00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:00.500
are when you've got a lot of evidence

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.280
to show why it needs changing.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.620
And he's a great researcher
and we started out

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.110
and did the research, started
with just a baseline survey

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.590
of all the UC faculty on family issues.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.100
How many children do they
have, what concerns they had,

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.700
had they ever used any
policies, et cetera.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.040
And that was a real catalyst,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.840
'cause then we had some real information,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.090
and then we started
crunching some of the numbers

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.750
with this survey of doctor recipient.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.520
And the Sloan Foundation found me.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.720
And literally this is what
the Sloan Foundation did

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.030
in those days, if they found someone

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.570
who they thought was doing
really interesting work

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.280
in the area, in this case, was work family

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.170
they just supported you, so
they supported us for 10 years.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.860
And that allowed us to add,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.500
actually just maybe one more person.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.870
It almost a small staff and
to sort of thing big visions

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.510
about what we could do
next, so it was a wonderful,

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.920
thrilling time because
we produced the data.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.890
We did the UC faculty, we did
all the doctoral students.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.330
We did all the postdocs in the systems

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.847
and we had these huge
samples that nobody ever had.

00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:03.520
You could really say
something pretty strong

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.430
about how graduate students
felt about the university.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.750
Did they think it was family friendly?

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.310
What were their plans?

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.120
And you could get an enormous
amount of information

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.500
just by asking people.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.700
Surveys are not easy to do

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.260
because no one likes to answer them.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.820
So we had to rely on the
president of the university

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.890
and the chancellors to
really kind of push people

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.440
along to do it, but they were
willing, they were willing.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.343
So we had a really good
timing and set of issues

00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:31.380
that was critical, clearly,
to a lot of people.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.020
And producing all the data that we did

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.470
at a time when nobody else
had data was very timely.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.800
- And were the right
questions already being asked,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.420
or did you have to come in and say,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.340
well what about this and what about that?

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.210
So what was the degree of addition

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.090
that you were bringing to the table

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.480
in addition to identifying
what could be done here

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.560
because of your knowledge of the problems?

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.630
- Well we did, we created the survey

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.460
so you could ask all the
questions you thought

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.810
would be relevant and we
tried to do some carry-through

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.610
questions between the
faculty and the postdocs

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.430
and the graduate students
like, how busy is everybody?

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.310
Looking at a household for a particular,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.290
if you have a child and
they're mother and the father,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.030
who works the most hours?

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.650
And you saw a distinct and
almost identical second shift

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.450
for mothers between the
faculty and graduate students

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.690
and the postdocs who had
children in the home.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.140
And a huge second shift,
an additional 20 hours

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.325
to what the fathers were
doing and 30 hours over

00:24:35.325 --> 00:24:38.060
or 40 hours over what
everyone else was doing.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.570
When you see it like that
and you see 'em identical,

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.660
you know this is not
just a generational issue

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.290
that things are still pretty
much the way they were.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.880
That particular finding and
the slide that we had with it

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.840
I think was one of the most
eye-opening for everyone

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.740
to know that it's still
largely a mother's problem

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.360
and that is an issue.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.720
That was one of the ground-breakers.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.890
So we knew the questions and then in terms

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:03.390
of what policies to do, really fortunate

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.130
there were people in the
office of the president

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.070
who had some ideas.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.850
A lot of people have good ideas

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.410
and although this system is
large and sometimes ungainly

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.110
it's very centralized, so
when you're doing anything

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:19.110
like personnel policy or
leaves or maternity benefits

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.450
all the campuses do it all together.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.840
So we could do UC-wide
family friendly policies

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.990
in one fell scoop. (laughs)

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.470
- Now I wanna break this down
and walk you through the data

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:39.470
in a minute, but I think
a very important point

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.660
that you make in summarizing a lot of this

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.280
in one of the papers that I read

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:51.170
is that previously most
of the focus had been

00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:56.326
on ensuring women's equality
by looking at representation,

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.200
you know, and salary.
- Yes.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.540
- But what was being
added now to the equation

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.540
was measuring also what
was happening to the family

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.610
who was assuming the burden of
responsibility in the family

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.840
and what were the costs of that for women

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.760
in their efforts to be equal in society?

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.690
- We were adding that, we
were adding another thing

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.910
'cause we stood the basic question.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.750
What is the effect of family formation

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.820
on the career lives of men and women

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.720
on its head and asked what is the effect

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.640
of careers on family and here we showed

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.110
even a greater discrepancy

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.270
than who gets to be a tenured faculty

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.440
in terms of those people
who are tenured faculty,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.700
who has children and a
marriage and who doesn't.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.860
Huge gap, I think it's 42%
for tenured faculty women

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.560
versus 75% for tenured faculty men.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.810
So you have a gap in both ways,
kind of a double gap there.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.800
There are fewer women at the top

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.330
and those that are have fewer families,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.290
fewer children and are
less likely to be married.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.160
So it's kind of a double whammy.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.400
I call it double trouble
for gender equity. (laughs)

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.240
And then we also did find the discrepancy

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.600
in the hours of work, as you say.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.840
- Right, so

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.210
in this data, were you surprised
by some of the findings

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.730
or did it just confirm what
you had already thought?

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.100
- What I was really surprised at

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.690
is that most of the
leak out of the pipeline

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.210
both men and women likely leave,

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.310
but more woman than men actually occurred,

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.680
well after they got their PhD,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.380
but they changed their mind
during the graduate school years

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.470
and during the postdoc years.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.870
They make up their mind, they
changed their career goals

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.760
away from their original choice

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.620
and are more likely to drop out,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.370
highly more likely to drop
out of they have children.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.110
Like with postdocs, a
woman who has a child

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.520
while they're a postdoc is 41% say

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.170
they're no longer going
to pursue their career.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.140
Just too damn hard.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.260
Whereas the fathers, only
20% change their mind

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.560
and single women, 19%,
so you have a huge gap.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.820
And the graduate students
as well, a huge gap

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.570
from the beginning when they
enter their graduate program

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.380
to two or three years later
they have already changed

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.100
their minds because they see
the faculty more differently.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.040
They don't have that many women models.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.620
If they have a child they'll
definitely, or not definitely,

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.740
but far more likely not to go on.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.310
So you see that the impact of policies

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.310
is not just on faculty where
there had been some attention,

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.150
but also on the graduate
students and the postdocs.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.260
So I put a lot of attention
with those two groups as well

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.500
to try to keep the pipeline going.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.940
- At the heart of all of this seems to be

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.640
questions about woman's role in the family

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.120
and whether women, and
I gotta be careful here,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.410
I say this, but that women are different

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:04.410
and we should embrace that
in the sense that they...

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.810
Well no, I don't think I want
to say what I was just gonna.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.860
What I wanna say is that
the default position

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.080
is that women are the
custodians of the family

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.810
in a way that men had not
been, but the structures

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.667
if changed might change that relationship.

00:29:25.667 --> 00:29:28.220
- Right, and one of the major focuses

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.210
on changing the structure

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.930
was to get fathers to participate more.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.493
And I have to say, we've been
quite successful at that.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.780
In 1980, I think it was President Gardner

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.840
had actually put in
place for the UC system

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.230
some family-friendly policies
like stopping the clock

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.920
and a semester off of
teaching for childbirth

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.090
that had been in place.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.890
They were incredibly far-sighted

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.370
and progressive at the time.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.380
By the time we did our survey in 2002,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.972
most people didn't even know they existed.

00:29:58.972 --> 00:30:00.890
It had fallen totally out of favor

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.360
and the women sometimes used 'em,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.810
but fathers never used them
even though they had access

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.790
to stop the clock and some
childbirth leave as well.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.680
So the new policies we put in place

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.470
really focused on fathers.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.420
They now get at Berkeley a
semester off from teaching

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.700
if they are at least a halftime caretaker.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.770
And mothers get two semesters
off and stop the clock

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.330
and the really good part is
men are really taking it up

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.610
and we're really seeing
fathers participating

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.690
in child raising in a way
that we haven't before.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.680
And this is happening at
other universities as well.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.190
It's the only way, ultimately,
our first feminist.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:38.570
Well, the early feminist days
in the 1970s the belief was

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.930
as long as you'd got women out
in the workplace, et cetera,

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.310
the home would take care of itself

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.250
and equality would simply happen.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.700
But it didn't happen and
it wasn't just because,

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.700
I think men increasingly want more time

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.750
with their babies, even,
childcare for sure.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:58.300
But the workplace did
not make it possible.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.460
Now even if the workplace
makes it possible

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.560
they have to get over the cultural issues

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.560
of men are the breadwinners
and women are the nurturers.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.750
Those are still very strong and in place

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:15.750
although you probably know that
35% of all American families

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.930
are headed by single women breadwinners.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.870
And of those that are married,

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.270
women bring in 40% of the income.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.370
So the breadwinner issue
is not what it used to be

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:30.080
by any means, in fact I think
there isn't any clear division

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.350
between mothers and fathers
in terms of bringing things

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.810
into the household, but the
culture still supports that

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.300
to some extent, so that's a real barrier

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.510
and one of the things we've
really tried to work on

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.340
'cause unless you have the
father playing the game

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.694
the mothers won't either.

00:31:43.694 --> 00:31:48.190
- So in a way, what the data tells you

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:53.000
is that the way

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
the family is structured is not conducive

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.240
for achieving equality for women

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.730
and that one has to tinker
with the family structure,

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.040
change the culture of the family structure

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.040
so that men share more
equally in the burdens

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.410
of household work, taking
care of the children,

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.850
daycare and so on.
- Right.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.700
But it really all begins
with structural changes

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.620
in the institutions because
men don't have the opportunity

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.010
to stay at home unless they're given

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.280
some sort of parental leave
or incentives to do so

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.400
nor do women, so you have
to have the workplace change

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.340
for both men and women and
then the home will reflect that

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.450
or could reflect that if
the culture worked at it

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:45.340
strongly enough, and as I
said, I feel some good things

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.940
happening here at Berkeley particularly

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.760
'cause the percentage of men talking

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.500
this active service modified duty

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.300
to help with childbirth and
babies has really grown.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.883
And the percentage of,

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.300
the number of babies born
to assistant professor women

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.770
has doubled since 2003 and
has gone up 60% for men.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.950
So we're in a baby boom. (laughs)

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.740
It's embracing the idea of parenthood.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.410
Now this is not a fix and the fix

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.840
is not going to be simple or easy,

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.950
but I think there is a realization

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.770
that it's not gonna work unless
fathers participate as well.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.430
And the fathers actually like it.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.190
All the opinion polls
you see it, they all say

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.400
I wish I could do more, it
doesn't make it easy at work.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.390
I'm teased if I do it or I'm
not going to get promoted.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.110
There's discrimination against me

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.970
for being the mother,
playing the mommy role

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.723
and that's still not culturally accepted.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.050
- And previously before
you institute these changes

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:49.290
when you looked at the
data, men were not suffering

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.540
in the way that women were.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:56.540
Women were essentially
opting out of the system

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.420
in order to be the caretaker at home

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.780
and to take the time to have children

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.580
whereas the men continued to
go on their merry way in a way.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.160
- Yes, and in fact
married men with children

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.010
are the most successful, not
just in the university world,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.620
but across the board partly because

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.860
they don't have as much
responsibility at home,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.710
but also partly because I
think there's the attitude,

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.650
for instance in science
that if a man has a child

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.170
then he's really serious.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.340
This will really hold
him down 'cause he has,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.120
you know, responsibilities,
makes him more responsible.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.980
Woman has a child, well,
bye-bye, she's left science,

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.140
she has other priorities,
she's not going to be

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.540
a responsible scientist,
so it's a negative image

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.920
for the woman and a
positive image for the man.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.250
That's only part of it of course.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.453
The structural issues
are important as well.

00:34:44.453 --> 00:34:48.100
So it's a combination, but the
structure has to change first

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.750
in order to make it
possible for the culture

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.030
to promote fathers to
spend more time at home.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.700
- And how hard is that
politically to do actually?

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.580
- Well it becomes, the good part

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.820
about any kind of cultural change.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.255
Nothing happens, or just
institutional change,

00:35:04.255 --> 00:35:06.130
and then all of a sudden
it happens quickly

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.890
because it gets competitive.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.730
We named our project
the UC Competitive Edge

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.440
and the idea is that we were gonna have

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.630
family-friendly policies
so we would get the best

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:20.000
and the brightest and actually
it has worked to some extent

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.390
and all the other universities now

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.010
have to get on the
bandwagon, so the competition

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.670
has kinda changed, used
to be that if you went

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.310
to an interview you'd never mentioned

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.390
if you had children or
family, it was a no-no.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.740
Now often people will say.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.610
And we have this great
family-friendly policy.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.160
They'll bring it up themselves.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:41.160
It's really a real sea-change in terms

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.920
of how people look at those policies

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.180
and think of it as an
asset rather than something

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.810
they're going to avoid talking to.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.520
Most these research
universities now have someone

00:35:50.512 --> 00:35:53.810
whose main position is to
help families when they arrive

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.630
to find jobs and to find schools

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.080
and also to help women
through these issues

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.900
if they are a faculty.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.970
Less attention paid to
postdocs and graduate students,

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:08.970
which is something I'm still
writing about, caring about.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.330
- Another structure that you identified

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:18.330
as this data began pouring out
was the structure of tenure

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.610
basically.
- Yes.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:24.610
- And as I understand it,
the problem here is that

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:32.840
the child-bearing years
for women coincide,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.840
namely 30 to 40 coincide,
especially in the sciences

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:42.260
with what is perceived
to be the creative period

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.983
when careers take off and
research piles up basically

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.120
to then justify tenure.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.800
Talk a little about that.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.510
- Well I call those years
the make or break decade.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.470
And it's not just for scientists

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.380
or even just for university professors.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.900
In all the professions
that's usually the time,

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:07.300
if you're in business or if
you're in law or medicine.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.280
By the time you're 40 you
have to have basically

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.860
firmly pinned down your
career and your place in it

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.080
and everything does pretty
much happen during that decade.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.900
You finish your training,
you begin your job,

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.070
you do whatever, the
academic world is tougher

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.057
because it's intense, it's up or out.

00:37:23.057 --> 00:37:24.497
You really don't have any wiggle room.

00:37:24.497 --> 00:37:26.820
And you have those six
years, whatever it is,

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.730
five or six years to get to tenure

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.580
and they're gonna be probably
the most intense years

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.800
of your career because
much is expected of you

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.900
and plus teaching all new courses.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.970
I mean, it's a very tough time

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.780
for all new assistant professors.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.620
And even places that didn't really require

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.420
too many publications now require them.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.350
So it's a hotbed, and
because in the academic world

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.930
it takes longer and longer to get that PhD

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.980
for many different reasons, but you often

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.850
don't get a PhD until you're
33, 34, or your postdoc

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.010
'cause scientists finish
early but take a while,

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:02.250
so you're really brushing onto
40 by the time you get tenure

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.810
it's 40 plus, so women
are likely to kind of wait

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.300
if they're going to get tenure or think,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.340
I just can't do this, or have that child

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.540
at the most busy time and
can't make the real push

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.425
to get tenure and drop out then.

00:38:15.425 --> 00:38:17.680
So it's a really difficult problem.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.350
It's more intense in the sciences perhaps

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.870
because sciences are so competitive

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.310
and their belief is that
if you leave the lab

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.520
for 20 minutes practically
you've lost the game.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.300
There is this notion that it's a race

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.850
and if you go to the race at anytime

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.270
you won't be able to get back in.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.870
But you see it across the board.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.730
So the idea that somehow
your career is over

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:42.050
if you haven't made it by 40
really needs to be changed

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.060
in terms of how we look at the,

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.020
'cause you're going to have
another, probably 40 years

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.590
or 30 years of work in your career

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.170
and if you miss the boat
during that period of time

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.860
there haven't been many second chances.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.430
So second chances is another thing

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.790
that I've really promoted.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.040
I can't say that I had much luck here

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.890
at the university system,
when you're out you're out,

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:06.030
but in the science world,
'cause I also deal with NSF

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.070
and NASA, the idea of reentry postdocs

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.350
is getting some traction, so I'm hoping

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.150
that the reentry postdoc,
which would be good

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.130
for all kinds of fields actually,

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.027
and certainly good in the academic world.

00:39:19.027 --> 00:39:24.027
- So the idea is that you could
drop out, but then drop in.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.800
- Drop in again once you had,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.290
and I think for most people, at any rate,

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.550
it's the first three or four years

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.500
that are the most intense
in terms of child raising.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.210
It doesn't mean that
children don't need attention

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.570
all the time but they have
spread out into a larger group.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.790
They don't really want
just mommy all the time.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.880
Or they want to have a
structure outside the home

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.680
and they do, they're in preschool,
they're wherever they are

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.900
so you're less essential
in terms of the time factor

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.480
that goes into it, and
also just less in terms

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.820
of the physical factor, they're
no longer attached to you

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.470
literally in the same way,
breastfeeding or whatever.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.270
So it is quite reasonable for many women

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:06.810
after two or three years if
they take that long to come back

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:09.730
and men as well, I mean,
or for any family event.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.480
It's not just childbirth,
we have family events

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.250
throughout our lives, often unpredictable.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.560
It can be just an illness.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.840
It can be your spouse's illness.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.870
Could be your mother or father's illness

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.630
that take you out of the workplace.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.130
Much easier later in life
because if you have tenure

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.040
or security of employment of some kind

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.470
you can take that time and
they can't do anything.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:30.574
They can't fire you for it, basically.

00:40:30.574 --> 00:40:35.574
- So the argument opposed to
making life for women easier

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.500
who want to have children is what?

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.847
Is it that, well, this is the way we do it

00:40:45.847 --> 00:40:47.930
and this is the way we've always done it?

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:51.640
Or is it, well this is
the most creative time

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.340
in a scientist's life and if
we don't get that creativity

00:40:55.340 --> 00:41:00.180
out of them in this period
then it won't happen?

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.590
What's going on here?

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:02.670
- Well science is, as I say,

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.750
is more likely to think this way.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.200
I think law or English
literature or any other field

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.530
could understand the value of
coming back after three years

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.470
and not having lost your mind, literally.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:15.780
But in science there
seems to be this belief

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.590
that you can't think like a scientist.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.640
I think what's going on here
is just partly a reflection

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.890
of the competitiveness the
grant world has gotten into.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.930
But what the granting
agencies are doing now

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.870
is discounting the resume gap.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.430
In other words, looking
at your grant applications

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.670
and thinking, if you explain
that there was childbirth

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.470
involved here then it's a different view

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:40.450
that they'll take with it,
which is a very good thing.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.780
The reentry postdoc.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.160
I mean, there are many things
you can do to rethink a system

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.810
so it doesn't have the
same punishing effect

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:49.700
just in this one period of
time because these scientists

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.960
have trained for a long
time and a huge investment

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.910
has been made in them, it takes a least,

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.810
I think a half a million
dollars to put someone

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.680
through a PhD and then more
for a postdoc, et cetera.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.680
And this lost investment
as well as lost brains

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:11.160
and it's a foolish kind
of economic analysis.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.690
So this is kind of the message
that I'm trying to get across

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.190
and actually seems to
be working pretty well

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.810
that we have to look at this differently.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.970
It may be that people do, or some people

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.970
do their most productive work up to 30,

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.830
but that doesn't mean that all
scientists do that, either.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.280
I'm sure many scientists do wonderful work

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.593
in their forties as well and fifties.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:36.710
And again, a highly trained
mind should not be let go,

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.190
and that is what's happening too often.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.040
- One of the issues that keeps coming up

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.502
is the change in the status of women

00:42:44.502 --> 00:42:47.430
as related to the broader
changes in society.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:52.170
And so you pointed out earlier
that as there was greater

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:56.040
and greater inequality
that the woman's salary

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.040
was needed in the home to keep
the family fiscally sound.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:07.210
Now in addition another change
that's going quite clear

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.770
relates to what you call the second tier.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.060
So given the situation
that was in existence,

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.620
women, if they didn't drop
out, you say they dropped down

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:23.620
to second tier positions,
adjuncts, part-time lecturers

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.580
and so on, talk a little about that

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.680
because that was a benefit
to the system as a whole,

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.123
but not necessarily to women.
- Yes.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:38.420
The fastest growing sector of academia

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.880
is the second tier, the
part-time and adjunct.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.890
The percentage of tenure-track
faculty has gone down

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:48.890
from something like 58% to
37% over a period of 20 years.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.970
And that's largely because the model

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:54.720
is use more adjuncts, use more
part-time, and it's largely

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.040
been disproportionately
women with children.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.550
There's now a labor
force that is, I suppose,

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.040
kind of stuck and will take those jobs

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.500
even though they're incredibly underpaid,

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.370
under-benefited, marginalized, et cetera.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:13.090
So we're kind of raising
the second tier in academia

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:15.270
and making it a whole lot more worse.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.680
Well not worse, whole lot worse

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.140
by reducing the number
of tenure-track slots.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.820
It's a different model for academia.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.170
I won't even, I probably shouldn't talk

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.410
about what's happening
at UC, but nevermind.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.280
We're going to use it, but
in the state universities

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.770
there are far more faculty
teaching undergraduate courses

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:36.012
who are not tenure-track
than there are tenure-track.

00:44:36.012 --> 00:44:39.190
In the university it is has not had that

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.750
partly because we have
lot of graduate students

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.670
who help out who have had
a pretty good faculty ratio

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.620
that's reducing and reducing and reducing.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.250
And now the classes are
being taught more frequently

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.110
by adjuncts or lecturers, et cetera.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:52.510
In professional schools the adjuncts

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:56.840
have always had strong role
like in law or public health

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.600
because it is a professional school,

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.080
so the training on the
ground is quite useful.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.780
But now you're seeing it in
many other fields as well.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.313
I think that's very bad for academia.

00:45:08.313 --> 00:45:11.920
A lot of women will say
that it's good for mothers

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.990
'cause then you don't have all
that pressure to get tenure,

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:17.530
but it's bad for academia
'cause it just dilutes

00:45:18.834 --> 00:45:23.280
the equality of works so much
you don't have the possibility

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.913
of innovation and free
thinking that you have

00:45:24.913 --> 00:45:27.610
with the tenure system therefore
you're not going to have

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.769
the kind of innovative knowledge
and culture contributions

00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:34.570
that you have now with the tenure system.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:38.610
And eventually, probably
sooner rather than later,

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.920
the best and the brightest
will not want to get PhDs.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.950
They'll consider this, particularly

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:45.520
if there are very few jobs
even for men as well as women.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.030
There's just no place to go.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.180
I fear that that is happening,

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.470
so I really promote the tenure system

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.510
even though some people say
it works negatively for women

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:00.300
because I think if you had a
different kind of tenure system

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.690
and in fact one of our
reforms was to put into place

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.720
a part-time pre-tenure as
well as post-tenure track.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.330
So you actually can in the
UC system now go for 10 years

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.790
in a part-time position and still

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.860
come up for tenure after 10 years.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.350
- Two important tools that
you identify in your work

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.400
as graduate dean and now
in the work you're doing

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.410
to promote these ideas is on the one hand

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.050
the role of the law, the legal system.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.630
And you reference Title IX here,

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:35.500
which guarantees these rights.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.280
But then the other is getting
the word out, basically,

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.000
that people should know their rights

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:47.400
and seek to realize them.
- Yes I just actually today

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.540
I think finished a law review
article on just this topic

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.690
because almost no one knows.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.130
Whenever I lecture to
other universities I say,

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.720
how many of you knew that
pregnancy discrimination

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.394
is part of Title IX?

00:47:00.394 --> 00:47:01.780
Huh, it is?

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.760
So it's unknown, and Obama administration

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.380
has put a very big drive
on Title IX compliance

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.460
because not just pregnancy discrimination

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.020
but sexual harassment
and other aspects of it

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:17.650
have not been that well
followed or complied with.

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.210
And as part of this, he
doesn't mention this,

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:21.750
but NASA guidelines do.

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:23.780
Pregnancy discrimination is a strong part.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.540
And that's particularly important

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.930
for the kinds of things
that I'm concerned about

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.510
because you have these
graduate students and postdocs

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:35.510
who do not generally get
protection from FMLA or Title VII

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.610
because they're often considered trainees

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.190
rather then employees, so
they don't get any kind

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.830
of legal protection and this will give,

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.100
Title IX will give them
the same kind of protection

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.130
they would get under
Title VII or under FMLA.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:50.530
It also means that if they
have to drop out of a course

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.860
or a class that they
have the right to go back

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.860
and regain their status so
they don't just lose momentum

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.970
and fail to graduate or fail to finish

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:00.420
on the project that they're on, et cetera.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.900
It gives them a lot of
protecting in hiring

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.900
and at all kinds of ways that
they're just not aware of

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:11.430
so that in general students and certainly

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.360
you can understand this are very reluctant

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.427
to complain about anything
because these are the professors

00:48:18.427 --> 00:48:21.100
and their livelihood, but
if you have a strong system

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.640
in place where people know
that they have the right,

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.060
they don't have to complain
directly to the professor.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.656
They can go to the Title IX officer.

00:48:27.656 --> 00:48:31.400
It can be done anonymously,
it will be checked out

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.850
and then of course if they
don't get satisfaction

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:36.660
they have the right to sue as well.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.760
That will often guilt a
university into action

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.110
in terms of complying or
doing more in this line.

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.740
I do think this is a very fruitful way

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.540
because it would change the culture,

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.440
particularly for graduate
students and postdocs

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.800
and I think it would
help everyone to know it

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.050
who's employed on it within
educational institution

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.740
that receives any federal money

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.210
that they have a lot of rights
they're probably not aware of

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.360
more than just workplace rights.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.160
There are all these rights
about being accepted

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.510
into educational programs, not
being kicked out, et cetera.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:11.850
Really a rich database
which have been not known

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.330
and not complied with, but I think

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.830
that is going to be changing,
so I'm hopeful about this.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.780
Another new frontier. (laughs)

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:22.780
- What is the responsibility
of the individual woman student

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:26.600
or the young professional?

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.810
What is it that they can do for themselves

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:33.110
beyond the change in structure,

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:37.850
beyond the law, beyond the
dissemination of information?

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.260
- Well first of all, they
should know their rights.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.810
To fully use the kinds of tools they have

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.160
and to know the workplace
policies that exist

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.610
and to push for them, that.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.660
But aside from that I think
you're probably talking

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.807
about the lean in issue. (laughs)

00:49:49.807 --> 00:49:51.910
- Right.
- Well I do think,

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.430
it's not totally black and white.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:55.890
She clearly doesn't talk enough
about institutional change

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:58.350
or about about family, et
cetera, 'cause that is,

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:00.290
at least our research shows
clearly the major reason

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:02.980
why women drop out, but it is true

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.950
that women often don't negotiate well.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:08.130
They don't ask for enough,
they are perhaps more reluctant

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.010
in some cases, to some
extent it's density as well.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.470
When I was first dean, I was
the first woman graduate dean.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.050
I was the only woman dean on
campus for a couple of years.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:20.070
And it is a little intimidating
to be on the cabinet

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:24.640
and everyone is not a
woman and you have to act

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.480
in a different way.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:30.480
You learn how to talk lowly
and slowly and wait and pause.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.040
Not to speak too much, but to be sure

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.750
that you reference
someone else with the hope

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:38.510
that they might actually
reference you sometime,

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:39.880
which rarely happens to women,

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.140
and then to always have a lot of data.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.080
So I'd come in armed with
PowerPoints. (laughs)

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.770
And obviously that's not my background.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:51.290
I'm not a statistician but the
only way you make your points

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.980
is to sort of not so
much do it like the guys,

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:57.960
but to be serious and to show
that you're a serious person.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.670
That got easier as more women became deans

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:04.740
and their voices were
different kinds of voices

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:09.050
and it was just, with
density things do improve.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.180
And as you know, women
are not always so good

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.700
about helping other women,
particularly the older school.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.320
I guess I am the older
school, but nonetheless,

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.970
in my day the older school wasn't

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.320
because you know, they'd
made their sacrifices

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.510
and they got here by
whatever means, et cetera.

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.960
Or they chose not to have children

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.720
and why should they do your work for them?

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.048
So this is not necessarily a girls' club

00:51:31.048 --> 00:51:34.450
that help each other,
although I have to say

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.413
at this university when
I first came the AAW,

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.720
which is the faculty women
association was wonderful.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.590
They had everyone be a kind of mentor

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.820
from a different department
and they really did help

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.770
the young assistant
professors 'cause they'd had

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.150
a terrible time getting
tenure in previous years.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.870
A couple of lawsuits helped and
the mentoring helped as well

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:54.270
so they can be very helpful.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.980
As I say, the density helps,
also the issue of service,

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.800
and there's been some research on it.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.920
Not ours, but others that
even women who get tenure

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.000
often kind of slog out
as associate professors

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.640
and their pay shows the kind
of sloped pace they're on

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.300
'cause that cumulatively
means they get paid less

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.520
toward the end of their career.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.370
And one of the major reasons,
according to this research,

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.000
was that they're always
asked to do more service

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.810
then are men, and maybe
they're less likely to say no,

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:31.110
I don't know, but women
do more service overall

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:32.430
generally speaking than men do,

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:33.263
at least according to this research,

00:52:33.263 --> 00:52:35.410
which is not something
I've researched against.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:39.660
- Bottom line is that
we have to achieve this

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.210
complete and real access for women

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:46.980
because they can bring their
creativity, their intelligence

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.120
and maybe a different set of values

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.030
as we look at the array of
policy issues that we confront.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.150
- Yes, I mean, this is
a very disputed area

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.870
whether women really do have
different leadership qualities

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:02.440
et cetera, but I think it's fairly clear

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.540
that they're more cooperative
in terms of their style.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.160
And they're less likely
to blow up. (laughs)

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.360
At least the women I know, I don't know.

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.050
It's not necessarily
because they're women.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:16.420
It's because they're also
managing children and family

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.890
and a dozen other things
that they get to be.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.140
I would actually rather hire
a mother of three children

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.811
who are perhaps in school by this time

00:53:25.811 --> 00:53:27.930
than almost anyone else 'cause
they just get things done.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:31.640
They don't waste time,
there's no doubt about it.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.570
They've got a task and
they'll get it done.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.549
So I think those qualities are
very good in women as well,

00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:39.550
whether they have children
or not I think they're good.

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.580
So I haven't written on
this or examined this

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.110
but just observationally

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.120
women do make more cooperative
leaders and are less likely

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.463
to fly off the handle and
do rash things. (laughs)

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.333
You know, that doesn't mean
that they're better leaders

00:53:58.333 --> 00:54:00.483
than men, they just
have a different style.

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.770
- Looking back at your career,

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:08.770
I'm curious how you would
evaluate the interplay

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:14.347
between political
movements, the legal system

00:54:14.347 --> 00:54:18.830
and the changes that
occur, but then essentially

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:22.710
the power that comes with
administrative positions

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:25.243
to actually try to make change.

00:54:25.243 --> 00:54:28.720
We touch on all three
of these in your career

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.150
and it seems like it takes all of them

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.380
and not one or the other is enough.

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:40.240
- Well, there are individuals
who do wonderful things

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.263
whether they've had a background
in this nature or whatever.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.770
The issue with
administration is interesting

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:48.750
because I'm doing this work now,

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:51.070
which is largely policy
work, our research is.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:55.180
And it has a conclusion in policy

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.950
otherwise I wouldn't
find it that interesting

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:59.880
just to be another publication
is not that interesting to me

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.930
but it's not the kind of
work for which you get tenure

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:02.950
or climb the ladder

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:05.700
and I didn't do policy
work for many years.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.050
I wrote A History of
Child Custody in America.

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:10.330
I wrote a lot of law reviews.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.780
I did things that were interesting to me,

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.350
but were not gonna change the world

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.210
because I wasn't in a position to

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:17.680
and it's not what you do as a professor.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.290
You want to do things that are scholarly

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.500
and you're rated only on your
contribution to scholarship,

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.860
not on changing the world, so
when you're an administrator

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.493
you have more power to change the world

00:55:27.493 --> 00:55:30.210
and if you take off your,
I must get tenure hat

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:31.760
then you really can use research, I think,

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.300
in a positive way, but
not that many faculty can.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.700
And the faculty on this
campus have such brilliance

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.200
among them it's always wonderful

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.430
when someone makes use of
their work to change the world

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.913
'cause rarely are they
in a position to do it.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:50.730
'Cause you know, outside of politics

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:52.890
where you are in a position
and you're encouraged,

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:54.830
that's why you're
elected, to change things.

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:56.270
I don't think university administrators

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:59.870
are elected or appointed
to change things. (laughs)

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.160
so it's something you take on if you,

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.650
maybe the president is or the chancellor

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.863
but others are meant to kind
of run the ship of state.

00:56:07.863 --> 00:56:10.390
But some make wonderful changes, too.

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:13.310
- But by bringing
information to the agenda

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:15.180
you can make some change.
- Yes, exactly.

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:18.490
Unique information, 'cause if
I had that unique information

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.430
and was not a high-level administrator

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:25.870
it would be much harder to get
any policy results from it.

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.440
So those positions are
very important for that.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.840
- If students were to watch this video

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.350
and your reflections on your own career,

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:38.670
what advice would you give
them in terms of preparing

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:40.050
for the future?

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.520
- Well, just don't give up your dreams.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.950
It may not happen exactly how you think.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:47.700
I think we should actually
have a high school class

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:51.150
called life 101 in which
they do a life script.

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:53.480
I mean, they can review it
every five years or whatever,

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:56.130
but to have a sort of a long-range idea

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:58.180
of how you would like your life to unfold

00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.430
and check in on it and not give up on it

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:02.100
because you're gonna be waylaid.

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.430
So take second changes when they come.

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:06.680
I've had several second chances in my life

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.590
which have allowed me to be here,

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.240
have allowed me to do a
number of different things,

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.373
and you have to just grab them
when they come along your way

00:57:12.373 --> 00:57:15.430
because I think almost
everyone gets a variety

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:17.870
of opportunities, at least
in this country they do

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:20.620
and they pick and choose
some or the others.

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.340
The other advice I give to women,

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:27.340
at least in this book I did,
don't marry a jerk. (laugh)

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:29.950
You know, all the women that
we interviewed for this book

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:32.260
who were very successful
like Dianne Feinstein

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.960
or corporate heads or women
who had really had it all,

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.940
more or less, they almost
all attributed their success

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.800
to their partner, not because he had done

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.540
half the diaper changing or whatever,

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.800
but the partner was totally supportive

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.020
economically and otherwise
and always took their career

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.500
as seriously as his own.

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:54.090
And that's really the
criteria for an equal marriage

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:57.130
and it allows women as well
as men to flourish in it.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:59.410
If it meant that he'd
have to make the move,

00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.920
and among academics that's often the case.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.880
You have a dual career
family and unfortunately

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.713
it's a two-body problem
and it's more often

00:58:06.713 --> 00:58:09.990
that the man's body gets
the choice than the women's,

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:12.380
those kinds of decisions
which are very hard

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.010
and academia's particularly tough on them

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:15.960
because you're only
limited to a number of jobs

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.370
in certain geographical.

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:20.740
But actually make sure
that the partner you have

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.820
is not holding you down,
they're pushing you forward.

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.050
- Well, on that note Mary
Ann I want to thank you,

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:29.680
but let me show your book
one more time to our audience

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:34.200
'cause it's a very succinct manual

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.810
for the problems that
we've been talking about.

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.816
So thank you again for--
- Thank you Harry.

00:58:38.816 --> 00:58:40.210
I enjoyed it very much.
- For being on our program.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.280
And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.577
for this conversation with history.

00:58:44.577 --> 00:58:48.077
(upbeat electronic music)
