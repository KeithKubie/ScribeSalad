00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.670
 Scan-duh-nay-vee-ah! (Scandinavia!) 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.530
 Take a look at this northern polar wonderland - fjord, sauna, fjord, caustic fish, 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:12.269
 Blondes, Vikings, blonde Vikings (?), more fjords, IKEA family, sleeping in the government-issued boxes of babies, Santa Claus, death metal music, and fjords. 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.340
 But where is the border of Scandinavia? Because not all of the above things are in place. 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.179
 Scandinavia accurately includes only three countries: Sweden, Norway and Denmark. 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.599
 More precisely, these three "kingdoms" are located in Scandinavia. 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.149
 It’s just that Denmark is not on the peninsula, but Finland is a member of the peninsula. Wait, this is totally helpless, forget it. 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.120
 The three countries on this peninsula can be called Fennoscandia, but 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.250
 If you use this vocabulary, everyone will cast a strange look at you, because only the ultimate 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.160
 This word is used by geography nerds. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.030
 *Fennoscandia* 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.899
 So the word Scandinavia includes geography, history, 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.210
 There are also three aspects of linguistics, so there are often people who dispute the places that Scandinavia refers to. 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.280
 Finland is usually not counted in Scandinavia because she is considered to be the same as the Baltic countries. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.829
 Russia has a historical connection. And although Denmark is on the other side of the peninsula, she is counted because this is because 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.780
 Her complicated relationship with Sweden. Between them 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.280
 15 to 21 wars (see how you count). This relationship has become more complicated because 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.340
 The main reason for the conflict between Denmark and Sweden is to compete for Norway. Who won't? She is both beautiful and affluent. 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.570
 All in all, when outsiders refer to "Scandinavia," they probably refer to "the five Nordic countries." 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.040
 These three countries, plus Finland, plus Iceland. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.829
 However, you really can't blame people for confusing this because even the organizations of the US Scandinavian Foundation 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.290
 All of the five Nordic countries are listed as members. When the five Nordic countries promote themselves, they will also 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.390
 Call yourself "Scandinavia." This is the "Dutch" treatment 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.850
 International Relations: If you have an anonymity that everyone likes, go directly to it. 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.780
 The relationship between the five Nordic countries is good, they even set up an official organization - 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.860
 "Nordic Council", a Viking Club, while others in the Nordic region 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.060
 Always dreaming of joining. Although the Baltic countries can participate in the conference, they do not 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.090
 Any voting rights. 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.039
 The Nordic Council is mainly composed of various committees whose role is to 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.820
 Coordinate the cooperation of countries on different issues, such as the Arctic environment, social welfare and regional business. 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.720
 They still have time to set up a set of rules that are scary. 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.660
 The method used to regulate the use of the board logo, including "to have an appropriate distance to show 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.520
 Inviolable sovereignty respects." However, the biggest function of the Nordic Council is 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.260
 Nationals of the five member states are free to live and work in the remaining four countries. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.040
 (If you have seen the film about the EU, this council is an already messy EU structure, 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.390
 Plus a semi-overlapping complex area) 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.080
 However, this immigration policy does not apply to Icelandic horses. 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.640
 First, the Icelandic horse is super cute. 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.010
 Second, once the Icelandic horse leaves, it can never return to Iceland. But this is another 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.070
 The story is over. 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.260
 In a political alliance, there are always some special strange places, 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.379
 For example: 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.200
 - Aland Islands: An autonomous region of Finland with a Swedish language. 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.870
 - There are also the Faroe Islands and Greenland, both of which belong to the Kingdom of Denmark. 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.420
 Greenland is a strange member of the Nordic region, she is in another hemisphere, 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.610
 And the Greenlanders have no connection with the Nordic people in history and language. 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.250
 Also, the banner of Greenland has disrupted the Nordic flag design. But because of the Vikings, Greenland became part of Denmark. 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.260
 Finally, there is a non-formal area in Swab-Norway, the reason for mentioning her is 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.850
 Because there is a seed bank that deals with the end of the world, there are various kinds of crop seeds, 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.860
 Used to rebuild agriculture when needed. And there are armored bears guarding there. 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.470
 It’s clear now - the next time you want to say "Scandinavia", but not completely sure what it includes, 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.650
 It would be nice to say "the Nordic Five". 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.200

 (IvanKT translation)
