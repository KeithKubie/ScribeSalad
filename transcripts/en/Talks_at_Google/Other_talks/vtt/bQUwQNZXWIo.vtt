GEORGE LOPEZ: Much obliged.

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:11.529
KEVIN VLK: All righty.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.987
Hello, everyone, welcome to
Talks at Google, I'm Kevin Vlk,

00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:15.940
and today we're
welcoming George Lopez.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.239
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.016
GEORGE LOPEZ: Thank
you, everybody.

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:21.810
Muchisimas gracias.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.738
Thank you.

00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:23.519
Gracias.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.185
KEVIN VLK: I don't
know what that means.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.620
GEORGE LOPEZ: Like, oh my
god, I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.350
KEVIN VLK: And I want to thank
our HOLA, Hispanic Googler

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.944
Network for also helping
us put this on today, so--

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:40.443
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:41.234
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:44.749
KEVIN VLK: Especially
[? Juani, ?] thank you.

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.290
And George, you can
currently see him

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.260
on his tour, which is the Black
and Brown Comedy Get Down Tour.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.250
And you're touring with
some amazing people,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.380
Cedric 'The Entertainer,'
Mike Epps, D.L. Hughley,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.980
Eddie Griffin,
anyone else in this?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.790
GEORGE LOPEZ: Charlie Murphy.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.325
KEVIN VLK: Charlie Murphy.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:00:59.450
GEORGE LOPEZ: D.L. Hughley.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.350
Charlie Murphy.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.780
Yeah, let's see.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.860
Yeah, Mike Epps,
Cedric, D.L. Hughley,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.270
Eddie Griffin,
Charlie, and myself.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.760
And then it's called the Black
and Brown Comedy Get Down.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.730
And then they said, well, you're
the only brown in the get down.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.750
And I said, yeah, but
when you hire one brown,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.400
they do the work of five people.

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:33.450
I'm the only brown they need.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.210
And I organized it all myself.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.710
They said, hey, I think George
Lopez put the stage together,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.900
too.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.733
Mike Epps, oh he can
put the stage together.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.780
KEVIN VLK: That's amazing.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.770
So you grew up in Mission
Hills, just outside of LA.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.080
Right?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.780
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yes.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.080
KEVIN VLK: Raised
by your grandmother.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.000
And I read that you
wanted to comedy since you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.880
were about 11 years old.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.870
So what sparked that for you?

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.100
Did you grow up in
a comedic household?

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.308
Or where you just a goofball?

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:04.320
GEORGE LOPEZ: You know what,
there was humor in the, house

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.610
but from a negative point.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.450
You know, I think sometimes the
negative is-- like, you know,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.540
in the tour right now,
if you see a kid now,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.150
you have to congratulate him
on everything that they do.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.100
Like waking up.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.230
Hey, hi, Ryan.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.700
You woke up.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.400
Hi.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.014
I was at Coffee
Bean-- this is true,

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:31.430
this is where the
thing came from.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.330
So I was at Coffee Bean,
and the father says,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.480
can you go get me
some Sugar In The Raw?

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.660
And the kid walks across
Coffee Bean, and the dad's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660
complimenting,
you're walking great.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.130
You're walking great.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.210
You're walking great.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.020
I'm like, what the?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.310
So then, with me and my,
you know, negative positive.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.160
The joke I say is, our
parents only congratulated us

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.210
when we did something bad.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.330
Like if you crashed the
car, your whole family

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.330
was out front going, beautiful.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.410
Congratulations.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.090
Look what you did.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.050
I don't know how you did
it, but you scratched

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.740
both sides of the car.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.984
And I'm so proud.

00:03:18.984 --> 00:03:20.150
I'm prouder that I cosigned.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.710
But you know, it's
an easy-- you know,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.014
like the formula for the comedy
came from the tough place

00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:30.680
where I grew up.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.100
But also because
everything was-- sometimes

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.710
when things are kind of
like, not going well,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.425
it's the funniest.

00:03:38.425 --> 00:03:41.572
You know, my grandmother,
who I miss, like every day.

00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:43.530
And I never thought I
would miss her that much.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.921
She told me, when I'm
gone, you're gonna miss me.

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:47.670
But you know what?

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.370
She was right.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.089
So the one time, you
know, she had cancer,

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.880
so I was taking her to
radiation, you know.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.240
And we get to the place,
and I said, OK Grandma, you

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.990
gotta go in there.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.270
She goes, I don't
wanna go in there.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.978
I said, Grandma, you
have to go in there.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.520
The doctor's waiting for you.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.700
And she goes, I'm
not going to go in.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.620
I said, Grandma, you
have to go get radiation.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.625
And she said, maybe I
don't want to be radiated.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:17.740
So I thought all that was funny.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.779
Me and her used to
have a great time.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.140
So you know, not until, I
think, when my show started,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.120
that "Time" magazine, they
wrote an article about me.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.125
And then the guy in
the article said,

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.500
I think George
Lopez should thank

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.210
his grandmother for
his success, because it

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.540
seems to all come from her.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.920
And it's true.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.717
It's true, everything
came from her.

00:04:39.717 --> 00:04:40.800
KEVIN VLK: That's amazing.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.650
So I kind of want to talk about
getting your rise into comedy.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.400
Because stand-up comedy
was huge in, like,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.360
the '70s and the '80s, with
like, Pryor, Cosby, Seinfeld.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.257
And then, kind of in
the late '80s and '90s

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:51.590
it started to kind of just sink.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.730
And in the '90s, mid
'90s, it really hit low.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.250
But that's kind of when
you were going through it.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.160
So what kind of kept
you through, and kind of

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.870
finding your voice, and saying
that I could actually do this?

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.860
GEORGE LOPEZ: First of all,
I was afraid of everything,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.190
growing up.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.780
Afraid.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.770
So I would quit if
it got scary to me.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.220
Or if it got tough,
I would stop.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.180
And when I was playing
baseball-- I loved baseball,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.240
I still do-- but
when I was playing,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.115
I got kicked off the team
for not being as disciplined

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:29.860
as somebody else.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.230
And then the coach said to
me, you know your problem?

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.220
When it gets tough, you quit.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.060
And it wasn't until, like
three years out of high school,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.755
that I realized
that he was right.

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:42.610
Like, he had nailed it.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.300
So I went back to
the school one day,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.320
and I waited 'till
after baseball practice,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.920
and I walked up to him, and
I apologized for the way

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.220
that I had treated him.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.600
And that he had taught me an
incredible lesson, of when

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.220
things get tough,
things get better.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.960
And that everything
that I wanted to quit,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.190
I didn't after that.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.480
And everything changed.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.377
And then I met Arsenio
Hall in February of 1989,

00:06:12.377 --> 00:06:13.460
his show had just started.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.418
And that was a night that
I wasn't going to go.

00:06:15.418 --> 00:06:18.770
It was a Wednesday, and I
said, nah, I'm not going to go.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.199
And then I end up
convincing myself to go,

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:21.990
and then I met him.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.762
And it really did change
the direction of my life.

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.470
Because not only did
I get an opportunity

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.570
to be on TV, on an
incredible show,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.390
but I also made a friend
that, we're still very close.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.130
We just went to a basketball
game, and we talk all the time.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.979
And I met somebody that
kind of understands

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.020
what I was going through.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.870
And it's a valuable friendship.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.070
KEVIN VLK: So your
first time onstage,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.520
was it good, or did you bomb?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.300
GEORGE LOPEZ: Man.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.184
So the first time I go
onstage, I'm scared to death.

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:00.600
And I had my friend
Ernie with me.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.266
You know I did the
show, that guy Ernie,

00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:03.500
there was a real Ernie.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.900
And we went to-- it
was in Westwood--

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.600
and we bought-- I was 18,
I was still in high school.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:19.420
And we paid a wino to go
into the liquor store,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.080
and buy us a bottle of wine.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.610
And then he gave us a little
bottle, and we're like,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.000
don't they have bigger bottles?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.950
He bought himself
a bigger bottle,

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.060
and gave us the little one.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.060
We didn't give him
money to buy his wine,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.670
but he used our money to buy it.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.554
So I took a little
bit of a drink

00:07:40.554 --> 00:07:41.720
to kind of sooth the nerves.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.550
Didn't work.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.260
But it is frightening.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.480
You know, anything new, any job,
any place you move, any school,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.990
education, people that you
meet, it's all-- initially,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.477
your initial reaction is fear.

00:07:54.477 --> 00:07:56.060
You know, you're a
little bit nervous,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.185
you're a little bit afraid.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:00.460
But then when you get past
that, and convince yourself

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.762
that you're in the
right place, you really

00:08:02.762 --> 00:08:03.720
are in the right place.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.440
KEVIN VLK: So what got
you back up on the stage?

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.356
If the first time was
scary and nerve-racking,

00:08:07.356 --> 00:08:09.876
and stuff, or was it
just, hey, I can't quit?

00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:14.770
GEORGE LOPEZ: You
know, I always felt

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.370
like I was little bit
different than everybody

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.680
that I had grown up around.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.530
And even people in my family.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.150
That I just felt a
little different.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.490
It wasn't through
intelligence, no.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.979
But I just felt a little
different in the way

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:30.020
that I thought, you know.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.839
And I started to write notes
when I was 11 years old.

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:36.440
I still have some notebooks
from when I was 11.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.589
And, yeah, I always thought
that I could be different.

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:42.505
Like I felt different.

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:45.210
Even when things
weren't going good,

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.130
I always felt that
I was different.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.210
KEVIN VLK: So did
you have a mentor?

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.747
Kind of going through the
comedy circuit, someone who kind

00:08:52.747 --> 00:08:53.955
of took you under their wing?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.680
GEORGE LOPEZ: Well, you
know, I don't think I did.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.270
You know, of the things that
I think I'm proudest of,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.410
is that Freddie Prinze, Sr.,
from "Chico and the Man,"

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.920
was really the first person
that I saw that I said,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.720
you know, I think
I could do this.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.400
I think he had an album.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.825
And he was Puerto
Rican and Hungarian,

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:23.475
and he was playing Mexican.

00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:26.560
And then I said, you know, I
think this is a possibility.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.220
So I started to focus
on him, and then

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.970
he committed suicide in 1977,
and I was in 10th grade.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.710
It affected me a lot, because
I had been in love with him.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.740
And then the first real loss
that I ever felt in my life,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.400
that somebody that
I'd admired was gone.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.040
And then Richard
Pryor, you know,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.640
was somebody that I watched.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.710
And my grandmother
was-- my grandmother

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.260
was not a fan of the
African American culture.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:01.570
So I say the only black person
that my grandmother allowed

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.770
into the house was Richard
Pryor, on a VHS tape.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.310
That was it.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.280
All my friends would
have to stay outside,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.020
even though when she left to
work, I brought them inside.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.750
But she was very
backwards in her thinking.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.116
But then also, I think
I told this story.

00:10:20.116 --> 00:10:20.990
This is a true story.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.365
Like, when my
grandmother started

00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:27.440
to get dementia and a
little bit of Alzheimer's, I

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.822
didn't put her in a home.

00:10:30.822 --> 00:10:32.490
I kept her in the house.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.880
But then I needed
to hire nurses.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:43.900
And I said, you know, I think
I'm gonna hire black nurses,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.900
so that my grandmother
would learn a lesson in race

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.766
before she goes.

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:53.950
Right?

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:54.450
True story.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.350
So I called the place, and
I said, I need some nurses.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.810
And they said, what kind
of nurses do you need?

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.830
And I said black.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:10.920
And then lady goes,
sir, we do not

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.850
give out our nurses by
the color of their skin,

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.640
but their qualifications.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.020
What kind of
qualifications do you need?

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.740
I said, no, they
have to be black.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.610
And she was like, who is this?

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.557
And I said, it's George Lopez.

00:11:25.557 --> 00:11:26.890
And you know what the lady said?

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.860
How black?

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.340
There's the money.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.200
I swear it, too.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.440
How black?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.910
And I said, now we're talking.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:42.797
And then I had
some-- and you know,

00:11:42.797 --> 00:11:44.380
the greatest thing
is, my grandmother,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.730
they would sit next to
each other, and watch TV,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.710
and say, this is my best friend.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.210
And then I would
be like, she never

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.920
told me I was her best friend.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.580
But you know, it worked out.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.410
It worked out, yeah.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:07.205
And then, it was years,
and she wouldn't go.

00:12:07.205 --> 00:12:08.020
You know?

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.400
So I told her one
time, you know,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.210
she had a hart thing
at the hospital.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.910
I said, Grandma,
you know, can go.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:26.445
She went like this.

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:32.985
She said, I'm not
going anywhere.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.860
KEVIN VLK: So every
comedian kind of has, you

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.290
know, two stories from
kind of like, their tours.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.430
It's kind of like their
biggest bomb, and also

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.850
just their weirdest, funnies
story from being on tour.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:41.760
So do you have
one of those, kind

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.968
of when you were kind of
rising up through the ranks?

00:12:46.755 --> 00:12:48.950
The most memorable moment?

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.290
GEORGE LOPEZ: I got a
gun pulled on me one time

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.715
in an alley in Indianapolis.

00:12:52.715 --> 00:12:54.090
KEVIN VLK: That
took a dark turn.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.699
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:57.490
KEVIN VLK: Terrible
questions, interviewer.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.350
Stop it.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.590
GEORGE LOPEZ: I had a
guy pull a gun on me.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.990
He didn't like
what I was saying,

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:09.555
and he says, get on your knees.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:17.190
And I said, literally, I said,
I'm not getting on my knees.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.315
He goes, get on your knees.

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:22.750
I said, I'm not gonna
get on my knees.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.640
And then he said,
I remember he said,

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.040
I'm not going to
shoot you, because I

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.650
believe in apple pie and
America, or something

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.150
like that.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.442
Was that in the Chevy slogan?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.020
So he says, get out of here.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.570
Like, he says, get out of here.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.500
And he says, run.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.740
And I'm like, I'm not gonna run.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.100
So I didn't get on my
knees, because I'm not

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.220
going to do that, ever.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.960
And then I didn't run,
because, you know, I'm Chicano,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.290
I don't run.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.900
And then, the minute I
turned the corner I took off.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.960
I ran out of my jacket.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.710
I was running, and
my jacket came off.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.740
I looked back, I
just kept running.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.280
I ran out of my jacket,
I was running so crazy,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.240
my arms were flying,
my jacket came off.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.800
And then I didn't
go back to get it.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.730
I never ran out of my jacket.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.020
But he didn't see me run.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.658
He came around looking
for me, but I was gone.

00:14:21.658 --> 00:14:24.267
KEVIN VLK: You know,
hearing your stand-up,

00:14:24.267 --> 00:14:25.600
it seems to be all new material.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.490
I know a lot of
comedians-- like Seinfeld,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.781
he mixes kind of like his
greatest hits with new stuff.

00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:31.830
And Louis C.K. kind of
starts fresh every time

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.585
he kinds of goes on tour.

00:14:32.585 --> 00:14:34.390
So what's your process for
coming up with material?

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.790
GEORGE LOPEZ: You know, I kind
of weave stuff in and out.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.910
You know, there's things that
are like synonymous with--

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.055
and I don't even know if they're
really jokes, per se, you know.

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:47.180
KEVIN VLK: They're stories.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.480
GEORGE LOPEZ: They're,
yeah, kind of recollections.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.915
You know, like, there's
the Jack in the Box one.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:15:01.290
The Jack in the Box one
started because in Sacramento,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.710
after we did the punchline,
I went to Jack in the Box,

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.610
and I rolled up
and the guy's like,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.446
welcome to Jack in the
Bok, can I hep you?

00:15:07.446 --> 00:15:08.837
And I was like, what?

00:15:08.837 --> 00:15:11.420
And the guy's like, welcome to
Jack in the Bok, can I hel you?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.770
I said, is this Jack in the Box?

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.130
He's like, say, Jack in
the Bok, can I hel you?

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.921
And I said, yeah, can I have--
just the way I laid it out

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:23.420
in the joke.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.420
Can I have a jumbo jack?

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.560
You want a yumbo yak?

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.900
And he goes, frem fry?

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.790
Frem fry?

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.720
I said.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.920
And then he's like,
papas fritas, stupid!

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:45.190
But he did say, he
said pexi, and esprite.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.240
He said esprite.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.570
Esprite.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:53.650
So then the next night
I did it, and boom.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.970
One time I was
outside of a club,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.652
and these Latinos
were there, you know,

00:15:57.652 --> 00:15:59.360
they were trying to
be, like, successful,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.660
you know, they're sitting there.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.550
And you know, and I'm
sitting right there.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.894
So they're going,
remember that time?

00:16:05.894 --> 00:16:07.560
And they're going,
remember that time we

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.610
went over to that place?

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.440
And they said, which place?

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:09.940
You member.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.900
Member the place?

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.730
They go, member?

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:13.270
You member.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.900
And they said, I don't member.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.090
Yeah, you don't member?

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.390
And then it was all negative.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.650
Member your mom
fe-- oh, yeah, that.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.230
Yeah, it was all
around a negative.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.770
Member your mom fell that time?

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.650
Oh, yeah, I member.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.440
And that I did
that one, and then

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.130
that one became huge, as well.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.566
So all of the-- I've got a pain
in my chest, I can't breathe.

00:16:35.566 --> 00:16:37.260
That was one.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
I know ha, was one.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:39.990
I know ha.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.142
And they say they
it all the time.

00:16:42.142 --> 00:16:43.100
I hear it all the time.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.940
So you know, I kind
of had-- you know,

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:52.035
I thought our culture was
funny enough to kind of--

00:16:52.035 --> 00:16:55.080
and it's funny, because
it's not-- you know,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.860
people say, aw, it's
making fun of it.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:03.940
But you know, Bill Cosby,
or Seinfeld, or those guys,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.815
they all had a thing.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.564
And it's funny, Bill
Cosby, what you know?

00:17:06.564 --> 00:17:07.310
Hey, the thing--

00:17:12.769 --> 00:17:13.810
KEVIN VLK: Next question.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.148
So--

00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:17.579
GEORGE LOPEZ: I
say it almost like

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.828
in "The Silence of the Lambs."

00:17:18.828 --> 00:17:22.230
It puts the lotion
in the basket.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:26.250
KEVIN VLK: So Sandra Bullock,
and her production company,

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.861
they gave you your
big break on TV.

00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:28.610
One of her scouts.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.193
GEORGE LOPEZ: Sandra
Bullock did, yes.

00:17:30.193 --> 00:17:31.672
KEVIN VLK: And I
did not know that.

00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:32.910
That's really, really cool.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.490
So she kind of noticed
that there wasn't really

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.144
a true, just Hispanic,
television show.

00:17:39.144 --> 00:17:40.560
GEORGE LOPEZ: She
lives in Austin,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.290
and she fell in love
with the culture.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:48.590
And she started to say,
how come there's not-- I

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.970
think she had done
"Miss Congeniality,"

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.240
and then I think her
mom was not well,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.141
she had kind of become kind of
distant from acting, you know,

00:17:57.141 --> 00:17:58.890
because she was taking
care of her family.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:06.510
So then she actually had a show
idea that was about teenagers,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.620
like Latino teenagers.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.390
And they wanted me to be the
father of these teenagers.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.100
But the father, he wasn't
in the lead of the show,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.530
the kids were.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.150
So then I got her to come
and see me do stand up.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.890
And after, she came back in,
and she goes, forget my idea.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.550
I want to do what's in your
act, because that's the better

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.500
story.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.300
And then I did the grandmother.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.740
My Grandma's name was Bennie.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.930
They lady on the show
was named Bennie.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.940
My best friend was named Ernie.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.335
The guy was named Ernie.

00:18:39.335 --> 00:18:42.010
I was married, my wife was
named Ann, it was Angie.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.190
Max was my grandmother's
dog's name.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.580
I named him Max.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.630
And Carmen was Cheech's
daughter's name.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.720
I thought that that would
be a good one, Carmen.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.920
And then the Powers
Aviation, I worked

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.310
at a place called Powers.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.650
I shipped books, like back end.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.785
You know, how to play
blackjack, how to read minds,

00:19:06.785 --> 00:19:09.840
you know, those how to books,
like how to grow a garden.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840
I shipped books.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.280
Like, I shipped.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.964
Like I got the thing,
I put the box in there.

00:19:14.964 --> 00:19:19.920
And the guy's name
was Melvin Powers.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.160
And I remember one day, he
came and he had some guys,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.910
he was taking a tour,
and he goes, hey, George,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.690
how's everything?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.460
And I said, great, Melvin.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.864
And then he looked at me like,
did you just call me Melvin?

00:19:30.864 --> 00:19:32.530
And I got fired that
day for calling him

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.760
Melvin, instead of Mr.
Powers, in front of guests.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.960
So when I did my
TV show, I named

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.590
one of the guys Melvin Powers.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.920
One of the brothers
that owned the place.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:51.350
So I used all kind of real
life names and situations.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.340
KEVIN VLK: And it
ran for six seasons,

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.150
and was successful on ABC,
but then it got canceled,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.647
and then it found
a whole new life,

00:19:58.647 --> 00:20:00.480
and was even more
successful in syndication.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.396
So do you just think it
was ahead of its time,

00:20:02.396 --> 00:20:06.064
or what attributes it to the
success that it had afterwards?

00:20:06.064 --> 00:20:08.230
GEORGE LOPEZ: Well, you
know I think that, you know,

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.640
ABC moved it around
a little bit,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.720
and then it struggled to
find, like, a main spot.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.137
But people liked
it when I was on,

00:20:15.137 --> 00:20:16.428
although it wasn't a big thing.

00:20:16.428 --> 00:20:17.860
But I thought the
fact that people

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.180
could see it at the same time,
and see back to back episodes,

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.440
because we had 120 of
them, that it became--

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:31.440
and it hasn't been off
the air since 2002.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.830
Professionally, I think it's
the thing I'm proudest of.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.950
Because I took some
painful things in my life,

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.490
and I put them in that show.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:46.480
And when I was younger
man, I'd gotten arrested,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.400
and I was in jail in Van Nuys.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.630
And I'm sitting
kind of like this.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.190
And then somebody
sits next to me,

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.050
and they're wearing
toenail polish.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.120
And I look down,
and I look up, it's

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.970
a guy in an orange jumpsuit,
with toenail polish,

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.730
and blond hair.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.650
Big guy, sitting next to me.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.180
So the guard comes to the
door, and he goes, Lopez?

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.480
And I stand up, and
the dude stands up.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.090
And the guard goes,
no, Mrs. Lopez.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.900
This is great.

00:21:21.642 --> 00:21:24.180
And you know what, I
put that in the show.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.560
That whole scene, where I was
in jail, and the guy came,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.710
and thing, I put the whole
thing in there, word for word.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.820
Word for word.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.010
No, Mrs. Lopez.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:32.510
Great.

00:21:35.606 --> 00:21:37.230
KEVIN VLK: What I
was really shocked by

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.420
was that you were one
of only, actually,

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.340
four Hispanics to ever
really lead a sitcom.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.715
It was Desi in "I Love Lucy,"
Freddie, who you mentioned,

00:21:42.715 --> 00:21:44.900
in "Chico and the Man,"
Paul Rodriguez in "Pablo."

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.474
But these were TV shows
really aired decades apart.

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:50.140
"Lucy" in the '50s,
"Chico" in the '70s,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.780
"Pablo" in the '80s, and
then almost 20 years gap

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.190
until your show in 2002.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.350
So why the long
gaps, do you think?

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.130
GEORGE LOPEZ: Well, no
disrespect to Paul Rodriguez,

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.740
but a.k.a.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.980
Pablo only was on three
weeks, and I was on 120.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:14.900
So Desi Arnaz was
Cuban, and it was

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.320
called "I Love Lucy." "Chico
and the Man" was Freddie Prinze,

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.320
and Chico was his name.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.502
George Lopez.

00:22:25.502 --> 00:22:27.600
KEVIN VLK: So you're the first.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.200
GEORGE LOPEZ: The
only Mexican, so far.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.076
So that's impressive.

00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:32.504
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:35.314 --> 00:22:36.730
KEVIN VLK: Were
there any TV shows

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.110
that you watched
when you grew up

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.400
that influenced you
to create your show,

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.608
or was it all just kind of
pulled from your stand-up?

00:22:42.608 --> 00:22:45.460
GEORGE LOPEZ: No, I think, like,
you know, "Taxi," or "Barney

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:51.330
Miller," or, you know,
"Rosanne," and stuff like that

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.510
was really influential.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.580
Seinfeld, and, you know.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.480
It's interesting, you
never know what you put out

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.490
to the universe, like you never
really think about-- you know,

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.969
people can make themselves
sick by worrying,

00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:08.510
and people can make
themselves better

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.790
by being happy, and
being cheerful, and being

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.050
positive, and being kind.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:19.110
And just, you know, putting
out positive energy.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:24.370
I used to watch Drew Carey, and
Bruce Helford and Drew Carey

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.280
created the show.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.110
And I would say to the
TV, I would be like--

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.590
because I knew Drew
Carey-- I would say, man,

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.630
where's my Bruce Helford at?

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.230
Where's my Bruce Helford?

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.647
So when I did George Lopez,
I did it with Bruce Helford.

00:23:39.647 --> 00:23:40.230
Is that crazy?

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.670
KEVIN VLK: Wow.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.461
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:44.800
And then I told my wife the
story about Bruce Helford,

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.440
the one time we were
doing interviews,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.250
and I was in the
hallway, and he was

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.390
on the TV in the hallway
talking about me.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.566
And started crying,
because I was like,

00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:54.802
you know, there he is.

00:23:54.802 --> 00:23:56.530
KEVIN VLK: Wow.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.220
How are you able to--
because you appeal

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.934
to such a diverse audience.

00:23:59.934 --> 00:24:01.600
Is that a conscious
decision, or are you

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.060
just kind of, what's
funny is funny?

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.300
GEORGE LOPEZ: Well, listen, I
mean, if you look like this.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.810
I mean, anybody could look like
Mario Lopez and be successful.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.355
You know, try looking like this.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.620
You've gotta be funny to be
successful and look like this.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.209
So I just thought
that-- you know,

00:24:22.209 --> 00:24:23.750
at first people
thought it was really

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.550
kind of Latino based humor,
and then if you look at it now,

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:32.060
it's very social and economic
levels of things that we did.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:37.340
And you look at things that
Latinos do, just in general,

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.871
like you have a dining room
table with every chair's

00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:42.370
different.

00:24:45.364 --> 00:24:47.860
You know.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.310
All the pots and
pans are in the oven.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.230
You know.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.106
You know what I mean?

00:24:53.106 --> 00:24:54.438
You're like, where are the pots?

00:24:54.438 --> 00:24:55.560
They're in the oven.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.970
Everything's in the oven.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.091
Oh my god, I mean, there's
so many things that my--

00:25:04.091 --> 00:25:06.007
KEVIN VLK: If you guys
want to start lining up

00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:07.316
for questions, too,
we're going to start

00:25:07.316 --> 00:25:07.590
answering your questions.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.423
GEORGE LOPEZ: Also, my
grandmother never put

00:25:09.423 --> 00:25:12.200
anything in a Ziploc bag.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:18.140
So you would eat ice cream,
and it tasted like tamales,

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.540
because the tamales that
were in there from Christmas,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.680
the fragrance had gotten
into the ice cream.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.793
And then you're eating ice
cream, and you're like,

00:25:25.793 --> 00:25:29.660
this tastes like tamales.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.920
And then the whole
thing, I really

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.680
did make snow
cones from scraping

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.730
the ice from the
freezer, and putting 7UP.

00:25:40.917 --> 00:25:43.375
You know, what's crazy now too,
is kids are like engineers.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:44.750
You know what we did?

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.370
As an engineer, we'd
try to fill the ice tray

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.060
to make ice without spilling
it before you got it

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.710
to the refrigerator.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.220
That was our engineering.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.540
Making Kool-Aid with cellophane
on top, with toothpicks

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.850
so that you've got a little,
like a toothpick ice cube,

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.940
that tasted like
chorizo from the thing.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.830
Or foil.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.010
Like, I would bring a
plate back with foil,

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.510
and then the guy would be going,
my mom wants her foil back.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.593
And it was over the plate.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.100
Yeah, they fold it
and put in there.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.560
KEVIN VLK: Oh my
god, that's so funny.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.450
And then, so you
went from your sitcom

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.989
over to "Lopez Tonight," on TBS.

00:26:21.989 --> 00:26:22.780
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.382
KEVIN VLK: And so, what was
the biggest difference for you,

00:26:25.382 --> 00:26:27.340
going from-- obviously,
other than the format--

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.249
but going from a sitcom with
multiple cameras, to a--

00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:31.790
GEORGE LOPEZ: You
know what the thing

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.502
is, you never want to work in
a place where you're stifled.

00:26:35.502 --> 00:26:37.210
Like every day, you
go, and they tell you

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.168
you can't do something.

00:26:38.168 --> 00:26:40.920
The talk show, it lasted two
years, but every day was,

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.450
you don't, you can't do
this, you can't do that.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.060
Too many Latinos are watching.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.480
Not enough women are watching.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.860
Too many women are watching.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.810
Too many Latinos are watching.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.329
Too many black
people are watching.

00:26:52.329 --> 00:26:53.870
Not enough black
people are watching.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.490
And every day, it was that.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.480
So even the last two
years, was amazing,

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.230
because, you know,
they say they want you,

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.480
and then they bring you in, and
then they make you different.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.054
And I didn't want
to be different.

00:27:06.054 --> 00:27:07.470
That's what I love
about stand-up,

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.330
is that nobody can say what
you can say or not say.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.795
You know, they either
laugh, or they don't laugh.

00:27:13.795 --> 00:27:16.870
I'll take that risk.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.620
KEVIN VLK: And what
was the biggest lesson

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.060
you learned just from doing a
sitcom and doing a talk show?

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.220
GEORGE LOPEZ: You
know what, you learn

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.860
to be dedicated to
your work, and to be

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.120
prepared all the time.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.680
That this business
is tough enough

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.910
for anybody of any color,
but the lack of preparation,

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.730
or when you're not sufficiently
educated or prepared,

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.490
can hurt you.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.950
And then you think it's
because of you or what you are,

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.140
but really it's just that
you're just not prepared.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.360
So it taught me to work
while people were sleeping,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.610
and to write while
people were resting.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:58.900
And I dedicated to my work
to myself, and it worked out.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.210
KEVIN VLK: Yeah.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.459
And then you transitioned
to-- well, not transitioned,

00:28:02.459 --> 00:28:03.950
but you've done a
lot movies, too.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.430
With critical success,
with "Real Women Have

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.239
Curves," "Bread and Roses,"
and now, "Spare Parts,"

00:28:09.239 --> 00:28:10.530
which just came out in January.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.700
And that's based on
a true story of four

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.700
undocumented Mexican
American teenagers

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.640
from Phoenix, who team up for
an underwater robot competition,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.800
national robotics competition.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.690
Marisa Tomei is in it.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.640
So I've seen a lot of
comedians, you included,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.139
do some of their
best work in drama.

00:28:26.139 --> 00:28:29.240
You are a very, very good
dramatic actor in your movies.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.520
Patton Oswalt did it in
"Young Adult" and "Big Fan."

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.240
And Jim Carrey,
"Eternal Sunshine."

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.885
Robin Williams in "Good Will
Hunting" and "What Dreams

00:28:35.885 --> 00:28:36.402
may Come."

00:28:36.402 --> 00:28:38.610
So what do you think it is
about comedians just being

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.570
really good dramatic actors?

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.695
Because you're really good.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.730
GEORGE LOPEZ: I think that
there's kind of a built in,

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.550
when you take a couple
of hits, and you

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.495
know what it's
like to have pain,

00:28:49.495 --> 00:28:55.000
and you tap into what is
natural, in kind of our lives.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.870
That things, of
people that have left,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.540
or things that you felt,
that you kind of carry.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.050
And it does help you become
a more dramatic actor.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.890
But, you know, in that
movie, "Spare Parts,"

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.860
which is a very important move
because of these kids doing

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.730
something, pretty
much impossible, that

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.840
for Latino kids
from Arizona could

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.540
create a robot for under $800.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.700
Wire it, and do the
coding all themselves.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.350
And beat MIT.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:31.870
And beat Stanford, and
Harvard, and Cornell.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.410
And they beat everybody.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.840
And they only
entered-- you know,

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.260
this is a very Latino
thing-- they entered

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.820
not to lose to high schools, but
never thinking about winning.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.700
So they didn't
say, we just don't

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.910
want to lose to high
schools, they never thought,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.590
we could win.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.560
So we have to change
that thinking, too,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.050
that you can win.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.120
And you can beat, if you
think you're the best,

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.280
you could beat
anybody who thinks

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.270
they're as good as you
are, if not better.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:55.952
KEVIN VLK: Wow.

00:29:55.952 --> 00:29:57.743
All right, we'll take
an audience question.

00:29:57.743 --> 00:29:58.870
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yes.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.370
AUDIENCE: First of all, thanks
for coming to Google, George.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.078
GEORGE LOPEZ: No, hey,
listen, thank you, Google.

00:30:04.078 --> 00:30:05.572
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.150
I'm deeply touched.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.472
You know, Ming, my friend,
has been very kind to me.

00:30:12.472 --> 00:30:13.680
He's my brother, right there.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.480
So, Ming.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.740
I met Ming at MIT,
with the Dalai Lama.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.730
Ming is, how long have
you known His Holiness?

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.050
MING: I don't know, many years.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.110
GEORGE LOPEZ: Many years.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:34.280
So I, a practicing
Buddhist, I'm trying.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.750
But you know what a trip it
is, that my grandmother would

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.590
see them around San
Fernando, and tease them.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.600
And then they were always
around me, so I said,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.850
there has to be a reason why
they're always around me,

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.340
so I met Ming through that.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.119
Yes, sir.

00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:51.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
to the Pebble Beach tournament

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.770
as frequently as you do.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.540
You and Bill Murray
make the tournament,

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.057
so please continue
coming to that.

00:30:57.057 --> 00:30:58.140
GEORGE LOPEZ: I love golf.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:02.560
You know, I never would imagine
that I would be a golfer,

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.380
but you know, it taught me
things that a human being

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.360
didn't teach me.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.620
KEVIN VLK: Well, we've got
mini putt- putt out here.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.036
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah,
I'll go there.

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:14.420
AUDIENCE: So, George, I'm
not much on the links,

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.359
but I happen to be a
professional mini golf player.

00:31:17.359 --> 00:31:18.150
GEORGE LOPEZ: Nice.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.610
AUDIENCE: So, I challenge
you to a one hole challenge,

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.300
winner take all.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.892
Prize--

00:31:25.892 --> 00:31:27.100
GEORGE LOPEZ: What are those?

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.800
Pajamas?

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.090
AUDIENCE: An Android onsie.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.842
GEORGE LOPEZ: A one piece?

00:31:31.842 --> 00:31:32.800
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.350
GEORGE LOPEZ: All
right, after we're done.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.140
AUDIENCE: It's on.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.460
GEORGE LOPEZ: All right.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.501
AUDIENCE: Thank you, sir.

00:31:36.501 --> 00:31:38.292
KEVIN VLK: I'll walk you out.

00:31:38.292 --> 00:31:39.416
GEORGE LOPEZ: I won't lose.

00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:40.535
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.580
Now that there's a flap
in the back, tambien.

00:31:47.167 --> 00:31:48.750
KEVIN VLK: See Hector
on your way out.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.375
GEORGE LOPEZ: If it
didn't have a flap,

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.626
I'm not sure I would play
you, but that had a flap.

00:31:52.626 --> 00:31:53.667
KEVIN VLK: Next question.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.520
AUDIENCE: You talk a lot about,
or you did earlier, about fear.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.460
And I'm thinking about Latino
households, especially those

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.150
without a lot of resources, just
how much heartache there is.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.050
Because it's tough.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.883
It's tough for parents,
it's tough for kids,

00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:10.110
yet that humor is there.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.340
And that, like, resilience.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.840
And that, like,
even if you're never

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.975
given positive
reinforcement, you

00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:19.850
know, like other families
are, people make it.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.040
And I'm wondering, I just feel
that anxiety and depression

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.460
are so prevalent, and humor
is such an antidote for that.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.160
And just wondering how you
think about your ability

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.460
to influence.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.580
I'm thinking about dads
out there, who are like,

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.540
they're beating down
their own demons,

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.902
and trying to raise kids
and not transmit that pain.

00:32:38.902 --> 00:32:39.860
What are your thoughts?

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.700
GEORGE LOPEZ: You know,
that is a great question,

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.740
because I didn't have a father.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.240
I never met my father.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.310
And my mother was
not well, mentally.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:01.620
And I took a lot
of abuse as a kid.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.950
And my grandparents
were disconnected,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.860
and never encouraging to me.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.280
Never encouraging to me.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.870
And I just didn't want to become
what I had seen, or was seeing.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.750
You know, and it's very
difficult, even now,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.380
but that is definitely right.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.955
There is a responsibility
that fathers have,

00:33:22.955 --> 00:33:29.700
and family has, to at least
encourage, or talk to, or not

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:35.150
talk at, or scream at children.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:39.230
Because a wound,
it stays with you.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.210
And then, like something
kind, stays with you too.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:48.280
Because I was always the darkest
of anybody of my friends.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.820
And I always felt bad about it.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.210
Like, you know,
all Mexicans have

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.940
a lemon tree in the backyard.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.850
So I used to rub
lemons on my arms,

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.010
to try to lighten my skin.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.990
Didn't work.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:09.340
But then one of the first
complements that I ever

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.679
really remember getting was,
I was at a department store,

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.010
and an African American
woman said to me,

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.980
you have beautiful skin.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.679
Beautiful color skin.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.370
And I never forgot it.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.940
And it meant a lot.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.170
So even little
encouraging things

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.170
mean a lot to kids,
and to people.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.630
And that's what I think
we should pass on,

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.820
is that critical
is too critical,

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.940
and somewhere in between.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.699
Where you can't coddle
everybody, but also,

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:47.042
you can't give them
everything, either.

00:34:47.042 --> 00:34:47.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:48.420
GEORGE LOPEZ: So, thank you.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.120
Was that a good answer?

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.036
Because that was long.

00:34:53.554 --> 00:34:55.179
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for joining us.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.695
I had a question on
Hollywood and globalization.

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.820
And you were mentioning,
you know, these audiences.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.174
What do you see in
the next 20 years

00:35:02.174 --> 00:35:03.340
for entertainment, globally?

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.230
GEORGE LOPEZ: Well, you know,
what I would like to see,

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.510
which I think is we're
suffering a little bit from,

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.500
is when movies are made, they're
made for a particular audience.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.050
And you look at movies that
are predominantly all white,

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.890
or a movie that's
predominantly all black.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.770
And I think we have to start
to incorporate, instead

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:29.920
of trends of actors, an actual
diversity of actors in movies.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.544
When they cast movies, that
it looks more like real life.

00:35:33.544 --> 00:35:34.960
You know, Woody
Allen does movies,

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.887
and there's never anybody
of any color in the movies.

00:35:37.887 --> 00:35:39.470
And it's a little
bit of a disservice,

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.070
that you see a guy that's
such a great filmmaker,

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.224
and he chooses to do a
movie like that in New York,

00:35:45.224 --> 00:35:46.640
and it doesn't
look like New York.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.870
So incorporating
diversity, and I

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:53.320
don't think there is even an
organization that makes sure

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.910
that there is
diversity in movies.

00:35:55.910 --> 00:36:00.500
But the producers, and
the people that write,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.150
and the movie studios
have to be more

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:07.880
responsible in getting more
of a mix of what looks like.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.850
You know, Asian, and what
the world looks like.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.960
Yeah, so, absolutely.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.520
And then when I did my show,
I tried to include everybody.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.670
I think that's one
of the reasons why

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.044
it's so successful, is that
I tried to include everybody.

00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:24.890
And not exclude
anybody, but include.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.230
Like, you know, with my
humour, it may, at times,

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:30.580
look like it's divisive, but
it's meant to be inclusive,

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.530
to where we say, you
know, we're here too.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.450
We matter.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:38.270
You know the Mexican
director that won an Academy

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:42.450
Award for "Bird Man,"
and then everybody's

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:47.490
pissed off because he's
Mexican, and he's from Mexico.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.490
And even Sean Penn,
who-- that's cool,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.200
if they're friends,
that's all right.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.640
But to say, you know, who
gave this guy his green card,

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.740
as a joke?

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.007
Maybe, you know, in a bar,
but not at the Oscars,

00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:00.090
because it's hard to tell
if that's a joke or not.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.810
You know, and even though
they're friends, you know,

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.830
this and that, there's a place
for it, and a place not for it.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.600
But you know, Donald Trump.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.100
So you see Donald Trump
like Captain America.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:15.860
He says, you know, Mexico
is sending over criminals.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.220
We're not all criminals.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.770
Some are, most aren't.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.410
But then he's like, you know,
we've got to close the border,

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.770
this guy wins an Academy Award.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:29.010
And he puts in a tweet,
Mexico, pay me back the money

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.290
you owe me.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:32.545
So I Tweeted him back,
listen, if you ever

00:37:32.545 --> 00:37:33.920
lend money to a
Mexican, you know

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.490
you don't get it all right away.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.260
You're going to
get installments.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.080
And I put
#igetpaideverytwoweeks,

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.970
#ihavemydaughterthisweekend,
#illpayyounexttimeiseeyou.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.440
So, you know, there's
humor in that.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.550
But ignorance, I think,
is the enemy of us,

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.420
not anybody of any
particular color.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.740
I think ignorance is
the enemy, not people.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.740
Stupid people, at least.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.198
KEVIN VLK: Well,
I read an article,

00:38:09.198 --> 00:38:10.931
and it must be true,
because I read it.

00:38:10.931 --> 00:38:13.180
But Hispanics comprise the
fastest growing demographic

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.780
in the US box office.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.730
So they're actually
contributing almost 20%

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.040
of the US box office
revenue of all movies.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.780
And they represent only about
17.5% of the population.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.190
So it's huge.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.340
And it's interesting that
movies just aren't-- is that

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.169
the politics of
Hollywood, and stuff?

00:38:28.169 --> 00:38:29.210
Do you want to change it?

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.959
Can you change it?

00:38:29.959 --> 00:38:32.752
GEORGE LOPEZ: I think can.

00:38:32.752 --> 00:38:34.210
You know, I produced
"Spare Parts."

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.126
You know it's harder to
find movies like that.

00:38:36.126 --> 00:38:38.540
But you keep doing
movies, and then

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.229
keep-- you know, we did
"Rio," probably made

00:38:41.229 --> 00:38:42.520
a billion dollars, both movies.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.980
And the director
was from Brazil.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.820
And he had great music.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.750
I mean, great, great music.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:53.730
And he actually wanted
me to try to speak

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.100
with a Brazilian accent.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.020
And I tried, like,
I had a coach.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.510
I'm like, oh my god,
this isn't going to work.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.680
And then, thank god
that Fox told him,

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.060
listen, if we hire George Lopez,
we want that bird to sound

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:11.920
like George Lopez.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.330
Phew.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.902
Thank god.

00:39:16.902 --> 00:39:18.360
But I've done a
lot with the voice.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.245
You know, the voice
is very recognizable.

00:39:21.245 --> 00:39:23.390
You know, a very
recognizable voice,

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.945
that I didn't think, you
know, anything of it.

00:39:25.945 --> 00:39:28.070
And then sometimes I'll
call a place, and I'll say,

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.445
hey, what time do
you guys close?

00:39:29.445 --> 00:39:32.210
And they're like, who is this?

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.570
But in those movies, you know,
in "Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:37.742
and what other ones?

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:38.450
KEVIN VLK: "Rio."

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.400
GEORGE LOPEZ: "Rio." "Smurfs."

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.040
I'm a Smurf!

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.930
Like a Chicano Smurf.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:44.850
Grouchy.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.630
KEVIN VLK: Grouchy,
doesn't fit you.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.010
GEORGE LOPEZ: And I think
they had him like that,

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:48.843
too, in one picture.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.370
KEVIN VLK: Do you enjoy doing
the voiceover work in a booth?

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.786
GEORGE LOPEZ: You
know what, I do.

00:39:56.786 --> 00:40:03.910
I enjoy contributing, so
kids have something to watch.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.150
You know, that kids
have something to watch.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:13.280
It's important, because I never
thought of myself like either

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.320
a leader in any way, or more
important than anybody else,

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.395
but I always respect the past.

00:40:18.395 --> 00:40:21.900
You know, like I have a star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.780
and I got it the day that the
show had the hundredth episode,

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.800
that day.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.100
And the guy said
to me, I think we

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.520
want to put a star
into the Walk of Fame.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.490
And I said, I can do it.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:44.040
I can't go in until
Freddie Prinze goes in.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.040
And then he said,
I think he's in.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.540
And I said, I don't think so.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.780
So they checked,
and he wasn't in.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.550
And I paid the money
so that Freddie Prinze

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.300
could have his star.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.925
And I was there, and
his son was there,

00:40:55.925 --> 00:40:57.676
and his ex-wife was
there, and his mom

00:40:57.676 --> 00:40:59.550
was on the phone from
Puerto Rico and crying.

00:41:02.665 --> 00:41:06.600
So that, the mom was, wow, man.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.165
Because, you know, everybody
kind of forgot about him,

00:41:09.165 --> 00:41:13.770
and the mom said to me,
if Freddie was alive,

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.345
you guys would be friends.

00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:19.485
And I was like, that's nice.

00:41:19.485 --> 00:41:20.740
I'm not crying at Google.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.552
Nobody cries at Google.

00:41:22.552 --> 00:41:24.010
KEVIN VLK: Somebody
give him a hug.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.380
GEORGE LOPEZ: I'm gonna
go somewhere, I'm gonna.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.260
AUDIENCE: Why are you crying?

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:26.662
GEORGE LOPEZ: I know,
why are you crying?

00:41:26.662 --> 00:41:28.270
AUDIENCE: Why are you crying?

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:29.280
GEORGE LOPEZ: All
right, now I'm over it.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.950
KEVIN VLK: It's the lights.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.130
GEORGE LOPEZ: Now I'm
over it, I'm over it.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:37.670
So the next one I did, that
I had to do, to honor-- thing

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.690
was that Richard Pryor
had a statue in Peoria

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.070
that was half done.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.260
And then I asked all those
guys to help me raise the money

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.312
to get the statute done.

00:41:45.312 --> 00:41:46.770
And then we raised
the money, and I

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.660
think the statue is going to
be unveiled in May, completely

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.640
done, in his hometown.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.040
And I think, so, I've done that
to the people that, you know,

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:55.840
inspired me.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.528
That was nice.

00:41:56.528 --> 00:41:57.319
KEVIN VLK: Awesome.

00:41:57.319 --> 00:42:02.064
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:04.022
AUDIENCE: Odelay, George,
what's going on, man?

00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:05.610
GEORGE LOPEZ: What's happening?

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.151
AUDIENCE: First, I
want to say thanks

00:42:07.151 --> 00:42:09.532
for coming through, to Google.

00:42:09.532 --> 00:42:10.740
Seriously, it's been amazing.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.589
Like, if there was
like a heat map,

00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:14.130
of like, where the
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.146
at, it would be, like really
red in this area right now.

00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:19.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:24.170
And I think it's due to
you, and your presence.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.865
Seriously, I have been a fan,
like, for the longest time,

00:42:26.865 --> 00:42:27.870
since you were in radio.

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.960
And just a long time.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.690
So I wanted to say, you
know, I see you sort of as,

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.910
like-- you know, the
movie, "Spare Parts,"

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:41.410
I thought that that was like a
modern day "Stand and Deliver."

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.220
Like that story was
resonating again,

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.750
for like, the audiences
that were growing up now.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.255
So, you know, like, how
do I reach these kids?

00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:50.900
You know what I mean?

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.270
I wanted to say, what do
you think about TV now?

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:57.960
Like if you look, I mean, we
have "Cristela," "Blackish,"

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.410
"Fresh Off the Boat."

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:03.322
You know, TV's become
a little more colored.

00:43:03.322 --> 00:43:05.780
And I like it, but I wanted to
see what your take is on it.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.690
GEORGE LOPEZ: Those are all
ABC shows, too, by the way.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:08.314
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:08.314 --> 00:43:13.560
GEORGE LOPEZ: So ABC, I think
ABC leads the way in diversity

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.520
on TV.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.390
You know, culture.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:21.330
You know, when I was on TV,
Damon Wayans had a show at ABC.

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.640
Wanda Sykes was at Fox.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.900
Bernie Mac, god rest him, was
over there at Fox, as well.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.869
And there was much
more diversity in TV

00:43:32.869 --> 00:43:34.160
10 years ago than there is now.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.860
And that's the saddest
part, is that as we

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:40.260
progress as a culture,
and get more intelligent,

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:46.050
that we leave that impression
that people don't matter.

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:48.960
They do matter.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.490
Everybody's like everybody else.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:51.920
You know, you're human.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.720
But if you watch TV,
and kids see that,

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.690
they need to see people
that look like them.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:58.440
They need to people
that sound like them.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:03.340
And they need to see
people that make them

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.820
feel good about who they are.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:13.940
You know, I got a message from
a Chicano kid at, I think,

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.240
UC Irvine, that the
professor told him

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.830
that Chicano was a derogatory
term for a Mexican.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:23.020
And I said, no, that's not true.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.910
And he says, well
he thinks it is.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:30.920
I said, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna name my next tour,

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.004
and I'm gonna put Chicano in
the title for your professor.

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.420
And I started
thinking, wow, what?

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:43.700
So somebody said tall,
dark, and handsome.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.850
And I said, wait a minute.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.290
So my tour in the HBO
special, the 15,000 seat one,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.900
was called "Tall,
Dark &amp; Chicano."

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.872
So I did it, and I sent
the teacher a DVD of the--

00:44:54.872 --> 00:44:56.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:59.895 --> 00:45:01.550
AUDIENCE: So I get
another chance?

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:02.256
Is that it?

00:45:02.256 --> 00:45:03.260
KEVIN VLK: Yeah,
sure, you're up here.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.510
Come on, ask another question.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.810
AUDIENCE: I guess part
of it, to let you know,

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.480
is that I feel like
you've obviously

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.460
been like an innovator,
and like a person that's

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.170
been able to cross
a lot of boundaries.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.330
A lot of borders within
television and entertainment

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:20.850
and stuff.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.030
How do you see your
role developing now,

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:29.420
as you become wiser
and more-- as a bigger

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.250
figure in Hollywood, how do you
see your role of bringing up

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:33.804
the young [SPEAKING SPANISH]?

00:45:33.804 --> 00:45:34.970
GEORGE LOPEZ: You know what?

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.210
It's interesting
that you say that,

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.709
because we talked
about it at lunch.

00:45:37.709 --> 00:45:42.870
I'm going to produce a
television show, "Stand-ups,"

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:45.850
and we're going to try to
find the next stand-ups,

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.500
the next generation
of stand-ups.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:54.000
Male, and female, and gay,
and straight, and creative.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.850
However we gotta find
them, I'm gonna do a show

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.670
and host it, and produce
it, and find them.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:04.289
And not necessarily Latino,
I'm gonna do it for everybody.

00:46:04.289 --> 00:46:05.330
Because that's important.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.180
I mean, it would be a disservice
for me to do all this,

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.350
and then leave nothing.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.320
Leave no influence behind,
other than people watching me.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.155
And I don't want to
watch me no more.

00:46:16.155 --> 00:46:17.130
KEVIN VLK: Well,
it's a great time

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.046
to do it, because comedy
clubs, and comedians,

00:46:19.046 --> 00:46:21.119
and stand-up is at
a peak right now.

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:22.160
Just all these comedians.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.180
GEORGE LOPEZ: And
you know, the thing,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.471
like, Carnival Cruise Lines,
you know, they came to me,

00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:28.770
I think three years ago, and
they said, can we use your name

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:29.770
on all the cruise ships?

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:33.170
So all the cruise
ships have my name

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:34.530
and my picture on the stage.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:41.740
So that was a big thing for me,
that kind of, like the brand

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.330
would cross over into
something like Carnival.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:45.865
George Lopez, you know, nice.

00:46:45.865 --> 00:46:47.740
KEVIN VLK: That's
interesting, because I also

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.250
read that you turned down
a role in the 1995 movie,

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.790
"Desperado," with
Antonio Banderas.

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:56.371
You didn't like how it promoted
negative images of Latinos.

00:46:56.371 --> 00:46:58.620
So do you do that a lot,
where you're just like, no, I

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.440
can't be involved with this.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.384
It's not my brand.

00:47:01.384 --> 00:47:02.800
GEORGE LOPEZ: You
know what, I do.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.030
Because for me,
particularly, I can't do it.

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:11.410
So when that movie-- it's
funny, because you know,

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:15.760
you always get your integrity
questioned, you know.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.650
Like, I remember, I
read for the movie.

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:19.490
Salma Hayek's in it.

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.450
Antonio Banderas is in it.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:23.090
Robert Rodriguez
is directing it.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.720
So they called me,
and they said, hey,

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.510
they're offering you
a part in "Desperado."

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:33.780
And I said, yeah, what part?

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.610
And they said, a drug runner.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.826
And then I literally
said, how much drugs

00:47:39.826 --> 00:47:40.700
and how much running?

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.440
But I turned it down.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.120
And then Robert and
I became friends,

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.014
and he understood completely.

00:47:49.014 --> 00:47:50.680
But, you know, for
me, I mean, everybody

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.260
has to do what's right for them.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.667
I couldn't do it.

00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:58.000
AUDIENCE: Hi, George, it's
really nice to have you here.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.749
Thank you so much.

00:47:58.749 --> 00:48:00.720
And you thanked us,
but you need to know

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.460
it's a really big deal for us to
have El Mas Chingon at Google.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.885
It's huge, so thank
you for coming.

00:48:05.885 --> 00:48:08.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.630
And you have a room--

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.940
GEORGE LOPEZ: I like the
El Mas Chingon title.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.820
I like that.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.642
AUDIENCE: That is
super official.

00:48:15.642 --> 00:48:17.600
Many of us like the cars
loves [? chingonas ?].

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.030
GEORGE LOPEZ: Si.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.488
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for leadership.

00:48:19.488 --> 00:48:20.630
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yes.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:21.770
GEORGE LOPEZ: And
my question though,

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:22.990
is you mentioned
earlier you used

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.130
Twitter to respond to Donald
Trump, which is awesome.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.400
You're really using technology
to voice your opinions

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.704
and represent your community.

00:48:28.704 --> 00:48:30.370
You have a room full
of a lot of Latinos

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.790
at Google, and our friends,
so it's really cool

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:34.290
to hear that you're
using technology

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:35.529
as a platform for your voice.

00:48:35.529 --> 00:48:37.820
And I'd love to hear what
you think about social media,

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.230
your use of maybe even YouTube.

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:42.200
How is that a part of your life,
and maybe even your strategy

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.220
as you think about your work?

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:50.530
GEORGE LOPEZ: You know, it is
an important thing, you know.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.672
There's a kind of a free
association in Twitter

00:48:53.672 --> 00:48:55.130
that's a little
bit mean, you know.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:58.930
Like bullying, and things
with kids and things

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:00.210
that are very hurtful.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.460
So I'd actually like to see
a little social media take

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.730
a little bit more responsibility
for filtering and sending

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.530
things that aren't
appropriate to a place

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.550
that you can suspend an
account, or do something.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:15.040
Because that seems
to be something

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.150
that, because of the value
that we put on things instead

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.901
of people, that people
are made to feel inferior

00:49:21.901 --> 00:49:23.900
because they don't I have
what someone else has.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.730
But really, it's not
about what they have,

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.330
it's about what's inside.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:32.310
So there is kind of a mob thing
going on with social media.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:37.380
But as far as-- you know, I'm
not going to say the F-word--

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.614
Google+, Facebook.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.420
They said, don't say the F-word.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.140
But I'm gonna get on Google+,
and I'm gonna build that.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.260
I'm gonna build that.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.397
Then I'm gonna get the glasses,
and I'm gonna live in my house,

00:49:56.397 --> 00:49:57.480
but go all over the world.

00:50:01.587 --> 00:50:03.670
AUDIENCE: And now what
about YouTube as a platform

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:04.489
from for content?

00:50:04.489 --> 00:50:05.530
GEORGE LOPEZ: Absolutely.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:08.840
You know, if a filmmaker,
or somebody who

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.060
is a creative, or blog writers.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.160
You don't have to
necessarily get a book deal

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.170
to become a successful
writer or blogger.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:18.370
So YouTube, yes.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.750
You know, now with
computers, you

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.333
can generate things, animation,
you could do all those things.

00:50:22.333 --> 00:50:24.480
So YouTube is viable
for that, for somebody

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.600
to leave work, you
know, little movies,

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.670
and little things behind.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.000
So absolutely.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.230
You can't say that,
oh, there's not

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.240
an opportunity, when
there's an opportunity

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.400
at your fingertips every day.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.760
So yes, incredibly.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.640
And you can kind of watch of
a person's-- you know, like,

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.650
when someone used to
say, who do you like?

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:47.770
And then you'd have to
either go watch somebody,

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:49.210
or audit a class, or something.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.565
But now, if somebody
wanted to be an actor,

00:50:51.565 --> 00:50:54.814
or learn how to play guitar,
or to learn how to do this,

00:50:54.814 --> 00:50:55.980
it's all at your fingertips.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.396
So there's no
excuse to say, well,

00:50:57.396 --> 00:50:58.810
I don't know how to do that.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.950
Or I can't get
there and do that.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.820
You can go all over the world.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.769
There's no excuses.

00:51:03.769 --> 00:51:05.310
I always try to find
an excuse, but--

00:51:07.221 --> 00:51:09.720
AUDIENCE: The last thing I'll
say is, I wanted to thank you.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.360
Last time I saw you live
was you were speaking

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.280
at the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus event about what

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.496
it means to be part
of a community that

00:51:17.496 --> 00:51:19.870
is advancing itself through
education, through hard work.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:22.040
So I want to thank you for
your involvement in that space.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.540
And I love that you made a joke
about the Secretary of Labor

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.410
being Latina.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:26.910
I think you said
something like, she

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:29.160
isn't trying to promote
finding workers at Home Depot,

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.200
but really good hard
work, and thank you

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.730
to them for their efforts.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:33.765
So thank you, I really
appreciate you being here.

00:51:33.765 --> 00:51:35.764
GEORGE LOPEZ: You know a
great joke that I told?

00:51:35.764 --> 00:51:39.620
I was at the White House
with Obama, and everybody.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:45.050
And Sonia Sotomayor, you know,
the first woman Latina Supreme

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.900
Court, you know.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.660
So she's there, right?

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.940
So the President's over
here, and she's over there.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:55.190
And I say to the
President, I say,

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.310
you've got a Latina
Supreme Court justice.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.810
And then I said, in
front of the President,

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:05.774
I said, good luck getting her
to zip her robe all the way up.

00:52:05.774 --> 00:52:06.720
Right?

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.530
Because you know, Latinas like
to throw a little, you know.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:12.520
And the President
goes, hey, hey, hey.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:16.320
And I look over, she's wearing
a low cut-- I said, look.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.430
And she was like, oh, my god.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.525
But I said, come on.

00:52:20.525 --> 00:52:21.550
It's what it was.

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:24.021
Like, even he was
like, hey, hey, hey.

00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:27.454
And I said, look, and she
had a low cut, you know.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.340
She's fun.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:36.260
I mean, she's a very nice lady,
and incredibly intelligent,

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.430
and you know.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:45.044
I was involved in those
campaigns, 2008 and '12.

00:52:45.044 --> 00:52:47.210
KEVIN VLK: Well, you talked
about-- or, back in 2010

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.890
you said you may want
to run as mayor for LA

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:51.060
in about eight years.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.260
So it's, yeah, so
2015, three years away.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.109
Is that still something
you want to look at?

00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.900
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.160
KEVIN VLK: Hey, look at that.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:02.340
GEORGE LOPEZ: I do.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.070
I want to be mayor
of Los Angeles,

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.490
but I want to be mayor--
because there's already

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.880
big businesses there
already, so we just

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.980
need to take care of the
schools and the streets,

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:15.590
and just have a
little bit more pride.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:17.780
The mayor, you know,
no offense to him,

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.650
but he's a little bit vacant.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.370
And we're usually used to having
a mayor that's a little bit

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:23.480
more present.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.450
So I would run on the
campaign that I would be there

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:30.870
when you needed me.

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:35.286
And then we did I a hashtag,
best mayor with the best hair.

00:53:35.286 --> 00:53:36.695
So that was the hashtag.

00:53:36.695 --> 00:53:38.070
KEVIN VLK: We'll
get the buttons.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:38.760
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.801
[SPEAKING SPANISH] mayor.

00:53:40.965 --> 00:53:43.340
KEVIN VLK: So you can talk a
little bit about your George

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.599
Lopez Foundation?

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:46.390
GEORGE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.580
You know, I was born
with kidney disease,

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:57.295
and I didn't realize it
until it was way advanced.

00:53:57.295 --> 00:54:00.020
You know, kidney disease
is a kind of a slow thing,

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.020
and it shows as fatigue.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.240
You know, a lot of people
are fatigued, and they say,

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.198
you know, I'm so tired.

00:54:04.198 --> 00:54:07.570
And you think it's because
you're working hard.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:11.690
So when I got well,
almost 10 years ago,

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:13.870
that I decided
that-- and I remember

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:15.022
telling my doctor this.

00:54:15.022 --> 00:54:17.480
I said, I just want to go in,
I just want to get this done.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.130
I don't want to become a
poster boy for kidney disease.

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.800
I just want to get well, and I
just want to go back to work,

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.540
you know.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.970
And then when I was
laying in the hospital

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:27.724
after I'd had it
done, maybe a day.

00:54:27.724 --> 00:54:29.390
I had it done on a
Tuesday or Wednesday.

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:33.420
Thursday morning when I got up,
was clearer than I'd ever been,

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:37.780
and I was healthy
for the first time.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.970
At that moment, I
decided that I could not

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:42.790
turn my back on people who
are sick, especially kids.

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:44.850
So I have a foundation
that raises money

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:48.580
to send kids to camp
who are on dialysis,

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.080
or are awaiting transplants,
or have had transplants,

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.355
so that they get
to be like kids.

00:54:53.355 --> 00:54:56.390
You know, and go out and
fish, and play basketball,

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:59.240
and be around kids that
are just like them.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.440
So I do that a
couple times a year.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.340
And then also, just to raise
awareness for kidney disease,

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.170
but also for just
health, overall.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:10.590
Because the thing that
I was a victim of,

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:15.360
was that as a culture, we don't
necessarily go to the doctor.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.754
As my grandmother would say
so perfectly, hey, Grammy,

00:55:20.754 --> 00:55:21.920
you should go to the doctor.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.961
No, porque they're going
to find something wrong.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.170
I actually heard somebody
go to the doctor,

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:35.610
find out that he was sick, and
get mad at his wife, and said,

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:39.520
you made me go to the
doctor and now I'm sick.

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.020
I wasn't sick yesterday, and
now I gotta keep going back.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.311
That's why I didn't want to go.

00:55:43.311 --> 00:55:46.034
Because if you go once, they're
gonna make you keep going back,

00:55:46.034 --> 00:55:47.200
and that's how they get you.

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.080
You keep going back.

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.750
So we do need to-- I mean,
clearly, here everybody

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.200
eats well.

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.490
You can even eat
the flowers here.

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:04.630
So that thing, of
eating the right things.

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:06.710
And already, Latinos,
we eat a lot of fruit,

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:07.780
we just put chili on it.

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.170
So we have to put half chili.

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:14.422
Low sodium [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:56:14.422 --> 00:56:16.130
KEVIN VLK: Well, thank
you for everything

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.050
you do with your foundation.

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:18.850
GEORGE LOPEZ: Oh, it's
an honor, thank you.

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:19.330
KEVIN VLK: It's wonderful.

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:19.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:21.250
GEORGE LOPEZ: It's an honor.

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.740
I can't believe it.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.810
AUDIENCE: George,
I'd be so excited

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:27.522
for you to run for mayor in LA.

00:56:27.522 --> 00:56:28.230
You have no idea.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:29.760
I think you have an army
of people that will--

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.760
GEORGE LOPEZ: I think
I would win, right?

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.200
AUDIENCE: --picket.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:31.940
Yeah.

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.523
GEORGE LOPEZ: You know, Arnold
Schwarzenegger became governor,

00:56:34.523 --> 00:56:36.570
he didn't know nothing, either.

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:37.800
I don't like that now.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.010
You get down.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:42.530
You know, I've
messed with Arnold.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.113
You know, because I
don't mess around.

00:56:44.113 --> 00:56:46.054
Like, if I go after
somebody, I go after them.

00:56:46.054 --> 00:56:48.470
Arnold Schwarzenegger, I went
after him in an HBO special.

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:50.210
He was for English only.

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:53.220
And I said, he don't
even speak English.

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:58.630
So, you know, I said FTP
to Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:01.570
And then I go to a
boxing match, and who

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:03.760
sits down right next to me?

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.490
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:07.200
And I'm like-- I look
at him, and I go,

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.220
this is going to
be uncomfortable.

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.920
And then I said, you know I
make fun of you in my stuff?

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.480
Yes, I know that you talk about
the FTP, I know what that is.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.750
He was governor.

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:22.780
And then they showed me
on TV, and they cheered.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.200
And they showed
him and they booed.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.366
And then I leaned into his
camera, I went like this.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.405
AUDIENCE: I love it, in
case you were interested.

00:57:32.405 --> 00:57:35.680
So I grew up in Miami, which
is predominantly Latino.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.664
And I've lived in
places like Boston.

00:57:37.664 --> 00:57:39.580
GEORGE LOPEZ: What do
you mean, predominantly?

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.280
It is.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.000
If you go to-- I went to the
Bonnev-- what do they call it?

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:44.705
Fountainebleau.

00:57:44.705 --> 00:57:45.996
AUDIENCE: Fountainebleau, yeah.

00:57:45.996 --> 00:57:48.240
GEORGE LOPEZ: And you
go to the front desk,

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.710
and they said
[SPEAKING SPANISH],

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:54.125
and they don't even say, hi,
welcome to the Fountainebleau.

00:57:54.125 --> 00:57:58.900
AUDIENCE: No, you're lost
if you speak English there.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.440
So I've lived in places like
Boston, San Fransisco, even LA,

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.360
where I'm noticing
over the last,

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.050
like 10, 15 years, that it's
just getting whitewashed.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:11.126
And so, you know, thinking
about your future campaign,

00:58:11.126 --> 00:58:12.750
how would you think
about-- like what's

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:15.970
the thing that we can do as
Latinos in places of power

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:20.287
to keep Latinos in some
of these urban centers?

00:58:20.287 --> 00:58:21.120
That's question one.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.740
Question two is,
like, what do you

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.790
think we can do, even
just as citizens here,

00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:27.550
to make that easier
for Latinos to stay?

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:29.912
GEORGE LOPEZ: Well, I think
everybody has to vote.

00:58:29.912 --> 00:58:32.370
Everybody that's capable of
voting, whatever color you are,

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:32.953
needs to vote.

00:58:32.953 --> 00:58:34.760
Especially Latinos,
because we have

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.182
to be the voice for the
people that don't have a vote.

00:58:38.182 --> 00:58:39.390
So we have to be their voice.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:43.420
So to not vote not only
hurts them, it hurts us.

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.180
Because the Republicans,
they always vote.

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:50.655
So they're relying on the fact
that we're not gonna vote,

00:58:50.655 --> 00:58:52.030
and that's how
they're gonna win,

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.250
because they have
higher voter turnout.

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.670
But we also need to remember
that it is important,

00:58:56.670 --> 00:59:00.150
and people lost their
lives in order to vote.

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.280
So that it's
important, because now,

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:05.100
because of the diversity and
the way the country's changing,

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.490
you can change politics.

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:09.730
You could change the way things
work by just going to vote,

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:10.580
and being there.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.796
But also, in the first part is
that you need to-- you know,

00:59:13.796 --> 00:59:17.550
we talked about mentoring
people, and looking out

00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:20.120
for people, and asking
questions of them.

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.160
And leading them to places
where they can get information.

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.670
And just being almost--
not a mentor, so much,

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:31.390
as being supportive of somebody.

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:34.210
Yeah, it goes a long
way, too, because when

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:37.540
I was in elementary
school, the first time

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.160
I ever heard somebody say
that you could be a success

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:45.340
and you could be whatever
you wanted to be.

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.960
It was in the auditorium at
San Fernando Elementary School,

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.160
and it was a baseball
player, and he

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.060
was kind of motivate-- nobody
was really paying attention

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:51.380
to him.

00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:51.879
I did.

00:59:51.879 --> 00:59:54.590
And I'd never heard
anybody say it, and said

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.990
I've never forgotten that.

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:57.340
I was probably seven.

00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:00.380
And I used that as
kind of, my motto,

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.500
as I went through
school, and realized

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.430
that nobody in my family had
graduated from high school.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:07.440
I was the first one.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.640
And then, my daughter
Maya, I think,

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.740
is going to be the-- you
know, I named her Maya,

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:18.870
because clearly-- is going to be
the first one to go to college.

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:19.370
So, yeah.

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:20.612
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:20.612 --> 01:00:22.765
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:00:22.765 --> 01:00:25.140
GEORGE LOPEZ: She's going to
one that doesn't cost a lot.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.030
No, no.

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:31.570
But that makes me proud,
is that she, you know,

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.690
wanted to do that.

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.440
KEVIN VLK: And so just
one final question.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.540
If you-- it's kind of
cheesy-- but, like,

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.235
if you could tell your
younger self anything--

01:00:40.235 --> 01:00:41.719
GEORGE LOPEZ: Oh, yeah.

01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:44.010
KEVIN VLK: --what would that
be in terms of the advice?

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:52.000
GEORGE LOPEZ: I would
probably say, don't be afraid.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.340
You're gonna be great.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:58.810
And always believe in yourself,
and trust your own instincts.

01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:02.430
Because we all have great
instincts that we come with.

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:05.090
And if you rely on
those to guide you,

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:09.410
because it is that good things--
and if you make a mistake,

01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.040
it'll be your mistake.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.390
And if you achieve
success, you can

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:16.510
be incredibly proud of
yourself for taking a risk

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.670
and trusting your intuition.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:22.130
So would say to trust yourself.

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:23.030
KEVIN VLK: Wonderful.

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:24.770
Thank you, George,
for being here.

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:25.970
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:30.495
GEORGE LOPEZ:
Seriously, thank you.

01:01:30.495 --> 01:01:31.370
Thank you, everybody.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:32.179
Thank you.

01:01:32.179 --> 01:01:33.470
KEVIN VLK: Thank you, everyone.

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:34.070
GEORGE LOPEZ: You
guys are great.

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:34.670
KEVIN VLK: See you next time.

01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:36.520
GEORGE LOPEZ: Thank you so much.
