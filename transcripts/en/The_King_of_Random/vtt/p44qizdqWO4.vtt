[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,

00:00:00.687 --> 00:00:03.640
we're taking a look at
how to make a DIY sandblaster

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.120
that you can use to etch
glass, mark steel,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.620
or engrave wood.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.860
[Music]

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.855
Hi guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.880
I'm Calli.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.100
And today, we've got
a pretty cool project.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.200
So sandblasters are thing
that take high pressure air,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.900
and drops sand
into the air stream,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.592
and so the sand gets blasted
out at high speeds,

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:29.752
and the sand is really hard.

00:00:29.752 --> 00:00:31.600
It's usually made
of things like quartz,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.500
and so those are very good
at etching pretty much anything.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.579
You can carve into steel,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.700
you can carve in a glass,
you can carve into wood.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.380
Unfortunately,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.400
sometimes sandblasters
can be pretty pricey.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.599
Today, we're showing you

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:44.050
how to cut that down
to about five or six dollars,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.500
and just a few tools.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.260
And from what you've
explained to me,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.441
sand can be incredibly abrasive
and sometimes scratch areas

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:52.060
that you don't want scratch.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.200
So what are the other supplies
that were using?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.380
Well, in addition
to the sandblaster itself,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.340
we're going to show you how to
do some DIY masking techniques.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.160
Sometimes using materials
as simple as duct tape.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.700
I'm also going to warn you
that this project does require

00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:06.963
owning an air compressor.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:09.250
So we've got a large
air compressor with a big tank,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.774
and that's what
we're going to be using.

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:12.300
But everything other
than the compressor

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.340
itself is very cheap
and easy to get.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.100
The idea is pretty simple.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.200
A drink bottle will
be filled with sand,

00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:19.850
which will feed into a hole

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.007
that we're going to add
into our air gun.

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.040
The sand will be pushed
out by air at high speeds,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.200
and carve into whatever
we're pointing it at.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.140
To start off,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.660
the main thing that we're going
to need is this airgun.

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:32.850
Now, I got this one
at Harbor Freight.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.552
It cost five dollars,

00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:36.450
and it's already
a pretty good start.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.969
We just need to make
one quick modification to it,

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.019
and then we'll be ready
to start using it.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:41.831
Do you guys know

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.760
what sound does semi-automatic
meow-chine gun makes me?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.720
Here, our airgun is actually
attached to our hose,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.440
and so we can spray air
out of it nicely.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.320
Now, we need to modify it

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.000
so it actually shoots
sand instead of air,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.100
and of course,
once there's sand in it,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.220
never ever pointed at a person.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.620
Air is negotiable.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.850
Calli's making quick work
of the drink bottle.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.366
We need this bottle empty,

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:13.582
and then we'll rinse
it and dry it out.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.300
Our bottle is now empty
and dried out.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.050
I'm just going to take
an exacto knife,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.980
and I'm going to cut
this little ring off.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.760
Now if we put the cap on,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.720
we can see that between
the cap and this lip,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.780
there is enough space
for the air gun nozzle to fit,

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.150
and that's exactly
where we want to drill a hole.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.550
With this particular nozzle,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.089
we're using a 3/16
inch drill bit.

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:49.200
[Music]

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.880
There we go.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.500
We can see that the bottle
now fits onto the end.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.120
But before we put
it on all the way,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.540
we actually need to do
a little bit more modification.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.727
We need to make sure

00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:00.888
that the sand is going
to feed into this,

00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:02.360
just the way we want.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.400
What we need to do now
is take a file and cut

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.600
a small rectangular hole
into the metal tube,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.650
and that's what the sand
is going to feed into.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.508
Our bottle will be attached
upside down with the cap

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:12.920
on full of sand,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920
but we're not just going
to cut a hole in the tops

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.971
so the sand falls in,

00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.328
we actually don't want
that much sand going in.

00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:21.250
What we want to do is cut a hole
in the bottom of the tube

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.922
so that the sand is drawn in
by the force of air passing by.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:28.109
There we go.

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.411
We've now carved a hole down
into that metal tube.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.972
And as you can see,
it's on the bottom,

00:03:33.972 --> 00:03:36.550
so all the sand will feed down
through the bottle,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.700
and get pulled in by the air
rushing through the tube.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.780
Now we've got
our plastic bottle,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.940
and if you look at the bottom,

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:47.706
you can see the hole that we
carved into the metal tube.

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:48.476
And at this point,

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.646
we are just about ready
to fill this thing up with sand

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:51.589
and give it a little test.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.402
We're going to take a look
at the two types of sand

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:54.600
that we're going
to be trying out,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600
and I got to say,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.049
I've used both
of these before,

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.150
and they do both work.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.260
So first we just
have playground sand.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.000
This is about the cheapest
stuff you can get,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.800
I think it's like three dollars
and fifty cents for a bag of it.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.340
It's--

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.420
I mean, it's just what you think
of when you think of sand.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.000
This is industrial quartz sand.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.660
It's all pretty uniform in size,
which is pretty nice.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.060
And this is actually
my favorite stuff to use.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.676
Now, like I said,
you can use the playground sand,

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:18.375
but sometimes,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.000
there are larger little rocks
and bits in it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.880
So if you're going to use it,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.640
I recommend running it
through a sieve or strainer,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.120
and just save all
of the finer grit sand.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.880
Everything that comes
through the sieve,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.700
you should be just fine to use.

00:04:30.962 --> 00:04:34.100
But the reason that we want
to do this is these larger rocks

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.700
won't always fit
through the hole

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.703
that we carved into the bottom
of the metal tube,

00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:38.804
and they can get in there

00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:41.350
and then jam it up, and then
your whole thing will get stuck,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.860
and it's pretty hard
to clean out.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.650
So you definitely want to run it
through a sieve

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.300
if you're going to be using
the playground sand.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.300
This sand, it
really doesn't matter

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.200
because as I said,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200
it's pretty much
all the same size.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.618
There might be
some larger grains,

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:53.541
but for the most part,

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.905
you can see it all just goes
right through the sieve.

00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:58.040
I'm just going to take some
of this quarzt sand,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.920
and fill our
bottle about halfway.

00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:03.402
So right now,
it's just shooting out air.

00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:05.100
The sand isn't going
to get to the gun.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.860
But if I turn this upside down,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.160
it now can start feeding
the sand into the gun.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.798
When it's under high pressure,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.640
you can't really
see it very well.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.320
I mean obviously,
you can see it some,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.660
and I'm turning it upside down

00:05:15.663 --> 00:05:17.586
because if it gets
too low of pressure,

00:05:17.586 --> 00:05:19.763
then all of the sand
gets sprayed out.

00:05:19.763 --> 00:05:21.920
It's kind of wasteful
on the sand,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.779
so usually, I'm spraying--

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.132
I just like to turn
it over before I stop

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.420
so I don't just have
a lot of wasted sand.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.640
This sand is really sharp
and really hard,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.700
and it's going to be moving
very quickly and bouncing back

00:05:32.713 --> 00:05:34.800
toward me off of whatever
it is I'm sandblasting,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.315
so I need to have a lot of
personal protection equipment.

00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:38.737
I'm not just gonna use glasses,

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:41.700
but I'm actually going to use
this full face mask, and then,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.171
while I'm using sand in this,

00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:45.150
I'm also going to be
using a respirator,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.940
because of the sand can break
and create dust,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.900
and I don't want to be
breathing any of that in.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.110
We're not using
a sand blasting cabinet here.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.550
It's just out in the open,
so I'm going to have

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.550
a respirator as well
as the facemask,

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.700
and I'm going to be wearing
thick leather gloves.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:16.220
[Music]

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.240
You can see how much that sand
has really marked up the glass.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.740
This is permanent.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.500
This isn't something
that's going to wash off.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.460
The sand actually chipped away
tiny tiny bits of the glass,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.460
leaving the surface
rough like this.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.100
Something you can absolutely
feel as well as see.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.831
This just feels kind of
like a rough sandpaper

00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:36.394
or ceramic at this point.

00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:38.668
It's unlikely that
most people are going

00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:42.050
to want to put a freehand
random design onto a cup.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.600
So now we're going
to take a look at

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.350
how we can make a mask for this,
and it's pretty simple.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.700
It just involves duct tape.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.178
We've now taken the duct tape

00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:51.478
and we've masked off
pretty much the whole cup,

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.621
which is just what we want,

00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:54.575
because now, we can cut
the design that we like

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:55.817
out of this part here,

00:06:55.817 --> 00:06:57.709
and only that part
will get engraved.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.980
How you make
your mask is up to you.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.869
We're just using some paper,
some duct tape,

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:02.836
and exacto knives.

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:04.771
If you have access
to a vinyl cutter,

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.060
you might be able to make
some pretty fancy designs.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:51.300
[Music]

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.450
Using a sandblaster
on wood can create a really

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.179
cool-looking effect that
you've probably seen before,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.540
without even really
knowing what it was.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.220
When you mask off
your letters or design,

00:08:00.232 --> 00:08:01.550
and then sandblast the rest,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.080
it really brings out
the grain of the wood

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.800
because the softer parts of the
would get eaten away faster,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.440
and the harder parts
in the grain stay behind.

00:08:09.443 --> 00:08:12.050
There are a few things we
need to change however.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.300
The wood, while softer
is also much bouncier,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.680
and it has a harder time

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.669
being eaten away the same way
that the glass and the metal do.

00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:21.550
So we need to turn
up the pressure

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.360
on our sandblaster
by quite a bit.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.140
However, when we do that,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.356
it has a tendency to eat right
through the duct tape,

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:28.912
so we can't use that as a mask.

00:08:28.912 --> 00:08:30.175
Instead of the duct tape,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.020
we're going to be using
something much thicker.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.780
This is shower pan liner.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.020
It's designed for going
underneath your shower

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.840
in the bathroom to prevent

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.085
any humidity or leaked water
from getting into the wood.

00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:43.420
It's a pretty thick rubber,

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.917
and it comes
in these big whole sheets.

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:46.323
You buy it by the foot.

00:08:46.323 --> 00:08:48.092
This whole sheet,
1 foot of it,

00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:50.862
was I think about three dollars
and fifty cents,

00:08:50.862 --> 00:08:52.040
somewhere around there,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.790
and this is enough
to do a lot with.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.429
To attach this,

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:56.414
we're going to prep
the wood surface by sanding

00:08:56.414 --> 00:08:57.349
it nice and smooth,

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:00.400
and then I'm going to use just
some spray adhesive on the back

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.182
of our cutout design
on the rubber,

00:09:02.182 --> 00:09:03.627
and attach that to the wood.

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:05.274
When your sandblasting wood,

00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:07.650
you are going to need
a much higher pressure.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.440
For the glass and steel,
we had it between 20 and 40 PSI.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.180
We want a lot more
than that for the wood.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.180
Now, it's at between 80 and 100 PSI.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:34.680
[Music]

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.540
That's amazing.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.940
To make it a little bit
easier to carve into,

00:09:38.948 --> 00:09:40.332
we did use base wood.

00:09:40.332 --> 00:09:42.450
That's something you
can just pick up pretty much

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.300
any hobby store.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.482
It's not too expensive,

00:09:44.482 --> 00:09:46.909
and it does an easier job
of carving all the way

00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:48.466
around than some other things.

00:09:48.466 --> 00:09:51.340
But this pine 2x4 actually
worked out pretty nicely too.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.880
I really like
how it brought the grain out,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.380
and it's interesting.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.900
It didn't just leave
like stripes in it.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.300
It's actually sort
of a tiered stair-step effect.

00:10:00.302 --> 00:10:03.149
What level of difficulty
would you say this project is?

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:05.100
I mean, if you have
an air compressor,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.500
not at all.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.880
This is pretty cool,
and the fact

00:10:07.897 --> 00:10:10.097
that you can engrave
and etched glass, steel,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.297
and wood is really neat.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.140
Hey guys, you've probably
noticed that since we introduced

00:10:14.148 --> 00:10:16.198
Calli in our Captain
America shield video,

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.998
every new video
has had secret codes,

00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:18.800
and graphic glitches,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.800
and other secret elements
hidden into it.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.388
Keep track of what you see,

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.440
and the timestamps
of when you see it.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.300
We've got some big
prizes to give away,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.300
and finding the codes
might make you our next winner.
