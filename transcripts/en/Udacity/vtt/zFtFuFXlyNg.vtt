00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; Now let's take a little deeper look at what is contained inside of the data

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.671
array. Now, if you recall, each layer is actually a large two-dimensional grid

00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:12.800
of tile data. It's listed here in the JSON file as a single integer array.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.558
Effectively, this is what we call raster scan order, where each row is listed in

00:00:17.558 --> 00:00:22.332
the file after the previous row, linearly. The value of each element in the data

00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:27.074
array actually has significance in itself. First off, if you see a zero value

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:32.090
that effectively means that no tile has been placed in that x,y position inside

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.546
of this layer. Any non-zero value represents a tile index for a given atlas.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:41.142
Now, this is where things start to get a little bit tricky. Now, if you recall,

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:45.832
this little element here, first GID, that exists for each atlas that's listed in

00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:50.005
our tile sets array. Now, if a zero value in the data array for a layer, it

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.025
means that there is no tile there. That means that the first element to

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:58.326
represent that a tile does exist must start with one. Each atlas that exists

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:02.659
inside of the tiled file will have an increasing first GID. Now, tiled has its

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.015
own heuristics on what the first GID should be for each subsequent atlas that's

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:11.496
loaded. We won't get into that other than to say that you need to know what this

00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:16.351
number is. So, what we see here is that if we have a value of 167 in this data

00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:21.565
array, and the first GID of the atlas starts with 1, this effectively means that

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:26.859
167 is the first atlas, tile number 166. Now, this makes a little bit more sense

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.140
once you start getting 4 or 5 different atlas layers on there. Right now, it may

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.337
seem a little bit [unknown]. The larger issue that you have to run into is what

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:42.084
does 166 actually mean. Now, recall once again that the atlas that's being given

00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:45.983
to us is in raster scan order as well. So, the value of 166 is actually the

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:50.066
raster index into the 2-dimensional array. With this set up, computing the

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.162
coordinates for the atlas simply involves mapping the tile size to the right

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:55.975
offset inside the atlas itself.
