00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:27.250
A fundamental question for me in my work is
how architecture can, perhaps, behave more

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.320
like an organism.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.510
And so, for me, at the beginning of the proposal
for Lumen and its conception, I was very interested

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.640
in developing a project that that allowed
for multiple experiences and transformations,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.600
and, really, in the end, celebrates human
engagement and change.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.430
If you look above up to the canopy, you can
see a whole series of different

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.700
size cells, or what we're calling, windows.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.780
And then also within the canopy are an array
of stalactite conical forms that are suspended

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.110
at various lengths.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.960
Now, each of these is individually digitally
knit by Sheima Seiki, who I've been working

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.190
with for about six years now, innovating this
particular material system, which I invented

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.190
in 2012.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.440
And the threads that we're using include 
two high-tech responsive fibers, which include

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.610
solar-active fibers.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.420
And so if you look above on a sunny day, all
of the colors that you're seeing are induced

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.460
by the presence of the sun.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.910
What you're viewing currently is about week
three of our installation process, installation

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.090
and construction.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.970
And what you're looking at is over a million
yards of thread, which is a lot.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.180
The large canopy is installed.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.030
It's a little bit lower than it will actually
be in its final completed state.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.390
And depending on what time of day or night
that you visit and engage the project, you'll

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.720
have a different experience both in terms
of the high-tech fibers that are changing

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.490
color and glowing and emitting light, but
also in terms of the sensing system and our

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.260
misting system that will create a kind of
cooling microclimate, as you wander through

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.789
the canopy and the various groves of cones.
