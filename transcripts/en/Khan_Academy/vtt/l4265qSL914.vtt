00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:03.091
- A cell phone producer distributes boxes

00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:05.484
of units to retail stores.

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:09.360
A unit is either a cell
phone or an accessory,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.866
and each box can have up
to 24 units composed of

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:17.604
c cellphones and a accessories.

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:20.320
In addition, each box must have at least

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.734
as many cell phones as accessories.

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:27.611
At least as many
cellphones as accessories.

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:29.492
Which of the following
systems of inequalities

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.301
best models the situation described above?

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:34.367
So let's just think it through.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:39.313
So each box can have up
to 24 units composed of

00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:43.191
c cellphones and a accessories.

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.302
So that means that the c cellphones plus

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:50.203
the a accessories, it
can be up to 24 units.

00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:53.408
So it has to be less than or equal to 24.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:54.406
This is the number of cellphones,

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:55.566
this the the number of accessories,

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.539
you add them together,
it has to be up to 24.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.323
And then they tell us, and then
they tell us right over here

00:01:02.323 --> 00:01:04.172
each box must have at least

00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:07.899
as many cellphones as accessories.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.684
So the cellphones have to
be greater than or equal to

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:13.587
the accessories.

00:01:13.587 --> 00:01:15.306
All right, those are the constraints.

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:17.837
So let's see which of
these choices match them.

00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:22.837
So, this one say 24 is less
than or equal a plus c.

00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:25.406
No, it should be the other way around.

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:30.406
It should be 24 should be greater
than or equal to a plus c.

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:36.110
This is saying that a plus
c needs to be 24 or above.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.338
But they say each box
can have up to 24 units.

00:01:39.338 --> 00:01:41.752
They can't have 25 units
or anything like this.

00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:43.563
So this is saying the opposite thing

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:44.747
than what this is saying.

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:47.302
This is saying c plus a has to
be less than or equal to 24,

00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:50.343
this is saying 24 has to
be less than or equal to

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.966
c plus a or a plus c, so we
can just rule that one out.

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:55.451
This one also has that same

00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:57.704
24 is less than or equal to a plus c,

00:01:57.704 --> 00:01:59.468
so we can just rule that one out.

00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:01.581
This one over here, let's see,

00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:04.879
a plus c is less than or equal to 24,

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.573
well that's exactly what
we have right over here,

00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:08.292
they just swapped the a and the c.

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.729
A plus c is less than or equal
to 24, and then over here

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.421
they have a is less than or equal to c,

00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.372
which is equivalent to what this is.

00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:18.578
Saying c is greater than or
equal to a is the same thing

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:22.897
as saying that a is
less than or equal to c.

00:02:22.897 --> 00:02:25.057
So this is the choice I'd go with.

00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:27.332
This choice right over here
has this constraint right,

00:02:27.332 --> 00:02:29.514
but then it says that
the number of cellphones,

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:32.162
the number of cellphones has to be

00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:35.504
no more than the number of accessories.

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:36.377
Another way to think about it,

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:38.560
is at least as many
accessories as cellphones,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.627
which is the opposite,

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.644
is not what this constraint is saying.

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:46.821
So we could rule that one out as well.
