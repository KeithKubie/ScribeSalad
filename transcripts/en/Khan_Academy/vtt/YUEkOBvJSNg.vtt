00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.550
For all the cyclic molecules
we've dealt with so far, we've

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.000
just drawn them as rings.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.250
For example, for cyclohexane
we've literally just drawn it

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.900
as a hexagon.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.420
So we've drawn cyclohexane
like that.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.570
Now, we know from the last
several videos that all the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.520
bonds for carbon don't sit
in the same plane.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.430
If we take the example
of methane, that's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.360
the simplest example.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.020
You have your carbon sitting
in the middle.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.180
You'll have kind of a hydrogen
popping out like that, another

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.000
hydrogen that's in the plane
of the screen, another one

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.240
that's behind the screen,
and another one

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.210
that is straight up.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.570
So you kind of have this
tetrahedral structure, and in

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.990
the case of methane you have
that 109.5 degree bond angles.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.410
Carbon likes to form bonds
of this shape.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.740
It won't always be
109.5 degrees.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.390
It'll be something close to
it, depending on what the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.010
different atoms or molecules
are that it is bonded to.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.150
So given that, what would a
cyclohexane molecule actually

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.480
look like if we try to
visualize it in three

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.420
dimensions?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.340
So to think about that, let's
think about these two bonds

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.400
first. I'll try my best to
draw it in one of its

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.780
three-dimensional shapes.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.890
So those bonds right there,
I will draw like that.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.260
And then this down here, in
orange, I will draw like this.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.230
And then this up here,
in magenta, I

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.010
will draw like that.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.730
And then, let me see, in, in
purple, I'll do these two

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.560
right over here, and I'll
draw them like this.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.010
So you have that
and like that.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.940
This hopefully makes clear that
over there is that end

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.060
over there, this end over here
is this end over here, and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.170
this way that I've drawn the
cyclohexane is called a chair

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.420
configuration.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.710
Chair shape.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.730
And it might be obvious.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.620
It looks like a chair.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.740
That's the back of the chair,
this is where you would sit

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.050
down on the chair, and I guess
the back of your calves would

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.570
go against here.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.560
Your knees would sit on it
someplace like that.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.310
That's called the chair
configuration.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.860
Now another configuration that
it could be in is called the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.949
boat configuration.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.150
And so if I were to put this
exact one in the boat

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.630
configuration, if I take it
from a slightly different

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.450
perspective, if I'm looking at
it, kind of, head on, it would

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.700
look something like this in
the boat configuration.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.440
It would look like this.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.710
Now I want to use the purple.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.390
It would look like that.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.770
Now, the first thing you're
probably saying is, Sal, you

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.690
said that the reason why it
looks like this is because

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.000
carbon likes to form these kind
of tetrahedral, or this

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.880
tripod shaped bonds.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.120
I don't see the tripod shaped
bonds either here or here.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.480
Let me draw that boat a little
bit, at least this end of the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.880
boat a little bit better.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.720
There you go.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.610
And you say, well I don't see
that tripod shape over there.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.270
And to see the tripod
shape, you just

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.330
have to draw the hydrogens.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.900
So let me draw some
hydrogens here.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.520
So let me draw a hydrogen
here that will go

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.525
straight down like this.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:16.840
A hydrogen that goes straight
down over here, a hydrogen

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.030
that goes straight up over here,
straight up over here,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.430
straight down over here,
straight up over there.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.420
I've now drawn one hydrogen
on every carbon.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.290
And now let me draw
some hydrogens.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.540
Let me draw a hydrogen here that
goes straight up, not up

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.510
really-- to the side
over here.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.900
So a hydrogen there, let me draw
a hydrogen over here that

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.960
does the same thing.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.415
So those guys have
their hydrogens.

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:53.520
A hydrogen right over here.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.840
And then, let's see, this guy
needs his hydrogens still, so

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.810
he'll have a hydrogen that goes
down like that, and a

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.280
hydrogen and it goes
like that.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.650
And this guy will have a
hydrogen that goes like that.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.230
And when you see it like this,
if you look at any one carbon

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.180
on this molecule, if you look at
any one carbon, you can see

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.430
that's forming the same
tetrahedral shape that has a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.320
tripod at every one.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.410
Over here, you have that close
to, roughly 109 degree, 110

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.290
degree angle between each of
the constituents that are

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.090
bonding to the carbon.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.210
Now, I've drawn the different
hydrogens that are coming off

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.770
of these carbons in different
colors, and I've

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.940
done it for a purpose.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.650
The ones that are going straight
up or straight down,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.160
we call those axial hydrogens.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.460
And the ones I drew in orange
that are kind of going to the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.880
side in some level, we call
these equatorial.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.410
These are equatorial
hydrogens.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.940
And the reason why it's useful
to know that name is when we

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.100
talk about the different
configurations, the different

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.800
chair and boats, whether
something is equatorial or

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.920
axial can change if this were to
flip up, or vice versa, and

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.360
things like that.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.360
And we'll talk more about
that in the next video.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.510
And the reason why they're
called equatorial is if you

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.060
think about it, and it's
sometimes hard to visualize,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.880
this bond right here is parallel
to this bond right

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.640
over there.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.810
And this bond right over here
is parallel to that.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.080
It's parallel, the equatorial
bonds are parallel, to some

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.020
part of the ring.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.390
So that one is parallel to
that right over there.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.020
Actually I should even, I could
even color-code that.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.700
This, well, I don't want
to use that same color.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:44.300
This is parallel to this and
this is parallel to that.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.090
And we could do it for all
the equatorial bonds.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.440
So for example, I don't
want to-- I'm running

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.650
out of colors here.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.840
So this right here is parallel
to this, and this, and that

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.440
over there.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.370
So we could keep doing
it for all of them.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.710
I could do it for the other
set right here.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.060
This guy right here
is parallel to

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.600
that guy over there.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.230
I didn't quite draw it like
that, but hopefully it makes

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.880
the idea clear.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.580
And I'll do one more of
these just to show

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.760
what's parallel to what.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.710
This bond is parallel to that.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.310
So the ones that are parallel to
some part of the ring we're

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.910
calling equatorial.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.990
And the ones that kind of jump
out of the ring, that aren't

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.960
parallel to any other part
of the ring, we're

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.960
calling those axial.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.940
And the way I've drawn it here,
the axials are the ones

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.880
that point up and point
straight up and

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.050
point straight down.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.620
We can do the same thing on
a boat configuration.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.200
Now, one question you might ask
is, well, there's these

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.090
two configurations.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.740
Both of these would result in
tetrahedral type shapes at

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.500
each of the carbons.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.530
In fact, let me draw
it for you.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.540
So this axial hydrogen is
pointing straight down, this

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.370
one is pointing straight down.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.930
Here, this hydrogen is actually
going to point

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.480
straight down because
we flipped it up.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.820
And then over here you would
have a hydrogen point straight

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.180
up, and then one that's
kind of pointing down.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.920
This gives a tripod there.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.520
To have the tripod over here,
you'll have to have a hydrogen

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.540
that points a little bit like
that, one that's pointing a

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.790
little bit like that, along,
well, you can kind of view it

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.870
along the same plane as this
guy would be parallel.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.180
It's hard to see it in
this, but he would

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.760
actually parallel to that.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.060
This guy would be out like this,
and then this guy would

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.240
have an axial hydrogen, and
then he would have one

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.520
equatorial one just like that.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.910
So you could draw the tripod
shapes in either the chair or

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.320
boat configuration.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.820
But one question is, well,
what's more stable?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.820
That's actually one of the main
points of being able to

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.650
visually think about the three
dimensional structure of any

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:47.020
of these hydrocarbons, or in
this case cyclohexane.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.890
So in this situation, we know
from past videos, that all of

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.320
these carbons with their
hydrogens around them, these

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.240
bonds, these have electron
clouds around them.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.130
The electron clouds are
negative, and so they want to

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.780
get as far away from each
other as possible.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.020
In this chair configuration, you
have this carbon up here,

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.750
the ch2 we could consider it,
has two hydrogens and is

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.240
connected to the rest
of the ring.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.410
It's as far as possible from
this ch2 as possible.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.280
So in that situation, we have
a lower potential energy, or

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.780
it is a more stable shape.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.270
Or more stable configuration.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.120
In the boat configuration,
this ch2 up here is much

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.799
closer to this ch2, I mean,
that's really the main

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.210
difference between the two.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.919
And they want to get away
from each other.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.059
They want to repel ech other.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:40.080
So this one will have higher
potential energy, or it will

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.330
be less stable.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.740
So this is just a starting
point of how to visualize

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.900
cyclic hydrocarbons and we'll
use this information in the

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.050
next video to think a little
bit more about, maybe, the

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.420
different chair configurations
that a molecule could have,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.990
and what could be more stable.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.530
In this situation, in the case
of just cyclohexane, the two

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.430
chair configurations
are equally stable.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.320
And let me just touch
on that a second.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.290
So you have, well,
I don't have to--

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.220
actually, let me see.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.250
I won't copy and paste.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.770
I'll just redraw
the other chair

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.420
configuration for this guy.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.520
Actually let me just do it
separately over here because

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.860
I've made the colors
here so confusing.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:26.230
Let me draw two, the same
cyclohexane, but in two

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.790
different chair configurations
that it could

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.790
be equilibrium in.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:34.570
So you could have this one, you
could have this one, so

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.920
this could be one chair
configuration, and I'll draw

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.450
it like this.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.090
And then the same hydrocarbon
could be in-- or the same

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.450
cyclohexane could be in
equilibrium with the this

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.850
other chair configuration
that looks like this.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.800
Let me have a little
more space here.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.655
So it looks like this.

00:09:56.655 --> 00:09:58.050
Let me do the pink.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.640
It goes up like that,
like that.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.544
Let me make sure I'm-- no,
I want to do it actually.

00:10:08.544 --> 00:10:14.940
This pink guy goes like this.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.320
And then the blue guy is going
to be just like this.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.370
So notice, in this situation
this carbon appears kind of at

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.250
the top of the chair, and this
carbon is at the bottom, and

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.210
then they've flipped.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.440
But these are equally stable
configurations.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.500
But one way to think about is
all of the axial guys on this

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.070
carbon here turned into
equatorial on this carbon and

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.900
vice versa on the two.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.640
Let me show it to you.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.270
Let me just draw the hydrogens
on this carbon.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:47.560
This carbon's hydrogens has an
axial hydrogen, and has an

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.040
equatorial hydrogen, whose bond
would be parallel to that

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.320
just like that.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.080
And this guy would have an
equatorial hydrogen whose bond

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.440
is parallel to actually
both of these guys.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.690
And an axial hydrogen.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.690
But when it flips, and I'm
just drawing those guys'

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.190
hydrogens, but when this
structure flips like that,

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.390
what happens?

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:14.330
Well, this hydrogen over here
goes into this position, and

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.720
this yellow hydrogen over here
goes into this position.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.850
So over here, it was
equatorial, and

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.500
now it becomes axial.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.900
The same argument can
be made over here.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.990
This equatorial hydrogen, when
it flips-- when this whole

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.030
blue part flips down--
now becomes axial.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.230
And this axial hydrogen, when
you flip it down, becomes

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.480
equatorial.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.040
And you can actually do that
for all of the hydrogens.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.970
Over here you have an
axial hydrogen.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:53.180
Once you flip it, you have an
axial hydrogen, and then you

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.140
have an equatorial hydrogen.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.050
When you flip it, these
two equatorial

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.970
hydrogens become axial.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.190
So they become axial and then
both of these guys become

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.050
equatorial.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.790
So let me do that in yellow.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.480
Both this guy and this guy
become equatorial So this and

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.830
that become equatorial.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.880
They become parallel
to the other end.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.440
And you could do it for these
two hydrogens, as well.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.990
So that's another interesting
to think about.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.630
And this is really just practice
on visualizing what's

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.610
going on when we when
we visualize--
