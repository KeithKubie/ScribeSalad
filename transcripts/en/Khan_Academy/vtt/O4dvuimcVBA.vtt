00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.670
We spent a couple of videos
naming amines.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.590
In this video, let's actually
see how they might react.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.010
Now, to just kind of understand
what happens with

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.080
an amine, let's study
one in particular.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.200
Let's look at ethylamine.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.070
That's its common name, and
that's obviously going to be a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.140
two-carbon chain, so that's the
ethyl part, connected to a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.320
nitrogen, so that is
the amine part.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.620
And then the nitrogen will
have two other bonds, two

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.980
hydrogens, just like that.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.400
And if you look at the Periodic
Table, so here's our

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.120
Periodic Table right here, you
see nitrogen is in Group 5:

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.510
one, two, three, four, five.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.330
This says Group 15, but we're
going to ignore the transition

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.400
metals for now.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.320
So it has five valence
electrons.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.800
When you look at it, when you
look at the bonds here, you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.050
only see one, two, three
valence electrons.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.430
So there's going to be two more
and they're going to be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.670
in a lone pair, just
like that.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.060
When you also look at the
Periodic Table, you also see

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.080
that nitrogen is pretty
electronegative.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.670
In fact, there's only a few
elements that are more

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.030
electronegative.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940
But remember, electronegativity
is just how

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.200
much does it like to
hog electrons?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.240
So it's more electronegative
than carbon.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.970
It's to the right of carbon
and it's way more

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.200
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.460
So if you compare it, not only
does it have this lone pair of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.558
electrons right here, but it's
also going to hog-- let me do

00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:34.690
it in a different color.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.230
It's also going to hog these
orange electrons that are on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.650
the other side of the bond.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.220
So, as we know, implicitly
there's a

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.690
carbon right over here.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.920
There's another carbon
over here.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.370
There's two hydrogens
over here.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.150
We haven't drawn all
of that stuff.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.170
But it's more electronegative
than everything it's bonded to

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.560
so its also going to attract
those electrons, so it's going

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.955
to have a partial
negative charge.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.720
Let me make it very clear.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.550
The partial negative charge--
that's carbon right there.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.260
The partial negative charge
is at the nitrogen itself.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.550
And you're going to have
slightly partial positive

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.840
charges of the carbons
and the hydrogens,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.310
especially at the hydrogens.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.180
And now if we just talk about
the properties of it, because

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.820
it's polar, this would actually
give it a reasonably

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.690
high melting and
boiling point.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.130
You could imagine, amines when
they are in a solution with

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.570
other amines, they are going
to be attracted essentially

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.750
via this type of hydrogen-type
bonding.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.140
The negative part of partial
negative nitrogens are going

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.590
to be attracted to the partially
positive hydrogens

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.950
of other amines.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.350
Now, the hydrogen bonding for
an amines is not going to be

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.390
as strong as it will be for,
say, waters or alcohols

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.190
because waters and alcohols
involve oxygen, and oxygen is

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.270
even more electronegative
than nitrogen.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.140
So these partial charges
are even stronger.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.450
So that's why hydrogen bonding
is even stronger in the case

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.360
of things that have oxygen in
it like alcohol or water.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.300
Now, with that said,
let's think about

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.990
how this might react.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.470
I have a lone pair over here.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.120
I also have a partial negative
charge because this guy is

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.430
more electronegative.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.200
It seems like we have a lot of
negative action going around

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.250
the nitrogen there.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.430
And because it has that, maybe
it would either like to give

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.450
away electrons or maybe take
hydrogens from other things.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.500
And that, in fact, is the
case with amines.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.540
So in general, and let me
write this down, this is

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.480
ethylamine right here, just so
we get our naming practice.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.700
Ethylamine, this is
the common name.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.110
We just said this is an ethyl
group attached to an amine.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.410
And this is obviously
a primary amine.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.800
It's only attached to one
carbon right here.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.130
But in the case of an amine like
this, and actually out of

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.260
all of the functional groups
we will look at, out of all

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.080
the neutral functional groups we
look at, because of what we

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.670
just described, because it has
this partial negative charge,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.570
it has this lone pair,
the nitrogen's pretty

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.145
electronegative, this is
actually the most basic.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.700
And this isn't just
ethylamine.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.610
This is all amines.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.930
Let me write this down.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:35.090
Amines are the most basic of the
neutral functional groups.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.770
Obviously, something like a
hydroxide anion, it has a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.850
negative charge.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.530
It will want to attract
protons even more.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.130
But this one's pretty good,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.660
considering that it is neutral.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.520
So given that it's basic, and
we'll also say, and it's a

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.220
related notion, it's
also nucleophilic.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.380
And just as a reminder, when
people talk about basicity,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.280
they're talking about how much
does something want to give

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.060
away electrons?

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.380
Or how much does it want
to take protons?

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.560
When you talk about the
nucleophilicity, or how good

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.490
of a nucleophile something is,
it's how good are you at

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.180
giving away electrons?

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.420
Or how good are you at
essentially being attracted to

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.930
protons or giving
away electrons?

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.910
And so when you talk about
basicity, you're talking about

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.010
a thermodynamic property.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.570
When you're talking about
nucleophilicity, you're

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.080
talking about a kinetic
property.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.010
How good is it at interacting?

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.750
The basic tells you how stable
is it once it has interacted.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.490
So given that it's a
nucleophile, you could

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.140
imagine, I think you see where
I might be going with this.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.280
Let me draw the ethylamine
again.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.365
So ethylamine, I'll draw it
in a little bit simpler.

00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:43.220
So let me draw the hydrogens
like that, and then it has

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.570
this lone pair.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.850
Let's think about what might
happen if we have a solution

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.180
of ethylamine.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.210
If we have ethylamine and
it's mixed in with some

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.430
bromoethane.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.850
So that's one, two carbons
right there.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.090
Let me draw the bromo group.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.190
And it might not be obvious
the way I drew this

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.390
bromoethane right here.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.130
Let me write this down.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.380
This is bromoethane.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.280
But I think it will be obvious
if I draw this carbon right

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.040
here and if I draw the other
two hydrogens, which are

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.760
implicitly there.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.150
So that is one hydrogen right
there and then you have

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.130
another hydrogen over here.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.490
And you have a good nucleophile
in the ethylamine.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.260
So what do you think
will happen?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.710
Oh, yeah, I also have a
good leaving group.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.310
So you see I'm talking in the
language of Sn2 reactions.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.170
Or really, I'm talking in the
language of nucleophilic

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.240
substitution reactions, and I'm
going to lean towards the

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.940
Sn2 direction because I have
a primary carbon here, good

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.090
leaving group, pretty
OK nucleophile.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.400
If this was a secondary,
especially if this was a

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.820
tertiary carbon, then I
would be thinking Sn1.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.500
Then I would say, oh, maybe
this leaves on its own.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.620
But in an Sn2, what we're
going to have is, this

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.000
nucleophile will attack or it
will give away its electron,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.590
so it'll give its electron
to this carbon.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.440
And simultaneously, since this
electron is going towards the

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.690
slightly positive, the partially
positive carbon

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:23.020
here, this bromine can finally
take away that carbon's

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.420
electrons, and so we just
experienced an Sn2 reaction.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.210
This is an Sn2 reaction.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.810
And then after that is done,
the bromine will have left.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.700
It has taken this electron.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.740
It already had this
one over here.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.470
It already had that one.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.560
And actually, it had another
six electrons.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.740
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven valence electrons

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.480
for bromine.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.280
Now, it will have eight.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.110
So, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, now it will

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.490
have eight.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.290
It just took this
one right here.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.580
It gained an electron, so it
has a negative charge.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.660
And now let me draw this
part right here.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.760
So we had this carbon,
that carbon.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.440
That hydrogen is sticking--
let me draw it like this.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.660
That hydrogen is sticking
out, just like that.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.850
The other hydrogen
is behind it.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.050
It's bonded to the other
carbon up here.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.520
That's really a CH3.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.140
It has three hydrogens off
of it implicitly there.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.500
And now the ethylamine
has attached to it.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.750
So let me draw that.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.030
So that's the nitrogen.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.620
It's bonded to one, two carbons
just like that.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.690
And then it has a hydrogen, a
hydrogen, and then you have

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.450
this electron is still
with the nitrogen.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:55.890
And then this magenta electron
has been given to the carbon,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.720
just like that.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.440
And since the nitrogen has given
away an electron, it now

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.790
has a positive charge.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.270
So when you think about these
two molecules, this molecule

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.100
now has a positive charge.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.080
This molecule right now
has a negative charge.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.600
So they would actually be
ionically attracted to each

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.100
other, and we've actually
just formed a salt.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.800
And this would be called-- and
this is interesting here, at

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.510
least from a naming
perspective.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.840
You have two ethyl groups.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.150
It might not be completely
clear.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.800
You have one, two carbons
here, and then you have

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.070
another one, two
carbons there.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:34.440
We could re-draw this as-- or
we could rewrite it as NH2.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.880
And then we have two carbons,
and then another two carbons

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.650
just like that.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.950
So we could call this diethyl--
we have one ethyl,

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.880
two ethyls-- so this
is diethyl.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.130
Let me color this.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.110
Let me do it in a different
color here.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.140
So you have an ethyl group right
there, an ethyl group

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.800
right there, so we call this--
this is the common name for

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.560
it-- diethyl.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.410
And then you might want to call
it diethylamine, but it's

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.770
not ammonia or it's not
derivative of ammonia anymore.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.940
It's a derivative of ammonium.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.680
And that's because it's now
positively charged.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.990
This nitrogen now
has four bonds.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.240
So this is diethylammonium.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.830
Diethylammonium is this
molecule right here.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.850
And if you view it as a salt,
and a salt is just an

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.220
ionically-- well, I don't want
to go into the definition

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.330
completely of a salt, but you
view this as a salt because

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.940
it's a ionically bonded
molecule, where one of the

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.450
molecules is diethylammonium,
the other one will be bromide.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.725
This is the bromide
anion right here.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:46.020
And you always list the cation
first, the positive charged

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:52.480
first. So this is
diethylammonium bromide, which

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.450
we were able to form with
the Sn2 reaction between

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.690
ethylamine or ethylamine
and bromoethane.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.550
Now, we can now go under
another step here.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.560
If we have a ton of this
ethylamine floating around, if

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.730
we have an excess, and early on
we will have a lot more of

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.250
that than we will have of this
thing right here, if we have a

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.760
ton of ethylamine floating
around-- let me draw some

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.350
ethylamine.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.600
If we have a ton of the
ethylamine floating around, it

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.590
might be able to grab one of
the hydrogens from the

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.650
diethylammonium over here.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.190
So you could imagine
a situation

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.055
where it grabs a hydrogen.

00:11:33.055 --> 00:11:35.860
It essentially gives its
electron to the hydrogen, and

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.460
then that hydrogen's
electron can be

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.560
taken back by the nitrogen.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.360
And I'll draw this as an
equilibrium because it's not

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.480
really that much more likely
that this guy takes away that

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.735
guy's electron than that guy can
go and take the electron

00:11:51.735 --> 00:11:53.850
back, so it's a reversible
reaction.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.050
But if that were to happen, then
this guy, this guy right

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.490
over here, will then
look like this.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.510
You have the ethyl group bonded
to a nitrogen that only

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.020
has one hydrogen on it.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.000
Let me just draw it like this.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.610
A nitrogen that only has
one hydrogen on it.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.990
And then he's bonded
to another ethyl

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.680
group right over there.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.290
And now he has his-- so if you
view this as an electron right

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.470
there, he has his lone pair.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.730
So he took that-- it looks like
yellow ochre, just kind

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.610
of a yellow-green color-- took
that back from the hydrogen

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.880
and is now neutral, got
an electron back.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.225
So now, this is just
diethyl ammonia.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:49.730
Actually, no.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.110
I'm sorry.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.290
It wouldn't be diethyl
ammonia.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.560
It would be diethylamine.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.730
Sorry about that.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.280
Let me erase that.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.530
This would be diethylamine.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.280
It would be ammonia.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.880
Ammonia is just NH-- let
me draw it like this.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.930
Ammonia, just to make things
clear, is this, and that's why

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.740
my brain was telling
us to go ammonia.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.320
And then ammonium is this.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.430
Give away one of these electrons
to a hydrogen

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.240
proton, you have a
positive charge.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.220
Now, when you do the common
naming, when it's kind of

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.070
ammonium derivative, you
do say diethylammonium.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.020
And then my brain said, OK,
now that we got rid of the

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.360
hydrogen, I went back to
ammonia, so I said diethyl

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.150
ammonia, but that's wrong.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.930
Obviously, this is now an amine,
so we used the common

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.210
naming for amines, and we get
back to diethylamine.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:53.110
And then this guy over here will
turn into ethylammonium.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.350
Sorry for all the confusion.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:14:00.030
So this guy over here is a
nitrogen, two hydrogens, ethyl

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.660
group, and then he grabbed
another hydrogen.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.870
So he grabbed this hydrogen
over here.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.560
So now he has a positive charge
since he gave away that

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.420
electron over there.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.670
So now he is ethylammonium.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.970
But this is reversible
right here.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.050
But what you can see, through
this Sn2 reaction, we were

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.040
able to essentailly, get rid of
one of these hydrogens and

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.010
substitute it with another
ethyl group.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.640
We went from having a primary
amine-- this is bonded to one

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.420
carbon-- to having
a secondary amine

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.170
through this Sn2 reaction.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.790
It's bonded to two carbons.
