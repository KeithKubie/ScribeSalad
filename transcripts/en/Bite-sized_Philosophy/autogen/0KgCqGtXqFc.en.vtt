have been bad I think I think the fact

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
have been bad I think I think the fact
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.590
have been bad I think I think the fact
that you sat there and you just said no

you're asking good questions and you
know the fact that you're asking good

know the fact that you're asking good
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.970
know the fact that you're asking good
questions demonstrates the invalidity of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
questions demonstrates the invalidity of
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400

one of the things I've been meditating
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979
one of the things I've been meditating
on for the last years there's a line in

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

think okay what they are you supposed to
do that why it's like because it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
do that why it's like because it's
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279
do that why it's like because it's
really a difficult thing to figure out

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
really a difficult thing to figure out
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.260
really a difficult thing to figure out

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
do you really mean that you don't resist
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.990
do you really mean that you don't resist
evil well there's a couple of problems

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
evil well there's a couple of problems
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.780
evil well there's a couple of problems
is if you punch back then you have a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
is if you punch back then you have a
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.160
is if you punch back then you have a
fight well but you can't just not defend

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
fight well but you can't just not defend
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140
fight well but you can't just not defend
yourself like weakly you can't be weak

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
yourself like weakly you can't be weak
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.210
yourself like weakly you can't be weak
and not defend yourself but you can be

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
and not defend yourself but you can be
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.380
and not defend yourself but you can be
strong and defend yourself minimally and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
strong and defend yourself minimally and
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.539
strong and defend yourself minimally and
that's a real art like that's that's the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
that's a real art like that's that's the
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399
that's a real art like that's that's the
essence of sophistication I would say

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
essence of sophistication I would say
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859
essence of sophistication I would say
and like I'm not you know I come from

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
and like I'm not you know I come from
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510
and like I'm not you know I come from
kind of a rough place I've come from

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
kind of a rough place I've come from
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.830
kind of a rough place I've come from
northern Alberta I come from the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
northern Alberta I come from the
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810
northern Alberta I come from the
frontier you know and my town was

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
frontier you know and my town was
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.550
frontier you know and my town was
scraped out of the bloody Prairie 50

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
scraped out of the bloody Prairie 50
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499
scraped out of the bloody Prairie 50
years before people moved before before

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
years before people moved before before
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.440
years before people moved before before
I lived there and so it's it's been and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450
I lived there and so it's it's been and
 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.730
I lived there and so it's it's been and
it's been a continual challenge to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
it's been a continual challenge to
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.590
it's been a continual challenge to
adjust my sophistication to the level of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
adjust my sophistication to the level of
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.539
adjust my sophistication to the level of
challenge and I've I'm trying to do that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
challenge and I've I'm trying to do that
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340
challenge and I've I'm trying to do that
and do you think but I don't always

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
and do you think but I don't always
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.440
and do you think but I don't always
manage it yeah so to that point do you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
manage it yeah so to that point do you
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.410
manage it yeah so to that point do you
think that we sometimes actually at a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
think that we sometimes actually at a
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.170
think that we sometimes actually at a
deep level use identity politics against

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
deep level use identity politics against
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.999
deep level use identity politics against
ourselves in in this regard so you're

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
ourselves in in this regard so you're
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.440
ourselves in in this regard so you're
sitting across from Kathy she's female

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
sitting across from Kathy she's female
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.920
sitting across from Kathy she's female
yeah at some level do you think you may

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
yeah at some level do you think you may
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.229
yeah at some level do you think you may
be moderated it because of that because

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
be moderated it because of that because
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.449
be moderated it because of that because
had it been a male you know and you and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
had it been a male you know and you and
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.070
had it been a male you know and you and
you talked about this often that we have

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
you talked about this often that we have
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.350
you talked about this often that we have
to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
to
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.970
to
differently towards males and females

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
differently towards males and females
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.080
differently towards males and females
and there's a physical there's physical

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090
and there's a physical there's physical
 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.820
and there's a physical there's physical
reasons for that and biological reasons

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830
reasons for that and biological reasons
 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.650
reasons for that and biological reasons
for that but that had she been a male

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660
for that but that had she been a male
 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.170
for that but that had she been a male
say say the same exact age from you from

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180
say say the same exact age from you from
 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.600
say say the same exact age from you from
Alberta yeah all of that that perhaps

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610
Alberta yeah all of that that perhaps
 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.490
Alberta yeah all of that that perhaps
your response might have been a little

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
your response might have been a little
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
your response might have been a little
more forceful even even though you're

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
more forceful even even though you're
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.390
more forceful even even though you're
we're all agreeing your response was

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
we're all agreeing your response was
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.000
we're all agreeing your response was
done correctly yeah and even handedly

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
done correctly yeah and even handedly
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.150
done correctly yeah and even handedly
yeah well I it's hard to say but

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
yeah well I it's hard to say but
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.150
yeah well I it's hard to say but
probably yes that's interesting well

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
probably yes that's interesting well
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.010
probably yes that's interesting well
because you did like I can't I don't

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020
because you did like I can't I don't
 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.250
because you did like I can't I don't
think that you can say that you fight

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260
think that you can say that you fight
 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.990
think that you can say that you fight
with a woman the same way that you fight

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000
with a woman the same way that you fight
 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.910
with a woman the same way that you fight
with a man that doesn't mean you can't

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920
with a man that doesn't mean you can't
 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.350
with a man that doesn't mean you can't
fight with a woman doesn't mean you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
fight with a woman doesn't mean you
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.420
fight with a woman doesn't mean you
shouldn't but I don't think the rules

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430
shouldn't but I don't think the rules
 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.550
shouldn't but I don't think the rules
are the same now why are the rules

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
are the same now why are the rules
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.230
are the same now why are the rules
different well some of the rules are

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240
different well some of the rules are
 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.350
different well some of the rules are
there's a physical limit it's much more

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360
there's a physical limit it's much more
 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.230
there's a physical limit it's much more
stringent right I mean there's a level

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240
stringent right I mean there's a level
 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.370
stringent right I mean there's a level
of hinting at physical threat that you

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380
of hinting at physical threat that you
 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.260
of hinting at physical threat that you
can bring to bear in a conversation

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270
can bring to bear in a conversation
 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.000
can bring to bear in a conversation
between men that you cannot bring to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
between men that you cannot bring to
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.590
between men that you cannot bring to
bear in a conversation with a woman

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600
bear in a conversation with a woman
 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.830
bear in a conversation with a woman
mm-hmm so and the mech mechanics of that

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840
mm-hmm so and the mech mechanics of that
 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140
mm-hmm so and the mech mechanics of that
are very very subtle and difficult and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150
are very very subtle and difficult and
 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.940
