Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. So as we said were, most of the lectures nowadays are about carbonyl chemistry and in particular today we're going to talk about [inaudible] means the nitrogen analog of a carbonyl group and ina means, which you'll see are closely related to those. And then get onto the general topic of oxidation reduction and how it applies in organic chemistry. And in its simplest case where it involves electron transfer. In the unlikely event we have any time we'll review Nmr a little bit at the end. Bear in mind, this isn't on the exam Friday, but it will be on the final. Okay. We talked last time about a ketone going to an mean. So you have an amine, it's unshared. Pair is a nucleophile to attack Pi Star, put a proton, then I'll take a proton off the nitrogen onto the oxygen minus. You get this carbon Ola mean, and then the unshared pair allows you to lose hydroxide,

Speaker 2:          01:01          right?

Speaker 1:          01:02          So you get this cad ion and a minium ion protonated amine and hydroxide, but the hydroxide can take the proton away. Okay? So that's how you make emotions. And we mentioned that last time. The amine is the nitrogen analog of a carbonyl group.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:23          the n the equilibrium constant for this, however, is unfavorable. It lies toward the starting ketone, but there are some cases where the equilibrium lies the other way. For example, with Oih as the r group, it lies toward the right that's called an oxy or when this complicated thing is used as the amine, the equilibrium lies to the right and that's called a two four Denitra fennel hydra zone or a two four d n p derivative. And these things were really important before Nmr came along. And, and, and I are to allow you to characterize compounds because you had these, these, uh, uh, ketone liquids typically that were very difficult to, to, uh, to deal with. But if you treated them with hydroxyl amine at the top or two for die nitrile fennel hydrazine at the bottom, they created the AUC seem or the two for DNP derivatives, which were easy to crystallize and gave nice sharp melting points.

Speaker 1:          02:25          So there were tables of all different ketones and what their oxygen's melted at and what they're two, four d and p derivatives melted. At. So you've made a couple of these derivatives beige or their melting point, and then you knew what ketone you had if you didn't have Nmr to help you out. So these were very important and you'll see that that such, uh, compounds, this kind of in mean is important in, in, uh, biology as well. Now, why do these equilibria right? Lie to the right when with an [inaudible] group at lies to the left.

Speaker 2:          02:57          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:58          so let's think about, we have an unshared pair here on the, uh, on the group that's attached to nitrogen where we don't have an unshared pair here. How might that help the equilibrium lie to the right? How might it stabilize the products? The fact that you have an a mean which has a Hetero atom with an unshared pair next door. What special stability might you get on the right from that, that you wouldn't get on the left? Anybody got an idea? What's good about this compound? Having an unshared pair here attached to the Amine, Matt, you got an idea? Sure. You got the Pi Star here and it can overlap with that. So you get special stability on there, right? It's uh, it's our Lilly, the, the unshared pair is adjacent to the, uh, to the, uh, double bond. So you got special stability on the right. Now how about on the left does heavy the unshared pair on the left to make any difference that would help the reaction go to the right,

Speaker 3:          04:07          right.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Is there any reason it should be unstable to have that unshared pair adjacent to the nitrogen on the left?

Speaker 3:          04:14          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Bear in mind that the nitrogen itself has an unshared pair. What if they overlap

Speaker 3:          04:24          right?

Speaker 1:          04:25          If you have to occupied orbitals come together, they mix up and down, but up more than down the unshared pairs repel one another, right? So the, so it's unstable on the left because of the overlap of unshared pairs. So both of these factors shift the equilibrium toward being stable as, as it means as oxy or two for dinitrogen mental hydra zone. Now, there are other cases where, uh, it means a very important, for example, uh, in the olden days when, when it was difficult to separate compounds, uh, it's still can be difficult to separate compounds, but there are a lot more techniques nowadays with fancy chromatic graphic techniques for example. But Gerard developed this, uh, this reagent which is you see one of these things that has an unshared pair next to the nitrogen, so it'll make a nice strong in mean a stable, I mean, and it could be reacted for example, with a ketone in cortisone or a steroid hormone, right, to make it soluble in water. So without Gerard's reagent t it would be dissolved in, in, uh, in, it would dissolve when you do an extraction it would be in the organic layer, but if you add Gerard's reagent, it goes into the water layer. So you can separate it from other things that would go into the one or the other of those layers. How does that work? Why does you ards reagent make the ketone soluble in water?

Speaker 3:          05:57          What,

Speaker 1:          05:59          what's the nature of the polarity? It's more of that polarity polarity is having, is having something to sty polar plus here on minus here, right? It's much more so than that. This reagent has a charge that you can't get rid of, right? Cause there that nitrogen has for Al Keel groups on it so it can't lose a proton and get rid of its charge. So once this is hooked on to here, the molecule is permanently a cad. I am, right? So then it dissolves in water. It's like a cat, a cat, ionic Emmy, a hydra zone. That is the hydro zone is those things that have nitrogen, nitrogen, double bond, right? Carbon. Okay. So there's a, there's another example of the importance of Ibi. Now you remember this slide that you've been reviewing for the test about, about chromophores, but let's just now focused on this part down at the bottom.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Notice that it's the end mean that holds the Chroma for the thing that's going to be colored that conjugated system onto a protein to make Rhodopsin. So that's what holds Retina Aldehyde. This was originally an Aldehyde with an oxygen on here, but it get formed and [inaudible] and got held to the protein. So it functions the way it's supposed to do in your eye. Okay. It means are also important in the synthesis of amino acids, particularly in the, in the uh, an originally in the technique developed by out off Stryker. Stryker was, uh, was a student and an assistant in a later in, um, in leaving slab in Giessen we talked about last time, but in 1854, he figured out how to make the amino acid alanine by starting with acid Aldehyde, reacting it with moaning fluoride and potassium cyanide. Now let's figure out how that happens. First to react, the ammonia of ammonium chloride, which is an equilibrium of course with ammonium chloride, uh, with the Keith with the Aldehyde to make an mean. Okay. Then what's going to happen next do you think given the reagents you have there, another reagent comes in, the reagent that comes in is cyanide. What we'll sign cyanide I do with an Emmy cyanides and an ion a nucleophile. It's a special nucleophile cause its nucleus like at carbon. So at carbon has a high homo on that, then cyanide. So where's it going to attack Cassie?

Speaker 1:          08:37          The Pi Star are the, I mean it would also attack the ketone if you had the ketone there. Okay. So the cyanide comes down to tax the amine, uh, that makes a negative charge on the nitrogen when you formed a bond. But you could put a proton on there, right? So you get this compound, okay, now it that, that's the first stage. Then you add strong acid and heated up hydrochloric acid and water and heat it up. Now you protonate the nitrogen, the unshared pair on the nitrogen with the acid and now water can attack the the cat. I had to give this and lose a proton. But now notice you have another sort of him being like thing, carbon, nitrogen, double bond. And we already know that that can react with water, right? To deliberate ammonia. We look, the very first step was the same reaction, going the opposite direction, taking the carbon neo off, putting the nitrogen on to make a new me.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Now we put an oxygen on, pulled the nitrogen off, right? And that's Alanine. So he was able to make that in 50 to 60% yield this way. So such a high yield from VF, such very simple compounds, suggests to a lot of people that this could be involved in the origin of life. There are people who get into, into discussions and debates about how life might've begun. One thing you need is amino acids. This could have provided amino acids without any, uh, extraordinary, uh, uh, requirements in terms of starting materials and complicated mechanisms. Okay. And notice as in passing here that this is an important thing that our c n triple a night trial, carbon nitrogen triple bond gives our COO h. So you could make carboxylic acids by first using carbon as a nucleophile because the carbon is an ana, the cyanide is an anti.

Speaker 1:          10:32          And so it can displace a haylight do these other things, right? And then you can change it into a, into a carboxylic acid group. So that's a handy thing and synthesis, which is exemplified here. Now, it's not only in the laboratory that this kind of thing happens where you go through any of mean here's an imaging of being used in a biosynthetic scheme to make the, to make the amino acid glutamic acid. So it's the same deal as before. You have, you have ammonia and you have Nadh, which we talked about last time we talked about in terms of nuclear affiliate, aromatic substitution. Okay. And of course there are enzymes that control this whole thing. L glutamate dehydrogenase is that is the one that does it. Okay. So first the ammonia reacts and gives the mean and then the [inaudible], then, uh, uh, uh, then you, uh, protonate the nitrogen.

Speaker 1:          11:30          So you have a car, carbon cad ion, and now the Nadh gets into the act because you remember Nad h was nad plus two, which h minus had been added. If you go back and review that, you'll see it. So it can, it can go the other way too. It can give up h minus and make Nad plus. So now the h minus can come down in the tack that carbon, right? And you have glutamic acid. And this is not for mammals and essential amino acids. They don't have to get it in their diet because they run this scheme themselves, right? So they make it, they make it inside themselves using El glutamate dehydrogenase. Now that's an interesting, uh, name for the enzyme that does this. Because notice what we've done is that the enzyme using the Nadh actually hydrogenated this, it puts h two on a chair and a chair, right?

Speaker 1:          12:28          The first stage came in as a proton, and then the key one came in from up here as h minus. But what you might call this, uh, Alpha Keto glutaric acid, hydrogen A's, right? The thing that does this, why is it called dehydrogenase? Because a catalyst bakes, the reaction go faster in either direction and it was first studied in the direction where it goes from bottom right, bottom left to top, right, right? So it's called dehydrogenase. But the catalyst just makes the transformation happen in either direction. Okay. Now, once you have an amino acid light glutamic acid that we got last time, then you could make other amino acids by what's called Trans Amination. So you have a compound like this that has a ketone in it that reacts with that Amino Group to form an Emmy. Right? And then this thing ultimately comes apart to go back to the alpha-ketoglutarate Rick acid.

Speaker 1:          13:30          So you sacrifice having made glutamic acid, having made this amino acid, but you get back Alanine, the one that's ch three here, c h and h two right now. What was the key step once you formed this form? This [inaudible], what had to happen in order to make it unzip to make alanine and go back to the Quito glutaric acid notice in this first step, we've made this double bond. Obviously if we had the double bond here and a single bond here, then if we undid the double bond by adding water, we'd put the key tone at the top carbon up here. Right? And we have the a amino acid at the bottom. So what's key is to move the double bond from here to here and the single bond from top to bottom. Right. What kind of rearrangement is that? Can you think of a name for a rearrangement like that?

Speaker 3:          14:36          Amy Did you say for somebody said, Oh, I should. It's an outlet for you arrangement.

Speaker 1:          14:42          All right, where are you? Say Take off this, this proton, which is adjacent to the double bonds and put it on down here. Okay, so that's called Trans Amination. So again, many other amino acids are not essential. You don't have to get them in your diet because you could. There you have the enzymes that help make it by transamination. Okay? Now, does anybody recognize what this fragment is? It's a fragment of a much bigger molecule. You know what the bigger molecule is?

Speaker 2:          15:11          Pardon me? I heard someone say something, Dna

Speaker 1:          15:17          change the DNA. It's a bunch of, it's here. Here's a stick diagram of it, and it's a bunch of cs in a row, okay? But let's just look at that bit in the middle there. All right, and let's, uh, uh, break the chain here, these phosphates. And uh, and so we'll make these o's into ohs here,

Speaker 2:          15:40          right?

Speaker 1:          15:40          So there's the key thing that's in the chain. Now, there's an interesting functional group there that's called Hemi Ama. Now that functional group, so it has a nitrogen. And an oxygen on the carbon.

Speaker 2:          16:00          Right.

Speaker 1:          16:01          Can you, does that remind you of any other functional groups?

Speaker 2:          16:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:08          What would the oxygen analog be if you had, instead of the nitrogen and oxygen,

Speaker 1:          16:18          what would it be? Yeah, it would be an asset towel. Right? And you can see then you could take it apart. The way you're taking an asset, tell apart you have an haven't a carbon eel and here an Nh when you would have an alcohol and o h if it were the oxygen analog. So you have a sugar and the basis it's called, right. But if that base, we're an alcohol instead and then reverse the reaction, you'd make a key towel. So the DNA is a whole bunch of essentially key towels. They're called Hemi aminals cause it's at Ama now would be two nitrogens, Akita, Alice, two oxygens, a Hemi am unal is a nitrogen and an oxygen. So you have a whole bunch of these essentially key towels so that you know, that's a protecting group for a sugar. Right? So in a sense, DNA as a protecting group for sugars, although it has other uses as well. Okay. Now you can also get what's called Alpha substitution via a really a relative of, of the amine called INA mean. Okay, so here we saw before you take the amine, you've put it together to get the, uh, m and l or the, the Carbon Ola mean you have the unshared Perry, you can lose hydroxide and you get here and remember what happened before the, Ooh, mine is took off a proton to make an [inaudible]. Now you can't do that. Can you see why you can't make an amine? Why can't

Speaker 4:          17:49          you make an Emmy in here,

Speaker 2:          17:56          Chris?

Speaker 4:          17:59          The domain is the carbon nitrogen double bond, but without the charge, right? Cause you've lost the Proton, but there's no proton on the nitrogen, right? Because we've started with a secondary amine, one that has to our groups on it. So you don't have the Proton to take off from the ammonium ion, right? But you do have that Proton on the carbon. And notice that's in the Alpha position adjacent to the double bond. And this is very much like a ketone. In fact, it's very reactive because the n plus makes that double bond even more. Uh, even a lower Lumo the Pi Star, right? So it's something that's going to be able to stabilize and electron pair if you pull that Proton off, okay, so you, you do that, the proton gets pulled off by the hydroxide and you have this, which is now called an Ian. I mean it's like an Ian.

Speaker 4:          18:55          All right. Now you can make that in a 90% yield by driving the equilibrium to the right by removing the water, which was the product you just made. So you distill out the water, then you can get a very high a yield of this ina mean, which it was shown to be a very useful synthetic intermediate. And the reason it's useful is the unshared pair can get involved in making that carbon nuclear fillic. Remember we just said that cyanide is an important synthetic intermediate because it has a carbon that's a nucleophile that can attack another carbon form of carbon carbon bond in the striker synthesis of the amino acid. We saw that, right? But here's another one that can do, can, can function as a nucleophile to make new carbon carbon bonds. Uh, for example, it can react with an acid chloride, right? So it adds addition, uh, association, and then dissociation of the chloride, right?

Speaker 4:          19:59          And puts an ACL group on the, on the Alpha position. Now you can bring water in, right? And reverse the formation of the, of the, uh, ammonium ion, right? And you get what you see there is a Beta die ketone. It's two ketone groups, not, not adjacent to one another, not alpha, but next adjacent with a carbon in between a Beta die ketone. So if you want to synthesize a Beta die ketone, you can use this reaction. And in fact, when our is a c five chain, uh, this was done in 70% yield. Okay? Uh, that process is called stork. Ina Mean Acla nation ACL. Remember is our c double bond o. So put our c double bond o on the Alpha position of a ketone. So if you want, you want the carbon eel grew up here, you can do make the ENM mean, then react with an ACL chloride.

Speaker 4:          20:59          Okay? But that's not the only thing you can attack with that carbon nucleophile. You could attack RCL right? Then that puts an art group on the Alpha position, right? Bring in water and hydrolyze it and you get that. And when our is fennel ch two Benzel, there's a 50 55% yield of that purified compound was obtained, right? But that's not an ACL elation that anymore. You're putting our on not RCO. This is an alkylation. So this is called the stork eno mean ow culation and there's a much fancier kind of calculation that was done in all these are in the same paper. If you have an Alpha Beta unsaturated key tone, so a conjugated ketone right now you can attack not just not the carbon that has the double bond o on it, but you can attack adjacent to it right to the next, to the terminal double bond there, and then form this.

Speaker 4:          22:02          So it would form first that he analyte. Then since the inlay could be on the Alpha position, Proton come in and you've got that compound so you can put that fancier Al Kill Group on, uh, bring in water, get rid of the helping group there. And you have this dye ketone now, um, this, these are called stork. The reason they're called stork is not because of the bird, but because of Gilbert's stork shown on the left there who was the phd adviser of my neighbor. Uh, Fred Ziegler, who teaches chem two 20. Uh, uh, and in fact Storch was a graduate or uh, uh, Ziegler was a graduate student in storks lab just at the time this work was being done. So when I went to talk to him about getting permission to use this picture and the slideshow, uh, he told me some lore about it that I wasn't aware of that I think is interesting for you to know.

Speaker 4:          23:01          So here, remember that there's a lot, there's an enormous amount of lord that you just have to be around the way Ziegler was around or to have used these things in order to know. So here was this, we showed this 70% yield of the free del Cra, the stork, Acla Asian. Right? But in fact, what, uh, uh, Ziegler pointed out to me is to do this, you need to equivalence of the enemy, not just one. Now why do you need two equivalents rather than just one mole per mole of the, of the ACL? Haylight because the first product, remember before you got rid of this helping group, uh, from the Itam mean was that, and that's a super

Speaker 1:          23:46          carbon steel group, which means that that hydrogen is Alpha both to this one and this carbon yield group. So what property should that hydrogen have? Unusual property. Pardon me? It's very acidic. The anti on will be very strongly stabilized, right? So it'll be easy for it to dissociate to give h plus right? Now, can you think of anything that would be a base in here?

Speaker 1:          24:18          Notice we identified the INA mean as a nuclear file, but nuclear files are also basic, right? So this product transfers a proton to a mole of Edo mean, right? So that uses a second enemy and up. So you need to have them if you want to get the reaction to go. Otherwise, the first half of the product chews up the rest of the starting material, right? But there's a cheaper way to do it, which is to put in some other base that can eat up the proton. So in fact, they use triethylamine is added in to soak up the h plus. Okay. And that wasn't the only bit of Lore Ziegler told me about, uh, this, if you go to Wikipedia and looked up, uh, you know, me and alkylation, you'll get this as an example of what the product is. But in fact, that's not the product. The product is this in 71% yield from doing this reaction. So where in the world did that come from?

Speaker 1:          25:25          Well, remember before we hydrolyze that it was in that form a supercar video type of group, right? And now here, that carbon is Alpha to the carbon eel. So you can make an eternal eight there. So now this carbon and I n can attack Pi Star at that carbon. So you form a bond from here to here. Now, of course, in order to reach, you have to flop this over 180 degrees. Okay? So if you do that, then you get this, right? This is the new bond that was formed to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen, right? But notice with this, you can make an anti in there. Take a proton off. It's a, it's an analyte. Where did the, where would the proton go?

Speaker 2:          26:17          Okay,

Speaker 1:          26:17          go on the nitrogen here. Right? And now we have a leaving group and a nucleophile and that's the product, right? Elimination from that compound. So that's another bit of Lore that you don't get. What? Wikipedia. Yeah, it's, you get what stork founding in 1963. Okay. Now, uh, that's what we want to say

Speaker 4:          26:44          about him means and now onto oxidation and reduction. Now this the most straight forward kind of oxidation reduction oxidation. Where did the word come from?

Speaker 3:          26:57          What does oxidation originally who thought of the term oxidation oxygen. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          27:16          the idea that oxygen made things acidic.

Speaker 3:          27:21          Shayla did,

Speaker 4:          27:22          yeah, Shayla discovered some of those things, but the name came from France, came to the blood loss. His colleagues. Okay. So oxidation was reaction with oxygen, right? Which made things acidic. Where did the word reduction come from? What's the reduced? What does reduce mean?

Speaker 3:          27:41          Right?

Speaker 4:          27:41          Duco do Caray and Latin means to lead. So to it is to lead back again. So you've gone to oxidation, you've put oxygen on to something and then you reduce it, you lead it back to what it was originally, take the oxygen off. When do you think that term originated in? Where would, where in technology would you be involved in removing oxygen from some material?

Speaker 3:          28:12          It's very old. Thousands of years.

Speaker 4:          28:19          You take a metal oxide, treat it with a reducing agent, carbon pull the oxygen, often make CO2 and you're left with the metal. That's how you get metal from metallic whores iron for example. Okay. So that's what reduces. Okay. But nowadays we understand that in terms of electron transfer, right? To oxidize something is to remove electrons from it to reduce it as to put electrons on and that those actual reactions occur in organic chemistry. For example, metals are something that are often used as reducing agents like solid magnesium and an owl keel. Haylight can take an electron. Where would the electron go in Meth into methyl bromide? If you took an electron out of magnesium,

Speaker 3:          29:09          where's the low Lumo Antonia, right?

Speaker 4:          29:16          Darcy CBR. So we have reduction sigma star. So an electron comes out, we get out of the metal. So the metal has lost, the, has lost an electron and the Ch ch three Br is gained one. What will that, how will that change the properties of methyl bromide having an extra electron in Sigma Star?

Speaker 3:          29:40          In what sense? Reactive. What specific bond will change? What do you call sigma star one kind of more? Well, why do you call an antibiotic? Because it usually breaks last attraction. So what's going to happen? So the Bob Burns,

Speaker 4:          30:09          alright, so you get c h three. Dot. There were three electrons in that sigma and Sigma Star. Two and sigma, one in Sigma Star. So now those three electrons or a pair on bromine, bromide and a single electron radical od on nothing, right? Uh, now you can get, uh, the magnesium Adam comes out or May, uh, uh, uh, and, and reacts with the, uh, methyl radical to give, uh, to give the methyl magnesium bromide. And that's called the green yar reagent and it behaves a lot like you might expect ch three minus to behave. It's a carbon nucleophile and it's a, it's a strong base, right? Of course. It's not really ch three minus. It's actually the, the, a sigma bond, the sigma pair of electrons in here. But because of the magnesium is not, uh, is so high in energy, it's orbitals. This is an unusually high homo and we've talked about it before and lithium can do the same thing that magnesium did here. Okay. Green Yard got a very early Nobel prize, not a 19 eight or something like this because it, because it was so useful to have ways to make Al Keel nuclear files in synthesis. Okay. 1912. Pardon me. He got the Nobel prize. Okay. Now another example is a ketone. So you can, it can react with magnesium. Now where will the electron go? Roll. What are you saying?

Speaker 3:          31:44          What's the, what's the low low low acid?

Speaker 4:          31:49          Put an electron in Pi Star. Okay. So now we can write that as a charge on oxygen and the radical on carbon. It doesn't break the bond because there was a double bond to begin with. So it's just the s but we went down to a single bond. Now, okay, now you can do that with another, uh, acetone on the surface of the magnesium and get that. And now you have magnesium double plus between them, right? But now since the two are attached to the same magnesium, the radicals can react with one another, right? To make a bond. And if you then add water to put protons on the Ohs, right? You can get pinnacle. And this is called the pinnacle reduction, right? And we've seen before that if you treat pin a call with h plus, you'll get Pinnock alone.

Speaker 4:          32:47          So here are two examples of reducing an organic compound, actually by electron transfer, right? But much more often in organic chemistry. We're not talking about actual electron transfers, we're just using it as a bookkeeping scheme right now. What do we want to keep books about? We, we arbitrarily assigned shared electron pairs. We know from last semester the nature of a bond and how electron pairs get shared. But for bookkeeping purposes, we pretend that if there's a bond between two different atoms, it's an ionic bond and those two electrons for bookkeeping purposes, even though they're practically 50, 50 shared, we assign them to the more electronegative as the two elements. There's nothing realistic about, this is just the scheme for bookkeeping, but it turns out to be handy as you will see. So let's look at these at these two comp, these two at the ketone and the alcohol here, and let's figure out what the oxidation states of the various atoms are.

Speaker 4:          33:59          Right? So let's start. Uh, so we're just doing bookkeeping here and I'll tell you why. It's because it will be very helpful in choosing reagents or remembering reagents, right? Because we've classified reagents as homos and Lumos and what they can react with. But there's a completely different way of classifying reagents, not as having unusually high homos are unusually low lumos or both or neither. But you can classify them as to whether they're oxidizing or reducing agents. And a good reason. So you have lots of, when you think of, I need to make a transformation from here to here, I'd have to choose the reagent. It could be very helpful if you can exclude two thirds of the reagents and think only about the others, or if you're trying to design a new reagent to design it sensibly so that it could plausibly give this transformation, right?

Speaker 4:          34:56          So you can think about homos and lumos would we do do that. When we tried to think, for example, for a ketone, we'd think of having a high homo to attack the carbon eel or a little Lumo like a proton to protonate the oxygen. That's mechanistic thought, but we can throw out two thirds of the candidates if we think about oxidation and reduction. So that's why this bookkeeping scheme is handy. So let's look first at this carbon and I'll get, I'll start you out here. Okay. So this carbon has a bond to carbon. Now that's a carbon carbon bond, right? So one electron came from the carbon. We're talking about. One came from the other carbon, but we now split it. 50 50 cents said the electronegativity. So this carbon neither lost nor gained in electron by forming the carbon carbon bond. But it also formed three bonds to hydrogen.

Speaker 4:          35:47          Now carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, right? So those three pairs, each of them has one electron that came from carbon. One Electron came from hydrogen, but for bookkeeping purposes, we assigned them to carbon. So now carbon has three electrons that it didn't come in with, right? It came in with four shared one with another carbon bookkeeping. Keep that one, but not the other one. Made three bonds to hydrogen. Get an electron from each of those so that carbon has an oxidation state of minus three is everybody. See how we did that? Okay, so if we see that, now tell me what the next carbon is. What should its oxidation State v

Speaker 3:          36:33          Roy second car.

Speaker 4:          36:38          Then from the left.

Speaker 3:          36:39          Yeah. What box does it too?

Speaker 4:          36:44          How many carbon carbon bonds.

Speaker 3:          36:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          36:57          carbon carbon bonds. Both of them split the electrons since it's the same element. So what should its oxidation

Speaker 3:          37:02          level? B. Z. Okay. How about the next one? [inaudible] carbon to bonds. To oxygen. Yeah. And those electrons go to who? Those went to oxygen.

Speaker 4:          37:25          Those two electrons of carbon went to oxygen. So what's the carbon

Speaker 3:          37:29          plus? Okay. How about the next carbon [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          37:41          again, like the methyls on the left. Okay, now let's look at the right. That one's minus three. How about the next one? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          37:50          that's zero. How do you, how would you answer so quickly here? Right? So that one zero. How about the next one? Zero. Zero because it was minus one with respect to the hydrogen, but plus one with respect to the oxygen. So it's zero. And finally,

Speaker 4:          38:14          now notice that almost all of these were the same left and right. So we, we're really wasting our time except for getting some practice and doing everything except the ones that changed. So you look at the elements that change their bonds, right? To see what happened. And if we do that now we see that only this one and this one changed and it changed plus two to zero. So it got reduced. Okay. So that question mark, now we know is that's a reduction. So we had to choose a reducing agent, right? So now if we had a way of classifying reagents as being oxidizing or reducing or neither, then we would know. We would only have to look among reducing agents if we want to do this reaction, unless the reaction might be a really complicated thing where you do an oxidation and then two reductions or something like that. But for simple things, it should be a reducing agent. Okay, so let's try some elements are so some compounds and see whether we would expect them to be oxidizing or reducing or neither. Okay, so let's start with hcl. There's a good reagent. Now, what's the oxidation state of hydrogen in this? There

Speaker 3:          39:32          it hcl. We'll see oxidation. State of hydrogen. Pardon me? It's plus one

Speaker 4:          39:40          because it's sharing. It's got, it's shared its electron with chlorine. That means for bookkeeping purposes that gave it to chlorine and so hydrogens plus one. How about chlorine? Chris

Speaker 3:          39:52          minus.

Speaker 4:          39:53          Now, what would those be if they were in organic compounds? If they were attached to carbon, what would hydrogen be? If it were attached to carbon,

Speaker 3:          40:04          it would be plus one. What would chloride be if it were attached? Chlorine for attached department. Okay, so these have there

Speaker 4:          40:11          normal oxidation levels, right? HCL has the same oxidation level for agency L as as if they were attached to carbon. So it's neither oxidized in nor reducing if it goes into carbon. Right? So that's neither. Okay. Okay. Now let's take br two of Poli. What's the, what's the oxidation level

Speaker 3:          40:35          of bromine in br two and elemental girl, I can't hear. Yeah, they're both zero.

Speaker 4:          40:45          They shared a pair, but they get it 50, 50 for bookkeeping because they're the same element. So they're both zero. That one zero. That one. Zero. Okay. Now what if they were attached to carbon? What would they be?

Speaker 3:          40:57          Why this one

Speaker 4:          40:58          take electrons from carbon, those atoms in bromine, right? So are they oxidizing or reducing

Speaker 3:          41:05          the agents? Is Br to oxidizing or reducing? If it reacts with Carbon Carbon,

Speaker 4:          41:12          it'll take electrons from carbon for our bookkeeping purposes, right? So it's a reducing agent. It takes the electrons away, right? It, it, uh, uh, our part to say the wrong thing. It's an oxidizing agent. Okay. It takes electrons away. Go ahead. It, uh, it makes the carbon become plus. Okay. So B r two as an oxidizing agent and we've already seen of course be to act as an oxidizing agent. For example, it reacts with ethylene. What's the oxidation level of carbon and ethylene? Well, what do you say in ch two ch two. What's the oxidation level of the carbon out?

Speaker 2:          41:54          Yes,

Speaker 4:          41:56          there are two bonds. Carbon to carbon, but those don't take electrons away or give electrons. Right? Cause it's saint. But there are two bonds to hydrogen on each carbon. Hydrogen done squat,

Speaker 2:          42:08          current bookkeeping,

Speaker 4:          42:11          we consider the bond ionic for bookkeeping, h plus c minus. So the carbon got an electron from the, from each hydrogen. Right? So what should its oxidation level via up the carbon on the left.

Speaker 4:          42:31          Okay. And same on there. Right now we've, we, we went through homos Lumos and so on and saw how it reacts with how it reacts with Brahmi. Remember Bro ammonium ion bromide comes in and so on. That's the mechanism. But for purposes of oxidation reduction there now minus a minus one, right? Because the bromine canceled one of the hydrogens. So we went from minus two on each carbon to minus one. So if we want to go from ethylene to die Bromo F to to die x ethylene, right? We need a, we need an oxidizing agent like Vr to not be our minus sodium bromide isn't going to do it. It has to be br zero. That's going to do it. And he did an oxidized. Now how about ch four? What's the, what's the oxidation state of carbon and ch four Amy. Okay. That's minus four. And the hydrogens are all maybe plus one for each of those, right? So those, uh, now should that be oxidized? Reduced? Well, certainly it, it, it reduces oxygen. O Two, what reaction do you call it when you reduce a o two with methane? What do you call it?

Speaker 4:          43:55          Call Fire, right? You got see co two and water. Okay. You can reduce Effie two oh three at great heat. That's the original reduction. Getting a metal from the metal oxide. You can react it with br two and free. Radical halogenation. Right. But generally methane is not very reactive except under very special circumstances. It doesn't have a homo Lubo, but we could classify it as a reducing agent sensibly. Right? Okay. How about lithium aluminum? Hydride so this is assault l I plus, right? So lithium is in what state?

Speaker 3:          44:37          It's obvious plus one right now. Aluminum, aluminum, uh, is, is uh,

Speaker 4:          44:48          is forming three is forming for bonds to hydrogen.

Speaker 4:          44:56          Now how are we going to do that? Okay. What we can regard this as is aluminum plus three and one of the hydrogens, hydrogens all being minus one, right? Except that we also have a minus charge there, right? So the aluminum would be plus four with four hydrogens because hydride is more electronegative than aluminum. So the aluminum would be plus four with respect to the four hydrogens, right? But then there's an extra electron. It's all h four minus. So that we put on the aluminum and we have a all three. Now, uh, what is, what's an abnormal? Uh, aluminum is a metal, not very electronegative. So we had expects the B plus try [inaudible] plus three. That's reasonable. What element here is unnatural? That is not what it would be if associated with carbon.

Speaker 3:          46:01          Yeah. Hydrogen. It's h

Speaker 4:          46:05          minus, not h plus. Right. So that's going to make this a reducing agent because of the h minus. Okay. How about sodium hydride there's an easier one,

Speaker 3:          46:19          Carl. What's the oxidation state of sodium in this plus one plus one and hydrogen minus one.

Speaker 4:          46:26          What's unnatural?

Speaker 3:          46:29          Hydrogen.

Speaker 4:          46:29          So reducing agent. Okay. How about potassium? Metal?

Speaker 3:          46:36          Nathan, what do you say? What's it's 10 potassium metal. What's the oxidation state of Gassy. So you're okay.

Speaker 4:          46:43          Is that what it is with respect to carbon? If you had a potassium carbon bond,

Speaker 3:          46:50          what would it be? It would be plus wonderful. It's carbon. It's less elected. I you

Speaker 4:          46:57          living carbon. So is that an oxidizing or reducing agent?

Speaker 3:          47:02          No, it's able to give up an electronic right to go from zero to one

Speaker 4:          47:06          plus one. So that's another reducing agent. How about KCLS?

Speaker 3:          47:12          Hey, can help us with that. What's pay plus one and chloride? What are they with respect to carbon? So where should we put it? Oxidizing. Reducing or amazing. Okay. Uh,

Speaker 4:          47:36          well, our s s are,

Speaker 3:          47:42          what's the oxidation state of sulfur? Sulfur is more electronegative for these bookkeeping purposes than carbon. Okay. So with respect to that

Speaker 4:          47:57          sulfur carbon bond, that it's more electronegative it would be minus one. How about sulfur? Sulfur bonds.

Speaker 3:          48:07          So your role, so what is it? The salt? It's minus one. Okay.

Speaker 4:          48:13          Same for the other one now. Uh, so that's an oxidizing agent because of or associated with two carbons, it would be minus two. It would get an electron from carbon. So as compared to, uh, so as compared to our SSR, right? O R S R it's, it's a, an oxidizing agent. So it oxidizes things like r two r s h is, could be oxidized by tea, can be oxidized to this by this. So r s h is, uh, is, is a reducing agent, right? In that reaction and that reaction, it's a reducing agent. Did you ever see such a reaction?

Speaker 3:          49:01          Pardon me? Yeah, that's all fine.

Speaker 4:          49:04          Bridges are the permanent waves and hair, right, with exactly the reaction that we talked about. We talked about it then Homo Lumo terms. But you know, in order to make the dye sulfide bridge, you need an oxidizing agent. Something has to be the oxidizing agent, and it could be this. Okay. Uh, cro three. Uh, I think I just have two more here. Let me finish it. That's plus six. Okay. That's minus two. Okay. Now there's also a stabili unlike this where it's cr plus four, so cr plus six can become cr plus four. That means it's an oxidizing agent, cro three. And we can put it over there. Okay. Water. Those are the normal oxidation level plus one minus two. So it's neither except, uh, well, no, actually let's, let's quit it here. We can carry on next Monday. Okay.
