00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.440
WILLIAM JONES: SPIDER's a
millimeter-wave polarimeter.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.520
It's designed to
image the polarization

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.520
that's in the microwave
background radiation.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.470
The ultimate goal of SPIDER
is to see to what extent

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.700
we can identify a very
characteristic feature

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.560
in that polarization,
that's expected

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.680
to have come from
the early stages

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.420
of the evolutionary
growth of our universe.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.960
SASHA RAHLIN: SPIDER
will, basically,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.640
map out a portion of the sky.


00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.520
And we're going to map out the
intensity and the polarization

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.330
of the light that we
can see from the sky.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.110
And that'll be a combination
of primordial radiation--

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.910
so, light that has been
traveling basically

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.240
since the Big Bang, since the
beginning of the universe.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.230
And also, intensity
from the galaxy.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.040
So we have to
disentangle those two,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.510
and we'll map out what that
part of the sky looks like.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.790
And we'll be able to
model it, and determine

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.840
the parameters that kind of
govern what the universe was

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.510
like, at the very beginning


00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510
WILLIAM JONES: The schedule
for a balloon launch

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.510
like this is,
essentially, that you

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.990
need to qualify for a
long-duration balloon flight

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.240
the summer prior to a
launch-- within a few weeks

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.840
of Christmas.


00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.350
Normally, the process--
and what we did last year--

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.400
was that you would
deploy your instrument

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.050
to the CSBF facility
in Palestine, Texas.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.580
You would integrate
the payload there.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.950
And you would test it with
all of the flight systems that

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.330
are provided by NASA.


00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.080
And once you've
demonstrated that they all

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.510
play well together,
then you ship directly

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.450
from that facility in
Texas to Antarctica.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.070
We went through that
process last year,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.440
but then, of course,
the government shutdown

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.570
resulted in the cancellation
of all the flights.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.270
Because we did it last year,
we're staying here this year.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.960
But it's the same schedule.


00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.160
That is, we'll integrate it
all in the high bay, here.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.250
The team will meet the
payload and all the equipment

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.570
in Antarctica.


00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.750
About the second
week of October,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.590
the first groups
will leave from here.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.730
And then you really have
the month of November,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.380
and the first three weeks
of December to set up a lab,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.150
build the experiment, calibrate
it, make sure it's all working,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.320
and get it ready for launch.


00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.450
STEVE BENTON: SPIDER's awesome.


00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.470
It's studying,
like, the Big Bang.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.450
It's almost
unbelievable that we can

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.770
test what SPIDER wants to test.


00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.720
I get to do that, while building
a really cool robot to make

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.740
that happen.


00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.990
And then I fly it in the
stratosphere from Antarctica.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.320
I get to do this
really cool thing,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.530
in this really awesome way.


00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.230
And it's great.


00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.690
SASHA RAHLIN: As
a scientist, these

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.140
are the kinds of questions
you really want answers to,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.460
right-- the big questions about
how did the universe, you know,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.160
why are we here, to some extent.


00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.280
SPIDER is a really cool
instrument to do that with.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.190
You know, ballooning in
general is really cool.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.180
It's really fun, as
a young scientist,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.430
to get involved with that
kind of a instrument.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.810
These kinds of
projects naturally

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.380
lead to satellite instruments,
and larger-scale science.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.900
So it's a really good
jumping-off point,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.910
as a graduate student,
to get involved

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.110
with this kind of a project.
