I helped them to clean up the interface

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859

of the tips and tricks that you would
give a designer that's just getting

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030
give a designer that's just getting
 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.930

start learning about the technology
 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.450
start learning about the technology
itself you don't have to code it but you

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460
itself you don't have to code it but you
 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.360

have to learn what it is and I think

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370

think really any successful technology
project may I think a lot of times

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350
project may I think a lot of times
 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.650
project may I think a lot of times
developers and software engineers don't

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660
developers and software engineers don't
 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.949
developers and software engineers don't
really know that right just how yeah how

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959
really know that right just how yeah how
 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.800

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.780
about creating beautiful user beautiful
and intuitive user experiences can you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
and intuitive user experiences can you
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.820
and intuitive user experiences can you
tell us a little bit about your talk and

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830
tell us a little bit about your talk and
 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.100

what you wanted the audience to walk

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110
what you wanted the audience to walk
 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.590
what you wanted the audience to walk
away with okay I was talking about

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600
away with okay I was talking about
 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.530
away with okay I was talking about
animation for interfaces and very often

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540
animation for interfaces and very often
 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.140
animation for interfaces and very often
I get okay that's too expensive that's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
I get okay that's too expensive that's
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.510
I get okay that's too expensive that's
too complicated we should do it later

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520
too complicated we should do it later
 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.170
too complicated we should do it later
when time is left and my point is that's

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
when time is left and my point is that's
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.809
when time is left and my point is that's
the wrong approach it's one of the most

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819
the wrong approach it's one of the most
 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.880
the wrong approach it's one of the most
important and powerful tools we have and

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890
important and powerful tools we have and
 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.340
important and powerful tools we have and
it's not very complicated to do and I

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350
it's not very complicated to do and I
 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.020
it's not very complicated to do and I
was showing my audience how to do it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030
was showing my audience how to do it
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.810
was showing my audience how to do it
with just pen and paper and they

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820
with just pen and paper and they
 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.580
with just pen and paper and they
shouldn't be afraid and I had a lot of

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590
shouldn't be afraid and I had a lot of
 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.790
shouldn't be afraid and I had a lot of
developers in my talk so I was
