LUCINDA SANDERS: Sit With
Me is based around

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.670
an iconic red chair.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.220
And there's so many things that
a chair really embodies.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.880
It's about sitting for the
future of technology.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.760
It's about not standing for
anything less than women's

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.640
full participation
in computing.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.750
And I hope this campaign
really helps

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.190
us understand that.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.920
We need more women
in the workforce.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.865
We need their creativity.

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:35.390
We need their skills.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.960
ALAN McCONNELL: We've learned
over time that you can't build

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.860
great products if you don't have
a team that empathizes

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.752
with and understands
the audience that

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:42.040
the product is for.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.530
LUCINDA SANDERS: We're doing
the Sit With Me campaign

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.690
because we want the world to
know that women are great

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.040
technical thinkers.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.820
And it's time to do it now.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.280
MATTHEW McTEE: I think the world
needs a campaign like

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.773
Sit With Me in order to ignite
a commitment towards really

00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:59.270
driving more women into
careers in technology.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.200
SHERYL SANDBERG: You know the
women who are dedicated in

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.450
computer science, who go into
math, who go into other

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.980
technical areas,
they're great.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.190
And it starts with believing
they can do it.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.730
COLLEEN BLAKE: As a mother, I
want to break the stereotype

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.800
to show my daughters that
hey, you can go to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.930
that engineering class.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.620
So it's part of telling that
story that's important for me.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.240
LUCINDA SANDERS: We want women
helping to solve the problems

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.430
that the world faces.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.100
That's what we hope
this campaign

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.490
provides a catalyst for.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.370
JESSICA MURILLO: We sent out
an email a couple weeks ago

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.950
about our International Women's
Day event and wouldn't

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.840
it be a great idea to
have this red chair?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.430
LEAH BRUNSON: The campaign is
getting lots of great buzz

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.450
here at Microsoft.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.950
We had about 100 people here
to talk about the powerful

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.690
contributions of
women in tech.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.640
They want to hear more.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.850
They want to get involved.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.620
We want you to have a Sit With
Me event or host a photo shoot

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.030
or use the chair as an
award program or

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.750
have a stealth campaign.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.510
JESSICA MURILLO: Just do it.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.780
It's not hard.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.310
You can request a red chair.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.590
You get some people together.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.530
You take some pictures.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.550
And you upload at the site.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.690
It's just easy.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.410
LEAH BRUNSON: Think about
the community.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.610
How can we get the community
involved?

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.880
FEMALE VOICE: They're going to
take this iconic red chair

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.860
places that we could have
never imagined.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.455
And that is the creativity
of this campaign.

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:10.860
ANDREW BOSWORTH: People who
aren't necessarily a part of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.080
the process, that's a loss for
not just the rest of us who

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.420
don't get that perspective, but
also for them who don't

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.130
get to shape the future that
is going to come to exist.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.520
COLLEEN BLAKE: This isn't
just a company

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.090
versus company issue.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.480
It's a societal issue that
we're trying to change.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.000
LUCINDA SANDERS: At the end of
the day, we'll know Sit With

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.470
Me's successful if we have
created a conversation around

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.530
the importance of women's
participation in computing.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.655
And not just the [? monk's ?]
technologists, but everywhere.

00:02:41.443 --> 00:02:41.940
MEGAN SMITH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.490
Thanks for coming on the eve
of Google I/O, which we're

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.010
very excited for.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.440
It kicks off tomorrow morning.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.811
And all of a sudden, there's
already been a set of events.

00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:54.246
I want to welcome my
co-panelists up.

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:55.590
Come on up, you guys.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.140
And we'll do some
quick intros.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.140
We wanted to play the video
that you just saw, because

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.180
there's several red chairs
in the room.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.680
And one of our partners, NCWIT,
which is the National

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.420
Center for Women and Information
Technology kind of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.135
made this idea.

00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:11.290
While these guys are coming
up, who has a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.280
red chair in here?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.950
There's one.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.300
There's one.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.400
So you can see some of them.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000
So we encourage you, get a bunch
of red chairs into your

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.230
company and kind of make a
visual statement about having

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.790
more women in technology
in the room.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.870
We thought it was a great
campaign and wanted to

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.620
highlight it as we kick
off this panel.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.160
One of our goals, tonight, is to
give a chance to the women

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.400
and some of the men who've
joined us to hear--

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.620
of the women of I/O--

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.490
Google I/O--

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.740
hear from some of the
women at Google

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.150
who are amazing leaders.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.670
And we want to talk
about two things.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.820
One is technology and leadership
and building

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.420
incredible products and some of
the experiences we have had

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.820
and you guys have
had doing that.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.610
And then also, we want to talk
about women in technology and

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.850
some of the experiences and some
of the challenges we all

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.470
face, and how-- you know,
things have gotten a lot

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.010
better and they're getting
better, but we still have a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.910
ways to go.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.500
So we'll kind of cover
both of those topics.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.880
But let's start with
introductions.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.608
So, Susan Wojcicki.

00:04:09.608 --> 00:04:10.858
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Hi everyone.

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:15.344
Hello?

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:16.470
Is it working?

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.160
There we go.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.230
All right.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:18.899
Good evening.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.360
It's great to see
everybody here.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.029
Welcome.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.710
And we're all looking forward
to I/O tomorrow.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.280
So, I'm Susan Wojcicki.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.370
I'm the Senior Vice President
responsible for our

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.550
advertising products and the
building and design of our

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.220
future advertising products.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.260
We were working on building
all the great things that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.650
we'll release over the
next coming years.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.890
ANGELA LAI: If this works.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.920
Can you hear me?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.080
My name is Angela Lai.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.710
I'm a vice president
of engineering.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.493
I'm responsible for the Google
Wallet and the Payments team.

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:56.730
My team's responsible
for money that

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.903
flows through the company.

00:04:57.903 --> 00:04:59.850
And it's great to be here.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.280
Part of my team--

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.500
MODERATOR: Between Angela and
Susan, I think have basically

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.880
most of the--

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.356
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Susan and I
actually work together.

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:08.170
ANGELA LAI: And part of my
team, actually, is in San

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.780
Francisco here.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.060
And I work out of the San
Francisco office.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.250
ANNA PATTERSON: Hi, I'm
Anna Patterson.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.940
I'm Director of Engineering
and Android.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.340
I'm in Google Play.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.460
I'm responsible for books and
search and recommendations.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.025
GAYATRI RAJAN: I'm
Gayatri Rajan.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:27.685
I'm the Director of Product
Management.

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:31.310
I used to work with Angela
on payments.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.240
And I recently moved
to Google Offers.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.680
MEGAN SMITH: And I'm
Megan Smith.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.110
I am currently working on Google
X. I just shifted.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.080
But for a long time, I led new
business development at

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.110
Google, which is the biz dev
team that helps these guys

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.560
when they are starting
new products.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.490
And I also got to work out a lot
of fabulous acquisitions

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.380
with amazing teams that
we were lucky

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.010
to bring into Google.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.690
So I guess one, as maybe sort
of a history-thinking

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.430
question, think about some of
your early experiences.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.940
And we'd love to hear from you
guys a little bit of what were

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.260
some of the things that
prepared you the most,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.460
different experiences that
prepared you most for what

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.220
you're doing now.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.210
Just by way of sort of almost
examples for people, things

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.190
that you came across.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.615
Anybody got any ideas there?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.740
Early experiences.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.780
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I'll start.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.340
I'm not sure, really, like,
any one thing prepared me.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.920
I was lucky.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.270
I joined Google when it was
a really small company.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.330
I joined as the 16th employee.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.800
MEGAN SMITH: Susan was
the Google landlord.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.690
For people who don't know, Larry
and Sergey moved into

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.950
her garage.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.690
So, that was her first
experience with them.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.310
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So I
joined first as the

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.560
first marketing person.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.530
And at the time, I
had very little

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.130
practical experiences marketing.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.890
I had a degree.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.400
I had an MBA.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.380
So I can't really say there
was any one thing that

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.070
prepared me.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.130
It was definitely working,
like I grew

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.550
as the company grew.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.400
And I took on new challenges.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.110
There was always new things that
I thought I wasn't really

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.850
sure I could do.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.570
I had never really
done them before.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.470
But each time I did them, I kept
building that skill set.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.290
And so over the course
of the last--

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.610
it's been 13 years that
I've been at Google--

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.350
I've been able to build a
really great skill set.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.250
So I will say my first job was
being a product manager at a

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.440
small little start-up.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.840
And I really got the passion for
technology there and the

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.470
passion for building products.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.240
And I learned by being at that
company that you needed to be

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.190
more than a technologist though,
that you also had to

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.990
have some business skills,
because the company went out

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.120
of business.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.450
Even though I thought I
built a great product.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.400
And so then I got interested
in also

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.650
building business skills.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.490
ANGELA LAI: I'll piggyback
on that.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.220
The Google culture, it's a
very supportive culture.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.190
And we really believe in
lifetime learning.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.780
And at the company, both
informal and formal, we have

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.110
classes to help people get
through things much like we go

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.610
through school.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.460
And at the same time, as a
company, we always try to

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.040
shoot for really ambitious
projects.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.560
And that's the way to stretch
ourselves, to

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.200
make ourselves learn.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.870
And we always try different
things.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.410
We're constantly trying
different things.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.940
And the culture of experiment is
there and available for us.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.680
And so for me, at Google, it's
a lifetime of learning, just

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.850
continue to better ourselves.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.020
ANNA PATTERSON: I had a very
early conversation which I'm

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.049
sure Susan doesn't remember.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.600
But I was pretty new at the
company, and I was saying--

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.010
I can't even remember
the project--

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.740
but I said that something
needed to be done.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.360
And she said do it.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:53.610
And so that kind of culture of
you see something and you

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.400
gather a team together and solve
a problem is definitely

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.820
one that I really value,
because it helps

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.358
us get stuff done.

00:09:03.358 --> 00:09:05.593
GAYATRI RAJAN: So my
early experience--

00:09:05.593 --> 00:09:06.820
it may not be early for you.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.500
It was early for me.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.550
I became a mother
in my early 20s.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.510
And in many ways, that prepared
me for the career

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.300
that followed.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.060
Because as a mother, I had to
learn-- one of the first

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.160
things you have to learn is to
give up control, to go with

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.900
the flow, to seek opportunities
where they may

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.650
arise, rather than having
a very strict plan.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.580
It also taught me how to
multi-task, because I had to.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.530
But I think, more importantly,
most importantly, it taught me

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.180
to really care about the
work that I was doing.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.320
Because it matters.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.720
It matters when you have
something else

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.970
you could do instead.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.090
It really focuses you.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.810
It makes you want to do
something even better than

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.880
what you might have
wanted to before.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.830
And I think you need
that passion.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.960
You need that flexibility.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.160
And you need the ability
to just manage 100

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.790
things at once at Google.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.550
And I think it's--

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.100
my children taught me how
to survive this place.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.980
MEGAN SMITH: I think, we've been
working in the tech world

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.840
so much, that you know,
start-ups are like that.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.070
They're just like
a free for all.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.410
And it's just coming at you.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.480
And you just have to try to
rise to the occasion.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.370
So that's I think a pretty
good example.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.950
There's a great book that
Alice Walker wrote.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.310
It's called We Are the Ones
We've Been Waiting For.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.785
And I think about the
things you guys

00:10:29.785 --> 00:10:32.160
have said about Google.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.470
It's our company.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.510
And we just have to make it
what it's going to be.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.120
And I think that if you're in
a start-up or in a larger

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.150
company, if you take ownership
like that, you see a lot of

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.080
benefits on that, not only for
what your company's going to

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.890
achieve, but also what you'll
get to be part of within that.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.030
So I think that's good advice.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.555
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So actually one
thing on that I think is

00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:54.040
an interesting perspective is--
actually, when I first

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.280
joined Google, they said we're
going to hire you a boss.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.980
Because I was, like, well,
I'm a marketing manager.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.710
I just graduated.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.560
I have my MBA.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.920
And they said, well,
we're going to

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.140
hire a VP of Marketing.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.720
And you'll report to that
VP of Marketing.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.170
And I waited and I waited.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:14.160
I waited for years for the VP
of Marketing until I learned

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.550
that I wasn't going to have a
person coming and telling me

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.830
what to do, that I just had to
figure out what are the right

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.490
things for us to do.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.300
And we used to have
this motive,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.050
like, act like an owner.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.110
So that really indirectly
helped me.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.520
Because I had no one to
go to for direction.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.690
I had to figure it out.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.230
And so it was very much a
sink or swim situation.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.190
And so I do think that that
is like a really valuable

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.080
experience, where you need to
figure out yourself what are

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.980
the important things
to get done.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.710
MEGAN SMITH: One of the things
that I did, in thinking a

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.110
little bit, we have an
extraordinary number of very

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.860
talented women throughout
Google and also in

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.670
leadership at Google.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.110
We're really lucky that our
company values diversity and

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.770
talent inclusion.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.880
And so we see that--

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.420
on this particular panel, I
asked these guys because

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.420
they're engineering and
product leaders.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.180
And they've built amazing
products that are--

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.470
in the beginning, it was
millions of people.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.900
Now, really, all of you have
built things that are

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.930
affecting billions of people.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:16.580
And so, maybe to sort of stay
with tech into innovation.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.930
How do you lead teams?

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.780
How do you come up
with early ideas?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.235
How do you listen for ideas?

00:12:21.235 --> 00:12:25.390
Can you talk a little bit about
experiences being on

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.540
this crazy rocketship and trying
to start new things and

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.385
then turn them into what
they have become?

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.820
ANGELA LAI: So things change in
the technical world very,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.570
very quickly.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.650
And there is our job,
and we deal with it.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.740
And the way that--

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.630
speaking of engineering-- the
way that we do engineering

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.630
some 10 years ago is very
different than the

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.040
way that it is today.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.490
And I will continue to vouch for
the really important part

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.430
of the group culture that
we continue to learn.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.860
And we're not afraid
to change.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.970
And that's part of
the culture.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.950
And you need to continue
to spread that.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.830
And every time this spirit of
pushing yourself beyond the

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:06.930
comfort zone--

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.240
what more can we do?

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.560
And look outside of our boundary
boxes, and figure out

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.260
can we try it and find
a way to try it?

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.520
And I think try not to say no,
and really trying to continue

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.990
to just sort of encourage
ourselves and continue to

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.220
encourage a team to think about
ways of looking at our

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.380
jobs differently.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.150
And some of my colleagues would
say every year they

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.410
figure out how to blow up their
job and try it again.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.040
I mean, really get out off the
mode of what you're doing day

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.360
to day, what seems to be
important to you today, and

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.820
try to get a new perspective.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.830
And I think that constantly
putting ourselves in a new

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.530
zone or thinking that well, if I
weren't me, if I were Susan,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.370
how would I do this?

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.380
If I were somebody else outside
of Google, how would

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.370
we look at this product?

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.270
And I think, trying to get a
different perspective all the

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.555
time is important.

00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:01.926
MEGAN SMITH: Any others?

00:14:01.926 --> 00:14:03.720
Talk about innovation, maybe.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.200
One of the things that
was interesting me

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.060
was watching Susan.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.410
You were on maternity leave
and we bought DoubleClick.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.120
And we're just kind of wandering
around trying to

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.320
figure out what to do.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.410
Susan was a big part of deciding
to do that, but then

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.160
she was gone when we were
doing integration.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.030
We need Susan.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.780
SUSAN WOJCICKI: It's because the
review took so long I was

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.284
able to have a baby
in between.

00:14:22.284 --> 00:14:23.248
MEGAN SMITH: That's true.

00:14:23.248 --> 00:14:25.660
It was amazing.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.380
Just how do you--

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.630
all a sudden, thousands of
people join the company.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.200
Would do you do?

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.030
How do you lead?

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.040
How do you help people put
something like that together?

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.250
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yeah, I think
that the trick on innovation

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.420
and on managing teams and
figuring out the right sorts

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.690
of things to do is, first of
all, to figure out where

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.340
you're going--

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.430
and being able to say
this is the vision.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.750
This is where we know we want
to be in two years or like

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:55.250
next year-- and then
working backwards.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.570
And so if you have a vision,
everybody can rally around.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.150
Everyone can start to
understand what's

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.910
important about it.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.230
They can be motivated by it.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.140
And then you can start figuring
out what are the

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.910
things that we need to
do to get there.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.980
And so that I think is always
like the number

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.790
one thing to do.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.690
And then I think the second
thing is just putting the

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:20.030
right people in place
and questioning.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.060
There's always like
a challenge of--

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.640
teams think they can only do
this much, but then if you

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.070
inspire them or challenge them
or they have to, they somehow

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.210
manage to go a little
bit further or do it

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.240
a little bit better.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.990
And there's always a challenge
of how do you get people to

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.910
really want to do that.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.060
And I think a big part is
believing in that mission,

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.980
being excited, being compelled,
believing that it's

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.375
what they want to do.

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:51.330
GAYATRI RAJAN: And I think
another important side, even

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.910
as you get people rallied around
the objective and have

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.010
them think about new ideas to
excel, you have to be pretty

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.900
strict and very disciplined
about making sure that the

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.940
ideas that aren't helping that
vision, that they don't take

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.920
up air time and they don't
distract from the mission.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.390
So that can often be the
harder part of the job,

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.690
because it's so much nicer
getting people forward.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.530
It's harder sometimes
restraining.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.770
But it has to be done.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.090
So it's a balance.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.120
But as Susan said, if you have
the right vision and if you

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.640
communicated it, people will
come up with the ideas.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.840
It's almost an easy job for a
leader to just harvest that.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.520
MEGAN SMITH: To crowd-source,
to harvest them.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.470
Yeah, Anna, go ahead.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.490
ANNA PATTERSON: I also try to
get people who actually really

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.160
believe in the vision and who
have a lot of passion about

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.090
contributing.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.290
And with every project, there's
the exciting bits and

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.540
the boring this.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.140
And so I try to actually give
each person an exciting bit

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:58.900
and a boring bit.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.456
So they actually get the
boring bit done.

00:17:01.456 --> 00:17:03.360
And they go on to the
exciting bit.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.359
And the great thing about that
is then you can give them

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:09.119
another boring bit, right?

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:09.640
MEGAN SMITH: Good system.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.750
We have a really great
OKR system--

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.960
Objective and Key Results.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.609
And we really use
it with a lot of

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:15.710
discipline within the company.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.700
I don't know if anyone wants to
say a sentence about sort

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.380
of how we do that, what we
do with the process.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.109
It's a process we drive
ourselves crazy

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.420
with it, but we do.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.960
ANGELA LAI: So those objectives
and results

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.500
actually speaks to how we just
[INAUDIBLE] ourselves.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.470
One thing that is important,
like what Susan was saying,

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.510
having a vision is knowing
what you're

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.530
trying to drive to.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.250
So the objective list, what
you're actually trying to get

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.080
to, not the task that you're
trying to do, not how you're

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.130
going to get there--
is actually

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.290
describe the actual objective.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.690
And the key results, as a
result-driven company, is to

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:54.060
actually define what makes you
successful, what makes us

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.240
happy about-- what we think
whether we have

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.820
achieved the objective.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.760
And so it's not about creating
a task list, even thought we

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.463
have to figure out which is
boring bits and which are the

00:18:03.463 --> 00:18:06.580
exciting bits that eventually
we work on, but as a way to

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.540
get everybody to be empowered
to understand the goal and

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.920
objectives of what
every team, every

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.910
individual, the overall company--

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.230
at the different levels, we
define these objectives and

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.850
key results.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.030
So people believe in what
they're doing, understand

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.880
where we're trying to drive to,
and then it really has the

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.870
part of responsibility and drive
towards the same place.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.526
So it's a very empowering way
for the team to figure out how

00:18:28.526 --> 00:18:31.810
to get in sync, and how to
prioritize [INAUDIBLE] what's

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.770
important and what we're
trying to get to.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.320
And we can also look back at it,
and say well, we planned

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.610
that and sort of do a
retrospective on was that a

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.500
good set of things to measure
to start with.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.930
And if we were measure our own
success by that, what do we

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:46.700
learn from it?

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.500
And that's how we continue to
innovate by reflecting upon

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.596
ourselves what we've actually
done periodically.

00:18:53.596 --> 00:18:55.480
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I was just going
to say I think that the

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.210
OKRs are sometimes like a really
good way of pushing us.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.350
And so, one example was when
we worked on AdSense in the

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.300
very early days.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.910
We were supposed to get the
online version of AdSense out.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.590
And I think either Sergey
or Larry, they just

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.510
made up this date.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.680
And they said you're going to
get it done by April 15.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.120
And we were like really?

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.570
And magically--

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.730
we launched it like
two days late.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.690
It was like April 17--

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.900
but that stake in the ground of
let me see if you guys can

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.810
get it done by this time really
motivated people and it

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.070
made us more efficient at
really getting that out.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.970
MEGAN SMITH: Which is good.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.060
And also having the habit of
setting stretch goals, as part

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.500
of the goals, and then letting
your team not achieve 100%,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.060
but try to get to 80% and then
set more stretch goals.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.120
FEMALE VOICE: I think it's also
been like a great system.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.120
MEGAN SMITH: Maybe
turn a little bit

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.480
towards women in tech.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.120
Somebody gave me these
interesting numbers.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:57.400
One of them is that last year,
I think it's 54% of the 2011

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.610
Intel science for finalists
were in biochemistry.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:05.160
And so you're seeing this rise
in bio, in chem, and sort of

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.340
the regular sciences.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.820
I am on MIT Board, and
the undergraduates

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.810
are about half women.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.380
And we're seeing about 80%
percent of the architecture

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.480
school is women--

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.720
and the sciences school, but
we're not seeing it in

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.480
computer science.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.530
And so the stats that were
really interesting to me

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.670
recently going to the Computer
History Museum, which Susan

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.310
has recently joined
the board of.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.050
I encourage you to go.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.780
They have this amazing
Revolution exhibit that shows

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.510
the 2,000 years of computing
history.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.880
But in the '80s, the computer
science balance was much more

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.620
even-- about 40% of the computer
scientists were

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.970
women, largely due to IBM
and other trends.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.570
And now we're really
graduating--

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.430
I think, it's 14% of the women
graduating last year were in

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.570
computer science--

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.030
of people in computer
science were women.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.020
And 18% if you take all
IT-type degrees.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.710
So really, just very low
numbers, given the impact we

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.920
all have and the profound
impact of the tools that

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.220
computer science brings
in for the world.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.660
I don't know if people
had comments and

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.920
thoughts about that.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.930
I want to open up
for questions.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.380
But we're doing a lot of things
with women at Google to

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.280
build community and recruiting
and those ideas, but maybe

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.670
talk about some of the programs
we have or other

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.422
thoughts you guys have.

00:21:21.422 --> 00:21:22.640
What do you think's
going on there?

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.400
ANGELA LAI: So the
NCWIT boards--

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.500
the video that we produced has
the Sit With Me campaign that

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.120
Google sponsors.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.690
The idea of the campaign
is to talk about it.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.610
We don't know whether it's
scientifically proven or not.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.910
But there are, we think, other
studies that we see that

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.120
there's some unintentional
bias, gender bias around

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.450
whether women are technical
or not.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.780
And I don't know about
each one of you.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.800
But the idea of the red chair
is just have that

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.050
conversation.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.730
It has this icon that you can
get a chair from NCWIT.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.480
And just have that conversation,
whether you have

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.820
a gender bias, on whether you
should be in technology or

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.580
not, whether people in
technology should be moving up

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.010
the ladder, become leaders
in technology.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.210
It has had very good effect,
mostly to just generate the

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.840
conversation.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.640
Because I think a lot of it
is unintentional bias.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.810
And we don't really know why.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.620
But once you notice it, then
the community will

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.265
self-correct for.

00:22:27.265 --> 00:22:29.832
And that's the idea behind
the campaign.

00:22:29.832 --> 00:22:34.010
GAYATRI RAJAN: You know the
products we build, they're

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.510
intended for men and women.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.860
And the product that I'm
on, Google Offers--

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.020
I mean, women like shopping.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.200
This is something that's--

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.670
MEGAN SMITH: And are responsible
for a lot of

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.180
shopping across the family.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.430
GAYATRI RAJAN: A very
loyal bias.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.720
It's clear that everything
we do, we're

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.780
doing for men and women.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.520
Somewhere in the pipeline,
there's a perception that

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.050
technology is very male.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.560
And I think what
we have to do--

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.380
and this is the responsibility
of everyone in the room who is

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.630
in technology--

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.140
is to tell the story of
what we do, in a way

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.700
that appeals to girls.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.720
And I say girls, not women,
because by the time they're

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.440
women, it's too late.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.090
So we have to find a
way to translate--

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.460
if they're not interested in
video games, find a way--

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:31.130
maybe it's a social game or a
game around philanthropy or

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.300
giving that appeals to them and
really find a way to tell

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.730
the story of technology in a way
that resonates with women.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.400
I don't think we do that now.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.150
ANNA PATTERSON: I think as a
career, it's very social.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.590
And I think media
portrays it--

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.540
and a lot of people, their
stereotypes in other

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.110
industries think it's
a very loner thing.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:59.470
And actually working in an
engineering team is a

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.060
remarkably together thing, like
rowing crew together.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.100
I mean, it's really intense
social interactions and a lot

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.230
of teamwork.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.090
And so I think women could
bring a lot to it.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.120
And they bring a lot
to their teams.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.180
SUSAN WOJCICKI: But I'm
always surprised

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.460
there aren't more women.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.840
Because I think if you look at
technologies afield, it's such

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.740
a new field.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.670
And there's so much
opportunity.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.930
And to me, that means
that there isn't

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:32.100
really time to be biased.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.340
If you have a great product, it
doesn't really matter who's

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.430
the person who's running
that product.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.200
If you have a great company,
if you have a great idea,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.060
there's lots of opportunity.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.460
There's so much opportunity here
that women have that, I

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.490
think once they're in the
system, they're able to

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:50.330
achieve a lot.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.400
But what the challenge is, and
actually you once told me this

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.770
great quote, like, there are
lots of-- what did you say?

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:56.960
Megan told me.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.170
Basically you have to know that
opportunity is there.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.230
If you get here and you get in
technology, then you have

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.410
those opportunities.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.630
But if you don't even know those
opportunities are there,

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.910
you'll never actually
get there

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.510
MEGAN SMITH: We're all in a
group called Women at Goog--

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.300
in fact, there's 19 employee
resource groups at Google that

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.885
were created by the various
teams to interconnect us.

00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:19.650
And actually, turns out there's
30,000 Googlers.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.110
And I think there's 12,000 or
15,000 people on these lists.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.370
So Women At is one that
we participate in.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.180
And some of you guys are in the
Google Women Engineering.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.440
Gayglers, VetNet, Black Googlers
Network, Hispanic

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.400
Googlers Network, Filipino
Googlers, Googler American

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.530
Indian Network-- just amazing
groups of people.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:46.600
And so we were talking all about
this and how a lot of

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.720
people out of the world don't
know about the world we live

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.870
in and how exciting they are.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.260
And so how do you tell people
especially, when we're often

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.870
in countries that are so highly
racially divided or

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.460
countries that are gender
divided, or--

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.280
sometimes, often for our
companies, we're hiring so

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.090
fast, we're like who knows
someone from this?

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.360
And so we just keep

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.780
perpetrating the talent circles.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.570
And instead like, who
knows a woman?

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.860
Who knows someone from an
underrepresented group, in

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.580
addition to just asking
the question in

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.820
general, to get them in.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.810
Because there's a wonderful
actual interview with three

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.890
African American CEOs here in
Silicon Valley, and they're

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.740
saying exactly this, which is,
if you can get here, it's a

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.490
meritocracy in many ways.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.740
But finding out we're here, the
tech industry is here, is

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.990
an important thing
to make happen.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.950
So one of the things that--
you mentioned media.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.950
Gayatri organized a great event
last year, which was a

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.420
conference of the various
women leaders and folks

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.070
getting together.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.860
And we were lucky to
have Geena Davis.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.320
And I don't know if anyone wants
to mention some of her

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.210
findings, but she did an
extraordinary study of the

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.220
media that we all watch for
six-year-olds and under.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.690
And so you were talking about
sort of what you see, like

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.590
this loner engineer
or the loner.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.590
But actually the portrayal
of women is

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.090
the interesting there.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.000
I think she told us that it's
two to three men or boys

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.830
on-screen to one girl
or women in

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.650
cartoons and various things.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.210
She has a funny joke about
the film Nemo--

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.410
wonderful, one of my favorite
Pixar films.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:22.610
But how many women or
girls in the ocean?

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.060
Yeah, there's one.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.300
So, it's Dory.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.780
I think there might be some
little girls on the swimming

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.520
fish school.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.470
And mom gets killed of course.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.660
But there's one.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.370
So that's like really
happening in

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.970
the ocean, I guess.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:43.060
So just that we grow up with
this image that Smurfette,

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.880
that the world is made of lots
of boys with one girl.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.400
And so we imagine this.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.300
And the one that was most
telling, Anna, to your point

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.500
is about jobs.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.780
Its that 80%--

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.790
yeah, 80%--

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.610
what was the stat?--
are held--

00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:00.140
ANNA PATTERSON: 80% of the jobs
in these cartoons were

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.155
held by men.

00:28:01.155 --> 00:28:01.530
MEGAN SMITH: Right.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.880
ANNA PATTERSON: Or 80% of the
jobs in shows targeted for the

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.410
under six-year-olds
were held by men.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.590
MEGAN SMITH: So the boys
are learning that

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.410
men hold the jobs.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.700
And these jobs, the girls are
learning that-- in fact, Geena

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.540
says boys will be boys and
girls will be boys.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.220
You have To translate to be a
boy, to think about being a

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.300
scientist or an engineer or a
businessperson or a lawyer--

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.740
examples of people
who are not even

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.800
depicted in the 20% women.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.890
OK.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.910
We should open up to some
questions from you guys.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.170
I think there's some
mics around.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.280
I have a little bit of--

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.190
a couple questions people have
asked on the Google Moderator.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.910
Is there a mic around
for these folks?

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.070
Or we can pass one of these.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.373
Raise your hand if you
have a question, and

00:28:42.373 --> 00:28:43.623
we'll get you a mic.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.270
Welcome.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.390
AUDIENCE: I teach at the local
community college at Foothill.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.630
And I teach computer science.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.610
So I was wondering if you had
any specific recommendations

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:04.230
that I could do to convince
the freshman to become

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.190
computer science majors
and transfer and get

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.440
a bachelor's degree?

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.030
ANGELA LAI: I do a lot of
college recruiting and I give

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.785
tech talks at universities.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.330
I went into computer science
myself without--

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.472
you can't hear?

00:29:26.472 --> 00:29:28.416
MEGAN SMITH: Maybe pull
the mic closer.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.270
ANGELA LAI: The mic
actually works.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.890
Is that better?

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.879
I went into computer science
without knowing anything about

00:29:37.879 --> 00:29:41.870
it before going into
university.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.636
And I always tell people the
story, I took the first class

00:29:45.636 --> 00:29:46.780
in computer engineer--

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.986
I was going to do file
engineering.

00:29:48.986 --> 00:29:51.230
And I went into computer
engineering.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.810
The first programming class
was programming a game.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:58.070
And it was very,
very engaging.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.770
Anna and I are programmers.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.580
It's just this thing that can
hold your attention and

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.120
immense creativity.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.910
And I think finding ways-- and
I have continued to find that

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.000
people feeling empowered, that
they can create something out

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.820
of nothing, make a game out of
it, and inject creativity of

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.310
it, seems to have a bend
particularly for women and for

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.160
female students.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.030
And more of the creativity
part of it, rather than a

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.630
technical side of it, that is
inspirational, and is also

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.560
something that I think
all of us can agree.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.970
In creating products at Google,
that's one of the

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.610
things that is most exciting.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.060
Creating something out of
nothing in AdSense, what we're

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.050
doing with Google Wallet, with
play, and everything that

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:45.010
we're doing here,
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.357
except for the phone
that's ringing.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.240
And I think instilling that
early into the program to let

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.620
people see what they
can really do,

00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.540
it's something that--

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.080
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.895
MEGAN SMITH: Someone
really wants to--

00:31:01.895 --> 00:31:05.080
ANGELA LAI: Someone really
wants to talk.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.660
We'll turn it off.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.510
Sorry.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.930
So, yeah,

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.680
SUSAN WOJCICKI: It's
interesting.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.240
I hadn't heard Angela
say that before.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.060
But it's actually
the thing that--

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.670
I mean, I think computer science
has this vision of

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.830
being a more solitary
kind of--

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:26.610
running statistics
and numbers.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.280
So I sort of fell into
it by accident too.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.210
And I realized a lot of what
Angela just said of how

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.320
creative it actually was and the
ability to actually make

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.470
something and have that thing
be usable and for people to

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.090
see it all over the world.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.820
And that's what I really
fell in love with.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.430
And when I would describe that
to other people, it's not

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.950
always how computer science
is represented.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.470
And so I think it's actually a
challenge of how do you make

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:59.340
it seem as like a creative,
building, and interacting and

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.700
working on teams as a much
more social experience.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.780
I think people would see
it very differently.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.250
GAYATRI RAJAN: And
I think also--

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.226
ANGELA LAI: Make sure
you have a mic.

00:32:10.226 --> 00:32:11.240
MEGAN SMITH: Here, trade--

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.928
[INAUDIBLE] pull
that mic down.

00:32:13.928 --> 00:32:17.190
GAYATRI RAJAN: I think it's also
important to illustrate

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.720
just the impact that
they can have.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.930
I know they're young, and
they're probably not thinking

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.510
about that just yet, but I think
it's very important.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:31.650
I think the kinds of things that
we do, and the number of

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.750
people-- it's not in the
hundreds or thousands.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.866
It's in the millions.

00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:37.050
You can build a bridge.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.890
It's going to take many
years before a million

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.770
people cross it.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.020
You can write a great app.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.440
And you could get a million
downloads in a month.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.605
So it's one of those--

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.360
it's here.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.340
It's now.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.270
And it's explosive.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.310
So that the kind of impact that
they can have is much

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.330
more than they can expect to
have in some of these other

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:00.760
professions.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.370
And I think they should get a
little bit of the sense of the

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.530
enormity of what they can do
with starting out with a

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.340
simple app or a game.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:16.550
MEGAN SMITH: We created a
product called App Inventor,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.310
mostly aimed at high school
kids, help them

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.660
put together apps.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.430
We especially wanted to target
high school girls to pull them

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.240
into technology.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.370
It's kind of scratch-like.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.460
And now the MIT Media Lab
is running that project.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.220
But just having people have
their hands on stuff--

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.960
I heard of a great class--

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.170
second grade class that was
taking Raspberry Pi, which is

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.730
a little computer that costs
about 25 pounds, doing scratch

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.600
programming.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.500
And second graders have just
learned to read, so why

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.120
shouldn't they program?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.970
So, pretty interesting idea,
and pull them straight in.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.775
And the girls and the
boys were all in.

00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:50.210
So having them have experiences,
I think, in

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.110
addition to--

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:55.632
I think exactly like applying
it to real amazing things.

00:33:55.632 --> 00:33:56.910
Another question.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.920
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:07.670
I work for a company aimed to
increase the number of female

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.810
founders in technology
start ups.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.750
And one of the things we
always focus on is to

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.510
highlight like-minded
individuals in the female

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.850
world technology, who have
done things and we

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.880
can look up to them.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.929
And the younger generation also
to have an iconic person

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:27.340
to look up and say OK, I
can get there as well.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.250
What is Google doing?

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.000
This is the first year I see,
actually, women being more

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.480
involved and focusing on
women entrepreneurs and

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.620
technologists.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.330
Where is your focus going moving
forward, because as you

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.473
mentioned, women are very
important in technology today?

00:34:41.473 --> 00:34:42.892
MEGAN SMITH: Sure.

00:34:42.892 --> 00:34:44.311
Do you guys want to
talk about it?

00:34:44.311 --> 00:34:45.730
ANGELA LAI: You or me?

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.469
MEGAN SMITH: Because we
have a huge number of

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.320
programs that we run.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.710
We work really closely--

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.010
we've so many different
programs, I'm not

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:51.850
gonna' think of them.

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:54.150
But the Anita Borg programs--

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.699
has everybody here been to the
Grace Hopper celebration?

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:58.610
If you haven't, you should go.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.290
I think it's 3,000 computer
science women now, meeting in

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.390
the fall, that the Anita
Borg Institute

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:04.750
runs, which is great.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.480
We work really closely
with them.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.860
And we also try do a lot of
scholarship work with all

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.800
different underrepresented
people, with women, a lot of

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.870
recruiting, a lot of
those pieces--

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.790
Susan, you had a couple.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.990
Were you going to
say something?

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.340
There's just a range of programs
that we're doing.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.230
And also like this,
like showing up.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:28.030
There's actually a question in
here about one of the internal

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.870
meetings we posted that's
about one of the Dory

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.850
questions or moderator asking
why the internal meeting only

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:36.670
had men talking.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.640
It was a search quality
meeting.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.550
I think they were talking
about spell check.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.780
And actually typically, our
teams are more balanced.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.640
And so I don't know why that
particular meeting--

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.820
and it actually is a good
example where someone's

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.630
checking us and saying hey,
you're putting a Google image

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.360
of an engineering meeting
out there.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.800
Make sure that the women in the
team-- or choose a meeting

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.380
where there are women or
underrepresented women--

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.286
everybody's in the team in
the way we normally work.

00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:00.360
So it's really important--

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.630
back to the media point--
what you project and

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:03.575
who you try to help.

00:36:03.575 --> 00:36:04.000
Yeah.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.985
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I mean, I think,
the other thing I would

00:36:04.985 --> 00:36:08.020
add is that I think it's not
just there's like one iconic

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.180
women, but that actually within
the organization,

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.590
everybody feels like there are
people in my group that are

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.880
like me, whatever
that group is.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.990
And I think if you look across
our organization, we have--

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:23.010
because we've worked really hard
at it-- we have a good

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.950
women representation across
different groups, across

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.600
sales, across engineering,
across all areas.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.920
But from a technical standpoint,
it definitely--

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.280
I mean, we have to work really
hard to get women computer

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.030
scientists and software
engineers into the program.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:42.550
So we do have special recruiting
to try to increase

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.800
that group.

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:51.640
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.590
So my question would be do you
think it's worth hiring women

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.610
that are just interested
about technology and

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.230
then training them?

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.480
Do you have some program
like that?

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.960
MEGAN SMITH: We do some
programs like that.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:11.320
I actually heard a really
interesting one by-- oh my

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.940
god, what's the name
of the company?

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.730
Social--

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.270
huge company.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:17.880
There's a group in DC.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.260
They're called-- it's
like Groupon.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.540
Social?

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.370
AUDIENCE: Living Social.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:20.890
MEGAN SMITH: Living
Social, thank you!

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.340
I don't know why I-- sorry,
Living Social!

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.860
Anyway, I met this amazing guy
from Living Social, and he's

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.590
been training people in DC in
general on computer science,

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.980
and has been making sure the
classes are actually

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.010
half-balanced, men and women,
just thinking of

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.040
very talented people.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.965
And I think he's doing almost
like a three-month onboarding

00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.170
and then pulling people in,
because they just need more

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.175
tech folks where they are.

00:37:43.175 --> 00:37:47.020
I also heard an amazing thing
that Code Academy is 40%

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.100
women, which is great.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.550
So definitely.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.240
We also have a wonderful program
called BODL practicum,

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.140
which is taking underrepresented
minority top

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.680
talent, focusing-- getting--
pulling them

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.020
into computer science.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.505
Because we need more people
from those backgrounds

00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:02.620
in our field too.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.350
So, definitely, we are part of
that, and we're also funding

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.490
some of the programs
like that.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.360
And if people have ideas like
that, we want to hear more.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.890
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I mean,
I would also say--

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.250
Google as a representative tech
company-- we have many

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.595
jobs that are for people
who are not technical.

00:38:16.595 --> 00:38:17.460
We have sales.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.500
We have marketing.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.650
We have operations.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.360
We have lots and lots
of different areas.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.000
And so anyone who has an
interest can enter through

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.060
multiple doors.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.510
And if they choose, they
can go back and get

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.870
more technical skills.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.320
But to be an engineer,
you need to have

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.680
the technical degree.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:37.924
MEGAN SMITH: The
question here.

00:38:37.924 --> 00:38:39.160
Grab your mic.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.330
Go grab your mic.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.287
SUSAN WOJCICKI: --or technical
experience.

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:44.020
MEGAN SMITH: Over here.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.060
AUDIENCE: My question is in
regards to the statement that

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.210
was made a few moments ago
about it being a very

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:53.140
supportive culture at Google
and how great it is to have

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.810
someone in the room
who's like you.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.330
So what about those of us who
are not fortunate enough to be

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.710
in that type of environment,
where there is not someone in

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.720
the room like us, what
recommendations or suggestions

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.525
do you have for women
in those situations?

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.740
MEGAN SMITH: Probably everybody
has been in that

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.040
position, where you're sort
of the only person--

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:15.920
you're the only woman.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.260
Or you're the only person
from wherever.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.580
Maybe talk a little bit about
strategies in that situation.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.850
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I mean,
I think it's a hard

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.200
situation to be in.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.500
And I'll just say like two
things that come to mind.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.310
I think first of all, I worked
at one organization before

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:40.030
Google where that maybe I felt
a little more isolated in.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.900
But what I found is there were a
couple other women that were

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.100
there in that organization.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.880
And we started to get together
on a regular basis.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.740
We wound up having lunch
once a week or

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.500
once every two weeks.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.110
And I found that actually even
though it was a small group,

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.870
by actually connecting, we were
able to form a pretty

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.400
strong bond.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.340
And having some set of people
that I could connect to made a

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.400
really big difference in like
that they had shared

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.420
experiences about that
organization as well.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.160
And then I say the second thing
too is that ultimately,

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:17.560
it's believing in what you're
doing and trying to get what

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.420
you think is the most important
thing to be done as

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.720
efficiently as possible and to
make sure that your work is

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.040
able to shine through.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.120
And then if ultimately you feel
like you can't, for one

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.960
reason or another, to find
a place where you can be

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.260
recognized for the work
you're doing.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.360
ANGELA LAI: It is definitely a
difficult to be the only one--

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.060
I'm the only woman in my
graduating class for many

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.760
years ago now.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.460
And it was a small class.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.040
It was about, I think, it was
only 50 or 60 engineers.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.900
And I find myself in a lot of
design reviews and engineering

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.740
meetings, where I'm the only
woman in the room.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.000
What I've found at Google, and
hopefully you can find this in

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.600
other parts of the culture,
a lot of men are also very

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.720
supportive.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.530
Our last VP, Alan Eustace, is
a very great champion for

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.890
women in technology, as well
as my manager, Jeff Huber.

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.290
These are the senior
vice presidents

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.230
that will speak out.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:12.380
And they will find a connection
by proxy in women

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.480
they support.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.190
And I have found actually in
technology, the culture of

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:20.940
technology is very rationally
objective.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.100
And I find a lot of men to be
actually great support for

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.320
things that we need to do it.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.550
And by proxy of them thinking
about how they support their

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:33.330
family, how they support their
daughters, and the experience

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:38.210
in these proxy situations, it's
good conversations to try

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.130
to create the bond.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:45.810
And also feeling confident to
not feel isolated is important

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.870
in finding other allies
that can help.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.240
I think it is important.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.470
MEGAN SMITH: You guys mentioned
Alan Eustace, he ran

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.710
engineering, much of
engineering, for many years

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.010
and leads a lot of search now.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.700
He shared an office
with Anita Borg.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.190
So he has high consciousness
about women's issues.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.050
But he runs studies a lot--

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:10.130
I remember he did a study where
he was wondering whether

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.170
women were not--

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:16.350
in Google, you can nominate
yourself for promotion.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.550
Or your manager might nominate
you for promotion.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.520
And then you go through
a process of

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.830
very transparent culture.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.380
And they were noticing that
women were not nominating

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.650
themselves as much as men.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:30.100
So they ran a study to see are
women being promoted as much.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.510
And it turned out that the
women that were being

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:36.100
promoted, the managers were then
taking care of nominating

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.930
women and making sure
that was happening.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:42.080
But something where he wrote an
active email to the company

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.400
asking that women nominate
yourself and really

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.270
encouraging people.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.520
And I think there is some
amount of maybe--

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.730
a friend of mine who won the
Anita Borg award, Mary Lou

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:58.430
Jepson, has synthetic hormones
from a pituitary tumor, and

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.630
she ended up taking testosterone
and found that

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:01.800
her confidence levels went up.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.131
So I don't know, somebody
should study this.

00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:05.725
She found other things too.

00:43:05.725 --> 00:43:07.720
But watch the video
of her speech.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.490
It's great.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.530
But confidence-- and so she said
she really had a lot more

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.440
understanding of the men she was
managing and working with

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.190
from that experience, which
I thought was really an

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.160
extraordinary thing for
her and to hear that.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.950
And so think a little bit about
confidence and maybe

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.750
there are gender differences
and maybe confidence or

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.030
feeling like the impostor
syndrome-- like if they only

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.650
find me out.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.510
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.720
But you really do.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.900
And having the confidence to put
yourself up for promotion,

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.760
in this case.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.190
But also I think the more
important thing there--

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.220
and your point of connecting
to people-- was Alan also

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:43.870
stepping up to make sure there
was space for people in the

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.060
community and that they
were going to become

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.220
leaders in the same way.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.630
It was really important.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.880
So let's see.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.060
We have a bunch of different
questions.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.410
One of them actually is
one that's sort of a

00:43:58.410 --> 00:43:59.690
controversy out there.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.350
If any of you have read the
Anne-Marie Slaughter recent

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.600
article in The Atlantic entitled
"Why Women Still

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.030
Can't Have It All," regarding
the unsolved problem facing

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.260
highly successful women who
value time with their

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.260
families, what is
your reaction?

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:17.970
That'd be an interesting one to
talk about, because there

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:21.680
are trade offs and challenges
with balancing work and family

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.120
and relationships.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.140
One extraordinary thing is that
both Anna and Susan have

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.710
four children under 12
or 12 and under?

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.000
Yeah?

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.420
So, just you guys are doing that
all the time at scale.

00:44:37.228 --> 00:44:39.380
So I don't know if either
of you or any of

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.240
you guys have comments.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.730
We have two boys, and
you know it's--

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.600
I think technology is a little
more forgiving than maybe

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.660
perhaps, say, Anne-Marie, who
was in the State Department, I

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.050
think, in a diplomatic role,
traveling quite frequently.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.430
I remember once talking to
Sergey and giving a tour.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.180
And he walked in and someone
said are people

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:00.840
here all the time?

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.640
And he's like oh yes.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.770
They're here from very early
in the morning till

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.130
very late at night.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.610
Just not the same people.

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.730
So we have this culture where
our founders from the

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:14.520
beginning were very open
to meritocracy.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.380
Get the work done.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.550
We don't care when
you're here.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.980
And I don't know if you guys
have thoughts about that.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.005
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I mean, I
read the article too.

00:45:22.005 --> 00:45:24.580
I don't know how many
of you have read it.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.880
I mean, I think these
are very personal

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.360
choices that people make.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:33.610
And I think if I look at the
choices that I have, I feel

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.880
like I've a lot more choices
than the generation--

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.400
that my mom's generation had.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.880
I have the ability to have this
amazing job, running an

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.450
important part of Google's
business, and to have kids at

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:47.150
the same time.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.520
And on the other hand, it's
not like there aren't

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:49.850
trade-offs.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.090
It's not like there aren't some
compromises that I need

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.930
to make on both sides.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.010
But I'm very fortunate
to live in this time.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.910
And I feel like the message that
I think is important to

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:00.950
send to young girls is like
you have all these

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:01.550
opportunities.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.500
You have choices.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.450
Those choices are yours.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.790
And there are trade-offs,
but there are choices.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:14.720
And I believe that women--

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.210
that we have all these great
opportunities and that women

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.700
should choose-- if
they choose--

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.950
should take advantage of it.

00:46:26.895 --> 00:46:28.050
GAYATRI RAJAN: An average
man or a woman

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.160
has 45 years of career--

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.960
spanning about 45 years.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.690
Your children are going to be
with you 18 years maximum.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.540
And my kids are already
out the door.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.830
So I think that's something to
recognize that there will be

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:45.150
periods of your time where you
invest a little bit more in

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.880
work and other times where
you pull back and

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.010
invest in your family.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:54.250
But recognizing that these
trade-offs will happen and

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:56.540
recognizing that it's not
going to be the same

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.320
trade-offs over your career
span, I think is very

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.970
important for young
women to realize.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:02.630
It's a long-run game.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.030
It's a marathon.

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.930
It's not a sprint.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:10.540
When you have your first baby,
it's not a five-year horizon

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.180
that you're looking at in
investing for your career.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.620
MEGAN SMITH: I just tell people
when they come back

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.750
from maternity leave,
right before--

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.640
I'm like you know, you won't
realize, but somehow you won't

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.260
actually get out the
door on time.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.080
And you'll need to change
your shirt three times.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.340
And you'll eventually
get here.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.980
But remember, babies are
only less than a

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.230
year old for a year.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:36.040
So maybe you don't work as much
that year, as crazy like

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.430
150% shipping and launching
and all that.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.690
And maybe you're in balance
with your team, and maybe

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.300
you're not doing a
total start-up.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.530
But then you do a start-up when
they're a different age,

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.070
so like that's a balance
for them.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:48.660
ANNA PATTERSON: And also
pregnancy gives you a really

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.910
hard deadline.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.400
ANGELA LAI: A schedule
that doesn't slip.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.630
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I think the
other thing people forget,

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:59.040
that if you work really hard and
you have a good job, you

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.480
can hire people who
can help you.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480
And they will help you.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.460
And you'll be able to help do
more to have more time,

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.810
because you'll have help.

00:48:10.456 --> 00:48:12.980
MEGAN SMITH: Do you have women
in tech leaders that you guys

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.240
look up to?

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.964
Who and why?

00:48:16.964 --> 00:48:20.435
ANGELA LAI: I look
up to Susan.

00:48:20.435 --> 00:48:22.230
I worked with Susan
for a long time.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:23.280
A lot of us have.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.690
And I think that Adool it really
is one of the things

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.105
that-- we've always had
people to look up to.

00:48:29.105 --> 00:48:31.610
And I typically sympathize
where you are in an

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:33.700
organization where you're not.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.320
And I think that it
really does help.

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.990
And I don't know how to bring
the Google culture to the rest

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.070
of the world.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.680
We work really hard at it.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.610
We have also leaders like Alan
that I greatly admire as a

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:50.310
"woman leader" because he really
does speak out for

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.560
women a lot.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.450
And I think as a community, we
all need to encourage our

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.350
leaders, also sometimes
a little bit shy

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.050
about speaking up.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:00.120
But if you kick them,
they will do it.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.140
And then I think it's us all
encouraging each other.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.660
Just speak up for it, and I'll
champion for the NCWIT Sit

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.090
With Me campaign again to
just try to strike the

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:11.920
conversation.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.180
It doesn't have to
be controversial.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.660
It doesn't have to
be emotional.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.796
It's just talking to them.

00:49:17.796 --> 00:49:20.748
GAYATRI RAJAN: And I wanted
to say that--

00:49:20.748 --> 00:49:22.455
ANGELA LAI: Here,
I'll give you--

00:49:22.455 --> 00:49:25.230
GAYATRI RAJAN: I tend to look up
to people not when they've

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:28.170
done something spectacular,
but when they've

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:29.070
really given back.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.970
And I will say this, without
embarrassing

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:35.170
Susan and even Angela--

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.340
because I've worked with both
of them-- is they found ways

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.840
to sponsor other people
in their org.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.870
Some of them women, sometimes
men, but I think they've

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:51.270
invested and often not overtly,
it's often in ways

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:55.410
that are behind closed doors,
or it's that little nudge.

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.810
It's sponsoring you
in a meeting

00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:58.846
when you're not present.

00:49:58.846 --> 00:50:01.710
I think those are the kinds of
things they've done for the

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:03.020
women in the org.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.670
And I know Angela has promoted
several women in her org.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.590
Susan has.

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:12.050
And I'm a beneficiary of that.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:16.760
So I think it's great that we
have women at Google who do

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.720
this for other women.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.470
And I feel this is one thing
that every woman, regardless

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.560
of their level, this
is something we

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.190
can do for each other.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.970
Women tend to--

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.240
there's research that's found
that when women tend to ask

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.820
for themselves, they are not
liked as much as when they ask

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.100
for others, which is probably
why you all think that you're

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.320
better at doing things on
behalf of others than

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.090
yourself, because it's clearly
a feedback loop there.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:48.970
So if this is what we have to
deal with, then let's make the

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:49.450
most of it.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.370
Let's try and help
other women.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:52.470
Sponsor someone.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.140
Say something nice about
someone when

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.700
they're not in the room.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:00.560
Seed those thoughts in people.

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.024
And I think that's a way we
can bring each other up.

00:51:03.024 --> 00:51:03.960
MEGAN SMITH: Terrific.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.110
Yeah, in the back of the room.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:08.490
AUDIENCE: Hi, I work here in
Silicon Valley, and frequently

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.890
am the only woman in a room or
the only woman in a form.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:16.180
And I'm the community manager,
so spend a lot of time using

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.820
your products, Google
products.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.290
And I wanted to thank you all
first for investing your time

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.540
and effort to have this event
here, the pre-event

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.700
dedicated to women.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:31.400
And I wanted to make a comment
and kind of also ask you for

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.500
what your plans are in
the future, because I

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.430
was all amped up.

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.530
And it's like oh my
God, I quit--

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.440
I stopped work--

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.280
I had my last meeting.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.840
3 o'clock, hop in the
car, get over here.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.090
Check in at Google I/O. And
I'm ready to go here.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:47.760
And they give me a t-shirt.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.940
And it's size small--

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.190
Men's.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.390
And I kind of thought maybe,
they didn't understand me,

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:59.210
because when they asked
me to register they

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.710
asked what my M-S--

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:02.640
Ms., right?

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.410
Female--

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.870
and I got this invite,
so Google

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:06.630
definitely knows I'm a woman.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:10.560
Are you guys sure that those
maybe green or gray ones don't

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.250
come in women sizes?

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.220
No, this is the smallest
you get.

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.050
MEGAN SMITH: It's either
this or the XL.

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:20.640
SUSAN WOJCICKI: It's funny.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:25.080
AUDIENCE: And then it's kind of
hard for-- and I'm not the

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.140
kind of woman who's intimidated,
as you can tell.

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:32.340
So that still makes
me feel unwelcome.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.480
And I don't want to make
this a big issue or

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.390
confrontational thing.

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:37.080
Because we're all women
and we don't do that.

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:43.910
But the thing is I show up
and I want my shirt.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:47.385
And I don't want to be told
that I can sleep in it.

00:52:47.385 --> 00:52:50.820
So I would like to encourage
you, like, what are your plans

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:51.520
for next I/O?

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.150
How are you going to make women
who show up like me, and

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.450
they're like, oh my God,
I'm so excited.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:59.380
And I don't care that I'm going
to be one, maybe, per

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:02.900
100 attendees, just one
woman, but I'm here.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.460
How are you going to make it
even better next year?

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.350
And thank you again.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:07.650
MEGAN SMITH: Sure.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:08.730
Thank you very much.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:13.830
You know, I love people
like you.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.670
When we see great ideas then
we can execute on them.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:20.295
So definitely let's work
on the t-shirts.

00:53:20.295 --> 00:53:21.520
That would be good.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.980
But I think, you know, Susan,
we had an event--

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.530
what's that?

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.770
AUDIENCE: Don't make
it pink yarn.

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:28.220
MEGAN SMITH: No,
definitely not.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.186
I remember planning it out, we
had a rule, like, no rainbows.

00:53:31.186 --> 00:53:32.020
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:35.440
That was the gay community
online in Web 1.0.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.430
Yes, no pink.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:38.520
Well, some pink for the
people who like pink.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.150
But Susan, we had an event
at Susan's house.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.890
We were lucky she hosted us and
you were talking about how

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:48.830
it's important to have
gatherings where we come

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:51.650
together, whether it was the
group when you had very few

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:54.260
women-- like find other women
in the company somewhere and

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.350
partner companies and just
build community.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:54:00.410
And so our hope is that this
event is the beginning of

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:03.270
kicking that off and really
recognizing in a very public

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:07.420
way, as part of the I/O agenda,
that we really as an

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.720
industry need more women at
the table designing and

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.730
building everything.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:14.160
And it's a really
important part--

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:14.980
Susan, you've got something.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.220
SUSAN WOJCICKI: No, I was just
going to say I think it's

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.000
great feedback.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.270
And we'll communicate it.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.665
And next year, we'll have
women's t-shirts.

00:54:23.665 --> 00:54:24.060
MEGAN SMITH: Yay.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:24.520
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.280
MEGAN SMITH: Definitely.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.900
So we mentioned Alan Eustace
because he's a big

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.470
supporter of women.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:31.890
He mentioned--

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:35.750
I was on stage with him and
he said I went to the--

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:38.730
I think it was the Grace
Hopper conference.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.600
And he said I know what it felt
like, because I got a

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.907
lipstick [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:45.889 --> 00:54:48.850
So I think that's the opposite
experience of

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:50.360
what you just had.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.240
MEGAN SMITH: That's
really good.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.380
And you know, we talked about
Alan, but also credit to Larry

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:59.160
and Sergey, they've always been
really just open-minded

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.870
about talent inclusion, which
is the way I think of

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:07.510
diversity and just the way we
work, not only inventing

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:09.910
products but also how our
company should be.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.870
And early on, I was not there
for this, but Marissa tells

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:17.790
the story of Larry getting yet
another guy's resume for

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.520
engineering across his
desk to improve.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.100
And he just said OK, you get a
couple more of these, but if

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.590
there are no women in the queue,
there's no more hiring.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:31.390
And so to take that kind of
leadership as the CEO at the

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:33.900
time was really a significant
move.

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:34.850
And it sets the tone.

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:38.640
They always wear the Women at
Google shirts and the Gaygler

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.160
shirts, whatever.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.410
They're really sort of trying
to re-represent the company

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:42.810
back to us.

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:46.330
And so that's another, I guess,
action item, I'd say is

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.500
that ask your leaders
to team up with you.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.340
And maybe if you need to give
them some of these examples,

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:53.370
but they're there.

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:55.740
So I think we're at time.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:56.925
AUDIENCE: One question?

00:55:56.925 --> 00:55:57.800
MEGAN SMITH: Oh, one
more question, OK.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.210
AUDIENCE: It's a
quick question.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:01.120
I'm a software engineer.

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.980
And I interviewed at Google.

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.800
And I was interviewed
by all men.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.240
And I thought it would have
been advantageous for both

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.390
sides to have at least one
woman interview me.

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:12.100
And I was wondering what your
thoughts are on that.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:17.820
ANNA PATTERSON: We
try really hard.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.310
We used to have the rule, a hard
and fast rule that that

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.510
had to happen.

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:24.790
And as the company--

00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.680
we have different times
where we have

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.680
very fast hiring velocity.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:33.160
And so in one of those times,
it's relaxed a little bit.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.136
But it's usually a hard
and fast rule.

00:56:36.136 --> 00:56:36.800
MEGAN SMITH: It's important.

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.940
Important point.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.210
I guess we'll close with
something exciting that I

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:42.560
learned recently.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.860
Walter Isaacson, of course,
wrote the amazing book about

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:48.180
Steve Jobs' biography.

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.490
And I recently read that
he's working on a

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.130
biography of Ada Lovelace.

00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:57.730
And he's doing this because he
became aware of her from his

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.100
daughter who's 21
and I think just

00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.610
finishing in computer science.

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:04.900
And I had never heard of her
until I went to Silicon Valley

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.460
Comes to the UK.

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.955
And there's actually
a portrait of her

00:57:07.955 --> 00:57:09.000
at 10 Downing Street.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.550
We were lucky to be there for an
app-a-thon contest judging.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:13.860
And there she was.

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:17.960
And for those who don't know
her, she was teamed up with

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.330
Babbage on the Babbage engine.

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:22.610
And she was really the
first person--

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:25.670
not woman, not man-- first
person to come up with the

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:28.470
idea of sort of symbolics,
and the idea of what is

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.740
programming.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:33.360
It was a mechanical computer at
the time, but really, kind

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.660
of really the world's
first programmer

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.140
for symbolics thinker.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.800
So pretty exciting to see kind
of our history begin to come

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.555
back at us in that way.

00:57:44.555 --> 00:57:46.550
So I'm looking forward to
reading that book and learning

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:48.990
more and her inspiration
as we go forward.
