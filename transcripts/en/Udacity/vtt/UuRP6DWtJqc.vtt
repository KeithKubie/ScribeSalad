00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.850
In this introduction, we've covered what
machine learning is and what it can do.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.850
We've covered how to evaluate whether or
not you're ready, and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.450
what you're going to cover
over the next several months.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.030
Now it's time to get started.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.620
In the introduction to this [INAUDIBLE]
we're going to cover some of the big

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.780
picture ideas in machine learning.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.110
You're going to hear
from Charles Isabel and

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.450
Michael Lipmann's
machine learning class.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.640
You're going to hear from
Sebastian Thrune's intro to machine

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.700
learning class.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.810
You'll hear from Ashok Goyal and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.740
my knowledge based artificial
intelligence class.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.680
These are all materials meant to
give you a big picture view about

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.210
what machine learning is and
what it can do.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.890
And that's really the learning goal for

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.950
this particular unit of
this nano degree program.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.230
You don't yet need to worry about
how you do machine learning.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.340
You need to start off with
understanding of what machine learning

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.860
actually can do.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.810
So, try and
focus on what machine learning can do in

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.860
these first few videos.
