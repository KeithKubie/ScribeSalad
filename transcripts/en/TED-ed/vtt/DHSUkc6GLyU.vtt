00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:07.474
One question I've asked a lot is,

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.137
"What is a big challenge you want to overcome,

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:12.149
something in your life that you want to do?"

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.544
because that tells me a lot about that person,

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:17.821
and very often it's not directly related to the job,

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.215
and that's even more revealing.

00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:21.886
So, that would be the question

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:23.261
I'd definitely ask.
