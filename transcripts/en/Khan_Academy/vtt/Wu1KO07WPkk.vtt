00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.520
A theater has a total of 63
seats in a rectangular grid.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.370
Here they are, right over here.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.210
It currently has 9 rows, each
with an equal number of seats.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.230
We see that-- 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 rows.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.950
How many total
seats will it have

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.400
if it adds 2 seats per row?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
So what we want to figure out
is the total number of seats.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.520
So let's say that
the total is going

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.370
to be equal to the
number of seats

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.780
that the theater already has.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.760
And they tell us that they have
63 seats in a rectangular grid.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.450
So it's going to be 63
seats plus the new seats,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.350
plus however many it adds.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.490
So plus the new seats.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.820
Well, what are the
new seats going to be?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.730
Well, the new seats are
going to be-- I have 9 rows,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.250
and I'm adding 2 seats per row.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.470
So the new seats are going to
be 9 rows times 2 seats per row.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.500
So we could say
that the total is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.332
going to be equal to
63 plus 9 times 2.

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:19.290
And we 'll talk more
about order of operations.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.470
But clearly, in
this situation, we

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.900
want to multiply 9
times 2 to figure out

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.760
the total new number of seats.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.050
And then we want
to add that to 63.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.210
And if we just
write it like this,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.187
multiplication takes-- you
will always do multiplication.

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:36.020
And when you just see
it in a row like this,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.580
you'll do the multiplication
before you do the addition.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.954
So this is literally
saying, hey,

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:42.040
multiply 9 times
2 first, then add

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.460
to 63, which is exactly
what we care about.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.300
And what is 9 times 2?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.410
Well, let's add those
2 seats per row.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:02:10.330
So that's 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.690
So 2 times 9.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.120
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
14, 16, 18 is 18.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.387
So we're adding 18 new seats.

00:02:21.387 --> 00:02:22.470
So let me write this down.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.560
I covered up my old total.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.980
So total is equal to 63 plus 18.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.510
I had 63 seats.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.720
I'm now adding 18 seats.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.240
So total-- my total
number of seats--

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.440
is now going to be 63 plus 18.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.170
Let's see, 8 plus 3 is 11.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.020
60 plus 10 is 70.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.720
70 plus 11 is going to be--
I have 80-- I have 81 seats.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.871
I now have 9 rows with 9 seats
each, which gets me 81 total.
