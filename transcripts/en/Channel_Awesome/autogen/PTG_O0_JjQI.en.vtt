00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.090 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what they were going for
 

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what they were going for
that<00:16:11.450><c> right</c><00:16:11.600><c> bring</c><00:16:12.080><c> all</c><00:16:12.290><c> the</c><00:16:12.440><c> emotion</c><00:16:12.770><c> up</c>

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:37.220 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's chopped middle because I
 

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.470 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's chopped middle because I
don't<00:19:38.220><c> as</c><00:19:38.430><c> much</c><00:19:38.790><c> have</c><00:19:39.000><c> a</c><00:19:39.030><c> problem</c><00:19:39.360><c> the</c>

don't as much have a problem the
 

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.970 align:start position:0%
don't as much have a problem the

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:54.930 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
in<00:19:55.080><c> the</c><00:19:55.170><c> middle</c><00:19:55.410><c> -</c><00:19:55.790><c> it's</c><00:19:56.790><c> not</c><00:19:56.940><c> my</c><00:19:57.090><c> favorite</c><00:19:57.270><c> but</c>

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:57.570 align:start position:0%
in the middle - it's not my favorite but
 

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.890 align:start position:0%
in the middle - it's not my favorite but
it's<00:19:57.960><c> also</c><00:19:58.110><c> not</c><00:19:58.620><c> the</c><00:19:59.520><c> worst</c><00:19:59.880><c> and</c><00:20:00.300><c> I</c><00:20:00.390><c> guess</c><00:20:00.720><c> I</c>

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's also not the worst and I guess I
 

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's also not the worst and I guess I
might<00:20:01.170><c> put</c><00:20:01.440><c> it</c><00:20:01.470><c> just</c><00:20:02.160><c> above</c><00:20:02.910><c> first</c><00:20:03.600><c> flight</c>

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:03.930 align:start position:0%
might put it just above first flight
 

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.650 align:start position:0%
might put it just above first flight
