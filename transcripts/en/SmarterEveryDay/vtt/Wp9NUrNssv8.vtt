Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So the purpose of this particular video

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.110
is to convince you to click at the end of the video on one thing

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.180
that will change a child's life. If you're an evil person and you want to do bad things

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.240
to little kids, it's a well known fact you need to go to Iquitos Peru.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.280
It's the largest city in the world that's inaccessible by land, and because you can only get in and out

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.310
via boat or airplane, it's an awesome place to do bad things because

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.390
the government of Peru has a very low presence there. Three years ago my wife went

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.430
to check it out. She went to work on an orphanage with some friends of ours and she came back telling me stories

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.450
about these people called the..
- Street boys.
- OK. And why not girls?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.490
- Ahh, the mom gets knocked up multiple times, has these children,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.530
girls require less food, more valuable at home, the boys..

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.580
- So the dude leaves?
- Oh yeah.
- And you just pick which one's gonna make it.
- Right.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.650
- And so you kick the boy out.
- Right.
- Organized crime, abandoned children,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.710
they start exploiting the kids, get them hooked on drugs and then special tourists come to town to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.760
take advantage of the situation.
- Yes.
- Urgh. In a world of talkers

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.790
I have friends who want to be thinkers and doers. They started an organization called Not Forgotten

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.820
and they bought land in Peru and they're gonna build an orphanage to break this cycle of abandonment.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.890
Two years ago my buddy CJ had saved up a bunch of money and we headed down there

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.980
to break ground by building a septic tank.
- It's real. It's not monopoly.
- [laughs]

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.080
This just got real. [laugh] We hired a Peruvian construction

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.090
crew and worked for a week by shovelling concrete and overseeing the engineering of the project.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.150
(Destin in Spanish) It's important it's perfect for my poo.
- [laughs]

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.200
[snoring]

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.200
 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.250
- And that's what you call a siesta. [laughter]

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.300
I uploaded the video last year and asked you to vote on a two day fundraiser called the Project For Awesome.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.350
Because you did this, and Not Forgotten was one of the top charities voted on, we got

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.410
$40,000 for the Project For Awesome, and you gave $10,000

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.460
directly to Not Forgotten. Now I personally couldn't head down there this year but I bet you're wondering

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.480
how we spent $50,000 in the Peruvian amazon.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.530
- Yeah great question Destin. Actually we're standing here with Fidel. You remember him from the last video last time

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.590
we were here. So Fidel do you wish Destin were here?
- No. [laugh]

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.640
- No. Do you think we'd be much more efficient if he were here helping us?
- No.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.710
- Really? Just remember CJ. I edit the video, and I get to show people how you sleep

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.840
when you're in the jungle. You gonna be done pretty quick?
- (groaning) Uhhh.. I think we're gonna be done right on time.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.760
- Anyway, when we were there, the land was rough

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.820
and it needed to be worked. So we used the money to rent equipment and fuel and begin to shape the land

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.860
to prepare it for building. We installed a power pole, we planted an orchard, we got a water cistern.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.870
I'll let CJ show you some of the big stuff that we've built so far.
- Alright so check this out. I'm standing

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.880
on the brick wall that we're building this week. We've got a team of folks down here. This is our project

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
it's gonna run along the front side of the perimeter of the orphanage. So you remember the last time you were here we had

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.940
that much smaller pond that was off to my left. Well now we have a much larger

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.980
reservoir and we're standing on a brand new retention wall that we've recently put in.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.060
Before we did any of that, before we built anything that we've recently showed you, we had to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.070
do one important thing, and that's build a soccer field.
- So the next step is to build

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.120
the orphanage buildings themselves. The idea is to make small modular buildings that'll house 8

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.140
kids each, so that we can actually complete a building as we get money. So there you have it.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.170
We're building an orphanage in Peru with the intent of breaking the cycle of abandonment.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.260
We want to educate the kids, we want to teach them a trade, and we want to show them what it's like to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.310
be a good father. This is the part where I want your click. If you're on board with this idea, I need you to go

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.350
to the Project For Awesome website and go vote for Not Forgotten. This is only

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.390
open for two days, and if we're one of the top charities, we're gonna build buildings and get kids

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.410
off the street. We're not playing here, this is the real deal. So if you can go vote for that

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.460
I would appreciate it, but more importantly if you would tell your friends to vote. If we're in the top,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.470
we save a kid's life. We're not gonna take the money, no organizational costs,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.480
straight to Peru. If you're watching this and it's past the voting time, I'll leave info below to tell you

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.520
if we won or not, and also I'll leave a link over here for anybody

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.570
that's interested, where you can donate directly to Not Forgotten, and you have my word

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.620
any money that's donated there, or money that we get from Project for Awesome will go directly

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.670
to the building and operation of this orphanage in Peru. We will take no overhead

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.720
or operational money out of it. I think PayPal does, or something like that.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.740
Anyway, I'll leave you with the boys in Peru saying thank you for

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.790
the money you gave them last year. Can you say thank you in Spanish? You know how to say that?

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.810
- Gracias.
- There you go, very good. Anyway,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.860
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, you should be clicking something over there about now. Thanks.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.890
- Gracias Project for Awesome.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.920
- Thank you Project For Awesome.

(Group in unison) Gracias!

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.922
