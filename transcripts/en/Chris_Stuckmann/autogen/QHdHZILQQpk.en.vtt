or push back it's because it isn't
 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.709
or push back it's because it isn't
really that good or because the studio

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719
really that good or because the studio
 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.089
really that good or because the studio
doesn't have confidence in it but this

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460
the reasoning behind pulling it and
 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.459

not that was a stupid stupid decision

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180
not that was a stupid stupid decision
 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.420
not that was a stupid stupid decision
but it languished for a while in

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430
but it languished for a while in
 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.640
but it languished for a while in
obscurity where it was just not released

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650
obscurity where it was just not released
 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.080
obscurity where it was just not released
and finally they just released it to

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090

thought about trying to write like an

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:42.970
thought about trying to write like an
 

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.940

because you kind of have to like make a

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:46.690
because you kind of have to like make a
 

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.110
because you kind of have to like make a
timeline first of what actually happened

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120
timeline first of what actually happened
 

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.400
timeline first of what actually happened

and then you can take all those pieces
and shuffle them around in different

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.030
and shuffle them around in different
 

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.120
and shuffle them around in different
ways and they intersect really well and

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.130
ways and they intersect really well and
 

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.160
ways and they intersect really well and
