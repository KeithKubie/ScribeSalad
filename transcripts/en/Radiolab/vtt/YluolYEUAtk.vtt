00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.840
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y.

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.100
S. E. N. N. P. R. Who's the gentleman we're on the air with? Not, oh,

3
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.760
there's going to be two of us. So one of them is named Jab. That's not me.

4
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.481
His name is Jad.

5
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:23.280
Like his parents call him Jad Jad but if jad really had they been drinking?

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.130
No, they live in these [inaudible] so we're going to begin the show with this

7
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.210
delightful duo. I'm Julie. Julie Moss. I'm Wendy Gwendy Ingram. Hi Julie.

8
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.480
Hi Wendy. Hi Jad. They've been friends for a really long time.

9
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.630
Remember that one time you bought all that? Everything in a tube.

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.810
They both like to travel.

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.070
They both like to shop and they both like to run really long distances until

12
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:51.240
they collapse usually in front of millions of people. Now, Wendy,

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.810
Wendy was a classic athlete from day one who was apparently born this way.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.290
Her mother tells me how she had to channel her energy into sports. A. Yeah.

15
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.350
I always considered myself a science project.

16
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
What do you mean we, we'd been created. We have hands, feet.

17
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.580
We have a mind. We have lungs, we have a heart. Let's see what it can do. Wendy,

18
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.520
we're very opposite in that, that Julie,

19
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.600
Julia is an entirely different story and we're going to tell you that story in

20
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:21.690
just a moment. But first we should say this is Radiolab. I'm Chad Apple,

21
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.410
Ron and I'm Robert Krulwich topic today is limits,

22
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.600
limits of the body.

23
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.230
Rest right there in the limits of the brain and finally the limits of what we

24
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.270
can know about everything.

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.461
Julie,

26
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:39.750
how did you get interested in this race that you're about to tell us about?

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.110
Was it like a, like an impulse or something? Well, no,

28
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:47.510
it was a requirement to graduate. I had, I had to do a, um,

29
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.710
it's called a senior senior project.

30
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:54.060
I went to cal poly San Luis Obispo in California and I, I was a PE major,

31
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:57.840
which now I said, you mean? Yeah. And I that was just by default.

32
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.350
I was a California surfer girl. I started surfing at 14,

33
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.050
but I needed a senior project and there I was in, um,

34
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.780
1981. Yeah,

35
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.630
<v 1>watching TV instead of studying. Then</v>

36
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.640
<v 0>in on comes ABC wild rose</v>

37
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.890
<v 1>sports brought to you by advisor voice</v>

38
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.600
<v 0>from Hawaii and I watched it and it just sucked me in.</v>

39
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.160
This must have been like really early ironman. Oh yeah.

40
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:32.360
I think it was the fourth one and I thought it's in Hawaii. It's great.

41
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.610
I know my mom will pay for it because this is,

42
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.500
I have to do this project for school and so I started doing research on it and

43
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:41.750
this, just so we know this is you, you, you swim, you bike, you run.

44
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:44.690
That's the order. You swim 2.4 miles,

45
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.520
you ride 112 miles and then you run a marathon. So it was,

46
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:50.520
wait a second though. Go ahead.

47
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.560
That seems like a major decision to want to go 140 I mean were you at triathlete

48
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.980
type person at that point in your life? Had you ran a marathon before?

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.450
It was conceptual. Those were just the distances. Those were numbers.

50
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.750
That wasn't reality. It was just you were in Hawaii.

51
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.060
By the time I got off the plane to do the Ironman,

52
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.890
I still hadn't completed the total distance that I'd need to do on the bike or

53
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.180
the swam. Oh my God. Wow. But I wasn't going over there to be competitive.

54
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.190
I was going over there to do this event, have fun in Hawaii,

55
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.160
and then I'll write up some sort of bogus, you know,

56
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.980
physiological consequences or something. But I really just,

57
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.090
I thought I was taking the easy way out.

58
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.260
When you got off the bus or you walked into the room where the other ones were,

59
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.430
did you suddenly think, oh yeah. I mean people were taking it very seriously.

60
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.620
People had coordinated outfits and I thought,

61
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:49.090
I am feeling a little like, um, the country mouse, you know? So I,

62
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.890
I think when race day rolled around, it was,

63
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.020
it was sort of my day to get through and never do again. I mean, it was really,

64
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:59.740
this is a onetime thing, so let's show, should we run the race? Yeah. So, okay,

65
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.740
let's just, you do the first two legs to swimming and then the biking.

66
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.460
I'm doing really well. You see me on the bike, I'm riding along,

67
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:10.090
I mean from the old coverage of ABC. I'm smiling at the camera.

68
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.280
I'm certainly not in an aerodynamic position.

69
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.840
Why would you want to be all crouched over when you keep sitting up smiling?

70
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.340
That was your beauty queen. I was doing parade waves.

71
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.400
I really was loving the attention. And, um,

72
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.580
I had a snickers bar early on the bike ride,

73
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.200
and I keep thinking if I'd only eaten that snickers bar instead of throwing it

74
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.840
away, ABC came up on a camera on there.

75
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:39.070
I was trying to open this melted snickers bar with my teeth and all of a sudden

76
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:40.720
there's a camera and it's like, oh my gosh,

77
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.740
I don't want to be messy on national TV. So I ditched this,

78
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.010
this beautiful snickers bar and you know, yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.890
<v 2>Okay. Skipping to the third leg of the race, Julie's through the swim.</v>

80
00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:59.100
She's through the 112 mile bike ride onto the marathon.

81
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.560
<v 0>I came off the bike. Uh, they told me there's a woman ahead of you at,</v>

82
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.060
she was a top notch cyclist. Oh, so you were in second place? Yeah. Whoa, Whoa,

83
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.700
Whoa, whoa. How could this happen? I was doing really well.

84
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:15.580
And I started on the run and the one gal who had had a great bike ride had a,

85
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.980
uh, an Achilles injury and sure enough, five, I think about eight miles or so,

86
00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:23.160
I caught her and there I am in the lead. Wow.

87
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.350
And all of a sudden it was a little, um, things started to shift.

88
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.020
<v 2>I'm, I'm, I'm good at something</v>

89
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.290
<v 0>and somebody is trying to take it away from me.</v>

90
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.680
And that was the woman who was in second place, Kathleen McCartney.

91
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.570
And even though she was a mile away,

92
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.260
it felt like she was breathing down my neck and trying to take something that

93
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:51.300
now I was becoming very attached to.

94
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.590
I was also starting to fall apart physically. What were those early signs?

95
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.870
I'm cramping and a feeling that you weren't digesting your food,

96
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.410
that everything was sort of sitting there, sloshing around Wendy's laughing.

97
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.680
If she's good, this is serious moment and she's laughing about it.

98
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.853
<v 1>Nanny case</v>

99
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.240
Sinally Julie makes it to the last little EDBD stretch of the race.

100
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.320
Probably about, oh,

101
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:20.300
about 400 meters from the finish and she's still in first place to do Julie,

102
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.660
let's do this. I'm actually, as we're talking, I'm watching you on a Youtube,

103
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.590
oh stinker. But I just wanted to take me into your head

104
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.580
<v 0>these final moments cause it's, it's just like,</v>

105
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:35.910
it's unwatchable but you can't turn away. Yeah, it's a train wreck.

106
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.060
<v 3>So I'm looking at you now and you're running and it's dark as people like on</v>

107
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.530
both sides cheering you until you're running and then you're slowing down

108
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.020
and you really slowing down and you're walking a little bit like you're on

109
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:55.220
stilts and then great here.

110
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.470
Your legs give out. They give out

111
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.000
and I couldn't get back up.

112
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.170
<v 1>I mean I get up and my legs wouldn't work.</v>

113
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.300
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

114
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.110
<v 1>So I actually, I sort of laid there on the ground and um,</v>

115
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.040
I figured out if I put my arms in front of me and leaned on my arms,

116
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:26.330
they would sort of form like a tripod and I could sort of lean on my arms and

117
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:28.620
kind of got one leg up and one leg up and,

118
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.300
and kind of staggered to a walk and started walking again.

119
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.440
All right, now you're walking again, but you're like junk monkey. Yeah.

120
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.390
Really wobbly. Yeah. No.

121
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:45.320
All this time your conscious that number two is getting closer and closer.

122
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.660
Are you, are you out? Are you conscious? I've heard all, oh yeah. Oh yeah.

123
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.390
And I had to keep finding a way to keep going and my thought was,

124
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.240
this is mine. Oh, you just fell again.

125
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.470
<v 3>Oh yeah,</v>

126
00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.830
<v 1>yeah. See this is the one that gets me right here.</v>

127
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.720
You fall down and it's in your arms. Go back. It's like you're dying. Yeah.

128
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:06.550
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

129
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.610
<v 1>and um,</v>

130
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.620
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

131
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.800
<v 1>as I was putting one hand in front of the other, I saw this,</v>

132
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.720
this pair of tennies go by and a these legs and I thought that's her.

133
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.920
She's gone by me

134
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.610
<v 0>and it was just, I just thought I quit.</v>

135
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.053
<v 3>Okay.</v>

136
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.140
<v 0>I just thought, I can't say it on national public radio, but effort,</v>

137
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.630
effort and all of a sudden,

138
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.103
<v 3>okay,</v>

139
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.990
<v 0>there's this voice that just said, get up, get up.</v>

140
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.850
Just keep moving forward.

141
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.230
I could see the finish line about 10 feet in front of me and I thought Getta I

142
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:57.240
cannot, I can't get up again. I really, I'd get up. Do not think I've,

143
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:01.590
I've sort of worn out that tactic. Get up, but I can crawl

144
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.243
<v 1>well fine.</v>

145
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.800
And I crawl and so here I am coming along and,

146
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.690
and the TV, camera lights, you're blinding me in. No one's helping her.

147
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.560
My life was going to be different. I mean I felt my life changing.

148
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.560
I made a deal with myself. A deal was struck and I don't care if it hurts,

149
00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:28.880
I don't care if it's messy. I don't care how it looks. I would finish,

150
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.340
I would finish, finish

151
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:34.740
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

152
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.390
<v 1>so Julie Moss crawls the last 10 feet of the race, literally an inch at a time.</v>

153
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:45.110
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

154
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.070
<v 1>that whole time the cameras are on her and they capture everything.</v>

155
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:50.750
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

156
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.510
<v 1>and I mean everything. Yeah. I, um,</v>

157
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.090
I pooped my pants on national TV.

158
00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:59.180
It doesn't get more shameful that from that when d teases me all the time,

159
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.800
you know, you were [inaudible]

160
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.950
<v 0>chocolate mess from, you know, one way or the other.</v>

161
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.280
You can get up there and do this next thing. But it was, it was a,

162
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.790
it was a pivotal moment in my life and to the stage. Julie says,

163
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.200
the person she is now,

164
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.390
it all began with that voice that, uh,

165
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.920
that I hadn't ever called upon that just said, keep moving forward. Well,

166
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.720
that's the thing that gets to me is like, it didn't say to you, you can't, it,

167
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.130
it actually said exactly the opposite. I'm isn't that cool?

168
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.300
I would have thought it would have said, stop. Come on. Stop.

169
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.730
<v 2>Well, I doubt you. Look [inaudible]</v>

170
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.950
<v 0>ego. That's your ego that will come in and sabotage your real self.</v>

171
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.000
There is no limit. You know? I really believe that and I just,

172
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.270
I absolutely do. No, no limit. Nope.

173
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.980
<v 2>[inaudible] nope,</v>

174
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.050
nope. [inaudible] yeah, no.

175
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.150
Let's take seriously what Julia Mazda said. No limits.

176
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.810
I think she meant the psychologically yes. I mean they are obviously limits.

177
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:18.950
If she, well, yes, they could die. You could die. Yeah. But short of that,

178
00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:22.970
you would say it is her muscles that are determining the limits. Right, exactly.

179
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.450
And the sale your muscle cells. Yeah. Let's just question that for a second.

180
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.550
Let me introduce you to it. To a

181
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.270
<v 0>guy. His name is, uh, what's his name? David Joe.</v>

182
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.180
His name is David Jones. Hi. Hi. Miss Him.

183
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:38.810
He's retired physiologist and much point in university and he's got a slight

184
00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:41.840
condition that interferes with his speech, just so you know. Okay. Anyways,

185
00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:44.900
he did a study, two studies actually that involved bikers.

186
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.420
He's on experiments likeness.

187
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.890
He'll have these people ride stationary bikes for really long distances. Yeah.

188
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.130
All the while he'll shoot their muscles full of sugar, like with an IV.

189
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.780
<v 4>[inaudible] actioning it.</v>

190
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.740
Extremely high levels of [inaudible] guys in the plant. How much?

191
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.040
Like a whole energy drinks worth of sugar straight into their blood. Oh,

192
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.240
more than that. Formally and prominent several energy drinks. Oh No.

193
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:07.931
Theoretically,

194
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:10.990
if it's your muscles that are controlling how far and fast you bike,

195
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.000
you should get this injection and just be like,

196
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.290
I shouldn't be performing miracles. That's fine. But it never works.

197
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.270
It never works. Yeah. People who,

198
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.720
who have sugar in their muscles do the same as people who don't. That's not,

199
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:27.430
it doesn't work at all, man. I'm seeing their difference now, the Holden's Whoa,

200
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:28.780
bad news for sugar.

201
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.190
And what it suggests is that our muscles have way less to do with our limits

202
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:36.880
than we think, which raises the obvious question. What is making the difference?

203
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.130
So now I'm going to tell you about the second study, which I completely like.

204
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.640
Find mind blowing. Oh, that's a hard study to summarize, but I'm gonna try.

205
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.880
Okay. You, so you with me, with you so far you haven't started yet though.

206
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.810
That totally is a good place to be. I need your full participation and interest.

207
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.531
Okay. Okay.

208
00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:55.830
So he does a study where he puts a bunch of bikers on bikes and he has them

209
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.810
peddle a lot, is about 40 kilometers, long distance now he's got two groups.

210
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.240
Each group gets an energy drink,

211
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.060
which they sort of have to drink while biking while biking,

212
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:10.150
except that they don't drink it. The rule is they don't actually drink it.

213
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:13.700
They just swish it in their mouth and ascension out. Swish and spit.

214
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.680
That's right. That's what they do. Swish, spit, bike, swish, spit by. Whoa.

215
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.170
Wouldn't want to be the towel guy in this particular experiment. Well,

216
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:23.320
I really have scientists with buckets who just stand next to them and then I

217
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:24.640
spent in an apartment. Okay,

218
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.730
so half the people get real energy drink to swish and spit.

219
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.160
Yeah.

220
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.980
Half the people get fake energy drink to swish and spit and I might of times the

221
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.930
same and nobody knows who's getting what. It's the normal line.

222
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.230
So you would think in this scenario that nobody should get any benefit from this

223
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:46.350
because no one's actually drinking the drink, nothing's getting into the body.

224
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.340
Or let's say like the taste creates a placebo effect.

225
00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:52.470
Well then everybody should get the placebo effect equal.

226
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:56.100
Everybody should get it. But here's the thing. Only the people who switched,

227
00:13:56.101 --> 00:14:00.360
switched, not drank, but switched the real energy drink. Got a boost.

228
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.590
Oh, how much of a boost in seven minutes or a couple of minutes. Whoa.

229
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.950
That's a lot. Yeah, I'm minutes Max demonstrating, you know,

230
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:10.530
finishing [inaudible] lost. Yeah. So let me think here,

231
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.540
but don't say anything for a minute. Let me think about this.

232
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.660
So maybe some thing in the first set of athletes who got the real drink,

233
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:25.930
something inside the new something.

234
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.760
Here's the big theory. Do you want the little theory of the big one first? Well,

235
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:36.160
I'd like the big theory briefly. Okay. The big one briefly.

236
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.880
There's an idea that's been floating around for a while called the central

237
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.820
governor theory, which has it inside your head.

238
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:45.760
There's this little circuit which just starting to see on brain scans,

239
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.820
there's this little circuit that governs your energy supply and when it feels

240
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.130
like you're in danger of running

241
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.150
<v 0>low, it'll trigger signals of pain</v>

242
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.200
to be sent to your body to try and get you to rest.

243
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.810
Now what scientists are finding is that this governor circuit is really

244
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:06.644
conservative.

245
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.760
It'll send you a pain to try and get you to stop way before you are out of

246
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:15.110
juice. So with your a fuel tank, they would flash e e for empty,

247
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:16.610
but you get a quarter tank left.

248
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.270
So what might be happening with these bikers is it the sugar is landing on their

249
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:23.624
tongue.

250
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.780
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

251
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.690
<v 0>the tongue sees the sugar, sends a message to the brain.</v>

252
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.650
The governor sees this message and says, Oh,

253
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.210
if we're about to get some energy then it's okay for you to spend some energy.

254
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.910
And let me just give you some from my secret stash over here.

255
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.950
And so you feel a boost

256
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.493
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

257
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.850
<v 0>the conjecture here is you have a reservoir of extra stuff,</v>

258
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.140
but it is so deeply disguised that you can't even know that it's there.

259
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.160
Exactly. And to skip to the punchline, when you feel tired,

260
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:04.200
Mr k [inaudible] not just tired, when you are dead spent. Well you are spent.

261
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.930
Yeah. Which does not feel like a subjective thing at all.

262
00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:10.260
That feels like an objective reality. You are done. Well in fact,

263
00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:12.000
at that moment, maybe you're not.

264
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.920
Maybe you're just feeling the effects of that little governor lying to you. Uh,

265
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.380
which raises the question, what if you could live back to her

266
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.470
then, how far could you go?

267
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.690
<v 4>So with all that in mind, I'm going gonna kick it up a notch.</v>

268
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.430
Let me tell you about this competition called the ride across America.

269
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.350
It should really be called the ride into the fire depths of despair.

270
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.360
But we're going to call it a the right across quite the zing that the sponsor

271
00:16:42.361 --> 00:16:46.640
wanted. The, those where I live, Wrigley's smear with go.

272
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.740
We heard about this first from a reporter named Daniel Coil.

273
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.050
So what is the right across America?

274
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:57.170
It is basically, it's an insane event. You,

275
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.150
you'd get on a bike in California and you bike across the country, 3000 miles,

276
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.730
the equivalent of four Mount Everest.

277
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.750
And they don't sleep at all. No. They will sleep.

278
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:12.180
They'll sleep a an hour a day, two hours a day, um,

279
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.800
hour a day. Yeah. So if, if this is a 10 day race,

280
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:20.560
they will sleep for 10 hours over the length of the race. Yeah.

281
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:25.730
It's a race that is designed to reveal what human limits are.

282
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.850
Who Does it? Can you describe the kinds of people who are attracted to this? No,

283
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:35.180
I think they come from all walks of life. They come from all over the globe.

284
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.540
It's a really interesting cross section. We actually got curious about this.

285
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:41.870
So we sent our producer, Lulu Miller to track down a few of these guys.

286
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:46.520
Two guys. Who'd you find? Well, the first one? Yes. His name is Patrick.

287
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.070
Patrick. You say I'm 47 years old from France. He's the

288
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.670
<v 5>rookie. Had you done any kind of long distance cycling before? No. No, no, no,</v>

289
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.460
no. He's actually a scientist. [inaudible] yeah, got a wife. Two kids. Okay.

290
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.700
And then we've got the champion. Okay. Hello? You right here.

291
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.500
So this is your aerobic.

292
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.760
He's won this thing four times and on the back he's a killer.

293
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.740
<v 6>My Body [inaudible] I can go also in the rain or cold or the heat job as he's a</v>

294
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:18.360
soldier implied by a Slovenian army. What else? What would you like to know?

295
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.213
Okay,

296
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.080
<v 7>2005 wow.</v>

297
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.510
This start with Sydney in San Diego. Touched

298
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.950
[inaudible] like 20 people or a hundred people. 25,

299
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:35.870
I think to the tape you're hearing right now is actual footage from that deck

300
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.980
got backdrop turned out the year he did it.

301
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.530
There was actually a film crew there following every single ride and so I was

302
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.690
really scared and scared him. Not Uri though. No,

303
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.740
he's just in front of Patrick. I really, uh, I would say in English, uh,

304
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.590
I'm literally shoring myself. [inaudible]

305
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.143
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

306
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.940
<v 8>it's easy. You just start your engine and go.</v>

307
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:05.420
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

308
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.510
<v 8>For me and c site, they didn't know what to expect.</v>

309
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.760
I was feeling very consultative.

310
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.170
<v 7>I have the back of the back.</v>

311
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.860
14 states, 3000 miles to go. They don't go very fast.

312
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.250
They'll cross the country going about 13, 14 miles an hour,

313
00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:30.250
which any 11 year old couldn't ride for a Taco.

314
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:36.150
The difference is that they just told stop seven hours later.

315
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.660
California desert, it's really hot.

316
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.310
My Watch says 109 degrees. We're in the shade and the car,

317
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.790
this is Steve Toady,

318
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.840
the camera guy following Patrick in a van [inaudible] out here climbing a hill.

319
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.970
I've never experienced this kind of temperature.

320
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.950
Do you have any hubby then and 10 Friday night,

321
00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.940
then 150 miles later,

322
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.470
Arizona running hills since it

323
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.180
200 300 million.

324
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.790
Then the sign is rising for

325
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.190
500 it's 10 very hot

326
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.040
then correct.

327
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.220
The mountains and the big mountains. You're using the lead.

328
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.730
He's just crested the top of the 12 mile climb.

329
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.170
It was during the middle of the night. It was just raining,

330
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.990
heavy rain. It begins to coast downward sanding could without Beverly

331
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.210
and after two kilometers I was completely frozen,

332
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.710
shaking like I was electrical. Your bed is like a hamburger. Oh yeah.

333
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.820
I mean it's all red. You don't have any skin at all. I mean,

334
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:02.080
the pike is the most efficient machine for creating suffering ever.

335
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.130
The pressures on your hands, the pressure is on your neck.

336
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.440
This British guy named Chris Hopkinson halfway through the race and his neck was

337
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.810
just given out. People whose necks have given out,

338
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.970
we'll take duct tape and literally tie their heads up.

339
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.390
They'll, they'll put a core to the back of their helmet and then pin it,

340
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.640
say to their belt, Jesus, God. So that they can look, cause they're,

341
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.990
they can no longer hold their heads up. God,

342
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.660
<v 5>the is like waves,</v>

343
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.370
<v 7>you know, and I don't know why he's dead, but it is, uh,</v>

344
00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.060
it's like waste. It's coming. Can, it's going.

345
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:47.090
It's a WHO's going to lose assuming that the central governor circuits inside

346
00:21:48.271 --> 00:21:50.760
the heads of all these riders are creating those waves of pain.

347
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.450
How do they soldier on? How do they ignore it?

348
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.680
<v 5>Well, I asked them that and they each sort of have different techniques.</v>

349
00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.373
So Patrick,

350
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.410
<v 7>just start shouting back at it. Literally.</v>

351
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.950
<v 5>Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Any Uri? Well,</v>

352
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.560
he gets his crew to come up alongside him and Blair

353
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.950
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

354
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:17.890
<v 8>Slovenian war songs speak us. Yeah, very loudly.</v>

355
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.650
Is that what we're hearing? It is. This is him on his bike during the race.

356
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.673
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

357
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.160
<v 5>but then they hit the halfway point. I don't know if you've been to Ken before.</v>

358
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.800
I don't know. It's awful.

359
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.370
Scenery gets really monotonous and you don't have any sightseeing,

360
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.780
nothing more than that.

361
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.370
They've gone over a thousand miles without sleeping basically.

362
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.240
And that's where we see the sort of really interesting stuff start to happen.

363
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.730
It's here that we can catch a glimpse of the hidden potential of the human body.

364
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.640
If you've done everything, if you've handled the heat and hydration,

365
00:23:01.641 --> 00:23:05.600
if your infrastructure is solid, all the stress goes to the last point,

366
00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:07.790
which is the mind. Um, it,

367
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.790
Ken's very suddenly it was doc.

368
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.850
I were in a forest and very quickly the environment got very um,

369
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.740
accuracy. He said he saw shadows running across the road.

370
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.140
It looked like the trees were trying to reach out to get him.

371
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.260
I was starting to have nightmares, but I was awake.

372
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.770
These kinds of hallucinations are just a fact of the race.

373
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.500
People seeing secret code in the cracks of the road,

374
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.280
riders jumping off their bikes to square off and fight mailboxes.

375
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.330
It's what breaks a lot of people. Strangely,

376
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.820
these kinds of hallucinations might be the very key to Uri.

377
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.230
I saw every single,

378
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:51.330
I mean a lot of like monsters like zombies.

379
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.940
He's gonna attack, you know? And why would that help him? Well for me,

380
00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:58.400
it was really think about why the central governor's in place or the system

381
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.930
that's designed to always keep an emergency stash of energy there for you should

382
00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:03.591
you ever need it.

383
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:08.030
So those feelings of pain are really just a way of safeguarding that last little

384
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:11.960
stash of energy that you could use if you absolutely had to. Yeah.

385
00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:13.730
Like if your life was on the line or something, that's right,

386
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.140
but what if you are convinced and therefore your central governor was convinced

387
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.480
that your life really was on the line

388
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.030
that year when you got to Ohio, he, he hallucinated that there were

389
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.240
<v 7>Lucia [inaudible], Dean's or Afghan horsemen chasing him. Yeah,</v>

390
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.220
with a gun, with just shot gun. And I said to bikers to fate,

391
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.880
they out of shooting gas, come on, come on, two 17 we are soldiers.

392
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.430
Do something to this idea or attack.

393
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.210
The interesting thing about that is that is the way in which his team sees him

394
00:24:45.211 --> 00:24:49.380
hallucinating. Lose your hygiene and their reaction is, oh yeah,

395
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.950
we see them to go your, to your mind when you are escaped, why?

396
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.270
Because they're gaining on us. They're gaining on it. It's funny, you know,

397
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.990
but for me it was not funny.

398
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.790
<v 5>They will use his hallucination as, as fuel and they,</v>

399
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.390
they make no bones about it. And when you see that,

400
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.060
that's my dad's planning check, Uris, crew chief,

401
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.120
<v 9>when you see him riding that fast after five,</v>

402
00:25:12.121 --> 00:25:16.050
six days almost dying on the bike and then suddenly he explodes,

403
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.250
your hair on your arm would go up on your neck would go up. And then, you know,

404
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.840
that's, that's why we are there because it's,

405
00:25:24.841 --> 00:25:28.260
you don't want to miss that moment because this is something out of this world.

406
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.780
<v 5>He says that during the hallucinations, I mean, the pain is gone. Does it go,</v>

407
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.850
does it go away? Completely? Yeah.

408
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:40.970
But the tradeoff is that when he watches videos of himself like this punching

409
00:25:41.341 --> 00:25:44.340
mailboxes and throwing his bike into a ditch, he says,

410
00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:48.380
it's actually painful to watch. You know, it's really

411
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:53.260
<v 7>tough for me to look into myself in this video was in these films. Uh, I'll do,</v>

412
00:25:53.261 --> 00:25:55.780
I might be going.

413
00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.660
<v 5>The reality is he's looking at a madman. It's not to me, that's,</v>

414
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:05.200
that's not me. Yeah. See now I'm thinking like Daniel,

415
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.480
like if madness is the key,

416
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.360
right to tricking your central governor and to giving you access to the,

417
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.253
did that energy,

418
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.530
does that mean that if Robert and I went mad in that particular way that we

419
00:26:17.531 --> 00:26:20.680
would suddenly be really athletic? I mean,

420
00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:24.700
are there actually seriously cases like that mother was actually in the early 19

421
00:26:24.701 --> 00:26:24.971
hundreds.

422
00:26:24.971 --> 00:26:29.950
There was a doctor named Auguste [inaudible] who noticed a mental patient making

423
00:26:29.951 --> 00:26:34.951
a leap in an asylum and he measured the leap and it compared rather favorably to

424
00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:38.440
the world record at the time. Yeah.

425
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.850
And he was one of the early sort of propagators of this governor theory that Oh,

426
00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:45.900
obviously this patient from whom all the sort of governors had been lifted was

427
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:48.840
capable of, um, a feat of astounding strength.

428
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.070
<v 2>Absolutely. What happened at the end of the race? Well,</v>

429
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.740
<v 7>Harry wins. I won the Ram.</v>

430
00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.760
That's the sound team. And what about Patrick?

431
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.050
<v 5>Well, let's rewind a couple of days.</v>

432
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.530
He's just crossed the halfway point Mount Vernon, Kansas,

433
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.480
and he decides to hop off his bike, take a quick break. And he's in the van.

434
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.440
He checks his email just to give me some motivation and he sees an email from

435
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:26.110
one of his friends. He said, we're so sad that, uh, the Dr Breedlove accident,

436
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.200
Patrick had no idea what this guy was talking about,

437
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.080
but it appeared to suggest that one of the 25 riders,

438
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.170
a guy named Dr Bob Breedlove had just been hurt.

439
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.480
And so I asked when I'm a crew member, uh,

440
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.100
what happened was Dr Breedlove and he said, well, uh,

441
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.570
it got an accident and he died

442
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.550
on the race during the race. Yeah.

443
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:53.770
[inaudible] and so when he's, when he, when he told me this,

444
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.090
I mean, immediately I was, I was, I mean, I was, I was, I mean, I mean,

445
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.610
nothing is shocked, but, uh, I was done.

446
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.450
<v 7>I understand Patrick. I feel bad too, obviously.</v>

447
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.700
And so it's happened teeth today. The commandment tried to, to push me both.

448
00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.620
They would be pointless to, to stop here where you have a wide shoulder,

449
00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.630
a van right behind you, who's going to coat [inaudible] and, oh,

450
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.200
well, sorry. But a petri just fell down the road.

451
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.560
And so he's asking [inaudible] or even even even worst,

452
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.060
I have kids and I voice I went to, I went to found this phrase,

453
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.280
I understand Patrick put how far the next time station. Why don't we go there?

454
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.990
[inaudible] I don't want to continue that. That's what he said.

455
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.130
That's okay. I don't want to continue that. I'm just saying,

456
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.290
let's not throw in the towel just yet.

457
00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.410
<v 5>So after that, I mean, uh, I started writing again. [inaudible]</v>

458
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.650
<v 7>but uh, for them</v>

459
00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:00.630
it was a magical night is very, uh, very well, a beautiful night,

460
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.920
<v 5>no class, nothing. And as always, his crews cheering him on,</v>

461
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:07.993
trying to pump them up.

462
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.710
<v 7>Yeah. Patrick, can I ask you why you're doing this? What?</v>

463
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.420
Can I ask you a question or daddy want to talk?

464
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.310
Why are you doing this? But

465
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.210
he's not saying it anything back for hours.

466
00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:31.743
And

467
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.750
then around one in the morning, Patrick says,

468
00:29:37.751 --> 00:29:39.730
his mind just goes quiet, quiet,

469
00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.870
<v 5>completely silent.</v>

470
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.330
<v 4>Out of that silence, he said he heard a voice that said simply,</v>

471
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.430
<v 3>you stop. Stop.</v>

472
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.960
<v 4>I saw, that's what I did. I said,</v>

473
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.530
<v 10>I'm done. I'm done. Done.</v>

474
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:04.890
You asked me a question on here. Remember why I was doing that? Yeah,

475
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:09.150
right there. Because we just wanted to test my limits.

476
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.870
Physical enemy and mental, and I touched twice this week,

477
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.850
yesterday morning and this morning and I don't want to read that again.

478
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.700
<v 3>I quit. That's it.</v>

479
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.553
Huh?

480
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:31.010
<v 4>I'm trying to figure out who I would honor more. Yeah.</v>

481
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.210
The winner of the race or the land who insisted on losing.

482
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.270
I'm 40 I've got kids. I identified more with the guy who stopped. Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.500
But I think also you,

484
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:45.580
you see the guy who wins and it makes you ask big questions about what's

485
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:49.690
possible. Yeah. Like how do you do that? Yeah.

486
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.390
I don't know that I'd want to be that guy or even hang out with them.

487
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.650
Probably like the second guy. I know. I'd like the second guy. Oh, Ben,

488
00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:59.260
what do you think? I find myself looking at both of them,

489
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.640
kind of with my jaw on the floor.

490
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.173
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

491
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.750
<v 4>Daniel Coyle. His latest book is called the talent [inaudible].</v>

492
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.940
<v 5>Yeah, and a huge thanks to Stephen Auerbach who made the film bicycle dreams.</v>

493
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.350
That's where all this footage came from.
