00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:03.487
- [Voiceover] There were
10 sharks at the reef.

00:00:03.487 --> 00:00:06.817
And we see, there's one,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:06.817 --> 00:00:11.317
six, seven, eight, nine, 10
sharks, just like they told us.

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:14.917
Two sharks swam away, I
was gonna say ran away,

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:16.751
(laughs), they swam away.

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:18.883
How many sharks are left?

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:20.383
So, let's think about it.

00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:23.050
There were 10 sharks at the reef

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.983
and two of them, two of them, swam away,

00:00:26.983 --> 00:00:29.383
so how many sharks are left?

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:31.150
How many sharks are left?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.450
Well, what's 10 minus
two going to be equal to?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.817
Well, we could look up
here if we had 10 pictures

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:39.617
of sharks and we were to take away,

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:42.750
we were to take away one and then two,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750
how many are going to be left?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.883
Well, we see we have one, two, three,

00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:52.382
four, five, six, seven, and eight.

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:56.417
So, 10 minus two, 10
taking away two sharks,

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:58.418
the two sharks that swam away,

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:01.464
is going to be equal to eight.
