[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.807
- Thank you, Meredith, for
covering so much of what I'm

00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:10.890
going to talk about today.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900
So let's--

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.180
- Oh, no.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.679
I was try--

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.360
- No, no, in a very great way.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.710
And just for being such
a generous introducer.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.360
Hannah Arendt has this phrase,
thinking without banisters.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.400
And it's often
used metaphorically

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.340
to mean that you have to
think on your own, that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.540
is you have to think
without others behind you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.640
and think for yourself.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.740
But in a material sense,
we all know that thinking

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.450
does require banisters.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.160
It requires a lot of support.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.120
And I just want to start
today by saying how grateful I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.850
am to the Radcliffe
Institute for giving me

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.040
all these banisters
for this year

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.240
to really think to take
a break from teaching

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.230
to try some stuff out.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.240
So I'll be eternally grateful.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.250
My project this
year and what I'm

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.459
looking at at the
Radcliffe Institute

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:10.130
is legal naturalization.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.370
And what I'm interested
in about naturalization

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.780
is that it's the only
way that a person, who's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.840
not linked to a state
by birth or dissent,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.650
can be granted
citizenship within it.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.500
And at the outset, if it
wasn't clear from Meredith's

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.740
introduction, I should say I'm
not a lawyer so don't ask me

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.580
for legal advice after this.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.260
And I'm not a historian.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.160
I'm a literary and
critical theorist.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.590
And I say that because I'm
not trying to exonerate myself

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.430
from any relevance or
relationship to truth

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.530
but because the way I approach
naturalization and immigration,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.450
in general, is different from
how legal historian may choose

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.520
to go about looking at it.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.680
As a critical
theorist, I'm really

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.700
drawn to the fictional
and rhetorical forms

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.800
of laws and rights.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.860
And I also look for
the history of law

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.190
beyond its expression in law
itself for positive mystic law.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.670
So in the past, I've written
about human rights quite a bit

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.820
and their basis in the
abstract principle of humanity.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.690
And before humanity, it
was the abstract principle

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.780
of nature, human nature.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.320
For this new project, I'm
looking more at naturalization

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.010
and the coincidence
that it developed

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.200
as a legal process
at the same time

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.020
that the novel was
developing in England.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.530
Though just as
naturalization was

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.890
becoming a matter of
public debate in England,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.200
the novel is a new genre--

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.110
long prose fiction--
was becoming

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.560
a new form of literature.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.220
And I think we can learn a lot
about both law and literature

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.210
from looking at these
two things together.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.310
So today, my talk is going
to be in three parts.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.840
I'm going to review the book
that I co-authored on The Right

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.850
to Have Rights, which
Meredith mentioned,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.700
because it's really
this project and where

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.120
it left me that inspired
me to start digging

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.250
into naturalization.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.200
So I'll just rehearse
that a little bit more.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.740
Then I'm going to talk about
the history of naturalization

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.960
and my interest in it.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.510
And in the third part,
which is, in many ways,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.750
still under a lot of
active construction,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.970
I'm going to turn to
the history of the novel

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.040
as a way to look at
naturalization differently.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.190
OK, so part 1.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.810
In January, I published
with the legal historian,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.090
a political scientist
and an activist,

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.311
a book called The
Right to Have Rights.

00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:55.810
Here it is.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.220
It's quite green.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.660
[LAUGHS] You won't miss it.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.040
And the book offered a very,
very intensely close reading

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.660
of Hannah Arendt's phrase,
the right to have rights.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.620
In fact, each author,
we broke the phrase down

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.780
into four parts, and
each of us took a part.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.200
And I was responsible for
writing about the first right

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.163
in the phrase.

00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:20.829
And the phrase, the
right to have rights

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.670
grows out of Arendt's experience
as a stateless refugee.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.830
In 1933, she flees
Nazi Germany for Paris.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.030
And two years later, she
and other German Jews

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.410
effectively lose their
citizenship in Germany.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.200
In France, she's interned as
an enemy national in a camp.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.810
But she is able
to luckily escape

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.760
when the Germans occupy France.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.290
There's a bit of some
confusion, and she gets out.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.980
And she makes an appeal while
in the unoccupied part of France

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.020
to some US diplomats.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.330
However, the US State
Department at the time

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.210
is actively discouraging
giving visas

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.890
to German Jews or any
refugees for that matter.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.580
But through a combination
of luck and quick thinking

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.830
and a person in the US
State Department, who's

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.130
prepared to defy the
orders of superiors,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.440
she is able to secure a
Nansen passport, a French exit

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.880
visa, a Spanish and Portuguese
transit visa, and a US

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.840
emergency visa.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.120
It's lot of visas.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.910
In 1941, she's given
asylum in the US.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.300
And in 1951, she's
naturalized as a US citizen.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.170
In the same year as her
naturalization, 1951,

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.980
she publishes the origins
of totalitarianism,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.560
which is her first
English language book.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.220
And you may have heard it
after the election in 2016.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.280
It became something
of a mysterious best

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.530
seller where a lot of
people were buying it,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.150
hoping for answers.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.540
In one of the book's
central chapters,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.290
such as the chapter in which the
right to have rights appears,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.480
she reflects on
what her experience

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.360
as a stateless
refugee taught her

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.100
about the ways in
which individuals

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.440
come to gain and lose rights.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.770
The Universal Declaration
of Human Rights

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.070
proclaims that human
rights have rights simply

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.660
by the virtue of being human.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.370
But Arendt knew, first hand,
that in order to have rights,

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.880
individuals must be more
than simply human beings.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.620
They must, she
insisted, be members

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.900
of a political community.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.740
Only as a citizen of
a nation state can

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.410
a person enjoy legally
protected rights--

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.820
education, to work, to health
care, to culture, and so on.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.350
And so Arendt
declared that there

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.790
must be something
called the right

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.290
to have rights before we can
have any other kinds of rights.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.390
And here's how it appears.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.670
I'll show you.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.480
This is probably the only text.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.020
I'll have up here
for you tonight.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.103
But it's really important.

00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:08.800
And we spent a lot of
time on it in the book.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.170
I'll read it to you.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.890
We became aware of the existence
of a right to have rights.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.720
And that means to
live in a framework

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.230
where one is judged according
to actions and opinions

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.160
and a right to belong to some
kind of organized community

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.830
only when there suddenly emerged
millions of people who had lost

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.560
and could not regain
these rights because

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.860
of the new global
political situation.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.460
And in my work on the book,
one of the things I do

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.340
is I emphasize that this
is a really strange right.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.740
And it's because
of its temporality.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.640
It's a right that
comes into existence.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.110
We become aware of it only
when it's already disappeared.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.000
And I end up calling
the right to have

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.390
rights what I call post right.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.130
It's the right that
makes itself known only

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.850
when the possibility of its
arrival has already gone.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.120
And I'm still looking for really
great Latin term or something

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.250
to describe this some
kind of rhetorical term.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.510
So if anybody has any
ideas, I'd love to know.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.600
So it's less of a right
that can be used or employed

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.900
than a eulogy for a right
that no longer exists.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.260
It's not something
we can stage or argue

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.090
for in Arendt's thinking.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.620
It's something that
we discover as lost,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.010
and that's its tragedy.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.100
What Arendt wanted to
show is that even when

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.539
someone performs a right to have
rights by showing up in public

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.730
and making a demand
for it, as we've all

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.130
seen in the news
in multiple places,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.960
there still needs to be a
nation state to recognize it.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.030
I'll offer you a brief
example that I talk

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.500
about a little bit in the book.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.700
In 2014, residents
of Detroit, Michigan

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.100
filed a lawsuit
against the city,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.700
because it had shut off the
running water of some residents

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.460
who couldn't afford to
pay their water bills.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.120
And the judge ruled against the
residents, saying that, quote,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.240
"water is a necessary
ingredient to sustaining life,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.170
but there's no enforceable
right to water."

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.400
So in response, the residents
called on the United Nations.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.840
And they wanted to claim that
their right to water in Detroit

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.410
was a human right.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.270
So Arendt, I think,
would, undoubtedly,

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.530
had she been alive--

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.770
by the way, the anniversary
of her death is yesterday--

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.320
I think she would have
recognized the polemical value

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.730
of this move.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.100
It's a shaming mechanism.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.410
But while the claims
certainly garnered

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.350
a lot of media
publicity, it doesn't

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.630
have the force to produce a
right to water under US law.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.930
The appeal to human
rights in this case

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.930
merely reinforced the
lack of enforceable right

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.760
in the civic national context.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.570
The United Nations could
make, quote, "recommendations"

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.840
and, quote, "do a
fact finding mission."

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.800
But it couldn't validate the
right of a claim to water.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.240
There's no guarantee that a
performative claim to right

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.070
will be validated, especially,
if the community that a rights

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.960
claimant seeks entrance into
the very community that's

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.117
responsible for
its loss of rights.

00:10:24.117 --> 00:10:25.950
And that's, of course,
something that Arendt

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.030
knew deeply from her experience
as a subject of the Nuremberg

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:39.780
laws, which made all Jews
like herself of alien blood.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.015
After fleeing the
detention center in France,

00:10:42.015 --> 00:10:44.040
Arendt doesn't go
back to Germany

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.190
to make a performative claim
of her right to have rights.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.130
No, she escapes to America.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.990
The country of her
birth, the community

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.350
on which she might stake
a claim of membership,

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.860
was actively the country
that didn't want her there.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.174
And so Arendt's point--

00:11:00.174 --> 00:11:01.590
and she goes on
to make this point

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.630
in a very detailed
and lengthy way--

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.100
is that there's no universal
right to citizenship.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.010
There's only two loopholes
that she identifies

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.010
in her writing for
a stateless refugee

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.980
to gain citizenship or at least
the attention of the nation

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.820
state.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.520
One is they can commit a crime.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.360
Getting yourself
arrested, she said,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.330
is one of at least
one way of getting

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.540
acknowledged by the state.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.380
The other loophole is that a
stateless person or a refugee

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.890
can somehow become famous.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.320
And this is Mamoudou Gassama.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.190
He was formerly an
undocumented migrant in France.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.120
And this past summer, he
was granted citizenship

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.130
from the French
government after he

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:53.890
scaled a building to rescue
a small child from falling.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:12:00.030
It is true, says Arendt, that
the chances of a famous refugee

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.310
are improved just
as a dog with a name

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.600
has a better chance to survive
than a stray dog who is just

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.670
a dog in general.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.972
So that's what I finished.

00:12:10.972 --> 00:12:14.460
[LAUGHS] And it left me in
a pretty pessimistic place.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.460
And my conclusion, I had
to note that at the time

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.890
of her writing, Arendt
thought that America

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.910
was the one hopeful place.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.090
And she said that America
was always a place that

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.490
welcomed its newcomers.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.451
But I think we have reason
to be suspicious of her place

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:31.950
of hope.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.410
And so it was at
this moment that I

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.770
decided that I wanted to look at
naturalization and its history,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.300
because it seemed
to offer something

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.680
more concrete than abstract
principles of human right.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.220
With naturalization, we can see
how, historically, citizenship

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.870
has been created for foreigners.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.760
And I actually got the idea.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.690
And I didn't quite
know it at the time

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.330
from Arendt herself, who
has this throwaway line

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.820
in the origins of
totalitarianism.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.480
She says that unlike
their happier predecessors

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.710
in the religious wars, the
refugees after World War II

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.276
could be welcomed nowhere
and assimilated nowhere.

00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:14.200
So one of my first
questions was, well,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.430
who are these happier refugees?

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.720
And what was so different
about immigration

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.960
in the late 17th
and 18th centuries?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.810
On what basis were all of
these refugees received

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:29.280
and integrated in a time before,
quote, unquote, "human rights?"

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.560
So I began to explore.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.840
I spent some time
at the archives

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.590
at the Clark Library at UCLA
and the glorious Huntington

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.600
Library in Los Angeles.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.100
And I've done quite
a bit of digging

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.950
with the help of three
incredible research

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.480
assistants--

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.570
Tamara, Jessica, and Amanda--

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.320
just got Amanda.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:53.820
Thank you.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.410
They're not here
tonight, but I really

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.930
appreciate it, because
it's been a lot of work.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.270
And we've been digging around
in old musty law books,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.490
trying to figure out what
this history might look like.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.420
And I'll tell you the
story so far as I'm

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.370
constructing it for myself.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.050
Prior to the Napoleonic
period, nationality

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.190
was decided by the feudal
tradition of jus soli.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.120
Now, jus soli dates back
to a medieval system

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.930
in which a subject
owes undying allegiance

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.070
to the monarch under
whom they're born.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.440
And it gets this tradition,
this feudal tradition,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.660
gets refined into English
common law following

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.070
this important legal case
called Calvin's Case--

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.490
1608.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.120
And in this case, the
court had to decide

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.490
whether a young Scottish child
named Robert Calvin whether he

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:56.260
had the right to inherit
a family estate in London.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.280
That was the case.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.370
And the court did decide
that Robert Calvin did

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.280
have the right to
inherit the estate,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.130
because at the
time of his birth,

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:10.960
the English King sovereignty
had extended to Scotland.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.970
So Calvin's Case made
the all-important ruling

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.590
that is detectable in
American nationality law today

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.160
that a person's membership
in a national community

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.532
is determined by the
place of their birth.

00:15:25.532 --> 00:15:26.990
And you might be
interested to know

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.200
that jus soli or birthright
citizenship, as it's sometimes

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.800
called, is still the dominant
principle of citizenship

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.740
in the United States
and in Canada.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.900
There's scarcely anywhere
else in the world.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.070
Even England, who's
responsible for the idea

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.590
or tradition of
jus soli, no longer

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.270
retains it as a principle.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.990
But in addition to making
this important ruling

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.500
about birthright
citizenship, Calvin's Case

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.970
also addressed how
nonsubjects, namely the Scots,

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.532
could be made into
subjects in law.

00:16:03.532 --> 00:16:05.240
And so that ruling
really was interested.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.600
Now, OK, what do we
do with the Scots?

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.050
How do we make them
English subjects?

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.020
But over the course
of the century,

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.310
the 17th but especially into
the 18th century, that debate

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:22.600
about naturalization
would take on more people

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.930
from different
backgrounds and places.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:32.680
And the biggest one happened
in 1685 when Louis XIV,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.330
he revokes the Edict of Nantes.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.460
Protestants were
living in Catholic--

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.990
France.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.910
And so hundreds of thousands--
it's an enormous scale--

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.930
of Protestants
had to flee France

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:58.300
at the risk of being violently
converted to Catholicism.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.690
They went all over the place.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.080
Many of them fled to the
Netherlands, Switzerland,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.490
Wales.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:08.859
And an estimated
50,000 of what were

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.490
known as the Huguenots
came to England

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.690
and which is to this
day, one of the largest

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.609
immigrations of a single
ethnic community into England.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.119
So that's around 1685.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:26.520
And it's these refugees, who
Arendt refers to as happier.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.800
And in many ways, they were
considered what we might today

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.180
call model immigrants.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.260
They were highly
skilled craftspeople.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.450
And they worked
primarily as weavers.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.980
And they were Protestants.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.009
So the English quite liked them.

00:17:41.009 --> 00:17:42.550
And they decided
that they were going

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.060
to try and use naturalization
to entice more of them

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.860
to come over.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.470
And this is when
in 1709, parliament

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.700
invents what's called the
general naturalization act.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.340
And basically this
is an act that

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.100
says, any foreign person
who's willing to swear

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.260
an oath of allegiance
to the English crown

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.760
take sacrament in the Church
of England, pay one shilling.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.160
Then they would be,
quote, "as if they

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.285
were born in this kingdom."

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.210
So they wanted the
Huguenots to come.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.410
But trouble begins the same
year that the naturalization act

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.720
is passed.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.630
13,000 immigrants from the Rhine
region of Northwest Germany

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.930
enter England.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:33.740
And these German migrants were
dubbed, the poor Palatines.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.530
This is a wood cut from 1709.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.060
I'm sorry about the quality.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.450
But I think it may be one
of the first representations

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.232
of a modern refugee camp.

00:18:43.232 --> 00:18:46.950
The Palatines formed a
camp outside of London.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.600
It was crowded.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.250
It was full of disease.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.240
They were dependent a lot upon
charity from church groups

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.390
and so on.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.160
The reason the Palatines
came to England

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.830
is not quite clear
to historians.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.160
Some people argue that they also
faced religious persecution.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.860
Others suggest that they
were fleeing the effects

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.230
of a really cold hard winter.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.420
They were mainly farmers.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.940
What is clear-- we don't
know why they came exactly,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.130
or there's multiple
interpretations

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.550
is that they did not
receive a warm welcome.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.020
The Tory critics liken
them to the plague.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.170
And, eventually, they were
shipped off to America

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.030
where many of them
died en route.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.494
And I nearly jumped
out of my skin.

00:19:32.494 --> 00:19:33.910
I'm sorry for the
quality of this.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.820
But I found this
in a old newspaper

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.870
at the Clark Library, which was
a table, that basically breaks

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.870
down how many of them died
en route and how many of them

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.520
arrived--

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:50.980
sort of odd way of accounting.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.250
I can't really in the frame,
well, I have with you.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.460
I can't really do justice to
the history of naturalization

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.220
or to these particular
refugee groups.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.730
But I want to emphasize
a few points as they

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.070
are coming clear to me today.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.140
One, naturalization
in the 18th century

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.630
is not about the
freedom to settle.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.200
Before the 19th century--

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.170
and this is really important--

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.720
England was a country
of open borders.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.450
It didn't regulate
who could come.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.290
It didn't regulate
how long you can stay.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.840
But if you did
come, and you wanted

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.600
to receive some positive
benefits, such as the right

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:37.050
to purchase property or to pass
down some effects to an heir,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.670
then you had to be naturalized.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:43.290
So it was something-- it was a
bonus, basically, a very nice

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.790
bonus.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.585
And it also allowed you to
sit in government offices.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.990
Naturalization in
the 18th century

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.660
is all about property, not
about political rights.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.240
The question of
nationality in this period

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.410
is all about whether a
foreign-born son can inherit

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.140
from an English
father or vice versa,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.100
whether an English son can
inherit from a foreign father.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.080
This is the whole question
of the problem for jurists.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.180
Lastly and most
importantly for me,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.980
naturalization in
the period doesn't

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:25.780
promise to make a foreigner the
same as a natural-born subject.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.500
It's not a declaration of a
primordial natural right, such

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.880
as you start to see in the
1789 Declaration of Rights

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.870
of Man and Citizen, which
launched the French Revolution.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.100
And unlike the 20th century
concept of naturalization,

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.310
there's no expectation that
a naturalized foreigner

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.920
will speak the same
language, engage

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.620
in the same national
customs, or even become

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.880
more English over time.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.230
And, today, I mean,
some of you may not

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.610
know what it requires to
be naturalized in America.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.690
You have to have a green card.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.380
And you have to have a
green card for five years.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.330
And you have to have
live in the United States

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.610
continuously for that period.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.530
You have to read,
write, and speak

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.620
English, have a basic
understanding of civics

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.640
and government, be, quote,
"of sound moral character,"

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.550
and six, demonstrate an
attachment to the ideals

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.050
of the US Constitution.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.280
So to arrive at
naturalization today

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:32.250
is to arrive fully realized with
secure bonds and attachments.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.880
There's a huge contrast from
early naturalization, which

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.460
was just a legal design to
settle matters of property

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.090
rather than create some sort
of sense of national inclusion

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.106
and belonging.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:53.430
The radicalness of this
early naturalization stuff,

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.350
it can't really be overstated.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.020
The general naturalization
act effectively

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.590
moved the location
of nationality

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.260
from a prior basis
and birthright

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:09.040
to qualities of faith,
finance, and language.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.530
And it was precisely the
kind of rhetorical basis

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.270
of the act, the idea
that it could just

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:18.340
produce subjects, who just swore
an oath, that produced really

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.180
strong opposition from
conservative critics, who

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.140
interpreted the act to mean
that anyone could just become

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.810
an English person in language.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.850
This is something I
found in the archive.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.320
It was a poem.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.050
Now, a lot of times
in the period, poetry

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.620
was used to disseminate
political opinions.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.900
It was designed to
manipulate opinion

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.050
against the naturalization
act, and it's quite long.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.880
But the gist of it
is that the refugees

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.660
are likened to canary birds
that were brought over

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.490
by Spanish sailors
in the 17th century.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.160
And the author argues that
these canary birds are going

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.230
to disturb the English utopia.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.430
So it's like a very elaborate
extended metaphor about birds.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:13.730
But you get the idea.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.880
But for all of the
radicalness I just

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.340
spoke up about
naturalization, it

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.690
was a really limited form too.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.560
It was really
designed to attract

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.250
a select group of migrants.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.770
Over the course of
the 18th century,

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.150
it was going to face challenges
from other people who

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.090
are perceived as threats--

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:39.620
Jews, Catholics, and free
blacks dubbed the black poor.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.260
The Jewish
Naturalization of 1753

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.710
was narrowly passed by
the Whigs in Parliament

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.220
and then swiftly repealed.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.030
And it produced an enormous
wave of anti-Semitism

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.370
in the country.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.760
And here's a kind of
satirical swipe at critics

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.080
of Jewish naturalization.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.900
You see a bunch of
kingly people, who

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.930
are frightened at a, quote,
"nasty, great, ugly Jew

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.610
bill," which is really this
rolled up scroll on the floor.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:23.970
It was a depiction of the
threat that supposedly

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.550
this legal maneuver would have.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.770
I'm actively researching
a little bit more

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.260
right now about
the black poor, who

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.510
were a combination
of former slaves

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.680
and black sailors from
America, who were settled

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.500
in a colony in Sierra Leone.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.110
Because they were
unwanted in London,

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:48.400
so they were lured away to this
new colony with the promise

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.960
that they would be
given citizenship

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.010
there and protection
from the royal army.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.650
This is similar to what England
did with the Palatines--

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:03.040
shift the problem away rather
than develop a legal design

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.670
to integrate people
in England itself.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.550
So given all of these
failures in the 18th century

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.420
and then more seismically
after World War II

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.610
where naturalization is all
but suspended for refugees.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.250
It may seem odd that
I'm actually even

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.240
interested in this history.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.290
But even though
naturalization only

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:28.010
affected a small
number of migrants,

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.340
it opened up a public
debate about who

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.940
could be received and granted
privileges in the nation.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.690
In this debate, as I'm going
to try and suggest to you now,

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.980
survives and is transformed
by the fiction that's

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.610
running alongside of it.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.060
The refugee movements in the
18th century and 17th century,

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.520
they're managed
through naturalization.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.830
In fact, it could be
argued that naturalization

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.440
is invented to manage them.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.070
But at the same time
that naturalization

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.150
is devising new rules
about national inclusion,

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.590
the novel's developing
as a new genre.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.610
The novel gets its name, novel,
because it was new at the time.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.650
And one of the things
that made it so new

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.200
is that it introduced
all kinds of new subjects

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.760
into literature--

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:24.880
servant girls, slaves orphans,
middle class businessmen--

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.690
just about anybody who, under
classical rules of genre,

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.300
especially of tragedy,
would never be considered

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.220
as subject of literature.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.420
So I'm interested in the
novel and naturalization

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.910
in one sense, because
they're both forms that

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.840
create new subjects who had
previously been unrecognized.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.380
Right, so there's just
that basic parallel.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.320
But, in fact, as I've been
researching this project,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.720
I've learned more
about law from novels

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.420
sometimes than from
archival materials.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.510
And I think that maybe
because the novel

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.685
is a more sustained
space of imagination.

00:28:01.685 --> 00:28:03.310
So it's a place where
people can really

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.240
experiment with ideas,
especially, of identity

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.050
and connection in ways
that are sort of limited

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.297
in newspaper debates.

00:28:14.297 --> 00:28:15.880
And the other reason
I'm interested in

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.840
is that if you just
study naturalization

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.380
as a legal history,
you're going to be

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.130
confined to the Protestants,
mainly the Huguenots.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.280
But the novel when it
takes up naturalization,

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.220
it introduces the
topic and extends it

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.310
into empire to
discussions of race.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.790
Ideas that if you strictly just
stick to the archival materials

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.760
and naturalization,
you're likely to miss.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.420
So I'm not the first
person, of course,

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.440
to think that the novel has
particular political importance

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.370
in the 18th century.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.650
Many incredible
scholars have argued

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.550
that the 18th century novel
and the 19th century novel

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:05.290
is a handmade into the
emergence of the nation state,

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.330
and that the novel helped
forge a sense of what it meant

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.850
to be an English Protestant.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.370
Edward Said and
Benedict Anderson

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.600
are probably the two
most important examples.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.940
Said argued in culture
and imperialism

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.000
that the novel narrated the
English Imperial Project.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.490
And he argued that the novel
was a concretely historical

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.480
narrative.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.130
And that you could learn a lot
about empire and colonialism

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.550
from studying it.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:40.690
Benedict Anderson had similar
ideas but differently.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.020
In his very famous book,
Imagined Communities,

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.160
he argued that the novel
became a form where individuals

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.260
could come to
understand themselves

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.480
as members of collective.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.960
And it did that by mimicking the
structure of a clearly bordered

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.100
national community.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.740
I'm not here to disagree
with those theories.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.180
But one thing I have noticed
is that after reading so much

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.360
about naturalization
and rereading so many

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.000
of these seminal
novels, I've come

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.130
to see that the
novel was thinking

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:18.210
about the borders
of national identity

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:22.380
just as much as it was
allegedly defining them.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.950
Novelists in the period
were experimenting with ways

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.390
to expand the possibilities
and naturalization, especially,

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.030
after the repeal of the
general naturalization act

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.780
and then later after the repeal
of the Jewish Naturalization

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.430
Act.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.720
And it's extraordinary
to me how many

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.280
novels that we've long read
is conservative or is vested

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.090
in deep nationalisms are
actually engaging questions

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.250
about naturalization
that if you understand

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.520
a little bit about the law,
you can begin to notice.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.930
I'm going to give
three examples.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.060
And I'm picking
them, essentially,

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:03.470
because these are popular
18th century novels that

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:08.660
have been read as providing
kind of nativist origin stories

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.580
for the English nation.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:15.600
First one, Robinson
Crusoe, published

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.950
by Daniel Defoe in 1719.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.690
And everybody knows
this novel even

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.060
if they haven't read it, right.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.120
It's the story of the
shipwrecked Englishman, who

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.760
creates a plantation on
an island with the help

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.000
of a colonized subject Friday.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.430
Karl Marx called Crusoe the
ideal English homoeconomicas.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.270
James Joyce referred to
Crusoe as the true prototype

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.580
of the English colonizer.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.850
Edward Said agreed.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.430
But there's so much
going on in the novel

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.890
with Crusoe's legal identity.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.110
The very first
line of the novel,

00:31:55.110 --> 00:32:01.220
we learn that Crusoe's
father is a German foreigner.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.360
He's from the same
region in Germany,

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.840
in fact, that so many
of the German migrants

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.420
had come to seeking
refuge in England.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.040
Most people skip
this observation.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.630
But-- and this is something I've
been covered in the archives

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.150
as well-- according to
a law called the Aliens

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:20.990
Law of the time, Crusoe
as the son of a foreigner

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.570
would not have been able
to inherit anything.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.490
So that gives a new
spin to the reason

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:31.890
why he may have left England
to seek fortune elsewhere.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.610
And it also means that he
couldn't colonize an island

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:40.671
in the name of England as
Edward Said insists he does.

00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:43.170
Later in the book-- and this
is a smaller detail that's been

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.580
neglected as well--

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.980
Crusoe takes an oath
of naturalization

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:51.910
so that he can buy this
plantation in Brazil, purchases

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.670
some slaves.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:58.730
And so technically the entire
time he's on the island,

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:03.010
he is a Portuguese Catholic
subject under the law.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.410
And so when he reclaims
all of his profits

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.780
after being rescued
from the island,

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.140
he discovers that a lot of
the profits of his plantation

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.300
have gone to supporting
the Portuguese empire.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.540
I'm not just reading this
into the novel, I should say.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.580
Defoe was really
aware of what he

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.880
was doing, because he
was a journalist prior

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.620
to being a novelist.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.700
And he was one of the
biggest journalists

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.960
to write on the
Palatine refugee crisis.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.660
In fact, he was
one of the few who

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.400
agitated to have the
Palatines settled in England.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.330
So if you start looking
at the novel this way,

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.480
it emerges as a book
that's a warning to England

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.950
about what's going
to happen if it

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:51.610
doesn't settle its foreigners.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.420
That's one reading of it.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:58.990
So that's one of the
books I've re-examined.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:04.060
The second is a book called
Laurence Sterne's Sentimental

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:09.400
Journey Through France and
Italy published in 1768.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.060
It's one of the most famous
novels of the 18th century,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.380
though, many of us
don't remember it today.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.429
It was one of Thomas
Jefferson's favorite novels.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:22.659
It's loosely a story
about a English man

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:27.520
named Yorick, who goes
over to France by sneaking

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.969
into somebody else's carriage.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:32.449
And when he gets
there, he has all

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:36.440
of these sentimental encounters
with people that he meets.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.219
And most scholars
read it as a satire

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:42.699
of bourgeois humanitarianism,
because the level

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:46.719
of his sentimental
encounters are a bit dubious.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:52.420
They're often sexual
or overblowing.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.330
But, again, like
Robinson Crusoe,

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.290
the novel is framed
from its very beginning

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.020
by a law about foreigners.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.090
The very first
lines of this novel,

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.990
as well, we learn that Yorick is
subject to a bitter French law

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.080
called the Law Over Strangers,
which would stipulate

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.642
that if he died while
he was in France,

00:35:15.642 --> 00:35:17.725
the French monarch could
take all of his property.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.950
The Law Over
Strangers and distance

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.160
great historical work on
it by the historian Peter

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.980
[? Salends. ?] It's
more than a feudal tax.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.140
In the time period,
it's the only way

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.640
that France has to make a
stipulation between who's

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.490
the subject of France
and who's an alien.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:43.060
And so to evade it, there's
this amazing moment.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.930
It's one of my favorite in
all of literature, I think,

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.580
where Yorick
discovers that if he's

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.710
going to evade detention and
evade the effects of this law,

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.360
he has to come up
with a passport,

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.230
but he doesn't have one.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.280
So he discovers
that there's a shop.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.390
And he goes in, and he
buys Shakespeare's Hamlet.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.580
And he goes to the
count who meets out

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.640
passports for
foreigners and says,

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.430
open to the gravediggers passes.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:17.320
And he says, that's me and just
points to the name, Yorick.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.910
And it's this
really funny passage

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.260
that I can't do justice to.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.990
Laurence Sterne is an
incredible writer where

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.780
he's not technically lying.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.510
But the count gets
mistaken and thinks

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.700
that he's another Yorick.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.310
So this third Yorick who's
a famous court jester.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.620
And so the count decides
to give him his passport.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.930
And this is an
illustration at the moment.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.060
And then Yorick is
free to stay in Paris

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.980
and bumble around and have
more sentimental encounters.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.820
This novel is really
ahead of its time,

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.660
I think, in asking questions
about the distinction

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.750
between private and
political identity.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.930
And the book has a lot to
teach us about passports

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:02.780
before the age of biometrics,
because in the 18th century,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.450
a passport was a florid
letter of introduction.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.520
Someone says, oh,
yeah, I know this guy--

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.200
let him in.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.840
There's no physical
descriptions on it.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.540
And so it's this beautiful
interplay of language

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.735
that lets Yorick
sneak in using Hamlet

00:37:20.735 --> 00:37:23.911
as a introduction for himself.

00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:26.630
So that's another one.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.000
The last one is
Frankenstein, which

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.520
is enjoying its 200th year
anniversary this year.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.970
And the novel, as we all know,
has many interpretations.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.100
One of the most
seminal is that it's

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.820
a warning about what will
happen if people stray too

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.360
far from their native home,
which Victor Frankenstein does

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.550
when he goes off to college.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.580
And you start to create life
outside of the conditions

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.390
of natural birth.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.300
And like the other
two novels, this one

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:02.710
has a legal political
dimension too.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:06.730
I almost prefer the 1818
version of the text.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.180
It's often considered
as the more original

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.460
or pure scholarly edition.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.030
But in 1831, when
she revised it,

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:19.800
Mary Shelley changes Victor
Frankenstein's birthplace.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.050
Instead of being a
citizen of Geneva

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.840
after the style of
Jean Jacques Rousseau,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.180
she has him born in
Italy, and then he

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:32.400
becomes naturalized in Geneva.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.670
In the 19th century, Geneva was
one of the most cosmopolitan

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.470
cities in Europe.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.220
Even before then, it was one
of the biggest places of refuge

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.490
for the persecuted Huguenots.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.250
But the city had a
real current of unrest

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.680
at the time of which
Mary Shelley was

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.430
aware she had written
about it in her letters.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.550
Over time, the number of people
who could be citizens of Geneva

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.870
had grown smaller.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:05.470
So in this context, Victor
Frankenstein's monster

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.860
emerges as what we might call
the ultimate unnaturalized

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.240
foreigner.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.590
At one point, he meets a blind
old man in the countryside.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:19.780
And the old man asks him
like who he is and asks him

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.210
if he's a French man.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.700
And the monster
replies, well, French

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.920
is the only language I
speak, but I'm not French.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.260
And so like the
sans-papiers today,

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.760
he exists within the state but
goes completely unrecognized

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.330
by it.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:40.260
And I'm hoping that what I want
to do more with Frankenstein

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.930
is to attach these
kind of legal readings

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.430
to some of the
brilliant work that's

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.500
been done on the
creature's race,

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.620
because it's emphasized
repeatedly in the novel

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.260
that he's not white.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.480
He's not European.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.460
And so I think we
could definitely

00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:01.750
see the novel in
conjunction to debates

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:06.250
about the black poor at the
end of the 18th century, who

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:10.360
were shipped off to a colony
rather than dealt with in law

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.000
in England.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.470
So that's what I'm
looking at there.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:16.330
There's so many more I
could tell you about.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.454
There's this really funny
one called The Adventures

00:40:18.454 --> 00:40:21.820
of Ferdinand Count Fathom, which
features a protagonist who's

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.720
born in a wagon that's passing
over the border of Holland

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.850
and Flanders.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.740
And his head comes
out in Holland,

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.802
but his feet come
out in Flanders.

00:40:31.802 --> 00:40:33.760
And in the rest of the
novel is everyone trying

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.180
to figure out where he's from.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.650
But I won't tell you.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.566
I'll stop there.

00:40:40.566 --> 00:40:43.810
[LAUGHS] I'm uncovering
a different story

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.700
about the 18th century novel.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.920
And the novels I
read show awareness

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.680
about the lives of
migrants and migration.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.990
They show awareness about
the effect of policy and law

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.560
on identity.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.260
And they're grappling
with scenarios

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.250
that nationality
law in its infancy

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:07.570
was just only
beginning to work out.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.550
What happens if you're
born outside the country

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.580
that your parents were born in?

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.740
Can you have allegiance
to two countries?

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.660
How does your legal identity
change when you migrate?

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.940
Why do we allocate
subject heard according

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.040
to the circumstances of birth?

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.140
It seems to me that some of
the early readings of the novel

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:34.790
are partial selective and maybe
ignore important elements that

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.920
can help us rethink
notions of identity

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:42.180
and belonging that sometimes
we take for granted today.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.240
One of the conclusions I
reached in my study of Arendt

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.510
was that Arendt thought
that each generation had

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.960
to study the conditions of
its own immigration crisis

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.950
from within its own time.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.509
I think that's basically
right, except, I

00:41:57.509 --> 00:41:59.050
think that if we're
going to do that,

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:03.340
we have to rethink the
very mythologies that

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.910
perpetuate the coupling
of nationality and birth.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.050
And I think the
novel can help us.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.770
It can help us rediscover
alternative, perhaps,

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.780
more inclusive
principles to relate

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:17.500
to those beyond the borders of
our limited national geography

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.810
and political imagination.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.790
I also think that the
novel can shed light

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:23.740
on other ideas that
have been eclipsed

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.560
by the rise of the nation
state and birthright

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.369
citizenship in the
past two centuries.

00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:30.910
At least, that's
what I'm going to be

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:34.100
trying to think about for the
remainder of my time here.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.650
So I'll end with those thoughts.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.180
Thank you so much.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.230
