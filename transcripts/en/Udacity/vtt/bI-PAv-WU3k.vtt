00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, if you believe the postulates, let's do some amazing things.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, I'm sorry to say but the train is back.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Train show up all the time in special relativity. Don't ask me why.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But joining this train are clocks held by two observers, green and red.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I don't know why but their parents named them after the color of their hair.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, what's going to happen here is that green, well, standing on this train

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the train is moving with some velocity v relative to the ground.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, she's going to do a little experiment.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
She is going to take her flashlight and bring it down to ground level.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
She's going to send a beam of light straight up

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so that it bounces off a mirror and then come straight back down

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and she's going to time how long it takes the beam of light to make this round trip.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I should mention the train has a height we call h.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, now that we're studying relativity,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we've really to think about whose point of view we're solving the problem from

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and first I think about the train point of view.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
From the point of view of the train, this is the right drawing to draw.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
From green's point of view it looks like, well, she doesn't know the train is at rest,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so it looks like the light goes straight up then comes straight back down.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So we drew a little arrow here showing that this represents the green point of view.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
From the red point of view, well as the train speeds by,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it's not going to look like the beam of light goes straight upwards.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's going to go over at some angle then bounce back down

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and be collected and observed.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
One thing that's potentially confusing here that I should point out

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I've tried drawing both of these perspectives on one train that's difficult to do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The red observer will not see the light leave from this portion of the train

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and then end up on this portion of the train in front of this front wheel

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because the train would have move forward as well.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Okay. Great.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So, we've got our two frames of reference, the green frame and the red frame,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and the light seems to take different trajectories in each frame.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Let's call this total distance traveled up and down in the green frame equal to d

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and the total distance the light spends traveling in the red frame dâ€™.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This prime is what we're going to use often in special relativity to indicate a different frames.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We have our two different frames.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Everything that we're talking about in the red head frame, we'll put a prime on.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, my question is which of these paths are longer?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Actually, what I really want to know is which of these statements are true.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Is the distance traveled in the green frame less than,

00:02:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
equal to, or greater than the distance traveled in the prime frame?
