1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
Graduated high school,
crushed it,
straight A's,
boom.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.800
Help my classmates with kindness kind and helpful and expected them to be.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.870
Meanwhile,
they put me down,
mocked me,

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.370
never loved me in a room with 30 people.
I was always alone.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.180
Inner voice tells me to go after the past.
Seek revenge.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.020
Keep looking at their profiles.
Profiles,
online profiles.
Social media.
Yeah.
Yeah.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.820
Should I go now?
He's got a series of questions here.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.970
Should I go after them and try to fix the past,

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.050
either by revenge or else should I,

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
should I remove them from social media and leave the the Facebook group?

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.320
Should I attend the reunion?
Why have they even been in my life?
Okay,

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.440
so let's break those down.
Number one,

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.940
should I go after them and try to fix the past either by revenge or something

14
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.600
else to answer that,
in my opinion is no man,

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.910
who cares?
They're high school kids.
Move on.
Get on with your life.
Yeah.
Disagree.

16
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.150
Agree.
Agree.
Okay.
That,
that one to me is pretty straight forward.

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
Don't worry about these humans.
I actually had a couple conversations with,

18
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.990
with uh,
my oldest daughters haven't had this one with my son yet,

19
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.180
but my older daughters,
which is,
hey look,

20
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:21.390
these people that are around right now that you think are so important in high

21
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.500
school,
they're not,
you know,
some of them might be,

22
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:27.720
you might have some lifelong friends from high school.
I get that.

23
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.290
But these people that are not nice to you,
you won't be thinking about them.

24
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.320
So I don't,
I'm not sure how old this individual is,

25
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.860
but he's got a couple more years before you won't be thinking about these people

26
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:41.130
anymore.
So just get there earlier question too.

27
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.240
Should I remove them from social media and leave this Facebook group?
Okay.

28
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:49.500
This is a little bit tricky in my opinion.
Uh,
first of all,

29
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.910
if you can,
if you can stay,
if you can keep them on social media,

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.800
but ignore them completely,
just leave me alone.

31
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.280
Just leave it and just totally ignore them because when you leave them or

32
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.220
whatever,
you're kind of,
aren't you kind of making the scene?
Okay.

33
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.640
I just want to make sure.
So you want to make it seem well yeah,

34
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:10.110
like when you unfriend them or whatever,

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.990
which didn't you and I have some situations with the athlete.
Yeah.
Actually.

36
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.350
So,
okay.
So
I know that I,

37
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.890
wait,
wait,
who unfriended you?
My wife.
Yep.
Okay,
so you did it well,
no,
no,
no.

38
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.410
I didn't even know how to do it.
Non You figured it out.
No,
I didn't.

39
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.590
So I didn't ever have social media until two years ago,

40
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.650
but all of a sudden I saw echo friends with my wife and I said,

41
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.160
Woo.
She's like showing me something.
And she says,
and I see echo.
And I said,
well,

42
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.450
why are you friends with people that,

43
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.980
why are you friends with people that I know on a,
or click on friend on that.

44
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.710
And I didn't even know it was a big deal.
I just thought,
you know,
hey,
that means,

45
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.160
and,
and then I didn't realize a big deal.
It's a big deal,
man.

46
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.200
Unfriended him messed up.

47
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.440
I thought you did it per purposefully knowing it's a big deal,

48
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:06.130
but not understanding that it's even a bigger deal than you know,

49
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.230
the kind where you're like unpruned him as a joke.
That was like,

50
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:12.250
it was totally your personality at that.
I did that to you.
Yeah.
Like as a joke,

51
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.420
like unfriend them,
you know,
say something to me like immediately or was it,

52
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.760
did that a month go by where I didn't make a joke about it?
I forget.
I forget.

53
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.460
So,
so it is kind of making a scene.
Yeah.
If you,

54
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.260
if you unfriend this person or you leave the group,

55
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.820
then you're just creating a little firestorm.
But I will say this,
if you can't,

56
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:38.320
if you can't keep yourself from checking on them,
then you might have to do that.

57
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.450
So try it for a couple of weeks.
Just say,
I'm not looking at them.
Yeah.

58
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.640
Let them go.
Just leave him.
If you can't do that,

59
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.980
then delete them and leave the group or whatever.

60
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.610
So the number three,
should I attend the reunion?
Okay.

61
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.650
My answer to that is negative.
Don't.
Why would you?
These people are negative.

62
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.220
They have,
they bring back negative memories.

63
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.560
They didn't treat you well,
they,

64
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.480
but why would you?
You don't need to move on again.
Key Word I think.
Move on.

65
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.953
Yeah.

66
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.580
And then the last question is why have they even been in my life?

67
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.461
Well,

68
00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:30.461
I think just like anything else bad that happens in life,

69
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.800
the things that are bad that happen in life can either teach you or break you

70
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.810
and you've got to decide what you want them to do.
I vote that you,

71
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.570
you allow it to teach you.
I,
I,
I voted.

72
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:49.650
You learn from these people that you learn how to forget about the past.

73
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.830
That you learn how to ignore people that are negative,

74
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:57.831
that you learn to control your vengeful ideas and that you learn to move on into

75
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:01.550
the future where you're going to meet better people and better times it'd be at,

76
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.550
that's what I would recommend.
Don't worry about these people from the past.

77
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.650
They're caught up in this weird world.
Yeah.
High School.

78
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.990
This is high school.
Caught up in high school world.

79
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.750
Don't worry about high school.
Get into the world.
Yeah,
right.
Big Time.

80
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.130
Well,
well got,
I've had one daughter that now graduated from high school.

81
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.220
I got two kids in high school right now.
Drama.
There's drama,

82
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.730
but actually believe it or not,
there hasn't been a lot of drama with my kids.

83
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.130
Not a lot of high school drama.
That doesn't surprise me but,
but I see it,

84
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.620
it does happen.
And I remember the drama.
I'd say it.
My guess,
I don't know.

85
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.700
It's been a long time since high school for me personally.
But yeah,
man,

86
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:46.890
I think that's life.
You know,
high school is drama.

87
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.320
You with a bunch of kids not knowing nothing.

88
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.740
Is there more drama in high school than there is in life?

89
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.930
Maybe it's because it's stuck together.
Yeah.

90
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.570
Like you look at your stuff depends on your life.

91
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.780
Like if you just consider a typical high school versus my life.
Yeah.

92
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.260
Way More in high schools in Miami,
your drama,
that's it.

93
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.980
You're not even really a job really.
Yeah.

94
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.670
They're all high school.
All of them.
Even this guy obviously,
you know,

95
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:21.050
so it's going to feel like way more than it is for sure.
But you know,
when you,

96
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.920
when you the,
the further you go along in life,

97
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.880
the more you realize that this means less and less,
these types of things anyway,

98
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.750
when you consider it high school is really just for learning.
Sure.

99
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.540
You learn social [inaudible] to,
you know what I just thought of it is,

100
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.540
is what's interesting about this is if you're looking back on high school,

101
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.160
either with fond memories or with negative Ben you way,

102
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.850
it's not a great thing because you could be like uncle Rico from Napoleon

103
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:54.710
dynamite.
Right.
Who's constantly living back his high school football games.

104
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.040
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he's wishing he made that pass and you know what I mean,

105
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.010
won the state championship or whatever.
Yeah.
You get that.
That's not good.

106
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.330
That means you're stuck in high school.
You peaked in high school.
Yeah.

107
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.530
If you're looking back at the negative things,
same thing.
Yes.
And who,
no,

108
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.480
move forward.
Yeah.
In his defense though,
obviously he just graduated,

109
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.400
so he's in life really.
Is it really,
you know,
it's still new.
It's like,
you know,

110
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.210
someone stuff's going to happen,
brother.
You just move on and get after it.
Yeah.

111
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.420
Probably the social media thing though,
I'll say this cause there's,

112
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.320
there's little levels of like unfriending whether you can unfollow someone.

113
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.100
I'm assuming this is Facebook.
I don't know.
There's,
you know,
there's so many,

114
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.270
he could be talking about other stuff,
but on Facebook you can still remain,

115
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.290
remain friends,
but just unfollow them so you won't get all their stuff.

116
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.720
Do they know that?
I don't think so.

117
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.030
I'm sure many people have unfollowed me and I don't know that I've never gotten

118
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.620
the alert or whatever.
Um,
I would say leave the group fully.
Oh yeah.

119
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.420
I would listen to your advice more than me because I don't understand it as much

120
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:02.870
as you do.
I don't,
I don't understand the Facebook group thing.
Yeah.
I mean,

121
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:05.210
depends how many people it seemed like who's was going to make a scene.

122
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.180
I don't like to make a scene.
Yeah.
So I'd be like,
well no,

123
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:10.550
I'm just gonna ignore it.
Yeah.
I don't think leaving the group is a scene.

124
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.061
If it is,

125
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:13.580
I mean obviously depends on how many people in the group is less people in the

126
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:16.310
group though more of a scene it's going to be,
or if he's always posting,

127
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:19.310
if he's the head of the group or something like this,
then yeah.

128
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.020
You know how in the past there was etiquette schools I went to,

129
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.310
I went to etiquette classes when I went to officer candidate school in
Pensacola,

130
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:31.430
Florida.
And they teach you which knife to use,
all that stuff,

131
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.810
and they teach you things.
For instance,
you might not know this.

132
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.280
If you take a bite of food and there's something in that bite of food that you

133
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:43.760
don't want to eat a bone of,
whatever.

134
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.330
The way to properly get it out of your mouth is to use your fork putting on the

135
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:53.000
fork and put it back down on the plate.
So like,
yeah.
Okay,
Gotcha.

136
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.480
They would say the same.
So that's the type of thing.
Yeah,
there should be a class

137
