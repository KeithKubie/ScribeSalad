this was in the middle of the day and it
 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.490
this was in the middle of the day and it
was out exploring as young things are

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500
was out exploring as young things are
 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.130
was out exploring as young things are
likely to do and it caught a glimpse of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140
likely to do and it caught a glimpse of
 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.660

me and instead of darting away it did

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670

would have been terrified because look

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970
would have been terrified because look
 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.699
would have been terrified because look
at a lobster they look like some

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709
at a lobster they look like some
 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.290

little Lobster and it was as it

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490
little Lobster and it was as it
 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.089

was come over take its antenna and start

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390
was come over take its antenna and start
 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.930
was come over take its antenna and start
touching my face mask and then it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940
touching my face mask and then it's
 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.410
touching my face mask and then it's
little pincers and started just touched

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420
little pincers and started just touched
 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.790

touched I'm not pinching just touch

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800
touched I'm not pinching just touch
 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.550
touched I'm not pinching just touch
touch touch around my face and and it

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560
touch touch around my face and and it

started making these little girl lobster

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020

purring buttons and I never thought

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
purring buttons and I never thought
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.040
purring buttons and I never thought
about lobster the same way since then

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050
about lobster the same way since then
 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.350
about lobster the same way since then
I've certainly had never eaten a lobster

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
I've certainly had never eaten a lobster
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.390
I've certainly had never eaten a lobster
since then I'd already sort of phased

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400
since then I'd already sort of phased
 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.410
since then I'd already sort of phased
out because I value the more alive

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
out because I value the more alive

don't really need to eat them there's so

much more valuable on my list if you're

much more valuable on my list if you're
 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.630
much more valuable on my list if you're

all of us if we value a healthy ocean we
 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.220
all of us if we value a healthy ocean we
will value the components of what make

we have to stop eating them no but we

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
we have to stop eating them no but we
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520
we have to stop eating them no but we
need to think about what the

need to think about what the
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.320
need to think about what the
consequences are not just to them but

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
consequences are not just to them but
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.000
consequences are not just to them but
also to us think about what they've been

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
also to us think about what they've been
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.100
also to us think about what they've been
eating and that you don't necessarily

eating and that you don't necessarily
