00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:02.654
"Most of the hypotheses that Kepler

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:05.723
developed to explain physical forces were

00:00:05.723 --> 00:00:09.637
later rejected as inconsistent to Newtonian

00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:13.135
theory, [or we have] No error." So, the

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:14.664
part that seemed a little strange to me

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:16.869
is when they talk about, "inconsistent to".

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.513
You don't say that you are "inconsistent

00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:19.926
to" something, you say that you are

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:24.689
"inconsistent [with]" something. Study A

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.337
is not "inconsistent to" Study B, you would

00:00:26.337 --> 00:00:28.484
say, Study A is "inconsistent [with]"

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.095
Study B. So, this should be "inconsistent

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:32.703
[with]", and if I were to rewrite this,

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:34.479
I would write this as: "Most of the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:37.219
hypotheses that Kepler developed to

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.132
explain physical forces were later rejected

00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:45.955
as [being] inconsistent [with] Newtonian

00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:48.638
theory". That sounds a lot better,

00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:52.929
"inconsistent [with]". So, the error is in D.
