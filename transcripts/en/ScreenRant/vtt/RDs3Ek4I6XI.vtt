00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.280
Bloopers are an inevitable part of movie-making.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.709
Like everybody else in the world, actors and
everybody else involved in the movie-making

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.400
process are only human.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
Mistakes will happen - but it goes without
saying that, as a general rule, most people

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.500
would rather watch an actual movie than a
movie's blooper reel.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.440
However, in some cases - either when a movie
is particularly bad or a blooper is particularly

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.589
good - the bloopers are actually more enjoyable
to watch than the movies themselves.

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.629

Here are ten bloopers you would rather watch
than the movie.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.120
Spider-Man 3
2007's Spider-Man 3 was a terrible movie and

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.100
a very poor finale to an otherwise great trilogy,
and it's safe to say that watching bloopers

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.690
from it is more enjoyable than watching the
movie itself.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.040
There are certainly plenty of bloopers to
choose from, including one classic example

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:29.060
of an actor not being able to stop laughing.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.729
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace
In 1999's heavily-criticised Star Wars: Episode

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.610
I - The Phantom Menace, Brian Blessed lent
his unmistaeable voice to Boss Nass - the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:47.270
leader of the Gungans, who the Jedi failed
to persuade to help the people of Naboo at

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.270
the start of the movie.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.369
In the scene in which he is talking to the
Jedi and their allies, there's a blooper that

00:01:51.369 --> 00:02:04.069
is far more entertaining than the movie itself!

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.619
Iron Man 3
2013's Iron Man 3 certainly isn't as bad as

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.230
some people like to think it is, but it certainly
isn't one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.160
better quality or more entertaining offerings,
which is why it's fair to argue that the movie's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:33.920
bloopers raise more of a smile than the movie
itself.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.500
House of Wax
Any movie that has Paris Hilton acting in

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.850
it is bound to be terrible.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.330
2005 horror House of Wax saw her in one of
her most prominent roles and was, unsurprisingly,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.970
not an exception to that rule.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.920
It was a ridiculous movie that made the original
1953 movie of the same name look like a masterpiece,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:05.870
so it's definitely more enjoyable to watch
the bloopers.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.930
The Hangover
2009's The Hangover is undoubtedly a great

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.930
movie.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.540
It remains the highest-grossing R-rated comedy
of all time - and with good reason, because

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.540
it's hilarious.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.430
However, some of the outtakes are even funnier
to watch, with the cast's uncontrollable laughing

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:44.860
being infectious.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.270
Daddy Day Care
Daddy Day Care is one of those movies where

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.980
the bloopers are, quite literally, the best
part about it.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.280
The 2003 "comedy" - and we use that word very
loosely - incorporates some of its gag reel

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.040
into the credits at the end, and it's genuinely
more entertaining than the previous hour and

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:11.020
a half you have to endure before it.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.700
Movie 43
Movie 43 is an absolutely awful movie.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.910
In spite of its almost unbelievably large
and strong ensemble cast, it is quite literally

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.810
one of the worst movies ever made.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.782
Like Daddy Day Care, it features some of its
bloopers in its closing credits - in this

00:04:23.782 --> 00:04:30.550
case, it's almost as if the people behind
the movie knew viewers would be dissatisfied,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.570
so they thought they'd throw in a few laughs
to appease them before they left the theatre.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.960
Men in Black II
2002's Men in Black II was undoubtedly the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.380
worst of the Men in Black movies, but it was
still pretty enjoyable.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.080
That being said, with Tommy Lee Jones being
such a straight-laced character in the franchise,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.600
seeing him mess up and subsequently laugh
was always going to be more enjoyable than

00:04:48.600 --> 00:05:06.880
watching this movie as a full feature.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.070
Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues
Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues continued

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.780
in 2013 where 2004's Anchorman: The Legend
of Ron Burgundy left off.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.650
While it lacked the originality of the first
movie, it was genuinely every bit as funny.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.620
A particularly funny moment came in the form
of Paul Rudd's Brian Fantana showcasing his

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:37.600
condom collection to the rest of the main
cast in his office.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:52.180
Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad
Suicide Squad was one of the biggest cinematic

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.990
disappointments of 2016.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.460
It seemed to have a great cast and a unique
concept for a comic book movie, but something

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.740
just didn't click.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.010
That being said, the cast seemed to have lots
of fun on set - not least because of a lot

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.210
of fun bloopers.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:16.669
Those bloopers are a lot easier to watch than
the contrived movie itself.

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.280
Thanks for watching our video about ten bloopers
you would rather watch than the movie.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.250
What other bloopers were more entertaining
than the movie they occurred in?
