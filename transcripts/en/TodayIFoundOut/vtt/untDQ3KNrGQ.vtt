00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.610
The popping is a result of the walls of the
Rice Krispies kernels fracturing.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.480
There are two prevalent theories as to the
exact process that results in this fracturing

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.580
and it’s entirely possible that both are
occurring.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.960
Rice Krispies, also known as “Rice Bubbles”,
in some countries, are created by preparing

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.230
rice in such a way that it will “pop”
like popcorn during the cooking process, albeit

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.610
much less dramatically.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.480
This popping puffs up the kernels.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.280
When the rice is finished cooking, most of
the Rice Krispies will have thin solid walls

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.340
with hollow, sealed, areas inside where air
pockets have formed.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.840
In the first theory of what is causing the
fracturing of the walls, the sudden temperature

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.860
shift caused by adding cold milk to the Rice
Krispies causes the air inside the hollow

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.870
pockets to contract suddenly, which in turn
fractures the thin walls of the Rice Krispies,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.870
creating the noises.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.990
The second theory also involves the fracturing
of the thin walls, but by a different mechanism.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.990
The thin walls of the Rice Krispies have very
strong bonds between the starch molecules,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.180
due to the high heat the Rice Krispies were
prepared at.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.390
When you add cold milk, the sudden shift of
temperature puts a high amount of stress on

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200
these bonds, due to uneven absorption.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.740
This is actually the exact same thing that
happens when you pour hot water over a frozen

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.740
windshield.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.980
This dramatic temperature shift causes both
the glass in the windshield and the walls

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.640
of the Rice Krispies to shatter.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.280
While Rice Krispies are puffed by preparing
the kernels with steam to provide the necessary

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.369
moisture to the kernels to properly “pop”
them, other methods to puff up rice/corn/wheat/etc

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.170
are also possible.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.640
The most popular other method is called “gun
puffing”.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.500
In this method, the kernels are cooked under
high pressure.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.260
When the cooking process is at just the right
stage, given the particular kernel, the pressure

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.810
is released, causing the kernel to rapidly
expand.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.700
This method tends to produce a more spongy
end product, rather than crispy, like the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:22.669
method used 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:32.470
with Rice Krispies.
