00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.060
So right here we've listed two
quantities or two fluid volumes

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.800
right over here in terms
of gallons, 1 gallon and 2

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.320
gallons.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.903
And what I want to
do in this video is

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:13.830
try to convert this quantity
of fluid, this volume of fluid,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.210
I want to convert it into
these other units within the US

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.749
customary system.

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.290
So I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.664
and first try to
do the 1 gallon.

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:26.010
Try to convert it into quarts,
pints, cups, and fluid ounces.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.400
Well, 1 gallon is
equal to 4 quarts.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.720
So we can just multiply by 4.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.770
1 quart is equal to 2 pints,
so we can multiply this by 2.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.420
So 4 quarts, each
of them are 2 pints.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.960
4 times 2 gets us to 8 pints.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.660
Each pint is equal to 2
cups, so we have 8 pints.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.450
Each of them are
equal to 2 cups.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.990
We're going to have 16 cups.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.170
And then finally, if we're
converting from a cup

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.680
to a fluid ounce, each
cup is 8 fluid ounces.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.850
So if we have 16 cups, it's
going to be 16 times 8.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.190
8 times 8 is 64, and it's
going to be twice that.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.117
That's going to be
128 fluid ounces.

00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:15.950
Now, let's do the same
thing with 2 gallons.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.397
Try to convert that into quarts,
pints, cups, and fluid ounces.

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:20.980
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.370
and try it on your own first.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.840
Well, same idea.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.860
1 gallon is equivalent
to 4 quarts.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.810
So 2 gallons are going to be
2 times 4 quarts, or 8 quarts.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.640
quart is 2 pints.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.400
So if we want to go
from quarts to pints,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.050
we'd want to multiply by 2.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.330
So this is going to be 16 pints.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.860
And then each pint is 2 cups.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.210
So multiplying 16 of them, then
that's going to be 32 cups.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.610
And then finally,
each cup is 8 ounces.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.850
32 times 8 is going to be?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.370
Let's see, it's going to be 256.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.960
And notice something here.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260
When we went from 1
gallon to 2 gallons,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.009
we essentially increased the
quantity of gallons by 2,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.085
or we multiplied by 2.

00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:12.460
And you see that
across the board

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.640
here as it's going from
4 quarts to 8 quarts.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.170
This is going from
8 pints to 16 pints.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.040
This is going from
16 cups to 32 cups,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.890
going from 128
fluid ounces to 256.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.202
When you increase the volume
in gallons by a factor of 2,

00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:31.160
you're, of course, going
to increase the volume

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.792
in any unit you measure
it in by a factor of 2.
