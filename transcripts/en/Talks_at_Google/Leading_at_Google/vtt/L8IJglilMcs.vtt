[DIGITAL JINGLE]

00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:07.710
MELISSA MORALES: Let's get
started and talk a little bit

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.873
about SheFighter.

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:10.040
LINA KHALIFEH: So thank you.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.430
Yeah-- go ahead.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.150
MELISSA MORALES:
Yeah, yeah, yeah-- no.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.608
LINA KHALIFEH: Thank you so
much for bringing me to Google.

00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:17.350
Actually, Google filmed a
documentary about SheFighter

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.155
last year.

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:18.780
But it's funny.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.880
You can find it on my
website, shefighter.com.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.740
But it's funny that
they filmed me running

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.120
all the time in the streets.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.620
And I told them,
I'm not a runner.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.725
I fight.

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:27.600
And they're like, no.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.170
We want more if you running.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.320
I'm like, fine.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.920
We did a lot of running.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.680
So if you see, like,
just me running,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.155
that's Google, from that
documentary about it.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:40.530
MELISSA MORALES: That's called
the Google Marketing Pixie

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.910
Dust that was sprinkled
on the whole thing.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.690
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah,
but I think they

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.160
wanted to show more of
Jordan-- the history,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.330
the streets, the people.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.830
Because they were
all looking at me,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.190
like, why is she running
at 4:00 in the morning?

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.107
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah.

00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:59.430
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah-- my
name is Lina Khalifeh.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.670
And have you heard of the
Khalifa Tower in Dubai?--

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.420
the tallest one in the world?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.230
I don't own it.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.020
If I owned it, I would come with
a private jet, like "vvvv"--

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.760
just land here.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.670
I started SheFighter
in 2012 with the idea

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.550
of solving the
problem for violence

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.320
against women in
the Middle East.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.780
Honestly, I had enough.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.910
I had enough from women telling
me, we cannot do anything.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.550
We have no solution.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.580
We're weak.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.750
I've heard that a lot,
especially growing up and being

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.520
raised in the Middle East.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.540
So what I did--

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.950
I had a background in taekwondo.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.243
I started 5-years-old,
training taekwondo.

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:40.410
And the reason why I started
it-- because my parents

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.660
want me to stay away
from the streets.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.490
I used to beat up boys a lot.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.700
And they're like, OK, we
need Lina off the streets.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.880
So if you see that
scar, it's actually

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.980
one of the fights with the boys.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.110
And yeah-- they enrolled
me in a taekwondo school.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.410
And from that time, I got
so addicted to martial arts.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.920
I loved it.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.230
It became part of my
personality-- my identity.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.880
And that's where I
wanted also, later on,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.380
to start something for women.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.360
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah--
that's incredible.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.090
So speaking of getting
into fights with boys--

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.500
LINA KHALIFEH: All the time--

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.720
MELISSA MORALES: Tell us
a little bit about some

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.090
of the challenges that
you've faced along the way

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.577
in starting SheFighter
and helping grow it.

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:21.910
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah, definitely.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.360
So I started SheFighter
because my friend

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.420
got beaten up and abused
by her brother and father

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.000
when I was at the university.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.560
And she was just my colleague.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.933
And I got really upset.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.350
I told her, why
didn't you report?

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.730
Why don't you do something?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.100
And she said, we
cannot do anything.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.930
Women cannot do anything.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.070
I got so pissed off.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.850
I said, I don't have a lot
of power and knowledge.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.910
But what I know
is training women

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.830
how to defend themselves-- how
to stand up for themselves.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.100
And I started at the basement
of my parents' house.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.880
And it was in 2009.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.190
And in 2012, I took
it very seriously.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.070
And I started SheFighter,
the first self-defense

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.960
to do in the Middle
East for women.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.910
And everyone was
against the idea-- a lot

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.410
of haters everywhere, right?

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.750
And they said, it's
not going to work.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.993
Women in the Middle
East are not interested.

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:13.410
They're just
interested in cooking

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.630
and just gossiping, maybe, or--

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.860
whatever-- fashion.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.000
And I told them, no.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.560
I believe that's right.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.860
And that's where I did
not care about others.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.430
It's important for you
to know that you do not

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.470
listen to people who
want to put you down.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.150
You always have small support.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.110
It doesn't matter.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.120
Just hang on with the support.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.000
And just look at the
bright side all the time.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.120
But a lot of challenges, of
course, as you start growing.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.670
The more you grow, the
more challenges it becomes.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.950
And the bigger it
becomes, dealing

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.040
with market and mostly
male-dominated country,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.330
like Jordan.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.710
So it started from an
idea to this huge business

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.750
that we are
franchising globally.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.450
And then the problems started
getting bigger and bigger.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.780
They want to shut me down.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.020
They want me they want
me off the market.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.657
I'm changing women's lives.

00:04:02.657 --> 00:04:03.990
I'm changing the way they think.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.880
And they just want me out.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.020
So one of the stories
is I got sued--

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.250
so it's a suit case-- by a man
who happened to be a lawyer.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.490
His wife was training at
SheFighter for two years.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.200
And she had an argument.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.290
And she used
self-defense against him.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.430
And she punched him in the face.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.640
And he got so upset,
because we taught her

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.020
how to stand up for herself.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.690
And he sued us for
teaching her self-defense.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.510
And he said, she cannot
teach that to women.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.350
And I thought, it's a joke.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.100
But it wasn't a joke.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.720
And I had to deal
with it legally.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.940
I called my lawyer.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.950
And they told him, there is
a stupid guy who sued us.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.700
Now what?

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.360
And he said, let's
work on it legally.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.550
I'm going to call him and see
what we can do from there.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.310
Because it's a still
male-dominated country

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.870
that will support men.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.840
And they you do whatever it
takes to protect the family.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.300
For them, if, like, SheFighter,
is ruining some of the families

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.790
or getting more divorces--

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.400
for them, women have voices.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.590
It means, they can put
me in jail for that.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.160
So you need to act smart
when you work in these areas.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.585
You cannot just keep fighting.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.350
You need to be smart.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.565
You just need to be smart.

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:29.190
So we said, we're
going to talk to him.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.815
We're going to have
a meeting with him.

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:33.000
And we brought him.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.040
So we told him,
what do you want?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.290
Like, let's not
get this to court.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.770
And he said, I want my wife
to be out of SheFighter.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.740
I don't want her to
come to train anymore.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.673
I'm like, problem solved--

00:05:45.673 --> 00:05:46.590
it's going to be done.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.340
And we called her.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.250
And we told her, you have to
solve your problems at home,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.440
dealing with your husband.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.240
But we cannot have you
at SheFighter anymore.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.120
But we had to work on
this in a smart way

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.498
to protect the business
from haters like him.

00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:05.040
MELISSA MORALES:
Yeah-- and actually,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.707
that leads me to my
next question, which

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:09.420
is, you're a social
entrepreneur who started small

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.880
but has really sought to scale.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.800
And you've done these
trainer of trainers,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.900
which is how you've been
able to really reach

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.910
a really mass audience.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.650
I'm wondering, when
you close your eyes

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.520
and you really envision your
grand vision for SheFighter--

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.470
in 10 years, what
does that look like?

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.010
Where do you hope to achieve?

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.360
What kind of change
do you hope to effect?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.610
LINA KHALIFEH: So definitely,
the more I inspire people,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.920
I feel like I'm
doing my purpose.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.050
I feel like, I'm alive.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.750
I feel, I'm not just
a number in the world.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.500
And my goal is to get to 1
million trainers globally.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.660
Now, we've done 500 trainers--

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.380
certified.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.200
And they are doing their
own workshops and trainings

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.590
in many countries, like Germany,
South Korea, and Africa,

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.920
Mauritius, in Portugal--
all over the world.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.565
And we're bringing
it to United States.

00:06:57.565 --> 00:06:58.440
MELISSA MORALES: Yay!

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.740
LINA KHALIFEH: So--

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.657
MELISSA MORALES: Whoo!

00:06:59.657 --> 00:07:02.700
LINA KHALIFEH: --I'm excited
to partner up, train trainers--

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.240
just grow this movement.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.270
Of course, the training
is not just physical.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.360
We have a lot of
training psychological.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.490
We call it the
philosophy of SheFighter.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.100
It's how to actually avoid a
lot of problems in your life

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.650
by just being more
self-confident

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.170
and believing in yourself
and just standing

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.650
strong for yourself
and others as well.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.870
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.650
And I guess, along
those lines, you

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.410
mentioned this
internal work that you

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.210
ask people who come through the
program to engage in, right?

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.250
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.500
MELISSA MORALES: I'm curious--

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.430
what kind of
internal work do you

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.050
do to maintain your
motivation, especially

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.425
when you're thinking about
challenges that you're facing,

00:07:43.425 --> 00:07:45.150
like the ones you described?

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.490
What kind of
processes do you have?

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.160
LINA KHALIFEH: So I realized
through my journey building

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.780
SheFighter, it's not
just building SheFighter.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.090
I changed a lot.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.290
I change in my mind.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.750
I changed in the
way I view life.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.000
I saw meeting different women
and people all over the globe.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.790
And I started growing my mind
and expanding my mind a lot--

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.710
that I felt, life
is so beautiful,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:12.060
just knowing that there
is a lot of mystery in it

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.110
and how you can solve everything
and how you grow internally.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.450
So martial arts
helped a lot on being

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.070
more focused and disciplined.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.060
But I realized, as I started
growing, my thoughts actually

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.780
affect a lot of decisions that
I have to make in the future.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.780
So I started to think about
positive things all the time.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.370
Positive doesn't mean that I
have to be happy all the time.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.552
It's just, my thoughts on
more brighter than darker.

00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:38.760
And if I have a dark thought,
I would think about it.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.909
Like, why do I get that
dark thought or emotion?

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.650
And I start implementing
it in my life.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.820
And good things started to
be attracted to my work.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.230
Other than-- I realized,
in my students--

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.090
my journey empowering women
as well, some students--

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.990
the women--

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.180
they started having
some ego problems.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.430
They become so strong--

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.700
stronger than men.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.920
They can take down any man.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.730
They're so strong.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.230
MELISSA MORALES: Ooh!

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.845
LINA KHALIFEH: They
got so addicted--

00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:04.920
MELISSA MORALES: OK.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.930
LINA KHALIFEH: That's good, but
they had the problem of ego.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.972
Of course, not all of
them, but some of them that

00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:11.250
they felt that they're
better than others.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.460
And it's important that
they keep this humbleness.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.660
You know your skills.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.710
Like, I know my skills.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.820
I know my strength.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.670
But I still do it for
good, not to hurt others

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:27.420
and not to use it for violence
or for just proving to others

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.373
that I'm the best.

00:09:28.373 --> 00:09:29.790
You don't have to
prove to others.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.530
You know yourself.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.915
A lot of my students, they
started challenging me.

00:09:35.915 --> 00:09:37.040
Like, do you want to fight?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.350
MELISSA MORALES: Wow.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.310
LINA KHALIFEH: Because
they want to test

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.060
if they are stronger than me.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.150
And then I learned,
it's an ego talking.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.930
It's not them.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.090
They changed to
become this person who

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.880
just wants to fulfill the
ego, because it gives them

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.180
satisfaction.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.620
So they have a problem
with self-confidence.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.220
For me, if you want to
prove to others and yourself

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.530
that you're good,
you have a problem

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.000
with your self-confidence.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.410
You don't know who you are.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.160
And they need to
know who they are.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.210
So I started talking
more training

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.340
about how to
discipline your ego,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.180
because the ego
wanted to be fed.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.860
Like, you want to
buy the best car.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.770
You want to buy the best house.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.640
Just-- it's ego talking to you.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.200
I would feel good,
if I buy this.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.900
I would feel good if
I win this champion--

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.670
I would feel good if I--

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.960
and it'd get me
thinking, why these girls

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.580
are behaving in that way.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.240
And then I did all
this philosophy.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.030
And I implemented
it in my training--

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.350
the philosophy of SheFighter.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.720
And it talks a lot
about thoughts,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.070
ego, discipline,
and how you create

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.073
your future and all of that.

00:10:45.073 --> 00:10:45.990
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.823
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah.

00:10:46.823 --> 00:10:49.940
MELISSA MORALES: I really
cannot think of a better place

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.070
to deliver this message
than Silicon Valley--

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.630
my goodness.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.960
So just very briefly,
I wanted to task

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.920
if you could share a brief story
of somebody in your program

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.710
that you think really
exemplifies that transition--

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.650
that evolution of coming
in, maybe not feeling super

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.530
empowered, but then
coming out the other end,

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.380
and then being what
you hope to see.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.507
And then we'll open it up
to audience Q&amp;A. I promise.

00:11:18.507 --> 00:11:19.340
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.900
So one of the stories--

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.950
one of the girls we had training
at SheFighter in Jordan.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.920
She got attacked at the
elevator in her own building

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.030
by a stranger.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.920
And she said, it was daytime.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.750
I was just heading
back from work.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.580
And there was a guy
who pushed her in.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.240
He choked her.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.800
And he wanted to rape her.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.160
And that guy-- he
was in his mid 20s.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.040
He was big.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.380
And she freaked out.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.670
The first thing she said--

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.130
I freaked out.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.800
I had a pepper spray in my bag.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.880
But everything fell.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.110
I could not think.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.240
And all I have is just myself.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.883
And she could not
even scream for help.

00:11:54.883 --> 00:11:55.550
So what she did.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.690
She start pushing him.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.250
She said, my mind
started reacting.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.720
Because she is trained, right?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.120
So she started pushing
him away from her,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.100
until he felt like
she's resisting a lot.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.360
So he escaped from the elevator.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.870
She got angry and chased
him to the streets.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.610
And she asked some
men to help her.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.690
She said, like, thief!--

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.230
or whatever.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.770
And everyone-- of course,
it's a macho society, right?

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.560
They all jump in on that guy.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.480
And what she did-- she started
hitting him in the street,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.620
because she's angry.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.790
He touched her.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.370
And the police
came after a while.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.870
You know how the
police in America--

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.617
they haven't just donuts maybe?

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:32.471
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:37.690
In Jordan, they have falafel,
so not much different.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.470
They came after a while.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.610
She put charges against him
in court for sexual assault.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.920
He put charges against her for
beating him up in the street.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.030
But she won the case.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.035
And he got three years
in jail for assault.

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:49.910
MELISSA MORALES: Wow.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.360
LINA KHALIFEH: So that's
one of the stories.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.860
There are so many
others, of course.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.060
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah,
yeah, yeah-- absolutely.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.560
Well, that was some--

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.060
yeah.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.565
LINA KHALIFEH: Thank
goodness-- huh?

00:12:58.565 --> 00:12:59.360
MELISSA MORALES: She
really-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.930
She really turned
that situation around.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:01.240
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.782
MELISSA MORALES:
OK, so now we'd like

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.630
to open it up for audience
Q&amp;A. What questions do you

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.165
have for Lina?

00:13:07.165 --> 00:13:08.540
AUDIENCE: The
story that you told

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.260
earlier about the husband
that got mad at the wife

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.310
for hitting him--

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.380
what other alternatives do you
think there-- because I almost

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.790
think, it's interesting
that you made the decision

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.130
to adhere to what he said
just to save your business.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.300
But I'm wondering if that really
goes against the core values.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.363
So I'm just curious--

00:13:23.363 --> 00:13:24.530
what went through your head?

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.600
And what are the alternatives
that you thought?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.080
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.060
MELISSA MORALES: Because I
think that's a tough decision.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.935
I don't know if I'd have
made the same, but--

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:31.610
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah-- for sure.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:36.170
If I had to, of course,
deal with him-- let's say,

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.240
stand against him and just
deal with it in court,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.290
it's going to take years.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.773
And he's a lawyer, so he has
connections inside the court.

00:13:43.773 --> 00:13:44.690
That's something else.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.545
Usually, men in
the Middle East--

00:13:46.545 --> 00:13:48.170
I don't know if you
have that trouble--

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.850
but it's mostly about friends--

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.700
making friends.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.320
I think it's everywhere.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.650
But mostly, it happens
a lot between men,

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.850
because they have relatives
in the government.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.490
They have-- so they know people.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.500
And sometimes, just
standing up against that

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.580
will just drain your energy.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.580
It's going to get you
to a point that you

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.240
want to shut down everything.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.260
And it's going to fill you with
more anger, because society

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.550
is not helping.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.170
So you think about
the smart decision.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.550
Of course, we called her.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.550
When we called her, she said,
I want to focus on my family.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.900
It was her decision.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.270
Like, she can get a
divorce if she wants.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.480
But for us to protect our
students and business,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.920
we have to act smart.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.720
And sometimes, just
going against them--

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.880
it means that you're
losing a battle.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.970
So in that environment, also--

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.400
for example, if you go
in the street and say,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.090
I am asking for women's rights,
they can easily kill you.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.480
It's not an easy environment.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.670
And if you want to spread
the message on the long-term,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.160
you need to exist
for a longer term.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.610
You cannot go do something
crazy and suddenly--

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.660
what's your use in life if
they actually took you in jail?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.340
You're not going to empower
a lot of other people.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.170
So you need to be smart.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.990
You need to make
a lot of friends.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.960
Even-- like, you
cannot go, let's say,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.430
just angry at the society.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.520
I worked with Syrian
refugees a lot.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.340
Also, Syrian refugees--
they have a lot of problems.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.900
They have child marriage.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.400
And of course, for me, it
pisses me off to see a child--

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.580
12-years-old-- getting
married, right?

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.480
But what I can do?

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.120
I cannot go and tell them,
you are doing something wrong.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.140
You need to change that.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.130
It's a culture.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.560
You cannot change the
culture in one day.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.210
It might take years, you know?

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.510
And what you do is,
just, you give examples.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.360
You inspire them.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.640
You empower the little
girls that, one day,

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.110
they can be something.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.080
Because all they see is just
a crisis, like, just a war.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.750
Or their father, probably,
is married to 20 women.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.440
I don't know.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.607
They have a lot of problems.

00:15:42.607 --> 00:15:44.500
I worked with them
for, like, four years.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.512
And you cannot go and just
go against them-- like,

00:15:48.512 --> 00:15:49.720
you're doing something wrong.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.010
You cannot do that.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.960
Because they would
never listen to you.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.130
They would leave.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.800
They would say, who are you to
tell us to change that culture?

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.890
But what you want to do--

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.840
you want to act smart.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.610
You want them to love you--

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.190
like, really love you-- so
they can listen to you--

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.830
so they can look at
you as a role model.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.170
And that's what I
do-- how I do it.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.590
I have a lot of men
supporting me in Jordan.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.140
And they keep telling me,
you're our role model.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.740
Because for me, also, having
the men's support is important,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.870
because it's a male-dominated--

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.800
Middle East is very
male-dominated.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.210
And you need men, also,
to back you up sometimes.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.800
They have friends.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.490
And it's fine.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.320
I have a lot of
support from women.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.370
I have from men--

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.430
like, I had a lot of
problems with the government.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.420
But who helped me with it?

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.510
It was all my male friends.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.047
And they're like, we need
to stop these haters.

00:16:43.047 --> 00:16:45.130
And we're going to stand
up by you, because you're

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.360
doing something good.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.590
And you need that support.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.520
And you need to change
slowly, step-by-step.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.660
You can't go and say,
like, we want our rights--

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.820
shouting, because no
one will listen to you.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.220
So it's just different.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.980
Being raised in the
Middle East is different.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for your talk.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.869
So this is pretty ironic,
because the end of this month,

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.290
I'm going to Jordan too.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:09.880
LINA KHALIFEH: Oh, [? great. ?]

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.950
AUDIENCE: First time ever
going to Middle East--

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.200
LINA KHALIFEH: You'll love it.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.520
AUDIENCE: So yeah--
just wondering--

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.140
I don't know if it's true, but
the stereotype that the Middle

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.464
East-- it's a little dangerous.

00:17:21.464 --> 00:17:22.839
And people have
been telling me--

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:22.905
LINA KHALIFEH: Oh, no--

00:17:22.905 --> 00:17:23.859
Jordan is very safe.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.810
AUDIENCE: OK-- so
I was wondering,

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.690
was that what inspired you
to get into self-defense?

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.250
I don't know.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.258
And then, do you have any
tips for a woman going

00:17:32.258 --> 00:17:33.550
to Jordan, especially someone--

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.090
LINA KHALIFEH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.715
AUDIENCE: --who
doesn't look Jordanian?

00:17:35.715 --> 00:17:39.800
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah, Jordan
loves tourists a lot.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.940
And yeah-- so you probably
want to go to Dead Sea, Petra--

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.840
there is a place--

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.170
you know the movie, "Martians"?

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.860
It was filmed in Jordan,
because it's all desert.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.980
And we're supposed to be Mars.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.830
I don't know.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.590
And there's a camp there--

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.820
it's next to Petra--

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.320
where you can-- it
actually was started

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.300
with the film of "The Martian."

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.770
And then they left it there.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:11.170
So it's like rounded houses,
where the ceiling's just open.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.880
And you see the stars at night.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.730
So definitely-- you do
it to work in Jordan.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.630
They love tourists.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.880
And they're very
friendly with tourists.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.490
I'm a local.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.800
So it's different.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.350
I know there are
rules inside rules.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.010
And just, that's why I know
about all the domestic violence

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.610
we have.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.740
But with tourists, they're
just very welcoming.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.480
You're going to see that.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.930
But don't think now it's
hot in the Middle East.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.280
Actually, with climate
change, it's changing.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.820
We have a lot of
rain, flash floods.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.990
And you definitely want to
be careful of flash floods.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.650
If there is rain, don't
go to Dead Sea or Petra,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.610
because there's going to be
just sudden flash floods.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.450
But enjoy the food.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:53.275
The food is good.

00:18:53.275 --> 00:18:55.150
MELISSA MORALES: No, I
think it's interesting

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.360
what you mentioned-- like, the
juxtaposition of, you know,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.500
the safety that maybe
one encounters out living

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.860
in the streets or in the world,
but then the very real dangers

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.025
that sometimes exist
behind closed doors, right?

00:19:08.025 --> 00:19:08.620
LINA KHALIFEH:
Yeah, yeah-- it is.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.700
MELISSA MORALES: Because
domestic violence--

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.633
there's a huge incidence
of it everywhere,

00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:12.800
including the United States.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.400
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah,
yeah-- it's everywhere.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.800
MELISSA MORALES: So we're
certainly not immune of it

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.840
here.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.420
But I think, it just speaks to--

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.820
we think sometimes about--
maybe like the situation

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.100
that you described of
somebody literally attacking

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.533
you and trying to assault
you-- sexually assault you.

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:28.450
And obviously, those
situations are also real.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.520
But there's just
such a myriad of

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.400
different nuanced
situations, where

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.140
you might find yourself actually
wanting to have these skills.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.635
And maybe you
didn't think that--

00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:41.800
it's maybe not like a scary
situation all of a sudden,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.490
but something that
builds over time.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.750
So anyway, just, I think
that's an interesting point--

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.340
the distinction
to be made, right?

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.100
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah, definitely.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.780
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah,
OK, let's get in--

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.822
LINA KHALIFEH: A couple--

00:19:53.822 --> 00:19:56.238
MELISSA MORALES: --a couple
more questions really quickly.

00:19:56.238 --> 00:19:57.850
And then we can move on to the--

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:58.707
oh, oh, OK!

00:19:58.707 --> 00:19:59.540
You have a question.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.340
All right, Anthony,
let's hit it.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.260
AUDIENCE: So I know
that you mentioned

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.400
that you were planning to
move your business over

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.690
to the United States.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.595
Have you face any challenges
here in the United States

00:20:08.595 --> 00:20:10.080
while doing that?

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.680
LINA KHALIFEH: So
should I mention--

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.180
OK.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.097
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah.

00:20:13.097 --> 00:20:14.597
LINA KHALIFEH: So
I'm also Canadian.

00:20:14.597 --> 00:20:15.748
I have a Canadian passport.

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:17.040
That's why it's easier to move.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.050
But I was in Seattle.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.063
And I usually don't
have any problem

00:20:21.063 --> 00:20:22.230
coming to the United States.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.313
And I was stopped
by the Customs--

00:20:24.313 --> 00:20:25.230
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.090
LINA KHALIFEH: --or
the Passport Control,

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.850
asking me, for two
hours, like 100 questions

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.230
and just being so rude.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:38.130
But it was just this
experience about the police,

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.660
maybe, in America.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.740
I'm not sure later on.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.700
But I still keep the
positive side of everything.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.260
I mean, I've been to Pakistan.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.330
I've been to Saudi Arabia.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.938
I've been to many,
many countries.

00:20:49.938 --> 00:20:52.230
I know that you're going to
face, sometimes, obstacles.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.730
It's fine.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:53.490
It's everywhere.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.810
You have problems.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.918
But it's just how you
look at it later on.

00:20:57.918 --> 00:20:59.460
Sometimes, you have
to deal with it--

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.660
like, just deal with it.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.520
Just be patient.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.063
Do not really argue a lot
and try to get out of it.

00:21:07.063 --> 00:21:09.480
MELISSA MORALES: Let me change
the framing of the question

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.880
a little bit and ask you about
it from a business perspective,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.380
right?

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:13.680
LINA KHALIFEH: Oh, yeah.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.080
MELISSA MORALES: Because
again, social entrepreneur--

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:16.900
You're out there.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.400
You're trying to
build partnerships.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.710
You're trying to get support
and meet the right folks.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.383
Like, even already
in this room, there's

00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:25.800
a couple of people who are
interested in working with you.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.925
What are some of the
challenges that you're facing?

00:21:27.925 --> 00:21:33.450
Or how can we, as an audience,
right here in the United

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.685
States, support you as you
try to grow your business

00:21:36.685 --> 00:21:38.310
and bring it here to
the United States?

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.410
LINA KHALIFEH:
Sure-- for example,

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.060
I've never lived in
the United States.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.140
That's number one.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.740
So I would love to know more
about who I can connect with

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.800
or if there's working
spaces for women

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.340
or we can partner up-- or
all these important things--

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.650
how to build my team
in the United States.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.600
In Seattle, there
were a couple of girls

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.460
who just came to my session.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.115
And they're, like, CrossFit--

00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:02.490
MELISSA MORALES:
Oh, yeah, yeah--

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:02.990
CrossFit, yeah.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.080
LINA KHALIFEH: And they're like,
we want to take your course.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.180
MELISSA MORALES: It's a very
enthusiastic audience, yes.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:07.680
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah,
and they're like,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.210
we've been following you a lot.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.120
And it's important
for me to create

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.110
all these women who
love, first, fitness,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.700
who love to empower other--

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.950
you don't have to have any
background also in fitness.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.350
But if you want to change
other people's lives

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.610
or you want to empower them
through training self-defense

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.140
and teaching to a
younger generation,

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.950
I would just be
happy to communicate,

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.280
coordinate together.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:33.450
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:33.960
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.980
MELISSA MORALES: So I just
wanted to put that out

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.313
there for folks in the room
or folks who may be watching

00:22:37.313 --> 00:22:40.530
on Livestream or later on.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.405
If you're interested,
make sure to reach out.

00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:43.738
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah, definitely.

00:22:43.738 --> 00:22:45.790
You can reach out on
website, SheFighter.com.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.040
MELISSA MORALES: Yes, perfect.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.320
LINA KHALIFEH: Or we are
on all social media--

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.340
so at SheFighter
Instagram or Twitter.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.623
MELISSA MORALES: Can't beat
that Instagram, you know?

00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:57.790
LINA KHALIFEH: There's a
lot of Google on Instagram.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.810
MELISSA MORALES: Slide
into the SheFighter DMs.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:00.852
That's what she's saying.

00:23:00.852 --> 00:23:03.960
OK, let's take
one more question.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.130
We have a couple more minutes.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.250
OK, we got one over here.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.130
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned some
of your individual supporters

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.378
for you trying to have a
women-empowering organization

00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:16.545
in a male-dominated society.

00:23:16.545 --> 00:23:17.378
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah.

00:23:17.378 --> 00:23:20.640
AUDIENCE: Did you find any
allies in organizations?

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.587
And how did you engage with them
and support them the other way?

00:23:23.587 --> 00:23:25.170
LINA KHALIFEH: Oh,
you mean in Jordan?

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.837
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.780
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah, definitely.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.550
As I said, you're
going to have support.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.800
You always have to look at
the good side all the time,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.710
wherever you go.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.750
Even if you go to really, really
countries that is under war,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.270
you're going to have
support coming for you.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.250
You need to just
make sure that you

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.937
are on good terms
with these people,

00:23:42.937 --> 00:23:44.520
because they're going
to help you grow

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.350
and will help you also work
on your plan as you grow.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:53.370
Definitely-- I work-- like
SheFighter is so big in Jordan,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.890
anyway, we're covering schools.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.990
We work with different
organizations

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:03.570
like UNHCR and all these
NGOs that we work with.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.610
And everyone knows about us.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.100
We've been there
for so many years.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.260
And of course, men
and women support.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.340
At the beginning, there
were not much people.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.450
But as you start growing and
proving that your system is

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.190
actually working--
because people--

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.690
it's like your parents.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.150
When you saw something,
they're like, eh--

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.440
you don't want to spend
a lot of time doing that.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.950
And when you grow, you're
like, oh, you need our help?

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.990
We have to be part of it.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.930
And it's exactly like--
but you have to know this.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.490
Your journey is not
to prove to others.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.840
Your journey is just, you have
to go through this in order

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.135
to grow inside yourself.

00:24:42.135 --> 00:24:46.200
And once you do it, everything
else falls into pieces

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.250
and you're going to find
yourself inspiring thousands

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.480
of people or changing lives.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.610
But you don't have to
worry about future.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.120
You don't have to worry about
who's going to support or not.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.960
You just keep going
with your path.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.940
MELISSA MORALES: Hm.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.722
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:25:00.722 --> 00:25:02.180
MELISSA MORALES:
Yeah, that's hard.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.350
It's easier said than done.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.920
I will say that much.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.940
LINA KHALIFEH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.690
MELISSA MORALES: But I think--

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.460
yes, that's--

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.800
LINA KHALIFEH: It needs a lot of
dedication and self-confidence.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.650
MELISSA MORALES: Yeah, yeah--

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.250
the confidence--

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.550
LINA KHALIFEH:
Confidence-- yeah.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.540
MELISSA MORALES: --to believe
in your dream and your vision--

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.590
absolutely.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.433
OK, well, let's thank Lina--

00:25:14.433 --> 00:25:15.350
LINA KHALIFEH: Thanks.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.950
MELISSA MORALES: --for her time.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:16.992
LINA KHALIFEH: Thank you.

00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:19.600
[APPLAUSE]
