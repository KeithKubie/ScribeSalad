My name is Eslam Hesham, I'm a Front-End Course

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.020
manager at udacity

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.680
and I would like to give an insight into our

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.310
websites development program.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.480
In this program we start with the basics,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.480
from scratch

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.859
we don't expect the developers who want to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.810
join
the program to have any skills in the subject

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.259
on contrary, we start with the foundations,

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.249
so
our first course is introduction to HTML and

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.249
CSS

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:29.759
through which we learn how to present our

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.449
content on the website

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.290
presenting it on the front of the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.980
website in a beautiful and organized way

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.399
so that it draws the user to log on to the

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.660
website more than once and interact with it.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.850
The job of a front-end developer is very important

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
in our times

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.140
because nowadays every company, every product,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.390
and every application needs to have a front

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.070
needs something that expresses or showcases

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.070
it

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.730
So it's very important that the developer

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.590
is up to date with the technology, because
every day there's a new technology emerging

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.629
because every day there's a new technology

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.780
emerging,
there's a new technology taking over the market

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.580
so it's crucial that one is interested in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.670
developing himself, in adding to his knowledge.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.050
I encourage you if you love the topic to participate

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.050
in our program

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.800
I think it's going to be highly beneficial

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.410
for you, allowing
you to be a part of this diverse workforce

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.410
and market

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.260
you can even work from home if you'd rather,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.020
you don't have to be working in a company,
you can have clients of your own

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.180
I think it gives you the freedom to work anytime.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.910
from anywhere making good money like others.
