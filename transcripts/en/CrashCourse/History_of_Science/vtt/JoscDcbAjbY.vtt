00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.420
Like thermodynamics, the history of electrical
physics has its roots in pre-industrial questions

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.690
that converged in the nineteenth century.
These questions became a research paradigm,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.630
driven by a whole crew of researchers… And
they led to a power system that reshaped the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.960
world. Time to get tingly!

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.760
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.750
The study of electricity goes all the way
back to antiquity. Like, for a long time,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.789
people knew that lightning is the powerful
release of energy caused when two clouds are

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.660
in love and make a baby cloud.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.890
But that's hard to study.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.820
Much easier to study, however, was static
electricity, or the electrical charge produced

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.989
by stationary friction: it waits for you to
pet your cat, and then shocks you!

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.649
But for centuries, natural historians didn’t
really have any good ideas about how to more

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.659
deeply understand this phenomenon.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.960
For one, they had no concept of current, or
electricity as a flow of electrical charge.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.710
Current can happen either by the movement
of negatively charged subatomic particles

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.420
called electrons through wires, or by the
movement of charged molecules called ions.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.160
And these people didn't know either of those things existed.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.200
Secondly, the relationship between electricity
and magnetism, which are intimately linked,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
was a mystery.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.770
And, third, a lot of experimentation into
these phenomenon basically amounted to weird

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.479
parlor tricks that had no obvious uses.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.420
English natural philosopher Francis Hauksbee,
for example, found out in the early 1700s

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.289
that spinning a glass globe produced electricity—thus
creating one of the first electrical generators.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.900
Then, in 1729, two amateur scholars named
Stephen Gray and Granville Wheler discovered

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.210
that electricity could be communicated over
long distances by contact.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.109
This was an important first step toward researching
currents. But mostly it was an excuse to conduct

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.859
totally ethical scientific demonstrations…

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.649
like suspending a young boy from the ceiling,
charging him up, and then watching him attract

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.979
objects with different body parts.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.690
And we can’t forget statesman, encyclopedist,
and infamous knowitall Ben Franklin.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.069
He witnessed one of these flying-boy demonstrations
in Boston, then went home to Philadelphia

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.330
and waited for a thunderstorm.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.810
As the story goes, in 1752, he flew his kite
in a storm and succeeded in “drawing off”

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.480
electrical fire.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.370
Inspired by this incident, he developed the
lightning rod. But no real epistemic knowledge.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.010
One of the first modern electrical physicists
was Italian physician Luigi Galvani.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.069
In the late 1700s, his assistant accidentally
caused a frog’s leg to twitch with a spark

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.590
from a nearby electrostatic generator.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.970
Inspired by this chance observation, he conducted
many freaky experiments with frogs.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.370
After much frog-shocking, he theorized the
existence of animal electricity, or the electrical

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.520
basis of nerve impulses.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.620
That inspired one young woman who was remarkably
well informed about contemporary science:

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.629
in 1818, Mary Shelley published what would
become a very famous book about a man zapped

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.220
to life by a Galvani-esque Doctor Frankenstein.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.180
Galvani also inspired his colleague, Italian
physicist and chemist Alessandro Volta, to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.560
push his work on nerves further.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.549
And Volta became a rockstar of electrical
physics when he created the first practical

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.739
method of generating electricity—the first
battery, known as the voltaic pile

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.810
So ThoughtBubble, let's make some sparks fly!

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.560
Volta’s battery evolved from humble origins.
The first iterations were made of two different

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.909
metals separated by a brine-soaked cloth or
piece of cardboard.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.840
But Volta kept improving the pile. In 1800,
he stacked pairs of copper and zinc discs,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.459
again separated by briny cloth or cardboard.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.599
When he connected the top and bottom of the
pile, it generated a steady electric current

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.760
that could be carried by a wire.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.329
Volta had created the first stable source of electrical
current!

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.650
This type of two-metal battery fulfilled the
world’s scant electrical needs throughout

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.040
much of the First Industrial Revolution, until
around 1870.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.040
But no one could really explain how it worked,
in part because no one had brought electricity

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.890
and magnetism together.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.530
One of the first steps in this direction was
taken in 1820 by Danish physicist and chemist

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.220
Hans Christian Ørsted.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.110
While demonstrating to his students how to
heat up a wire by running an electrical current

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.889
through it, Ørsted noticed that his compass’
needle kept jumping to a ninety-degree angle.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.650
Somehow, he realized, the electrical charge
and the magnetic attraction of the compass

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.650
were linked.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.009
Ørsted conducted further experiments and
showed that electric currents actually produce

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.190
neatly circular magnetic fields when they
flow through wires.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.450
This became known as Ørsted’s law.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.590
Later in 1820, at the Academy of Science
in Paris, physicist André-Marie Ampère watched

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.370
as a friend reproduced Ørsted’s electrically-messing-with-a-compass
trick.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.729
Amazed, Ampère went to work figuring out
the math behind this special relationship.

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.530
He showed that two parallel, electrified wires
attract each other if the currents flow in

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.150
the same direction, and repel if the currents
flow in opposite directions.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.060
Thanks Thoughtbubble. Ampère also showed
that the force between the currents was inversely

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.940
proportional to the distance between them,
and proportional to the intensity of the current

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.360
flowing in each.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.980
This became known as Ampère's law. You can
watch a whole episode about that over at Crash

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.980
Course: Physics!

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.800
And he even theorized that there must be some
“electrodynamic molecule” that carried

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.400
the currents of electricity and magnetism.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.920
This became the basis for the electron.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.030
Ampère’s insights became the foundation
of the quantitative science of electromagnetism,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.210
or “electrodynamics.”

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:54.000
In 1827, Germany physicist Georg Ohm —who’d
been conducting research using Volta’s battery—published

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.510
his discovery that an electrical current

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.490
between two points is directly proportional
to the voltage, or potential difference, between

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.490
them.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.740
This became known as Ohm’s law.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.010
This can be expressed using the concept of
resistance, or the difficulty of passing an

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.430
electric current through that conductor, in
a really simple equation:

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.120
“I = V/R.” Current, measured in amperes,
is equal to voltage, measured in volts, divided

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.280
by resistance, measured in ohms.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.280
Yep: all three scientists became standard
units.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.860
Congrats, scientists!

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.740
They say, in Physics the greatest honor is when your name starts to be spelled with a lower case letter.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.640
With practical batteries and basic scientific
laws, the stage was set for electricity to

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.370
become an industry—enter motors and lights.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.440
Born to a poor family in Newington Butts,
London, Michael Faraday became obsessed with

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.150
electricity and chemistry at a young age.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.889
Eventually, he became as important to the
sciences of stuff as Darwin was to those of

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:52.889
life.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.690
In 1821—a year after Ørsted characterized
electromagnetism and Ampère began experimenting

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.000
with the math behind it—Faraday got to work
inventing electromagnetic motors.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.229
His motors worked due to “electromagnetic
rotation,” a motion made by the circular

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.990
magnetic force around an electrified wire.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:17.310
In 1831, he had his big breakthrough—electromagnetic
induction, meaning the generation of electricity

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:23.260
in one wire via the changing magnetic field
created by the current in another wire.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.400
This became the basis of the electromagnetic
technologies that we use today.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.110
So… thanks, Mike!

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.479
In the same year, Faraday also discovered
magneto-electric induction, which is the generation

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:38.360
of a steady, direct electrical current in
a wire by attaching it to a copper disc,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.050
and then rotating the disc between the poles
of a magnet. This was the first modern electrical

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.050
generator!

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.940
And he proved that the electricity created
by magnetic induction, the electricity produced

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.550
by a voltaic battery, and good ole static
electricity were all the same phenomenon.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.810
Faraday’s experiments led to the invention
of modern electrical motors, generators, and

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.810
transformers.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.430
He figured out how to make electricity do
work on magnetism and vice versa.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.560
And his young buddy, Scottish physicist James
Clerk Maxwell, played the Ampère to his Volta,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.870
figuring out the math involved in induction.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.310
In 1855, Maxwell dropped “On Faraday’s
lines of force,” showing Faraday’s discoveries

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.290
about electricity and magnetism in the forms
of differential equations.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.070
Maxwell’s long paper, “On Physical Lines
of Force,” introduced his full theory of

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.900
electromagnetism in parts over 1861 and ‘62.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.650
Here, he theorized that electromagnetic waves
travel at the speed of light, and that light

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.540
must exist in the same medium as electrical
and magnetic energy.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:46.190
By connecting light, electricity, and magnetism,
Maxwell laid the groundwork for modern physics.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.660
And his work was a major influence on Einstein.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.520
But the average person in the 1870s didn’t
know who Faraday and Maxwell were, much less

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.450
that they had revolutionized energy and work.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.820
There was still no system for using electricity
industrially.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.540
For that useful system, we have to hop across
the Atlantic to the first home of corporate

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.910
research and development in science—Menlo
Park, New Jersey.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:14.400
Here, a mix of brilliant engineers, scarcely
trained boys, and one pet bear (yes!) worked

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.800
under the direction of a controversial inventor—

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.280
who was or was decidedly not much of a scientist
himself, depending on which historian you

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.280
prefer.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.870
His name was Thomas Edison.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.980
Edison, or the “Wizard of Menlo Park,”
or the “Napoleon of Science,” started

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.830
his career as a lowly telegraph operator at
the age of sixteen.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:39.860
He worked his way up, improving telegraph
systems, until he could open his own contract-based-lab-slash-workshop

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.890
in 1876.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.780
Mostly, people remember Edison for his work
on making practical incandescent light bulbs,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.010
but he should really be thought of as the
person who first saw the potential for an

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.360
entire electrical grid.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.510
This included the generation of power, its
distribution to homes and businesses, and

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.540
the invention of useful products that required
electricity to work.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.450
In the late 1870s, people didn’t understand
or see the need for electricity. Customers

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.170
had to be created. So what did Edison do?

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.290
Befriended the richest guy in New York, who
was also the richest guy in the world—J.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.600
P. Morgan.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.960
With Morgan’s money, Edison had the resources
to work out the longest-lasting filament,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.940
or slender, heated-up-until-visibly-lighted
bit, for his bulbs.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.440
This ended up being made of carbon, after
thousands of experiments on different materials.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.070
But he also had the resources to show off
his lights in Paris and London. And, most

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.790
importantly, to electrify downtown Manhattan.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.620
Think about it for a second: the night before
1880 was dark.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.840
Yes, gas lamps existed, but they were weak,
smelly, and dangerous.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.760
Edison’s electrification of the cultural
and financial capital of an ascendent American

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.160
empire was… blindingly amazing.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.750
People stayed up longer. More work got done.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.280
The feedback loop of just pushing off bedtime
by a few hours was enormous—and this was

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.400
before anyone had devised a good mass-scale
electrical motor or vehicle.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.560
It’s true that Edison didn’t invent the
components of his electrical power system,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.980
only improved upon them,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.070
thanks to his team-based, finance-backed approach
to science and technology.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.890
And it’s true that he became embroiled in
an intense public battle called the Current War,

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:21.150
over the safety and efficiency of his direct
current, or DC, versus his rival Westinghouse’s

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.970
much more practical alternating current, or
AC.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.301
Aaaaand it’s true that Edison promoted capital
punishment in New York, using an electric

00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:30.850
chair powered by Westinghouse’s AC.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.900
But—beginning with incandescent light—Edison
and other inventors used the discoveries of

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.120
the early electrical physicists to utterly
transform the world.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.190
Next time—we’ll follow Edison, tracing
the effects of corporate research and mega-scale

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.671
engineering through many fields during the
Second Industrial Revolution. It’s time

00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:52.050
