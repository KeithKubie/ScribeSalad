00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.760
Look—it's changing color.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.760
It's changing color...

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.640
instantly.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.360
It's pretty amazing.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.660
Oh, here we go.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.100
[laughter]

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.940
This is six months of stress.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.180
[laughter]

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.080
This side up... great.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.620
Okay, so let's just slowly unsnake it.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.300
Okay, let's just roll it.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.120
Here we go.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.220
Great.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.420
We can slowly start to move it...

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.840
Yeah, so we get that corner orientated here,
which that'll be great.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.240
That's about right.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.740
Right?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.179
Today what we're doing is we're just unrolling
and unfolding the whole canopy.

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.249
As you can see it's massive.

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.770
It will fill the entire courtyard.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.570
And in prep for tomorrow, when we start to
take these edges and tails and begin to ratchet

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.640
and connect to the courtyard walls.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.720
We successfully removed the supports, so the
mast and the ropes are working together in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.170
tension and compression and standing on their
own.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.420
And what we're about to do—we have the large
canopy prepped.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.080
We're going to start with the north wall,
and we're going to start to make connections

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.050
in that corner.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.240
And then we're going to move it to tower one
and make connections to the tension ring.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.570
We'll unzip the zipper and then bring it around
and zip it up, and then we'll make connections

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.910
along the the southwest wall here, and then
slowly work our way around to the southeast

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.120
wall, and then eventually to tower two, and
just stitch our way around.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.160
Is it knitted or crocheted?

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.850
It's knitted—digitally knitted.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.850
Wow.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.840
Yeah, every single one.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.720
And then they're finished and sewn together,
so they're digitally knitted first and then

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.760
finished.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.040
So the forces are actually carried through
the webbing.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.290
So this—you can see, Klaus—we cut away
the supports, the temporary supports, so this

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.290
is now free-standing.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.280
How tall is it?

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.440
Almost 43 feet.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.060
Wow.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.580
Yeah.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.340
So ambitious.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.240
I love the ambition.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.580
It's insane.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.180
[laughter]

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.400
Move it with the webbing, not the knit.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.460
Nice!

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.600
Yeah, this thing's heavier than it looks!

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.680
Five hundred pounds.
