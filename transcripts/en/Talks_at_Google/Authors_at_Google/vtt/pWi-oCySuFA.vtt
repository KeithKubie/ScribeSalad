[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:07.890
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: I have
heard that people at Google

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.910
are extremely smart, talented,
and very good with numbers.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.920
I'm a neuroscientist.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.500
I love to see for myself
if that's really true.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.257
So I'd like to ask 10
people to come over here.

00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:20.840
We're going to do a
little competition

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.340
and put this to a test.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.192
Please?

00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:24.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.410
Otherwise, I'm just going
to take the first row.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.670
So if nobody dares, you guys
here are already doomed--

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.267
so five people over here,
five people over there.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.015
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:39.720
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: One,
two, three, four, OK--

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.760
five people--
that's five people.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.720
Good.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.620
Two people here.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.830
We need three more.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.730
OK.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.760
Here's what we're going to do.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.580
We're going to work in
two competing teams.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.190
I'm going to start with
the first team over here.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.800
And you guys are not supposed
to talk to each other.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.880
You just watch them and wait
that they make a mistake.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.550
OK?

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm not as good with numbers.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.250
So I need your guys' help.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.920
If anybody makes a
mistake, let me know.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.020
Could you please form a circle?

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.800
Natalia will be in the middle.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.690
So all you have to do
is to count to 100.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.190
OK?

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.370
Can we just give it a try?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.087
AUDIENCE: One.

00:01:20.087 --> 00:01:20.964
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:21.630
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.830
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.660
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.494
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:01:23.494 --> 00:01:24.160
AUDIENCE: Seven.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.490
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: OK.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.790
OK.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.450
You can count.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.950
That's good.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.180
Since you're so super
smart supposedly,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.260
I would like to introduce
three simple rules.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.900
OK?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.500
The first one is called
the evil number seven.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.170
So don't say any number that
has a seven in it, like 67 or 87

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.460
or something like this.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:53.440
Don't say any number that is a
multiple of seven, such as 77

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.420
or 49.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.160
Don't say any number where the
two digits add up to seven,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.380
such as in 52.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.330
You guys are supposedly
smart, right?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.669
[LAUGHTER] So when such a number
comes up and it's your turn--

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.380
and let's take you
more in the middle so

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.970
that you're not confused
as a participant.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.330
NATALIA: Yeah.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.230
I can [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.396
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Right.

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:19.120
So when such a
number comes up, what

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.140
you should be doing is
instead of saying the number,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.940
you swirl around your own axis.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.190
Can you do it, like this?

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.950
And when you're back here facing
the others, you clap your hand.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.050
Can you do-- once.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.760
And then the third rule is your
team must reverse directions.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.630
OK?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.240
We just try it quickly.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.134
So you go first--

00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:41.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.633

FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS:
And then you--

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.300
and then you go
reverse directions.

I think you can all

go back to your seats again.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.930
[LAUGHS] So what did we
just experience here?

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.149
Why was it so hard
to count to 100?

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.000
And why would that
matter to you, right?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.550
Who cares if they
can count to 100?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.600
I will tell you why.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.720
I will give you a closer
look at how the brain works

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.110
to understand what
just happened and also

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.690
to help you understand how
you can use that knowledge

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.030
to improve your performance.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.490
At any time, feel
free to interrupt me

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.640
and to ask questions.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.010
I love questions.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.280
And I love to be challenged.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.870
So if something is unclear or
you have a little question,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.010
just raise your hands.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.676
And you will get a microphone.

00:04:48.676 --> 00:04:49.800
And you can ask right away.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.390
So don't wait to the very end.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.740
I'm flexible.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.460
So use the possibility
to ask right away.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.350
So if this is a head
and you can see it

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.020
from the side with the eyes
here, and this is your brain.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.990
There is a part of the brain
called the prefrontal cortex,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.000
PFC. That's the part
of the brain that

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.687
makes you successful.

00:05:16.687 --> 00:05:18.270
That's the part of
your brain that you

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.120
use for complex decision-making,
rational thinking,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.280
planning ahead for the future.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.190
That's what you need in order
to be a high-performing person.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.150
Researchers found that
already at age five,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.910
you can see if children have
well-developed prefrontal

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.690
cortices.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.000
And what they did is
they made an experiment

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.210
where they had people
or children sit down

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.130
in a chair in a
laboratory setting.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.970
And they said, you can
get one marshmallow now.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.660
And they put it
in front of them.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.750
Or you can wait for
15 minutes and then

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.450
you can get a second
marshmallow if you manage

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.990
to wait for those 15 minutes.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.790
Well, then the
researchers left the room

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.760
and left the kid alone with
a marshmallow for 15 minutes.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.970
You would see some kids.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.470
They would run for
the marshmallow

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.980
and just eat it, get
it over with, right?

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.460
And some others, they would turn
around, ignore the marshmallow,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.100
or put it under the table so
they didn't have to see it,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.590
or play with it and
throw it in the air.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.640
Crazy things happened.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.670
But what researchers
found that the kids that

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.760
were able to wait
for just 15 minutes

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.220
to get a second
marshmallow were the ones

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.010
that were way more
successful later in life.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.320
They had earned more money.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.640
They had better jobs.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.230
They had better health.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.910
They were happier overall.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.000
So success in life is
correlated with how well

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.100
your prefrontal
cortex is functioning.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.020
Because it's your
prefrontal cortex

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.770
that helps you to make
executive decisions.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.610
And it helps you to
have executive control.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.090
When we did this little
experiment over here

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.490
and I introduced the
rules with the evil number

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.620
seven and the swirling around
and not saying the number

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.140
and then reversing
directions, this

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.850
was a task aimed to
test or to freak out

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.410
your prefrontal cortex.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.660
You had to use your
prefrontal cortex

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.020
to manage these different rules
and to do this calculations

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.800
in your head.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.840
The problem is, as we know,
the prefrontal cortex fails

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.970
very quickly, right?

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.632
And we could all see it here.

00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:27.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.030
So we like to think of
ourselves as rational beings.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.740
We think that we are so smart.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.930
And we're always in
control of things.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.320
And we're so rational.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.540
But that's not how
our brains work.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.550
But in order to be
successful in life

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.550
and in order to be
innovative and in order

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.280
to create new ideas and
to be high-performing,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.680
you will need your
prefrontal cortex.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.650
So I will show you
today how you can

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.450
improve your prefrontal cortex.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.720
But before that, I will show you
which other brain areas always

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.000
run over the prefrontal
cortex, because it's

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.600
a part of our brain that was
only fully developed, you know,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.360
at age 18 or 21.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.820
Maybe some of you
guys here don't even

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.890
have a fully developed
prefrontal cortex

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.200
yet, if I look at the audience.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.380
It's a part of our
brain that is the newest

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.960
from an evolutionary
perspective.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.680
And it's also the one that
takes longest to grow.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.900
So I have five kids at
home under the age of six.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.820
And they do crazy stuff.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.450
And I stay relaxed,
because I know

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.110
it's just that their prefrontal
cortex is not working fully

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.919
yet.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:42.169
So which other brain parts run
over the prefrontal cortex?

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.630
There are many other
areas that influence it.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.150
But I'd like to
highlight one today

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.980
that we could see in
our little exercise

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.320
and that really
determines much of what's

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.550
going on in our lives.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.090
It's a part of our brain
called the basal ganglia.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.710
What are the basal ganglia?

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.190
That's where your
habits are stored.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.110
That's where your
mindsets are stored.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.130
That's where your
belief system is in.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.520
So if you think that
Brexit is a good idea

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.950
or that voting for a certain
political party is a good idea,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.180
that's probably stored in your
basal ganglia in your brain.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.370
When you have lots
of experience,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.470
it goes into your basal ganglia.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.630
If you think about that
little game we did,

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.620
it aimed also at
your basal ganglia.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.540
Because what did you
do that you learned

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.270
at age two or three or one?

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.147
AUDIENCE: Counting.

00:09:34.147 --> 00:09:36.730
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Counting--
all of you know how to count.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.670
The better you
know how to count,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.970
the more it is represented
in your basal ganglia.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.280
And once that something
is in your basal ganglia,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.770
you don't get rid of it anymore.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.550
Once you know how to ride a bike
or once you know how to count,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.600
you can't unlearn it.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.530
Once it's there,
you're stuck with it.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.030
OK?

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.000
And it will overrule
everything else in your brain.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.880
So you need to be aware
also of habits you create,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.920
because they can
be very stubborn.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.140
To illustrate this,
if you think about it,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.470
the first time you learned
how to drive a car, maybe

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.430
at your first driver's lessons,
that was really something that

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.020
required a lot of attention.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.910
You had to focus on the wheel.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.280
You had to focus on
pushing the brakes.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.440
You had to focus
on shifting gears.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.520
There was a stop sign.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.610
Oh, there's-- my driver
teacher is talking to me.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.240
Oh, what a distraction, right?

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.970
You're totally
getting shivering.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.080
This is because you drove with
the part of your brain called

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.340
the prefrontal cortex.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.490
You had to use your prefrontal
cortex for driving, because you

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.530
had to think of all the rules.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.620
And that's something you
had to do consciously.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.940
So you did have to pay a lot
of attention to that process.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.710
Later on, a couple
of years later, you

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.780
drive with your basal ganglia.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.310
You can probably, you know, get
up in the morning half asleep

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.290
and get yourself to
work in your car.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.120
I'm not suggesting
that's a good idea.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.294
I'm just saying you
probably do a lot of things

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:00.960
while you drive.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.580
People talk on the phone.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.890
People talk to the person
sitting next to them.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.390
People eat on their car.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.920
People put on makeup in the car.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.690
People text while driving.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.480
And you know, that leads
to a lot of mistakes.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.540
But you can get from
A to B without even

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.990
noticing what you did, because
it's in your basal ganglia.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.960
The brain is a
lazy couch potato.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.360
It likes to make
things easy for it.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.640
Whatever you do with
the prefrontal cortex

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.860
takes up a lot of energy.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.420
There's something
that psychologists

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.750
call ego depletion
or decision fatigue.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.800
After a long day of heavy
thinking and paying attention

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.470
to things, you're just
done with it, right?

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.130
You don't want to think anymore.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.620
You just want to watch Netflix
or something like this.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.630
You have used up
all your willpower

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.580
at the end of a long day.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.160
So the prefrontal cortex is
not an unlimited resource.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.850
It's a resource that
gets depleted easily,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.860
that gets distracted
easily, and that

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.060
gets run over by other parts
of the brain very easily.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.720
OK?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.910
So today, I just
wanted you to not just

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.560
talk about the
prefrontal cortex,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.130
but to make you experience how
easily it gets knocked out.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.780
So if you want to be
successful in life

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.900
and if you want to be
successful at your jobs

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.970
and high-performing,
you need to find

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:23.180
ways to make the prefrontal
cortex function properly.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.830
And there's three
things we need in order

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.070
to make our prefrontal
cortex happy.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.720
And these are the things I
would like to show you today.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.020
Are you ready for that?

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.040
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.810
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: OK.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.370
So here it goes.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.760
If this is performance--

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.690
and I don't mean how
much money you make

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.640
or if other people think you're
smart or things like that--

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.730
I'm thinking about
how high-performing

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.790
is your individual prefrontal
cortex at this given moment,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.290
OK?

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:06.750
So this is measuring performance
of your prefrontal cortex

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.520
over here.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.100
And here, we have stress level.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.730
Basically, here you would
say you're in a coma sleep.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.160
And over here, you would
be close to panic attack.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.980
And in between, there's
many different circumstances

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.290
and situations you could be in.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.265
Usually, let's say somebody
here calls you up and says,

00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:32.340
you know, we have this
new initiative at Google.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.130
[BLOWS RASPBERRY]
We don't know yet

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.900
if we're going to
go through with it.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.520
It's just a new idea.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.950
Maybe next year we're going
to have a meeting about this.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.970
But we don't know yet
who's going to sponsor it.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.210
So could you please put together
some PowerPoint presentation

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.480
for this and some ideas?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.250
Doesn't sound very
good, does it?

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.010
So you're going to
sit at your desk.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.080
And you're probably going
to clean up your desk

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.050
and procrastinate
and do other things.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.180
But your highest performance
will not be on this job.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.790
This is true for all
kinds of routine jobs,

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.380
such as doing your expenses
or checking your emails.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.650
You can do a lot of things just
with your basal ganglia, right?

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.400
You will just go through the
motions, no effort required.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.470
And the performance of
your prefrontal cortex

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.600
will be very low.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.650
So now let's imagine
that you're supposed

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.200
to give a presentation
in front of your CEO.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.390
I know you have your
Christmas party tonight.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.480
And you now receive an email
this very moment, telling you,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.050
why don't you give a spontaneous
speech tonight presenting,

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.680
you know, your latest
results at work?

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.180
We'd love to hear
more about this.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.900
It should be five to 10 minutes.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.930
And you know, just
prepare something really

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.180
fun and energizing for people.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.500
Engage them.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.900
And afterwards, we're
going to rate you.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.671
And this will influence
the bonus you get.

00:14:54.671 --> 00:14:55.170
OK?

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.580
Something like
this, their chances

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.680
are that your
performance is going

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.420
to be down here,
because you might

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.030
be so sweating and terrified.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.390
Everybody is watching
you, all eyes on you, OK?

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.510
And then maybe right
before you are on it,

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.790
you realize that all of
your numbers are wrong

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.880
or that, you know,
something is not working out

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.620
with your presentation.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.400
When we are under
extreme stress,

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.090
when we're experiencing
stress, our prefrontal cortex

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.620
shuts down.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.910
This is what happens.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.850
Your brain will go into
fight, flight, or freeze.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.240
And this will lead to the fact
that our brain just shuts down.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.510
Not all parts of the brain,
but the prefrontal cortex

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.170
will shut down.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.100
Because from an
evolutionary perspective,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.820
if you have to fight
a bear in the forest,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.120
you don't want to think of 10
different creative solutions

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.160
of how to fight a bear.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.830
You can either fight or
flight or freeze and hide

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.670
under a bush or
something like that.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.860
So under stress, the
prefrontal cortex shuts down.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.500
When we're very bored,
our prefrontal cortex

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.210
does not feel motivated to work.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.300
And then in both cases,
it's your basal ganglia

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.290
doing the job.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.740
When we are bored, we just
go and click into our habits.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.240
We do the things we always do.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.860
We go through the motions.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.830
Other people might even
think you're performing well,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.420
because if you have
good habits, then

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.780
you can go through a lot in life
just with your basal ganglia,

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.470
right?

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.540
It all depends on what
kind of training you had

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.230
and what's in there.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.180
If you are very
stressed, your brain

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.910
will also rely on
your basal ganglia,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.850
because your prefrontal cortex
doesn't work properly anymore.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.310
Then you also have
to rely on instincts.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:49.160
That's why in professions like
fire fighting and the police

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.770
and medical doctors who
work in emergencies,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.780
they train people a lot.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.700
Psychologists call this
over-training, over-learning,

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.450
because they want to
make sure that people

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.960
have the right kind of action
stored in their basal ganglia.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.599
So in the military,
for example, you're

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:09.770
trained how to pull the
trigger 100 million times so

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.530
that when the emergency
situation comes up

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.730
and your prefrontal
cortex shuts down,

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.220
you know exactly what to do.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.530
And you make that decision
within milliseconds.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.900
Because the prefrontal
cortex is slow,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.060
but your basal
ganglia are quick.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.670
And they work without
you not even noticing.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.890
They just go on autopilot.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:28.580
OK.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.610
But this is where you want to
be with your prefrontal cortex,

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.110
right?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.610
If you want to be
innovative, if you

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.450
want to come up with
new ideas, if you

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.910
want to create something new
and exciting in your company,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.715
you have to engage
your prefrontal cortex.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.020
As you can see, there's
an inverse U correlation

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.840
between stress level
and performance.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.140
If there's too
little stress, you

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.030
will just do business as usual.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.500
People might even
go into boreout.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.870
People love what you do.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.760
You might get compliments
for your work.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.310
But it's a bit boring
and irrelevant.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.390
And you just do it.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.830
But nobody cares
about your work.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.730
And over here, you
might have a situation

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.550
with too many deadlines, too
many people wanting stuff

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.540
from you, bad bosses
who follow after you

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.790
and give you bad
feedback all of the time.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.250
Things like this can really wear
down your prefrontal cortex.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.190
So how can you get up here?

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:36.440
When we reach peak performance,
we lose concept of time.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.010
If you ever had a moment at
your work or in your free time

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.320
when you really were
performing at your best--

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.510
it could be in sports.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.670
It could be in music.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.530
It could be in arts.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.980
It could even be at your job--

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.940
you lose the concept of time.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.190
You're fully present here now.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.960
And you love what you do.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.960
Usually, this is
associated with joyful.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.490
It's a joyful experience.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.930
Research shows also that when
we are in this state of mind,

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.040
we are five times as productive,
five times as productive.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.730
That's a lot.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.650
You could save a
lot of time if you

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.650
know how to get there
whenever you want it,

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.530
whenever you need it, rather
than spending most of your time

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.060
here or here.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.210
For your most strategic
task, for your most important

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.240
decisions, for the
things that truly matter,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.710
you should know how to get here.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.460
And there are three
things you need.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:37.455
And I call them fun,
fear, and focus.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.560
Why should you have fun at work?

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.330
Aren't you paid to work?

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:51.370
You know, shouldn't that be what
you receive for your hard work?

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.870
Isn't that enough?

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.830
Research shows that when
people have fun at work,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.260
a neurotransmitter
called dopamine

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.929
is released in your brain.

00:20:00.929 --> 00:20:02.470
I will write it here
for those of you

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.760
who want to remember that.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.120
So you have the dopamine.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.980
OK?

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.720
And the dopamine is
a real brain booster.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.790
Dopamine is a
neurotransmitter that

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.260
links into the reward
system of your brain.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.220
It will make you think faster.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.480
It will make you learn faster.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.390
And it will make this a
very joyful experience.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.530
If you think about it,
it's not by coincidence

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.940
that most famous people
who excel in some area

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.370
really love what they do.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.620
Because when you're
really good at something,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.060
then dopamine is released.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.424
And it makes it even better.

00:20:38.424 --> 00:20:40.090
So if you want to
have more fun at work,

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.150
this is not just
about having free food

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.890
and all of the
gadgets you enjoy here

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.440
at Google or the after
work party kind of fun

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.060
you're going to have tonight.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.600
It's more about, do you
truly love what you do?

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.310
Are you're really good
at what you're doing--

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.670
you know, fun
related to the task

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.940
that you perform every day.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.400
So my advice to you
would be to find

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.250
a job where you can be
really the best in class,

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.010
not something where you're
kind of doing OK-ish.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.070
Seek something where
your talents can shine.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.020
And then you will get
bursts of dopamine

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.020
that will help your brain
to perform much better.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.450
Other ways to get more
dopamine are to, for example,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.780
work with surprise and novelty.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.070
Every time we get surprised,
our brain releases dopamine.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.470
Every time something
new happens, our brain

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.850
reacts by eliciting dopamine.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.190
So that little exercise we
did here a few minutes ago,

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.650
I also did this in order
to get you out of a rut.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.080
You come to listen to a talk.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.800
But I wanted you to
also do something

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.170
you didn't expect to be
doing, because this will give

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.120
everybody a burst of dopamine.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.600
And it will make you retain
better what I tell you today.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.990
Jokes are a good way
to get dopamine burst.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:59.100
When people laugh, the
brain releases dopamine.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.970
So if you want people to
learn well and to perform well

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.240
at work, it might pay off to
have somebody really funny

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.900
at the team, maybe somebody not
really high-performing person,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.520
not so--

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.080
[LAUGHTER] I'm serious.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.930
Funny people boost
everybody's performance.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.050
So you know, if you have
this fellow who is not

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.330
adding much value
but making jokes,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.900
keep that guy on the team.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.320
[LAUGHTER] OK?

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.730
From a brain perspective,
laughs really boost performance.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.630
So that's the fun.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.370
The second thing is the fear.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.450
I don't know if you
have experienced that.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.490
But I have a friend.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.130
And she went to a
Bob Dylan concert.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.680
And what happened is
that she hated it.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.640
Why did she hate it?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.520
Because he was playing new
songs she never heard before.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.560
She wanted to hear
the songs that she

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.660
knew and loved to sing along.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.710
And instead, he was going
totally experimental on stage.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.220
And she said, I didn't know
the stuff he was singing.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.510
It was OK.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.140
Why did Bob Dylan do this?

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.050
He was upsetting his audience.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.570
Nobody loved the concert.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.490
People hated it.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.790
Well, otherwise I guess he
would have been bored to death.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.500
If you're Bob Dylan,
you've been doing

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.520
the same thing for 40 years.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.910
You don't want to
play the same songs.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.140
It goes out of your ears.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.699
Your ears will explode if you
hear that song one more time.

00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:24.240
I don't know.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.990
I'm not Bob Dylan.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.490
But I guess that's what
was going on in his mind.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.290
You need to try new things.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.270
You need to push the boundaries.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.900
Most people, when you ask
them how can you reach best

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.290
performance, they say this
happens when the challenge

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.450
meets your skill set.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.840
No, that's not true.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.610
This happens when the challenge
exceeds your skill set.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.960
You need to be slightly
over-challenged.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.080
Find a job you really love
and then push yourself

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.190
to the boundaries.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.210
Get over the top.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.240
Do things that are a bit
too difficult for you.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.460
Do things that are a bit scary.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.140
If you're never
scared at your job,

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.850
something's wrong with you.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.575
You need to be
sometimes a bit nervous.

00:24:06.575 --> 00:24:08.750
You need to try new things.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.190
You need to experiment.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.800
If you're always staying
in your comfort zone,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.890
your brain will react by
going into your basal ganglia.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.100
Because when we have a
slight level of fear,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.000
our brain releases a substance
called noradrenaline.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.970
And noradrenaline is a
positive stress hormone.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:29.990
OK?

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.960
Noradrenaline-- might not
be the prettiest flip chart

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.160
you guys have seen.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.250
So here it is for those of
you who want to write it down.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.020
So you need the dopamine.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.696
But you also need
the noradrenaline.

00:24:43.696 --> 00:24:45.320
When there's no
challenge, when there's

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.770
no deadline, when nobody
cares about what you're doing,

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.390
you will under-perform.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.580
You will go into
basal ganglia mode.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.900
So push yourself.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.060
If you find yourself too
comfortable in your role,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.960
you might want to quit your
job or go on a job rotation

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.940
or try something new.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.470
If you're getting
too comfortable,

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.390
you will go into boreout.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.150
And your brain will
think, why should I

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.220
engage my prefrontal cortex?

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.920
It costs me a lot of
energy and attention

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.870
to engage my prefrontal cortex.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.590
The brain will only do it
when it's really necessary.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.800
And if there is no challenge,
if there's no fear,

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.570
your brain will not go
through all of this effort.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.220
So you need to be slightly
over-challenged to achieve

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.730
that.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.590
Yes, a question?

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.500
AUDIENCE: Regarding the fear
and the stress, well, I'm not

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.510
an expert in this issue at all.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:44.470
But that hormone is a good
one when we are a bit nervous

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.680
or with fear.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.830
But is it associated
also with cortisol,

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.530
like it happens
at the same time?

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.840
And is it-- because I've
heard that cortisol is not

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.740
that good for your performance.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.757
So then I would like to know--

00:25:57.257 --> 00:25:57.730
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS:
Mhm, the difference.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.380
AUDIENCE: --your
opinion about it.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.505
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Yeah.

00:26:00.505 --> 00:26:02.510
Cortisol is also helpful.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.700
But it's not a good thing.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.190
Cortisol is a negative
stress hormone.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.380
So what happens with
cortisol is that if you

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.010
have that over a longer
period of time in your body,

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.170
you will go into burnout.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.430
A part of your brain
called the amygdala,

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.420
which is processing negative
information, will grow.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.820
Your prefrontal
cortex will shrink.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.820
Your hippocampus for
learning will shrink as well.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.270
So cortisol has a very
damaging impact on our brain.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.180
But when is cortisol released?

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.520
Cortisol is released when
there's chronic stress

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.390
over a longer period of time.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.160
So let's say you have an awful
boss who treats you badly.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.010
If you live in a
dysfunctional relationship,

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.050
if you go to your
job every morning

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.389
and you feel that
you hate it, that

00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:50.805
will give you a
level of cortisol.

00:26:50.805 --> 00:26:52.750
And when you feel so
overstressed that you

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.000
can't sleep anymore,
it's the cortisol

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.100
hindering you to go to sleep.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.520
Noradrenaline gives
you positive push, OK?

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.810
So it gives you a kick.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.380
Cortisol will slow
things down for you.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.770
So this is the matter of whether
it's a short-term stress--

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.810
here, I am speaking
about short-term stress,

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.190
which is good--

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.170
or whether it's a
long-term stress.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:18.560
And then the number one
protection factor for cortisol

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.620
is actually autonomy.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.370
If you think about it, big
bosses in large organizations,

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.140
they work many hours.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.970
But they're not as
stressed as the people

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:30.520
at the bottom, who
maybe work 9:00 to 5:00.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.760
Because when we can
influence the situation,

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.670
that's when our brain makes
sense of the situation.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.150
It does matter whether
you work up to 3:00 AM

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.340
because your boss
told you to do that

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.310
or whether you work up to 3:00
AM because it's your company,

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.740
and you chose to do that,
if you feel that there's

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.490
a purpose associated with it.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.370
So if you want to
avoid cortisol,

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.910
try to take as much control
of the situation as you can.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.820
Rather than being a victim,
go into a more active role

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.270
to fight the situation.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.600
OK?

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.330
So that's the noradrenaline
and the fear part.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.270
What about focus?

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:14.200
Imagine some athlete in
the middle of a match,

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.700
like Johnny Sexton.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.570
Or imagine Serena Williams
playing a tennis match.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.430
And then in the
middle of the match,

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.040
she's pulling out
her cell phone.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.820
She says, I just need
to take that call.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.660
Hold on a moment.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.730
Or I need to check my emails.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.260
People would hate that.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.730
Their friends would be appalled.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.320
People would be shocked.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.790
But in the business
world, that's

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.910
how people behave all
the time, constantly.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.890
People are multitasking.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.920
People are constantly
checking their emails.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.610
People are hardly
ever focused, right?

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.240
And research shows
that when we multitask,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.330
we make 50% more mistakes.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:56.050
And we take 50% longer
to complete the task.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.360
Research also shows
that today's teenagers

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.640
have the attention span
shorter than the one

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.800
of an average goldfish.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.420
Attention span is going down.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.800
Our brains are plastic.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.670
We're adapting to
new situations.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.550
And if you're
constantly multitasking,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.080
you're not getting better at it.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.940
Your attention span is
actually going down.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.090
Because your brain says, I
never need focused, prolonged

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:17.080
attention, right?

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.770
I never need it.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.020
So why should I
develop that skill?

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.760
But it's impossible to
reach peak performance

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.610
if you're not fully focused.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:28.090
Because when you're
fully focused and present

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.970
in the moment, your brain
will release a substance

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.560
called acetylcholine.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.470
Let me write it
down here for you.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.920
As we saw in that little
exercise we did in the group

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:50.050
this morning, you really had to
focus on keeping the seven out

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.230
of the game, right?

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.860
You really had to focus on
these complex calculations.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.070
Your prefrontal cortex will only
work when you're fully focused.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.780
It requires attention.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.740
It's impossible to get into
flow if you're not focused.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.540
So what should you do about it?

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.990
I mean, there's many ways to go.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.710
One of them is, for example,
to eliminate distractions

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:09.820
from the onset.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.270
Because our prefrontal
cortex is a limited resource.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.900
If you are going to spend all
of your energy suppressing

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.750
the urge to check your phone--
let's say it's on your desk

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.280
while you work on something.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.680
And then you just read
a book that told you

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.957
that multitasking is bad.

00:30:24.957 --> 00:30:26.540
And then you decided
to check it less.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.581
You're always going to
look at and think, no, OK.

00:30:28.581 --> 00:30:29.500
I check it later.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.111
Get rid of it.

00:30:30.111 --> 00:30:30.610
OK?

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.180
Put it somewhere else.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.850
I know that many
executives are now

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.020
doing what is called
a meeting of one.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.850
When we get in a meeting
with other people,

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.290
we always schedule time.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.310
We turn off the phone.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:46.690
We don't check-- you know, we
really focus on that meeting.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:54.550
But you should be just
as critical, rigorous,

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.170
when you have a
meeting with yourself.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.630
If you really have to put
an important presentation

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.080
together, if you really have
to solve an important question,

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.060
take some time.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.450
Block your door.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.250
Don't let people walk in on you.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.650
You know, I don't know if you
have an open office policy

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.240
or something like this.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.040
Put something in front of your
door so that nobody can get in.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.410
It's nice to be social.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.870
But research shows that
when people have too much

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.930
open office spaces,
collaboration and communication

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.550
actually decreases.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.820
You think it would go up.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.170
But it actually goes down,
because people are hiding.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.870
Because it's impossible to
focus if you constantly have

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.220
your colleagues in your ear.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.650
So find a way to truly
focus on your work.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:37.300
But I would like to let
you in on a little secret.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.100
Most books will tell you
that eliminating distraction

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.840
is the right way
to improve focus,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.870
or that you should go to a
mindfulness training course

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:51.240
and learn meditation and do
yoga, something to train up

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.680
your inherent ability to focus.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.760
That's good.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.650
But it's not really
working, because people

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.930
know that multitasking is bad.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.700
And they keep doing it anyhow.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.620
Why do they keep
doing it anyhow?

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.230
Because we're addicted
to our phones.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.030
If you think about
it, every time

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.802
you get a new email or something
happens through social media,

00:32:10.802 --> 00:32:12.760
your brain thinks, oh,
there could be something

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.110
new and relevant going on.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.290
I need to check that out.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.170
And then you get a
burst of dopamine.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.820
And you get a burst
of noradrenaline

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.560
because there could be
something relevant for you.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.770
And when we are bored at
work and tired and a bit,

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.340
you know, not fully motivated,
you might just as well

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.850
pick up your phone to see
if something new is going on

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.820
in order to get a quick
burst of dopamine.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.260
Or when you're very
stressed and you

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.020
want to escape from
that situation,

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.200
your phone could be
an escape strategy.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.490
Rather than focusing on
what's going on around you,

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.300
you focus on your phone.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.850
And what happens is that every
time a new email comes up

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:54.910
or something new happens, you
get these bursts of dopamine.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.460
And they link in to the
reward circuit in your brain.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.050
And you get addicted to it.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.240
And you need more
and more and more.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.750
As you can see in teenagers,
drug use has gone down,

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.680
but phone use has gone up.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.690
So it's the new drug.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:13.030
Basically, in the brain,
multitasking and the use

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.129
of mobile devices is
treated like an addiction.

00:33:16.129 --> 00:33:17.920
If you look at people's
brain while they're

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.370
looking at their phone, it's
like a brain love or a brain

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:22.780
on drugs.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:29.080
So I want to invite you to
create a work environment that

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.590
is more fun and where you
have the right level of fear.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.680
And then focus will
come naturally.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.280
Pay attention to that.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.790
You will see that these things
are correlated to each other.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.720
When you have fun at work and
when there's truly something

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.810
at stake, when it's
challenging, your focus

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.580
will be there immediately.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.110
Yesterday, I had a
session with executives.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.320
And they were working on glass.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.150
We first wanted
to do a fire walk.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.970
But then the university
building wouldn't allow that.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.250
So then we did a
glass walk on real--

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.210
you know, it was 70 bottles
of glass, shattered,

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.760
70 bottles of wine,
shattered on the floor.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.370
And people were walking
over it barefoot.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.830
Nobody was multitasking
while doing that.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.960
Everybody was focused.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.650
Trust me.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:16.570
I've seen people.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.790
Everybody was really paying
attention while walking,

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.110
because you don't
want to hurt yourself.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.969
So you have a certain
level of fear.

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:27.199
And it was kind of fun, because
it was new and unexpected,

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.750
not something you
do every day, right?

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.710
Oh, let's walk on glass today.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.350
So people had fun.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:34.250
People had fear.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.616
And everybody was focused.

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:38.449
We didn't even have to
tell people to focus.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:39.770
Focus just happened.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.710
So if you find yourself
having trouble with focus,

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.830
improve the level of fun,
improve the level of fear.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.170
And it will come naturally.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.281
Thank you.

00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:51.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.450
SPEAKER: If you
have any questions?

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.970
AUDIENCE: So you were kind of
talking a lot about delaying

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.790
or postponing gratification.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.550
What are some of the
more specific things

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:12.590
that people could do to
try and be better at that?

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.930
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS:
To delay gratification?

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
because that seems what

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.250
you're kind of thesis is there?

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.375
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Yeah.

00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:21.610
Well, find something you
truly love and practice it.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.030
Research shows that
people like musicians

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.430
who have to practice
a lot to get better,

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.890
they have a better
executive control.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.930
Because let's say
if you spend all

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.820
of your day playing
video games, you

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.950
get an instant reward
all of the time.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.480
You know, you just
push some button.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.160
And then it's like, woo,
you know, something happens.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.280
AUDIENCE: I kind of disagree
with that, honestly.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.410
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Yes.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.860
AUDIENCE: Because like
in many computer games,

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.061
you don't just mindlessly
mash on buttons.

00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:48.060
You actually have to think
about your skill set,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:48.960
develop yourself.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.710
You have to train.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.001
You have to look at other
peoples, how they strategize,

00:35:52.001 --> 00:35:52.668
a lot of things.

00:35:52.668 --> 00:35:54.334
And actually, a lot
of research recently

00:35:54.334 --> 00:35:56.100
has been showing that
computer games have

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.540
been increasing one's ability to
focus on and train one's self,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.580
and getting in many
sense, a flow, which

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.230
is what you were talking about.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.855
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS:
Yes, in the game,

00:36:04.855 --> 00:36:07.052
but not necessarily
outside the game.

00:36:07.052 --> 00:36:08.760
AUDIENCE: But you can
apply it elsewhere.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.885
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Yeah.

00:36:09.885 --> 00:36:13.560
But I think you get more
instant reward in the video game

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.355
than if you do
practicing the cello.

00:36:15.355 --> 00:36:16.480
AUDIENCE: Definitely, yeah.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:16.890
That, I agree.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:17.390
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Right.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.530
I agree with you that
in the moment when

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.360
you play the video
game, you are in flow.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.140
You have the fun.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.890
You have the fear.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.460
You have the focus for sure.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.610
But if you do
things that give you

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.660
no gratification
in the beginning,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.200
such as learning to
play an instrument

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.850
or reading long books
with more than 100 pages,

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:39.030
right, then what happens
is that your brain

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.100
will get used to not get
everything right away.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.070
But a lot of it has
to do with parenting.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.980
If your parents brought
you up to work for things,

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.380
then you probably will continue
to do that later in life

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:49.810
as well.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.185
So when you have
kids, you should

00:36:51.185 --> 00:36:53.880
be thinking about not
spoiling them too much,

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.510
or they will not have that
ability to delay gratification.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.820
And then you have
what we see today,

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.690
that many millennials are
having suicidal thoughts

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.600
and are very unhappy because
they always got everything

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.440
from their parents.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.870
They never had to
work to get anything.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.140
AUDIENCE: So you were
talking about the correlation

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.650
between performance and stress.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.820
So if you were to look at
it in a perspective of time

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.400
as well, because for me, that
dopamine and the noradrenaline

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.100
and all of the fun,
fear, and focus

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.950
seems to be a little
bit more short-term.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.120
Is that true?

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.794
Or how long can you
keep going like that?

00:37:29.794 --> 00:37:31.710
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS:
It's a short-term thing.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.900
You cannot be all day in flow.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.850
And you shouldn't
be all day in flow.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:38.250
Because if you think about
it, when your brain releases

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.040
dopamine and noradrenaline
and acetylcholine,

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.080
it gives your brain
a quick burst.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.270
But then it vanishes quickly.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.250
If you think about
negative stress

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.020
hormones, such as cortisol,
they hit your body.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.780
And they can stay forever.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.340
Let's say I give you 10
things to think about.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.990
I say, you did great
and this and this

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.940
and this and this
and this and this,

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.720
and great job at this, and
great, and great, hooray.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.060
And then I say you have one
little area for improvement,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.664
one little thing to work on.

00:38:07.664 --> 00:38:09.330
That's the one you're
going to remember.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.140
We are wired to focus
on negative things.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.800
OK?

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.130
So what this means is that
this is a short-term thing.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.520
You should use that if
you want to get something

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.440
really important done.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.780
And then it's OK to
spend the rest of the day

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.080
sometimes under-challenged,
sometimes over-challenged.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.120
This is something you
should use for your most

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.540
important moments.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.120
If you think about
athletes, they

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.520
spend a week training
and recovering.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.690
And then they just
have a one-hour match.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.480
You need that for
that one-hour match.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.820
And afterwards, your
brain will be depleted.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.690
What you see is that when
your brain releases dopamine,

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.610
when all of that
dopamine is used up,

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.980
you feel kind of
like, whew, exhausted.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.200
So it's a short-term thing.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.490
AUDIENCE: So most
of us don't really

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:56.920
to have their offices here.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.440
It's really an open plan.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.860
And basically, if you want
to disconnect, what about,

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.510
for instance, listening to
the music, and specific music

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.319
more like classical?

00:39:10.319 --> 00:39:12.360
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: I
didn't get your question.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.859
Could you--

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:15.450
AUDIENCE: So the question is,
if you want to disconnect,

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.600
does listening to
the music help that?

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.474
Or it distracts you?

00:39:19.474 --> 00:39:21.390
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS:
So if you want to focus,

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.160
whether it's good
to listen to music?

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.560
Well, for some
people, it's good.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.510
And for others, it's not.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:30.090
Research shows that this
is highly-individual.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:33.120
It seems that a little
bit of background noise

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.500
is good if you want
to be creative.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.860
Here, we've been speaking
about the flow state.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.760
And then music can be good
if it's not disrupting you,

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.850
if it helps you to
get-- if it's more

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.710
quiet than the
people around you.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:54.460
But if you, for example,
want to be a bit creative

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.430
and if you're designing
things and if you're

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.940
working in a more
artistic way of working,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.925
it could be OK to have an
office that is like Starbucks,

00:40:02.925 --> 00:40:05.220
you know, with lots of
people running around.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.890
Because then these distractions
will give your brain

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.980
some impact to make connections
that you haven't made before.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.040
So the answer is for
some people, it's good.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.080
And for some jobs, it's
good if you really have

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.764
to just concentrate and focus.

00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:20.430
And if you're working
more artistically,

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.630
it's actually OK to be
a bit more distracted.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for the talk.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.310
I have a question.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.310
When you provide these
talks or the courses

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:31.589
like the walking
on glass, they're

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:32.880
probably tailored to the group.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.130
But they probably
run from your own BSG

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.740
as well, because
you do it so often.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.365
What do you do to
create the fun, fear,

00:40:38.365 --> 00:40:39.330
and focus for yourself?

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:39.874
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:39.874 --> 00:40:42.040
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: That's
a really good question.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.680
Actually, the little
experiment here

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.980
we did with the
standing up, I've

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.380
only done this once before.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.260
I always create new
stuff for myself.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.280
Usually, you know,
I've just changed it.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.330
Now I made it about
the prefrontal cortex

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.640
and the basal ganglia.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.090
I always take in other
brain parts, you know?

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.220
I change my presentations.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.390
I adapt them.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.580
I try to also, for me--

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.490
well, the fun for
me is the purpose.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.690
Because I see that people
get the benefit from what

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.200
I'm doing.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.300
So if people tell me, oh,
this was really helpful

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.140
and write to me a year
later, then this for me

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.780
adds value to my life,
to what I'm doing.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.170
The fear is I'm a public
failure, you know?

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.510
I could be here on
stage, making a mess.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.770
And somebody asks
very smart questions.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:35.130
And I could be standing
here like a full idiot.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.930
This can happen, right?

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.850
And then your reputation
is kind of ruined.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.200
This will be filmed.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.270
So there's always
a level of fear.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:46.830
And focus, once I have the
fun and the fear, it comes.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.360
But I mix things up.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.320
And as it happens for me,
engagements get bigger.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.110
I get more speeches
with more people there,

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:56.980
more than thousands, you know?

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.680
I started out with small groups.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.490
And now I get these
sometimes big things, where

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.828
I have to design something new.

00:42:04.828 --> 00:42:06.782
Yeah.

00:42:06.782 --> 00:42:07.990
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.364
Thank you for all
your questions.

00:42:09.364 --> 00:42:11.410
Thank you, Friederike,
for this great talk.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.630
And I think there is no
doubt that we need to train,

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.220
not our bodies, but
our brain as well.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.400
And now we have an instruction.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.020
Thank you so much.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.353
FRIEDERIKE FABRITIUS: Thank you.

00:42:21.353 --> 00:42:23.070
