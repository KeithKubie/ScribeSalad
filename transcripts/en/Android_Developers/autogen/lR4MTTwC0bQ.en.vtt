00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.270
 Sometimes things are simpler 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.460
 A source of important ideas 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.840
 Which radically changes the world 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.080
 A few years ago, my husband was "Nishant" (co-founder) 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.300
 He lives and travels in China for a few months 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.740
 He had many difficulties when trying to order vegetarian food 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.290
 Therefore, learning Chinese was necessary for him 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.150
 The problem faced by "Nishant" 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.520
 Showed the magnitude of problems faced by language learners around the world 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.350
 So we thought about creating an application 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.300
 Easy to access and low cost 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.940
 And effective language teaching 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.900
 Almost 80% of the population of India belongs to productive age groups 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.230
 They can get jobs, but they do not succeed 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.650
 Because of their lack of proficiency in English 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.701
 Therefore English proficiency is necessary for them 

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.860
 To change their lives 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.170
 My name is "friend of mine" 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.660
 I am from Mumbai 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.340
 After my retirement, I decided to do something useful 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.130
 So I joined Hello English 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 Many children around us 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.340
 They want to learn English 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 Joining Hello English has given me enough confidence 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.990
 To go to my towns and educate the poor and the needy 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 this is my goal 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.444
 I am in Kochi for that 

00:01:38.444 --> 00:01:40.590
 Much improved in English 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.740
 Before that, I was afraid to speak English in front of others 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.600
 But I have overcome my fears now 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 welcome 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.730
 how are you? 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.750
 what's your name? 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.000
 Bogar 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.920
 Wonderful. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.312
 My name is Sidhar 

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:01.394
 My name is Sidhar 

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:02.560
 this is good 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.350
 Hi 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.945
 What do you mean hi? 

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:05.760
 Namaste 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.120
 English is useful for higher education 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.990
 And open up better areas of life 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.520
 good 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.300
 Wonderful 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.480
 Wonderful 

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:24.050
 At first, we never dreamed that we would achieve such success 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.215
 There are over 30 million users currently in use 

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:30.050
 We are larger than any university or school 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.040
 Have existed for many years in India 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.850
 Google Play gives us statistics and data 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.490
 About the behavior of users so that we can access 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.100
 To a larger base of users 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.780
 Our inspiration and enthusiasm 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.360
 Is to hear others talk about 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.700
 The effectiveness of learning English using the application 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.960
 Have benefited greatly from this 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.920
 This gives us greater strength to continue 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.250
 And strive to make a greater impact 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.210
 I believe that what man gives to the world in his own eyes 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.070
 He will be punished in the Hereafter 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.310
 So I will try to provide my best.
