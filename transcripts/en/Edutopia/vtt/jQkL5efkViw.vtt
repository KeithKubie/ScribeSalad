00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:11.306
&gt;&gt;Chris Kelly: If you're going to
work independently to catch up,

00:00:11.306 --> 00:00:13.316
you'll actually turn the
tables toward that wall.

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.436
If you're going to collaborate,
you're going to be at this table

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:18.476
or you're going to be at this table.

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:19.816
All right, go.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.756
&gt;&gt;By differentiating in a space
that's small or where you have a lot

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:29.186
of students we are able to set
students up with the learning situations

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:30.406
in which they can learn best.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.946
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen: Here at Summit
we serve a wide range of students

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:47.306
and so you'll see a varying degree of
skill within an academic classroom.

00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:51.406
Providing flexible space
gives students the opportunity

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:52.746
to learn in different ways.

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:56.416
And it also gives the teacher the
opportunity to coach them properly

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:58.826
in a personalized manner to
reach their learning goals.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:02.196
&gt;&gt;Chris Kelly: If you guys
want to work independently,

00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:06.636
what is going to be the best place
and the best people to be next

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:08.366
to you to work independently?

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:11.326
Those who want the mini-lesson
are going to come to this table.

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:15.676
&gt;&gt;We provide a lot of flexibility
for learning environments,

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:20.296
whether it's flexibility in terms of
the physical space, flexibility in terms

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:22.046
of the different choices
that students have.

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:26.446
You see students seated
toward the back of the room.

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:29.136
Those students are working
independently.

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:32.186
The students who are at the
tables have chosen to collaborate,

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:35.386
which is something they thought through
and made part of their goal-setting.

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:39.456
And then you have the group of students
that chose one of the two mini-lessons

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.796
and that takes place in the
center of the classroom.

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:45.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Is it better to have
more body paragraphs or conclusion?

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:49.736
&gt;&gt;Chris Kelly: Sometimes a student will
write a better thesis and the conclusion

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:52.356
than they do at the opening,
because they've had a chance--

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:54.396
&gt;&gt;Kayla: We wanted to collaborate,
because we've been helping each other

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:56.226
on the steps that we had to do.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:58.976
And especially since they're
so long we kinda thought,

00:01:58.976 --> 00:01:59.976
"Oh, let's just work together."

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:03.956
Also, I think if we were to be at other
tables we'd probably be more distracted.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:07.546
&gt;&gt;Kayla: Like, each slide
has a different objective.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:11.556
&gt;&gt;Taylor: This is, like, summarize
each slide in your own words, I guess.

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:12.136
&gt;&gt;Kayla: Yeah.

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:16.246
&gt;&gt;Taylor: When the classroom's flexible
we can learn a lot more from each other

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:19.906
and it forms a better bond with
the students within the school

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.166
and also the staff members.

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:25.386
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen: You may
walk by one room and see work time

00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:28.596
and the teacher floating around and
giving one-on-one support to kids.

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:30.046
Or you might see the
teacher in the middle

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:33.176
of a small group giving a
quick mini-lesson on something,

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:35.746
then moving right on to
the next group of students.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:38.886
Or you might see kids in a circle
engaging in a Socratic seminar

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:43.976
and having a dialog about an issue
that is tied to their class content.

00:02:44.246 --> 00:02:45.716
&gt;&gt;Student: How is e-waste to cycle?

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:49.816
&gt;&gt;Student: You buy something and then
companies start making more products.

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:53.756
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: Today in biology I
grouped them together in the middle

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:56.486
of the classroom so that
they could have a space

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:57.846
that was conducive to a discussion.

00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:00.556
&gt;&gt;Student: Is e-waste
preventing our choice or our duty?

00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:04.266
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it's our choice,
because nobody really tells us to do it.

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:05.096
&gt;&gt;Student: I agree with you.

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:06.676
I feel like it's our choice right now,

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.046
but it should be our duty
'cause it's important

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:11.396
to make the world a safer place.

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:14.906
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: Other students are in
the process of gathering information

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:16.936
for the experimental design project.

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:20.356
So, they were seen in the
outside, facing outwards

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:22.626
so that I could see their
screens and help them work

00:03:22.796 --> 00:03:24.806
through any distractions
they might have.

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:28.176
It's hard sometimes to stay
focused, especially as freshmen.

00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:29.996
&gt;&gt;All right, go ahead and move.

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:33.416
&gt;&gt;If they've mastered that or if they
are ready to move on to the next thing,

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:37.376
then our classrooms, you know,
support that transition by being able

00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:41.726
to very quickly move desks and
chairs into different groupings

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:45.646
for the next part of the class period.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.086
&gt;&gt;You guys move quickly and safely.

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:52.216
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen: It is important
to have furniture that allows me

00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:55.236
to create different types of learning
environments for the students.

00:03:55.236 --> 00:04:00.146
And, so, we have tables that have wheels
on them, so it's easy to transition

00:04:00.146 --> 00:04:01.626
into a different configuration.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:03.936
It doesn't disrupt the
learning too much.

00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:06.396
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: Buenos dÃ­as.

00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:07.276
&gt;&gt;Students: Buenos dÃ­as.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:10.396
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: Everybody can talk
about what this quote means to you

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:11.676
and what your response is to the quote.

00:04:12.026 --> 00:04:14.466
&gt;&gt;Student: You can't control
your circumstances always.

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:16.346
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: I will have
a whole-class discussion.

00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:19.256
It's called a whip-around and
we'll go around the entire circle

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:20.516
and have people share-out that way.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:22.626
It just is a way so that
we hear more voices

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:26.326
and make sure there's a
diversity of thought in the room.

00:04:26.406 --> 00:04:27.926
&gt;&gt;Janet: Some of us are
minorities and, like,

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.476
we have experienced certain
things that are--

00:04:29.476 --> 00:04:31.826
&gt;&gt;When we're sitting in a circle
and everyone can look at each other

00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:34.786
and be aware of each other I feel
like it makes you learn a lot better.

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.896
Like, you grasp concepts
more once you see a face.

00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:40.616
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen: What's really
exciting about the flexible space is

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:45.556
that it allows kids to really understand
what type of learning works for them

00:04:45.936 --> 00:04:48.626
and it equips the teacher with ways

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:51.716
that they can deliver more
personalized instruction to the kids.

00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:52.786
&gt;&gt;Student: It makes a lot more sense.

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:52.886
&gt;&gt;Cady Ching: Yay!
