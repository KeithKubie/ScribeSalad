Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. Right. So let me explain to you how I got got started with this. You were at some kind of an affair. I'll tell you how good. I was at a party party. Uh, it was a, it was a conference where they have a lot of different people of different disciplines come together, you know, one of those. Um, there are panel discussions of various things. It's, we were at one of the like functions and, uh, it was a situation where like dinner hadn't yet been served and there was a lot of booze being served, so everybody was like drunk on an empty stomach. So I was standing there with some biologists. Oh, they're the fun ones. The junk biologists. Yes. As night. My people barely. And uh, they, uh, we were, they, they started to lose their shit, like genuinely lose their shit about this thing called CRISPR.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And like, I've never seen scientists this excited about anything. So I was like, what is this thing? Wake up, what is CRISPR? And they were trying to explain it to me, but they couldn't slow down enough for me to get it. I gathered it had something to do with genetics. And then at 1.1 of the biologist turned to me and was like, I'll tell you what it is. I can use CRISPR to take a little dog and Poof, make it into a big dog. Give me a Chihuahua. I can turn it into the size of a great Dane. And I was like, no, you can't. He's like, yes I can. I could do it with crisper. I was like, what the hell is this thing? Do you want me to sit here as usual? If you sit here, I will get out, let me know, imply I, no, no, no, no, no. We'd be sitting here together. So what happened was I came back and I immediately called science writer Carl Zimmer because I just figured for this kind of thing, this is a Carl thing. I got to talk to Carl. So I a, I basically asked them like, while the fuss, maybe it was just the alcohol or, but maybe there's something really happening here.

Speaker 2:          01:49          Oh, there's something totally happening here. I mean, it's big. He started at the beginning so that you can actually find like the first reference to CRISPR in a 1987 paper from some Japanese scientists. They basically described something weird in Nikolai and they said, we don't know what this is.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Ecola are bacteria inside humans. And like all living things equalize made up of DNA, A's and t's and C's and g's. And what happened was that these scientists were reading a chunk of that genetic code when

Speaker 2:          02:22          they found this really strange stretch of DNA. Strange how well, so basically what it was, um, was five identical sequences in a row. And then they were separated by very short sequences in between them that were all different from each other. These little blurbs, it'd be like,

Speaker 3:          02:46          okay,

Speaker 4:          02:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:52          and they looked at this and they're like, well, what, this is nothing like we've seen before. Repeated sequences in bacterial are kind of unusual. Seems very strange. Some biologists felt that, you know, there must be a purpose for these among those purposes. Eagers Jennifer Doudna, University of California Berkeley. She's a cell biologist, so it's Doudna. Not Dude. No, it's Doudna. I used to be called the dude sometimes in the in school, but in the movie she will be played by Jeff Bridges. Right. Anyhow, as time goes on, scientists are seeing these little repeat blurp repeats everywhere. Yes. Releasing bacteria, lots and lots of lots of species of bacteria. They say, okay, wait a minute. That's kind of cool. Their findings, it so often that they decided they had to give it a name and this is this where the named CRISPR comes from. The full official name is clustered regularly.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Interspaced short palindromic repeats. Oh my God. I don't know why they called it CRISPR. It's kind of a CRISPR. It's like a furniture manufacturer or something. It sounds like an app. Yeah, yeah. CRISPR. CRISPR, but now scientists had this puzzle. If nature at this level preserved something intact. Here, I'm here and here and here and here and here and some of these here's or are creatures that have been around for hundreds of millions of years. You figure, well, whatever this is, it's doing something, doing something, but what it doesn't take very long before the first big clue comes up. All right, fast forward 2005 now scientists have these big searchable databases of DNA sequences, so some scientists think, well, let's do a search. Let's see if these repeating patterns. We keep finding match. Anything else that's out there in the world and the scientists are using computers to just line up these stretches of DNA with thousands upon thousands of different species and then click.

Speaker 2:          04:46          All of a sudden they discover that those bits of DNA between the repeats, the stuff in the middle of those blurps, these are matching virus DNA. Like you can find viruses with genes where these little, you know these little to the bacteria had virus inside of them. Yup. I mean that, that a virus brought it into these cells will tell you anything but the origin of it. The first recognition was this is virus DNA. Somehow all these bacteria have little snippets of virus DNA wedged in these particular places in their genome, which is a little weird if you think about it. I mean these are totally different creatures. They would be like inside a human finding, a little bit of mosquito DNA. You're want, how do we interpret this? Well, actually there was one scientist, his name is Eugene Koonin who looked at these results and just said, okay, I get it.

Speaker 2:          05:41          It's a defense system. Why would he think that? Because he's a brilliant man. What do you mean? If I went to a large sanitation dump and I found a team bit of human hair, why would I think, oh, I got it. It's a defense mechanism. I wouldn't know it. Just like a bitty human, right. Well, you see I, that metaphor might sort of betray your lack of skill and microbiology. I'm just saying like this is not a dump. All right. This is bacteria are not gonna just let virus DNA get into their genes willy nilly. Okay. Remember, viruses are the big enemy, right? If your bacteria, viruses make your life a nightmare, think about it in the ocean. Okay. The, the ocean is full of viruses and, and uh, viruses kill up to 40% of all of those bacteria every day. Really? Every day. Yeah. And we know that they have defenses.

Speaker 2:          06:40          What Eugene Koonin said was, okay, I'm going to bet that these bacteria are somehow grabbing pieces of DNA from viruses and then they're storing it and now they have a way of recognizing those viruses if they come in later, a little Polaroid shots of the enemy, right? No, thy enemy. Yeah, like a most wanted poster. What do you call the Mugshot? This is Eugene Koonin leader of the evolutionary genomics group at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He's the guy that Carl referenced who thunk up the whole idea that maybe these bits of virus DNA inside the bacteria is the bacteria trying to defend itself. But really if I, if I, if I, if I could eat myself with anything here, it was not so much getting this because you know, again, you see the vague dentical sequence that gets pretty obvious. It is figuring out how the mechanism was likely to work. So can you walk us through how the mechanism is likely to work? Oh right. What happens if you know, when a virus comes in to a cell, I just kind of explodes and just kind of releases naked genes. Basically, if you're this bacteria, these things might take over your cell, so you've got to respond, move moonstruck the guy, you have multiple weapons of defense. If you've never seen this virus before, it usually the first thing you do says Eugene is you send out these enzymes to attack the viruses. They're sort of like the ground troops and they fight really hard, but much of the tie,

Speaker 5:          08:25          thank you

Speaker 2:          08:27          fail and then no one will hear about you again. They're not terribly sophisticated fighters, so very often various takes over. The bacteria dies, but [inaudible] very fun nonzero probability

Speaker 5:          08:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:45          that you actually survive it. If you do then with the bacteria will do is send in some new enzymes to basically clean up to go out, find any stray viruses and then caught the enemy DNA into futile small pieces in here. He says when you get to the storage part, those enzymes will then take those little bits of virus and shove them into the bacteria as own DNA, right in those little spaces between the repeats right there and nowhere else. So I use those spaces in my own DNA as a storage facility, as a as a, you use it as a memory device

Speaker 1:          09:26          cause here's what happens next time that virus shows up

Speaker 2:          09:31          sprays with jeans everywhere. Now you are prepared and this is where the CRISPR story really gets going because instead of sending out the ground troops, we're probably going to get their asses beat. Now you can actually send out the big guns

Speaker 2:          09:48          and in fact what the cell does is it will manufacture these special molecular assassins and they'll give those assassins a copy of that little bit of virus DNA it has in stores. Basically saying, here, take this mugshot. If you see anything that matches this pattern, kill it. And these attackers, do we know what they, one of them looks like. Yup. So we know what the protein looks like. It, it actually looks, I would describe it, um, a little bit like a clamshell sort of imagine pack man, but kind of misshapen and rough in each one of these guys. What it has is a copy of that virus DNA. It's got the mugshot that it's kind of waving around. What then happens is that whenever the PAC man bumps into some virus DNA, it pulls apart the DNA and zips. It reads it. If it's not the right one, it goes on.

Speaker 5:          10:43          Nope,

Speaker 2:          10:45          sure.

Speaker 5:          10:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          10:50          and if that RNA has the same sequence, then click click. It just locks in. And if that happens then the DNA is trapped and molecular blades come out and chop cartoon gets scared that the mighty blow. Yeah. Smart scissors too. It's like, are you like the thing I got? Are you like say I got your like thing, I got sniff. Sniff. All right, now we are going to kill. Oh, I see. And it has to be exact. It has to be an exact match.

Speaker 1:          11:21          When scientists first discovered this whole system, they were fascinated. They were like,

Speaker 2:          11:26          they were working it out. They were like, oh, okay. Then this happens and this happens, this happens. Cool.

Speaker 1:          11:31          But then

Speaker 2:          11:32          in walks the dude, Jennifer Doudna with a crazy idea, I don't know if it's crazy radical. This could be an amazing technology. This is a tool. This is a tool, right? This is a tool that we can use to cut DNA where we want to cut DNA.

Speaker 1:          11:54          The basic thought was, why don't we turn this defense into offsets? Cause these things, they seem to be really good at cutting and yet they only seem to cut the things that are on their mugshot. So maybe I could just replace what's on their mugshot. So instead of them going after viruses, maybe they could go after a gene that causes Huntington's disease or hemophilia, for example. And this is actually something that's been done. So you've got a mouse with something like hemophilia. Okay? This is a disease is caused by one bad gene. So what you do is you take these little surgeons, you give them the mugshot for the bed

Speaker 2:          12:25          gene, then you stick the surgeon with the new mugshot and a mouse. Then you set it loose and just like it's the program too, it will find that gene and

Speaker 5:          12:35          click, click chop.

Speaker 2:          12:38          Yes. Scissors will end up cutting exactly the gene you wanted to cut to, the bad genes gone. Now the question is how do you put in the good gene? Right, right, right. It turns out actually according to Jennifer Doudna now that that's actually not as hard as you would think. Really. Yeah. Apparently what you do is just throw this new good gene kind of in the neighborhood of where they all genius to be just in the general vicinity. You don't have to get super precise. I mean, it turns out that, um, you know, there are repair enzymes that are probably continually surveying and checking for breaks. And she says, what'll happen is it inside the cell, these repair crews come along, they'll see the break, they'll see the good Jean just sitting there next to the break, there'll be like, all right, I'll just stick it in and split the pretty guy in this space. Exactly. So, so we take advantage of a natural repair pathway that cells have. They trick both the cutters and the fixers. Yeah. Now we're not assassinating anymore. Now we're actually engineering.

Speaker 1:          13:43          We've gone from killing to refashioning.

Speaker 5:          13:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:53          well though, haven't we been designing jeans doing genetic, a form of genetic engineering for, I don't know, like 30 years. Yes, but not like this.

Speaker 5:          14:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:07          genome editing technologies have been around for a long time, but none of them have been as powerful as CRISPR is. That's Beth Shapiro from UC Santa Cruz. She was actually one of the biologists that I drunkenly talked to at that thing. Was it a modern art museum? I can't even really remember. I don't remember either. It must've been quite an evening to have the setting be so vague. Anyhow, here's how she put it to us. Back in the day, this was just like two years ago you would have these gene editor or things you would take one, put it in a cell and what happened before was you would give it on some instructions about where to go and it might go there but it might go to somewhere. That's kind of related to where that was. It's like you just dig it right? Its Staten Island but it takes a left, not only would it take a left Staten Island and not find there, but it would've cost you a fortune and taken up six months of your time to get that thing and now you know it's really easy. You just give it that mugshot and it goes, I'm going to find that to guy. Exactly. So it seems to be pretty precise and it's cheap. Like the old tools would set you back about five grand just to use them once CRISPR but 75 bucks. And here's the kicker, says Carl, it seems at the moment that you can take these things out of bacteria, stick them into almost any other creature

Speaker 2:          15:19          and it still works. You can use the same CRISPR system on anything. Can you like do it? If corn is vulnerable certain past, you can do it in corn and corn, do it in anything. I have not. I'm waiting for someone to say CRISPR doesn't work in species x and I have not heard of that.

Speaker 1:          15:37          So basically what you have for the first time in science is this gene editing technology that is cheap, precise, and possibly universal. And Jennifer Doudna says the moment, the full impact of that landed on her.

Speaker 6:          15:50          I really, I literally had, you know, the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up

Speaker 7:          15:59          just processing the fact that this thing exists, you know, and that you could actually program it to cut DNA and just like this molecular scissors and I can just program it and it cuts DNA. Roder I want

Speaker 2:          16:20          it is amazing unless you think about it further, which we will do in just a moment. I feel a cloud coming in over their eyes and just over there, TC. I see you. Let's get a certain horizon mark over there, but we'll be right back.

Speaker 1:          18:04          This is Radiolab, mom jad up and Ron, I'm Robert Krulwich. Okay, so, uh, clearly the possibilities are there to use CRISPR to treat disease, right? Right. But what if you could get a little more fanciful, right? Like what if you could actually go back in time and resurrect long lost creatures. I mean, this is something that Best Shapiro has talked about a lot. We could reconstruct using a computer what the genome sequence of the ancestor of all birds was and that would have been a kind of dinosaur. And then we could use crispers to turn a chicken into that thing. Or what if you could take an elephant and snip, snip, snip, gradually turn it into its long lost relative, the woolly mammoth. No, cause they're related. But if they're there, they're similar over. Well, right. But if you know the woolly mammoth genome, which they do cause they apparently got it off some bone or some hair, then you could compare the number of differences you use CRISPR to crisper out the different parts of the elephant and put in wooly mammoth and stuff.

Speaker 9:          19:03          If you can in effect, go backwards in time and make changes. And obviously I think you can go the other way too, right? I mean, humans are good at design. We're designing animals. So if it doesn't seem to me to be a crazy notion to imagine parents all over the world wanting, I don't know, taller children. So silencing the short jeans and favoring the taller jeans, getting rid of weak muscles and going for stronger ones and on and on and on and on. I don't know where the designing stops.

Speaker 1:          19:34          We sort of got into all of this with uh, Carl Zimmer, science writer.

Speaker 9:          19:37          If, if you can be very, very gene specific and you learn more and more about genes over time, why couldn't you invent a creature? Why couldn't you make a pig with wings? You might one day get sophisticated enough to do that.

Speaker 2:          19:53          There's no wing at pig lab. You know, the best you're going to hope for right now is a woolly mammoth lab. And that's down the hall from where the, where the real action is, is now there's a hall and at the end of the hall, a wing piglet has not been built yet. It may be 20 years from now. But that's what you're looking at. Well, I think, but the thing is that why shouldn't anyone realize that that's really what we're talking about? Well, because you can't make weight. We need the pigs just because of sort of evolutionary barriers. Okay. Well, there's no reason to fly a gentleman for the job down. Come on down. I'm just, I mean, okay. I, I don't think that we need a federal department of homeland piquing security. I think we're okay there. All right. Well we do need is like, uh, we do need to like figure out what are we going to do about CRISPR and humans. I mean, they're going to be using CRISPR for cancer. Okay. They're going to take people's immune cells out of their body and they're going to use CRISPR to basically allow them to make proteins, are going to be able to grab onto cancer cells and attack their own cancer. Yeah. That's to be for that. I mean, you have to be, well, I don't know. I mean, are you for that is your, your, your, you talk, you are tink, you are tinkering with someone's own body. You are altering their own cells. You know,

Speaker 9:          21:18          dude, where do I, it's just, I tell you, look, was it, this is me. I don't know if it's a religious thought or just the thought of a conservative person, but I mean, I've, I grew up in the, in the test to baby era. I now know many wonderful adult formerly test two babies. And I, I remember being astonished that no, so I can't, I don't know where the sacred begins and ends anymore on that particular turf. I guess what I'm instead on is I'm on, on, um, a Hobbsy in view of human beings that there is something about human beings including scientists, human beings, all human beings, that there's a darkness and a light there, there, there, there's an angelic side to being human. And here's a very, very difficult set. And as the human beings get more and more power to create and design and essentially create a future, that future will include the imaginations, both light and dark of humans and that will be new in the world.

Speaker 2:          22:17          Yeah. I don't think it is new because if you go back to the start of the scientific revolution, some like Francis Bacon would say explicitly like science is going to be both about learning about how the world works and using that knowledge to control it. You know, this has been discovered. This has been published. Everybody knows it exists. Um, if you're going to say like, okay, now we're going to all, we're going to outlaw this. I'm not saying festing that well. What are you suggesting? I think we should cringe level as opposed to just have a big part. Right. That's all great. You Ready? One, two, three. [inaudible] what do we have? Cringed, deny way. What do we do now? Well, I don't know if that's what you're arguing. No. [inaudible] cringe too. You cringed meanly and deep and you Chris Chew Cummins with attitude I don't pitching with with, I would like because you're afraid of like dragons. You're saying?

Speaker 10:         23:16          You're saying, oh my God, yes, I'm afraid of dragons. Okay, so that conversation with Carl was four months ago and a lot has happened in the in in that time because to the question that you asked, like where does the sacred begin and end? Well, one of the lines that had been drawn by Jennifer Doudna and others was that we should not use this technology on humans who haven't been born yet. Meaning not on sperm cells or egg cells. Because if you CRISPR say an embryo that is a, that is a permanent,

Speaker 1:          23:46          right. That is a change to the DNA that will be passed on to their children and their children's children and their children's children's children. And you can't ask the person if that's okay because you're doing it before they're born. Consent becomes a real issue. And if you imagine making these changes and they cascade through generation after generation, you could affect the evolution of organisms. And it's, I don't want to say trivial, but it's, you know, it's fairly easy to do it. Wow. It's kind of profound. I feel it's really profound. Profound. But it was just an idea that is until

Speaker 2:          24:21          for the first time in history, researchers in China have successfully edited the human genome and an embryo. Just two months ago, it was announced that a Chinese team from Estonia, Watson University use a technique called CRISPR to edit DNA than human embryos. It's a way of hacking evolution itself. Well, this is hugely controversial. Now these embryos, the Chinese team had edited, they were created through IVF and they were not viable. But these are embryos that are, are not going to actually develop into a person. So they're, they're going to be discarded anyway. It's still thinking, figuring it out with those embryos. What's to stop any of us from going further. I ologist and bioethicists are sounding an alarm scientists face accusations that they crossed an ethical line that's just sort of thing could be sort of a slippery slope towards toward designer babies. Essentially genetically engineering the human race

Speaker 9:          25:10          when I use the term chips to kind of test your levels. Okay. Now that the cringe party had spread and Robert didn't seem like such a loon. Yeah, we called up Carl again. Well, we have to revisit, we have to revisit it because in our Iron Mageddon conversation in which I believe I was extremely alarmist and you were extremely down pudding, I feel that I should do a small little parade called the [inaudible]. The Alamo is take remember, remember China and you have to close. You should just begin anytime you want. Like getting on your knees and saying how sorry you are. I don't if you start from there. Um, I'm sorry. So are we actually surrounded by,

Speaker 1:          25:49          uh, an army of, uh,

Speaker 9:          25:51          clones with superpowers? Not yet. Not yet, but I think the dyke has been open. I believe, I'm going to quote somebody who said, uh, maybe a few weeks ago, I think maybe it was last week, even writing for National Geographic. I think it was, maybe it was somebody named Carl who said that, uh, the news from China and that news was probably the beginning of an entire new era. I think I actually said it was a historical moment. That's right. Yes.

Speaker 1:          26:17          Yes. And I, and I still stand by that. Do you feel differently now than the first time we talked? Yeah, that's really the question. I don't feel different actually because, um, there isn't really no scientific surprise here. He says, people have been doing all these CRISPR experiments on all these different mammals. We're mammals. This is bound to happen. And in fact, it may be happening more than we think. Uh, in one account in the journal, nature has said that for other Chinese labs are doing this kind of work as we speak. But Carl also told us, which he said was unsurprising too, but I actually find it kind of surprising that the CRISPR worked. This Chinese team did, didn't work very well. It worked kind of,

Speaker 2:          26:57          I mean, in only a few of the cases did they really get exactly what they wanted.

Speaker 1:          27:03          Um, they tried using CRISPR and about 86 embryos and they only get off to work right. And maybe 28 getting in and a lot of them crispers made the wrong cuts and screwed up the cells and that led them to conclude that this is a technology that's not ready right now for

Speaker 2:          27:18          application in the human germline. And I agree, oh, we're sort of, we still are in this kind of a fortunate position where we can say, oh, well it's dangerous so we shouldn't use it on in human embryos. I just don't think that we're going to be able to sort of, uh, find refuge there in like 10 or 20 years. In 10 or 20 years. You know, CRISPR will be so sophisticated that people will be able to say, I can get you the change you want and I can do it safely. I can guarantee you that you will have human embryos that have the alteration in the particular gene you want. So then what,

Speaker 1:          27:57          in fact, Jennifer Doudna told us that this experiment or similar experiments have been repeated in mice with more advanced CRISPR systems. Cause apparently there are many different kinds and they're, it was done with almost no error.

Speaker 2:          28:09          Sometimes I feel like we're sort of displacing all our ethical concerns onto something that hasn't happened yet. If we really are concerned about what we're doing to the human gene pool, you know, it's already here. Take

Speaker 1:          28:23          as an example, in vitro fertilization, about 60,000 kids are born a year through IVF and it's probable that some of those parents chose whether they wanted a boy or a girl. And, and

Speaker 2:          28:34          when people started doing IVF, there was a huge controversy. People said this was dangerous. This is unnatural. I don't see people who are unable to sleep at night because of the existence of IVF. Yeah, yeah. Now I'm going to sound like I'm on Robert side of this. I mean, okay. So, so I won't hurt. They won't. It won't. It will. Okay. All right. Yeah. Here we go. So, okay, so breath. So you guys know about, uh, all the stuff going on in Iceland where they're looking at people's DNA and you know, they're looking for disease genes and so on. And when they were looking at these Icelandic people, they found that some people had a gene that, uh, protects them against Alzheimer's. It reduces their odds of getting Alzheimer's. Let's imagine your doctor said now if you'd like for an extra thousand dollars, we will take these IVF embryos and we will use CRISPR to give them the Alzheimer protecting variant. Would you like that? Do you want to add that to your, to your procedure? Sure. Yeah. Or would you like your child to, to face a,

Speaker 1:          29:42          a future of, of Alzheimer's, your choice. See, here's my, here's my thing. Here's my thing with this whole, with this whole thing, I'm, I'm a little bit haunted by the thing you said, which is that when it's not dangerous anymore, what will we do? And I'm afraid we've already answered that question, that it's not, it's not a question that's open anymore because if we're already doing this kind of stuff and who's going to say no to that? Who's going to say no to that? That's what he just was demonstrating. Yeah. Yeah. We've already answered the question. Yeah. We may have

Speaker 11:         31:10          to hear the message again. Press two to delete it. Start of message. Oh no calls number nine. This is Beth Shapiro. Hello, this is Jennifer Doudna. Radiolab is produced by Jada, the right Brendan, Cheryl, Ellen, Lauren, Dylan, Keith Matte, guilty and Levy, but Keith Nasser, Melissa O'Donnell, Kelby Padgett, Arianne wack, Molly Webster, Sean ruler, and Jamie are, I think I said Webster. Let me try it again with help from Daddy Lewis, Kelly crime and Damiano Marchetti. Our fact checkers are Eva Dasher and Michelle Harris. Awesome. Thank you. Much redder and this message.
