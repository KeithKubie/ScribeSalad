1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,350
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:04,900
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:09,790
August 20th, 2018. Sorry, what's going on?

4
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,730
How are you?
How was your weekend?

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:18,030
Did you or did you not enjoy yourself
digital or did you dot abuse substances

6
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:25,780
that were a illegal and,
and uh, possibly. Dot. Um,

7
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:27,820
I was actually out in Las Vegas,

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,250
hot as Fuck Las Vegas.
Let's make it fun.

9
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:35,680
And everybody talking about how can
you believe how hard it is out here?

10
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:38,620
It's like, yeah, man, we're
in a fucking desert in August.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,790
I can completely understand why
it is so fucking hot out here.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,150
Um, and then you get the global
warming thing going on, you know,

13
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:56,140
with half, half the half the world's
on fire according to the news.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,240
Um, yeah, I can, I can see why it'd
be a little small to read their, um,

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:02,971
you know,

16
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:07,660
it's so fucked up about Las Vegas is
I was thinking when I was out there,

17
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:08,560
it's like there's,

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,650
there's only one reason and one reason
only that that place exists and that is

19
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,940
air conditioning.
Okay.

20
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,650
I know back in the day, you
know, when they had like
three or four little fucking,

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,630
I dunno, one floor casinos
in the middle of nowhere.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,410
Whatever the hell was going on out
there. I did. I forget the whole story.

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,760
All right. I've watched all the
goddamn movies. I saw casino,

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,640
I saw fucking Bugsy goes
to fucking pebble beach,

25
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,770
whatever the fuck it was called.
I watched that one.

26
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:46,970
Yeah.

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,890
I don't remember what the fuck. I'm
sure there was some fans, you know,

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,430
overhead fans. Is that all they had back
in the day? But I can tell you right now,

29
00:01:55,431 --> 00:02:00,080
nobody fucking went out there in August.
Well, maybe they did. I don't know.

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,190
But I'm just anyways,
cause it different breed of people.

31
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:09,040
That was the greatest generation
back then. Okay. They, they, they,

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,280
they defeated Adolf Hitler,
defeated Japan.

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,040
You know, they date, they beat their
wives and then nothing was said about it.

34
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,850
You know, they will all those women back
there, Rosie the riveter. What happened?

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,260
I was a rebut.
I walked into a fucking door.

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,480
I, the meatloaf was called, you know,

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,340
was the greatest,
the greatest generation.

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,190
Um, anyways, I was just looking around,

39
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:45,530
just looking at the whole fucking thing.
It was like if there's no AC,

40
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,110
this fucking place is done.

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,390
All right. They, for whatever
reason they had in Nevada.

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,870
Is that the governor who's
the president of Nevada?

43
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:01,390
What's the highest political
position you can hold? Senator?

44
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,740
Yeah.

45
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,210
What is the Senate senators like?

46
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,730
An absentee father right
there fucking in Washington.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,670
They playing grab ass with
their secretary going,

48
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,720
you're not going to meet to me now are ya?
Huh?

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,860
What if it's just a cigarette?
Um, so they're never around.

50
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,750
They come around once every
fucking six years or something.

51
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:25,470
That's when they get elected right
there and there for six fucking years.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,360
Yeah.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,310
Just sitting there eating just one.

54
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,920
Say I want you to after
another on a pretzel roll,

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,993
you know,

56
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,360
occasionally hitting the elliptical
lying to themselves that that 20 to 25

57
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:42,000
minutes on that elliptical just burned off

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,500
the nightmare level of eating that they
did the last fucking eight days. Right.

59
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,960
They just keep getting fatter.

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,630
They send their fucking secretary that
they're banging down to Brooks brothers

61
00:03:56,631 --> 00:04:00,800
to buy the next size dress shirt is they
pushed their pants down a little lower

62
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:04,070
in lie to themselves that they're still
wearing the same size slacks that they

63
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:09,071
wore back in fucking high school when
they were president of the four h club or

64
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:13,400
whatever it is. Politicians do those
fucking worms. They figure it out early,

65
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:15,380
don't they?
Right.

66
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:18,860
They become head of the glee club with
the fucking student body president.

67
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,183
You know,

68
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,850
they fucking petition to have something.
I don't know what tree planted.

69
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,860
It's just bullshit like that. Whenever,
whenever they, whenever they write those,

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,740
those fucking autobiographies
about presidents, you know,

71
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,750
it was very inquisitive. Always love
that aims. I'm very inquisitive kid.

72
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,930
All kids are inquisitive once
they learn the word. Why?

73
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,700
Because they're looking at everything
is fucking brand new. What's set TV?

74
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,790
Why? And also we can watch a bunch
of shit. Why I cause what board?

75
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,730
Why I don't fight. I don't know. Why

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,290
is your mother here? All
right. That's how it goes down.

77
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,150
It's really weird that when you become
president for the rest of your life,

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,430
you know, you're out of power and
you still get that secret server.

79
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,600
I know that they're doing away with
it, I think. I think, was it George?

80
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:25,650
Debbie who was the last guy who's
getting it for the rest of his life?

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,611
It's kind of weird,

82
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:30,900
the first like half black president that
we get all of a sudden it's just like,

83
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:34,360
yeah, you know, uh, you, I did. Well,

84
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,920
we'll hang out with you for like
another 10 years, but you know what?

85
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,690
She hit your sixties.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

86
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,483
MMM.

87
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,630
Anyways, I, uh,

88
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,410
and then they fucking,
they'd sit there and they write books.

89
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:58,100
I cannot fucking believe that
Obama was on his third book.

90
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,730
He's only been out of office year and a
half. What is he fucking Stephen King.

91
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,230
He just cranking them out.

92
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,010
Did he? He wrote two of them while he
was still president running the country.

93
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,820
Allegedly.
That's what the president allegedly does.

94
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:18,600
He's running the fucking country and
this guy's in there. He's writing books.

95
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,340
Um,
anyways,

96
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,020
so I'm going to say it's the governor,
the governor ever just sat down.

97
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,400
You know, I was actually joking
on stage saying a great way,

98
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,980
you know, eventually they're
gonna have to thin the herd ditch.

99
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,350
They're just gonna have to do with this
whole fucking bullshit that we're going

100
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:46,850
to build a space ship and
we're gonna move to my,

101
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,410
it's like it doesn't have
a fucking atmosphere.

102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,770
Okay. And am I talking about oxygen?
I'm just saying this. No five.

103
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,950
You want to fucking go
all the way out there,

104
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,723
right?

105
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,440
It just sit there looking
at a bunch of fucking rocks

106
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,800
inside your little space. They, how much
others? Scifi channel are you watching?

107
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,090
How many times did you rub one out
to that chick on Star Trek? I mean,

108
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:27,390
I don't,

109
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,740
I don't even know what the fuck you
doing that you would even even want to do

110
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:36,720
that anyways, at some point.
Even these blueblood guys,

111
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,750
I think eventually why think what
they're working towards right now?

112
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,410
I apologize because I am
completely fucking wiped out.

113
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:47,340
This is why this podcast is so
fucking nuts right now. Okay.

114
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,740
I flew myself out,

115
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,210
my instructor out to Fucking Vegas,

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,860
uh, yesterday and then today we
flew over to Utah and went through,

117
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,090
I think it's Zion National Park

118
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,640
and then flew back.

119
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:12,900
I flew a helicopter day
for 6.4 fucking hours,

120
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:17,670
whatever the fuck you call it. Um, and
those things are not built for comfort.

121
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,390
All right. Anyways, that's why
I'm all over the fucking map here.

122
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,870
I'll talk about that shit later.
Anyways, plowing ahead here.

123
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,753
Um,

124
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,050
the fuck was I talking about? Oh God.
Nine let you leave to go. Oh, this one.

125
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,180
I think these fucking rich
guys are going to do all right.

126
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,560
I think their solution is,
is

127
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,860
they either don't give a fuck

128
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,840
about how out of control
the population is right now.

129
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,280
You know what I mean?
Where any scientists

130
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,340
who's not on the payroll of some fucking
corporation that produces energy will

131
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:06,801
tell you that 2 billion people is the
maximum amount of people evidently that

132
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,510
the earth can handle.
All right?

133
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,270
Without it, I'll go into fucking hell.
And we're up to, we're over seven.

134
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,540
All right, we're red line in it.
We're in the left lane on the highway.

135
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:23,050
We're still in first gear and
the engines at fucking 8,000 rpm.

136
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:25,660
So that's what the fuck we're
doing day in and day out.

137
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,390
We're like a fat guy walking
up a flight of stairs,

138
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,090
eating a cupcake while
smoking a pack of cigarettes.

139
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,350
That's what the fuck we're doing.

140
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,843
Okay.

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,200
So I think the reason why
they're investing so much
in robotics aside from then,

142
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:44,090
they won't have to hire people.
This thing won't.

143
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,240
There'll be no back sass
and from this fucking robot,

144
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,780
they won't want a union.
They won't give a shit.

145
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,123
Right.

146
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,620
They're basically gonna replace
us and rather than killing us,

147
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,430
I think they'll just fucking shut off.

148
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:06,431
The AC is as the world heats up and then
that's going to be yet it's going to be

149
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:09,350
it for a lot of people.

150
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,783
You know what I mean?

151
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,760
I want, do you think the Kardashians would
last without fucking air conditioning?

152
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,720
How soft

153
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,980
and cushy,
you know,

154
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,700
let's say they happen to work for what
they have, but I'm just saying, you know,

155
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,760
when you, when you get designer
bag sent to your fucking house,

156
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,590
I would think if they took away
your air conditioning at that point,

157
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:36,250
that would literally, you would go into
depression. Like you lost the limp,

158
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,753
right?

159
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,360
So anyways, but don't worry. Okay. When
they shut off the AC and you die, a slow,

160
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,700
miserable death and the heated future,

161
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,880
the upside is, is that the rich
guys, they're going to die too.

162
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,880
Because what they're gonna do is they're
going to make these robots have such

163
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,710
human fucking qualities that eventually
they're going to feel slighted that

164
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:07,000
they're doing all the fucking work,

165
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,753
you know,

166
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,740
and the weight. Then they're making them
so fucking good. I saw this whole thing.

167
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,660
They go like, yeah, hey, this robot

168
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,330
beat a video games like beat
the best gamers in the world.

169
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:25,270
They couldn't beat this robot.
It's like, it's a fucking robot.

170
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,280
You know?
Of course it didn't.

171
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,930
But you understand that we made the robot.

172
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,870
Human beings figured out
how to make a fucking robot.

173
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,330
Why are you talking about the robot?
Like it's a fucking person.

174
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,703
It's not a person.

175
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,210
Did you hear that?
A a fucking a guy with an egg beater.

176
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,610
The fastest guy in the world with the
fucking fork in a bowl of eggs. Can you,

177
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:01,390
can you believe that? Yeah. The machine.

178
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,303
So anyways,

179
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,060
they're already starting to talk about
these things as if they're fucking

180
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:14,490
superior
to a mouth.

181
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,080
Breathing more on like myself.

182
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,870
Who Right now is sitting
in air conditioning talking
to himself into a fucking

183
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:23,704
microphone.

184
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,700
All right?

185
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,700
This is going to be their downfall because
they're going to make those things so

186
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,960
God damn human,
they're going to feel fucking slighted.

187
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,023
All right?

188
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,090
They better build into chip where they
feel unbelievably fucking grateful

189
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,870
that these sociopaths who own them,
poof,

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,670
who fuck them, they can have
sex with them and shit, right?

191
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,000
They better put in.
They didn't Beldam they,

192
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,960
they told some fucking nerve to do
it and the fucking nerd day, right?

193
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,940
Everybody thinking nerds is
so goddamn harmless. They say,

194
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:12,941
make one fucking goddamn dream after
another come true for absolute fucking

195
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:18,500
sociopath's with unchecked power.
Thanks a lot.

196
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,960
You fucking four.
I'd fucking cunt.

197
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,093
You know,

198
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,350
so you could do what by doctor
who on fucking laser disk

199
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,930
anyways, these fucking thanks.
They're there. Eventually.

200
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:43,960
That's what's going to happen.
They're going to feel fucking slighted.

201
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,540
They're going to feel
superior. And uh, you know,

202
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,080
cause I'll keep making it better and
better and better right now. They try to,

203
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,930
you know, make everything a little faster,
a little fucking bored. Our dynamic,

204
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,900
they're gonna make the things work a
little better. Thank a little better.

205
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,640
Fuck a little better at the whole thing.

206
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,040
And then eventually they just
gonna look at you like that.

207
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,940
Bear looked at that woman on the talk
show who snuck in beside him and they're

208
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,130
going to do the double take and
then that's just going to be yet,

209
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,670
and there's going to be no trainer there
in a fucking karate suit to pull the

210
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,170
fucking thing off you.
It's going to be yet.

211
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,543
MMM.

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,680
Those are the thoughts you have when you
fly a helicopter over the Mojave desert

213
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,650
and then on and know where you come up
over the fucking hill and [inaudible].

214
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,250
There it is. This, this fucking
thing that shouldn't be there.

215
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,880
Knowing that I live in a city
that it shouldn't be there.

216
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,780
I got to read up on the history of La,
like

217
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,620
who was the driven content that decided
that we should build fucking a city

218
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:50,540
here?
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

219
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,410
There's no water. It's unlivable.
I don't worry about it.

220
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,910
We'll get some,
we'll figure it out.

221
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,040
We'll name it after me.
The aqueduct,

222
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,030
the river, whatever the fuck it is.
Um, I think I have sunstroke right now.

223
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:15,410
Everybody. Um, I will
tell you, you know what?

224
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:19,460
I was psyched about
going to the gym and uh,

225
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,020
working on my legs for the last
month. Like I don't feel, you know,

226
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,800
I got out and stretched a number of times.
Dude,

227
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,440
it was one of the sickest
fucking flights I've ever done.

228
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,620
Breathtakingly beautiful,
beautiful stuff.

229
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,700
And then just other places where you just
like, how the fuck did people on horses

230
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,380
used to survive here?
Native Americans,

231
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,480
the white men that came along and
slaughtered them, you know, come on.

232
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,410
We got him at this time.
Right? Just openly talk about

233
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,080
the transitioning
gentrification of countries,

234
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,420
how that happens. Um,
you know, follow this,

235
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:07,370
this, this fucking thing
on Instagram where they're
talking about the changing of

236
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:10,400
neighborhoods and there's all these people
going, you know, when I was lived here,

237
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,070
it was a neighborhood.
There was a Korean guy across the street,

238
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:17,240
there was a Russian guy up the street
and everybody knew me and all of this

239
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,920
fucking blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

240
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,330
And all of a sudden all these white people
are coming in the state of themselves

241
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:24,630
and they make it everything,
all nice.

242
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,410
We all to leave and I'll
fucking neighborhood it goes
away. And she's like, well,

243
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,570
you know,
well who was there before you got there?

244
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,990
You just keep going back
and back and back and back.

245
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,920
And eventually there's a bunch of native
Americans. They're living off the land,

246
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:37,754
not hurting anybody.

247
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,730
Yeah.
So

248
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,820
I dunno, I dunno. I don't know how to,
I don't know how to rationalize that.

249
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:49,481
I will tell you this.

250
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:53,410
I don't know what the fuck's going
on as far as like everywhere I go,

251
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,440
they got like they're building these
luxury high rise apartments everywhere I

252
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:03,700
go. Luxury high rise of
plant with, first of all,

253
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:08,380
what kind of a dumb fuck
would rent a luxury apartment?

254
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,020
Why wouldn't you just buy a shitty house?

255
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,300
Why are you going to take all that money
and put it in somebody else's pocket?

256
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,920
Not to mention who has the money
to rent a luxury apartment.

257
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,660
He need a fucking apartment.

258
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,893
All right.

259
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Is this all goes back to all of these
fucking who is on TV walking around with

260
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,170
their big fake ass lips.

261
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:39,820
They've fake fucking tits acids
jacked up in the air, right?

262
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,310
These big stupid designer. Everybody's
living this designer fucking life.

263
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,240
All right, let me, I do, I, I, I realize
how crazy I sound right now. By the way,

264
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:51,600
everybody,

265
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,010
I'm just going to talk until 60 minutes
is up and then I'm fucking going to put

266
00:17:56,011 --> 00:18:00,060
my giant Charlie Brown
sunstroke fucking head to bed.

267
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,140
All right.

268
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,870
I know a lot of you can see right now
you're enjoying this because I'm sounded

269
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,940
like I've walked myself off in this
authorities outside my house right now.

270
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:13,560
I understand that. I understand
on some level how crazy I sound.

271
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,080
It took me about 17 minutes
to fucking realize it,

272
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,330
that this was a little fucking nuts.

273
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,530
And then amazing being a comedian. How
you can feel time. I just looked down.

274
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,980
It was eight minutes,
18 minutes and 19 seconds.

275
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:29,850
Okay.

276
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,350
Um, anyways, after a while you can
feel the club owners staring at you.

277
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,910
Like if he burns his fucking life,

278
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,670
I'm going to end his career and he's
going back to his fucking day job.

279
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:41,160
Do you can feel it?
Um,

280
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,140
yeah,

281
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,530
like I think that they're just going to
build all of these fucking things and

282
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:51,710
there's not going to be enough people that
can afford to live in them. The whole,

283
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:54,290
fuck that thing's going to crash. And
this is what I love. It's all our money.

284
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,640
These banker costs are doing it again.

285
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,650
They did 10 years ago,

286
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:05,500
a collapsed with the fucking houses and
now they're doing it with these goddamn

287
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,630
buildings. And once again,
it's our money at once again.

288
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,460
They'll say we're too big to fail.

289
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,570
And once again they'll write themselves
bonuses and they will just leave

290
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,190
nameless and faceless.

291
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,220
And then Steve Carell is going to
have to start another fucking movie

292
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,890
called, what's the deal with
bankers part too, right.

293
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,180
And do you think that fat ass
fucking Senator Reed that say,

294
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:33,140
what should that fucking pretzel roll
pushing his slacks down to just above his

295
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:37,130
pubic line is going to fucking do
anything about it. I don't think he is.

296
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,260
There you go buddy.
There's a fucking 19 minute fucking swirl.

297
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:43,160
A Horse Shit for you.

298
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,883
MMM.

299
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,260
I had one of the best shows of my career.
I'm not going to lie to you last night.

300
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,030
I had so much goddamn fun.

301
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,133
MMM.

302
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,440
That what used to be, I got to get this,
I got to get the name of this casino,

303
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,960
correct.
All right.

304
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,490
It used to be the mining Carla
and then the MGM bought it.

305
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,090
Uh, let's see. Casino now it's
called the MGM something or other,

306
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,740
uh,
fuck you.

307
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,770
Fuck you. Where the hell is it? I
am not going to be able to find it.

308
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,090
Bonkers casino. I'm an idiot.
I got to write Las Vegas. Ah,

309
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,360
okay. All right. Hang on a second.

310
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:40,020
Las Vegas,
Las Vegas,

311
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,920
fucking Nevada.
The park MGM is what it's called now.

312
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,800
Monte Carlos now called
the park MGM and a,

313
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:55,801
I performed there with Joe Barnick
Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe Barr.

314
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:58,780
Nick. We had a great time
and it was all these awesome,

315
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,370
amazing comics were in town.
Uh, Todd rex, the beige band.

316
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:06,100
Ditto is, he calls me, he calls himself.

317
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,380
We still gotta do that toward some point.

318
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,400
The Beige Bandido when the
freckled Fucko right. Again,

319
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,160
we had the whole tour poster.
We had the whole thing mapped out.

320
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,620
Just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Anyways,

321
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,910
one of the hardest people I've ever
had to follow in the business, uh,

322
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:25,390
he swung by, uh, Ron White was in town.

323
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,190
Dice clay was in town.
Um,

324
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,160
yeah, it was pretty fucking awesome.
So anyways, I went there with my laugh.

325
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,180
My mother in law came along and um,

326
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,460
for the first time we, uh,
we actually had our, uh,

327
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,310
daughter's staying with the God mother.

328
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,510
That was a little nerve
wracking. But um, you know,

329
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,050
we were only gone for a day and uh,
came back,

330
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,790
I basically didn't see her
for maybe like 30 hours.

331
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,020
And uh, it was awesome. It was
all great to see her, you know,

332
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,560
dropped her off and I read her like
frigging like nine books. That's my thing.

333
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:13,150
You know,
it's funny like this is how much,

334
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,170
like technology's just
all over everything.

335
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,620
Like she was grabbing all these
books and I go, let's, let's, let's,

336
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,360
let's read a quiet book.

337
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,370
And it just struck me as so funny cause
like all of the other ones have like

338
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:31,150
sound effects and you know,
the farmer,

339
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,000
he looked over and he saw a, and
you press the button, it's like

340
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,030
you gotta go roaster.

341
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,810
And then he saw his mirror. It's just
like, can't, I can't fucking do that.

342
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,630
I Dunno. Maybe you know what
it is. These book people,

343
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,600
I think they fill in
the pressure of IPADS,

344
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,480
not the office.
Probably the people that make books,

345
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,040
they're like, we're doing what we
can. We're putting books on kindle,

346
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,190
but we're losing the children.
Okay.

347
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:09,370
Is there a way that when they read,

348
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,190
I dunno,
Moby Dick,

349
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:16,030
is there a way it can there be like they
turned the page and water squirts at

350
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:19,390
them? Like everything is going to
turn into like a fucking imax movie.

351
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,330
Uh, I really try to limit the amount
of time. Uh, my kid watches TV,

352
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,840
but she loves the puppy dog
pals. And every time, you know,

353
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,390
she knows like her scheduled,
like we let her watch it in the morning,

354
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:34,900
she wants his puppy dog pals may
be a little bit of Disney shit,

355
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,150
Mickey and Minnie Mouse,
uh, in Vampyr arena. Right.

356
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,990
And then this is fancy Nancy thing.
I don't know how I feel about that show.

357
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,280
You know,
she's just really into,

358
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,660
into fucking clothes and shoes and shit.

359
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:55,300
And she's always trying to be
the cool kid, but she's not.

360
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,590
And then she thinks if she fucking buys
some shared or has some shit made or she

361
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:03,370
has the best fucking tree
for it, uh, it's just like,

362
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,470
what the fuck am I watching? So I
finally said to me, I got in the A and I,

363
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:10,960
and I don't know if I like
this check and you know,

364
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,710
this is why I love my wife.
She's like, yeah, you know,
I don't know if I like her.

365
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,760
I don't know if I like to read it.
You know,

366
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,850
she already said about another like
show. She goes, I don't like this show.

367
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,570
And I was like, well, what's wrong
with it? You don't like the, you know,

368
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,570
like the characters? She goes, no, they
always kind of lie and do shifty shit

369
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,080
to get what they want.
And I was like, wow,

370
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:35,140
she's watching this on a whole other
level. She's watching it as a parent.

371
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:36,930
Okay.

372
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,810
So I started watching him
like that. Oh, shut up bill.

373
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,340
You Watch fancy Nancy.

374
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:45,820
What you saw was an eight year old who
in the in the future looks like she's

375
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:48,880
going to marry a guy because of how much
money he makes. That's what you saw.

376
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:51,160
Okay?
It has to do with your issues with women.

377
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,940
That's why you don't like the show.
All right?

378
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,610
See that I don't need to go to therapy.

379
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,400
I can get down on my own
fucking issues myself.

380
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,420
So anyways, I went on this helicopter
ride today up to the Zion National Park

381
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,150
and the shit that I saw,
I saw this thing called the Monkey Mesa

382
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,650
and it's a set of railroad tracks
that goes, that has to go for like it,

383
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:18,750
it looks like for like
three quarters of a mile.

384
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,750
We flew right over the fucking
thing and when it gets,

385
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:24,750
and it goes right to the edge
of a cliff and just stops.

386
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,910
Back in the day when NASA was testing
our parachutes and shit like that,

387
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,040
they'd put a fucking monkey on the thing.

388
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,790
They'd send it down the track and they'd
shoot this poor fucking monkey off the

389
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:40,470
goddamn cliff
if it lived the next day.

390
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,460
You know, like chuck Yeager was
like, did the monkey live? All right,

391
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,150
I'll fucking give it a shot. Let's have
balls those guys had. But you know,

392
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,380
what about the monkey?

393
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,090
Is it any wonder that you know,

394
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,700
some day they're going to learn how
to talk and try to take us over.

395
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:00,680
I may go with what the
fuck we fucking deserve it.

396
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,430
Probably don't even give it a flight
suit or a cool nickname like maverick.

397
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,020
They just fucking throw it in there.
Give it half a banana.

398
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:13,810
Yeah.

399
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,180
Think about how fast a
monkey moves on its own.

400
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,060
Now all of a sudden it's getting launched.
Fuck it.

401
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:24,540
Then goes to space.
You know they can do that shit now.

402
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,540
They look at these ex football players
and they look at like the damage they've

403
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,700
done to the brains, to
CTE. I want to take and,

404
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,210
and I know that they can look at
your brain and see what stress does.

405
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,770
I can't imagine when a monkey
comes back from fucking space,

406
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,280
you know that fuck it thing has got
to be just stuck around like, dude,

407
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:45,540
what the fuck?
What the fuck was that?

408
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,940
You just fucked that monkey
over for the rest of it's,

409
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,300
they can't relate to anybody. You
think you know the astronauts, they,

410
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:58,320
they had enough of a fucking problem.
We're, after they went out there,

411
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:00,810
the only other people they could
talk to his other astronauts

412
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,090
of what they saw, where they went, what
the fuck they did, how scared they were,

413
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:10,050
how exhilarating it was, how much more
they believed in a fucking higher power,

414
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,130
that level of experience.

415
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,060
And then they come back and they try to
hang out with other human beings who are

416
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,160
all excited.
Go Age.

417
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:23,760
You see the new Starbucks sip building
and that's going to be a really nice one.

418
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,180
You know? And then you,
as you're sitting there,

419
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,960
you orbited the fucking earth
and you've got to try to how to,

420
00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:32,610
how to enter the orbit of
that fucking conversation

421
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,410
without your brain kitchen on
fire, man. It's fucking unreal.

422
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,540
You know, I, if you're
sitting there going,

423
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,220
what the fuck is this guy talking about?

424
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,890
I don't even know what I'm talking about
either. Right? So go fuck yourself.

425
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:51,150
Anyways, so we went and flew
into a Zion national park.

426
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:55,950
We actually set it down, uh,
before we got into the park. Uh,

427
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:58,080
we will try and find a
place to fucking land.

428
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:03,081
I wanted to stretch my legs and that's
one of the great things about flying a

429
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:08,271
helicopter is you really fly as far
as how close she can fly to shit.

430
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,130
If you just want to set down
somewhere, you know, we will.

431
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:15,090
It's so fucking hot.

432
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,800
We were actually looking at this lake and
you want to sit down and just fucking,

433
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,880
I was like, dude, if I had, if
I had packed a bathing suit,

434
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:25,860
I would fucking jump in that thing right
now in the middle of fucking nowhere.

435
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:27,640
And then he can, you know, I, but I,

436
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,240
I actually wouldn't do it because I'd
be too afraid of bear would come out of

437
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,410
nowhere. Fucking mountain
lion or some shit, you know.

438
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,410
But uh, we flew over Lake Mead, who you
always heard blink back in the day. The,

439
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:43,140
um, all the gangsters, you know,

440
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,400
that all the people that the mob would
whack that they'd dump them out there.

441
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,460
So read up a little bit on that.
I don't know.

442
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,730
It's basically the water that got
backed up when they made the Hoover dam,

443
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:54,960
which I was not aware of

444
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,310
because I was thinking like how the
fuck does this lake exist out here?

445
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,900
Oh that's right. Once again,
we fucked with nature and uh,

446
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,790
you know, as I sit there flying a
helicopter over blasting unleaded,

447
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,570
I leaded fuel into the atmosphere
becoming part of the problem.

448
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,500
I'm not pointing any fingers people.
Okay. I'm, I'm as big a problem.

449
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:17,490
Is anybody else?
Right.

450
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:22,491
So that lake is like on either side of
this mountain and in the middle there's

451
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,630
like a little valley that this water
goes through and we fucking went down and

452
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:30,750
flew right up the thing.
Okay.

453
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Like some magnum Pi Shit over
people on jet skis and boats.

454
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,740
It was incredible. It's fucking
incredible. And the coolest things I ever,

455
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,210
I've done since I've
been in the helicopter.

456
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,240
And then we flew up to Zion
National Park and just saw like,

457
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,141
you remember those things,

458
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:49,300
they'd sell you if you are
tourists during the summertime.

459
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,610
If you're in summertime, Campbell,
they'd have all the different colors,

460
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,230
sand and stuff.

461
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,890
They put it in a bottle than your older
brother would come up and shake it up

462
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:59,620
and he'd start crying and be like,
mommy shook it up.

463
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,850
But she was working two t two jobs that
she was too tired to do anything about.

464
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:07,540
It said work it out amongst yourselves.
Um,

465
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,460
yeah, like these, these
cliffs looked like that.

466
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,450
Just these crazy,
unbelievable colors.

467
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:21,130
Unfortunately there was a fire so there
was a lot of smoke and shit, like, uh,

468
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,160
just a lot of haze and stuff.
So it wasn't as vivid,

469
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:28,200
but still it was one of the most
incredible things I've seen. Um,

470
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,430
but it was hot as shit,
man. I out on these,

471
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,300
these Adidas that were all black and
my feet, I had to keep, you know,

472
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,100
like once every like 40 minutes,
you know,

473
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,130
I had to give controls back
to my instructor so I could
like move my feet to a

474
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:52,231
shaded area underneath the GPS system
where I could have my fucking feet cool

475
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:56,350
off. I guess that's why, you know,

476
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:01,060
over in the Persian Gulf army boots
aren't black anymore cause it's your feet

477
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:04,750
get too hot. That's why they're this sort
of the color of Pete Carroll's pants.

478
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,180
Isn't that interesting?
All right.

479
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,760
You know what's even more interesting
than any of that bullshit I was just

480
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:11,870
talking is,
um,

481
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,060

482
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,370

have to suffer through. All right.

00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,420
Didn't sound realistic to me, so I
looked it up. Turns out they were not.

581
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,010
Maybe you can correct Tom, so he doesn't
continue to perpetuate this myth. Listen,

582
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,870
I've known Tom too long
to try to correct them.

583
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,690
I'm sure Jane Fonda had her faults,
but my guests is,

584
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:47,980
she tried her best to be a good,

585
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,050
a good person and to fight for
peace on our planet. Who wrote this?

586
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,000
Jane Fonda might be,

587
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:58,050
she is as heroic in her own
way is some as those on the AH,

588
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Jesus fucking Christ Jesus
Christ on the battlefield.

589
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,630
Oh yeah. A starlet going
to the enemy, you know,

590
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:12,480
as opposed to some guy who's fucking poor.

591
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:16,950
So he has to go to the front
fucking lines. Yeah, yeah.
Maybe. Maybe they're both,

592
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,700
oh yes. Heroic. Yeah, I can see that.

593
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,360
You know what I mean?
Like me doing this podcast.

594
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:28,200
I think in a lot of ways I'm
sort of like a navy seal,

595
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,053
you know?

596
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,920
Um, sir, I understand what
you're saying. I am the,

597
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:41,830
I am a pacifist too.
I really do not.

598
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,880
I don't understand why war is legal.
Okay.

599
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:52,090
And I just think it's the temper Tantrum
of rich people is all a war is okay.

600
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,700
I'm not saying this not
crazy psycho fucking people,

601
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,540
they get in power and need to be
stopped. That there's also that. Okay.

602
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,530
But a lot of times it's just the fucking
land grab or you're going after some

603
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,210
sort of natural resource.
Okay.

604
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,920
And I want to tell you all right,
but having said that,

605
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,620
all right. You know, once
the troops are on the ground,

606
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,040
if you want to fucking bitch about
it, go to your politician. All right?

607
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,270
Go file for a permit to protest 90 miles
away from where any media coverages.

608
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,350
That's the way it's done.
Okay?

609
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:30,690
What you don't do is go to Saddam
Hussein's house and have the guy cookie a

610
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:34,390
fucking meal. You know, while all this
server, it's equivalent and you go, hey,

611
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:39,190
you know he's not even that bad of a
fucking guy, you know? Or maybe you do,

612
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,630
but at no point do you feel as fucking
heroic is some poor fucking bastard.

613
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:48,930
All right. Trying to Piss a top
of a fucking Scorpio blown off.

614
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,773
Yeah.

615
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,230
I think once you're wearing leg warmers,

616
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,460
the though I don't think you're a hero
anymore. Alright. Met a girlfriend on 10

617
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,110
dear Billy balloon tits.

618
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:09,170
I'll have you guys fucking know I'm in
the best Goddamn fucking shape I've been

619
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:13,110
in and I sense, I don't
know how long. All right,

620
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm getting my abs back.
Okay.

621
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,670
I'm getting a little sick of the body
shaming here on the Monday morning

622
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:24,510
podcasts. I go out of my way
to not research on Jane Fonda.

623
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,530
I would think that you guys would do a
little more research on what I'm looking

624
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:33,510
like lately. All right. The last
three weeks. Okay. Listen to your pod,

625
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,390
your last podcast and heard all the leg

626
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,910
trashing dating sites and
Tinder. Well, I may be a dude,

627
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:44,250
but I wanted to offer
my take on the matter.

628
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,540
I have never gotten so much fucking
pussy in my life. I'm kidding.

629
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:49,650
He didn't say all right.

630
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:54,210
Since it's not all serial killers
and fuckboy Weirdos on this sites,

631
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,500
on these sites, fuckboy Weirdos
is, I don't know if this is,

632
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,130
that's gotta be the name of like a
punk band or something. First off,

633
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,810
let's make one thing clear.

634
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,920
There are shitty women on these sites
too. Oh, thank you. God bless you.

635
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,050
Gotta love somebody that
tries to balance it out here.

636
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,270
I know guys get and probably
deserve most of the heat, but girls,

637
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,120
cat fish guys all the
time and these sites,

638
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,390
plus there are the girls on these sites
who only want attention slash money and

639
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:28,030
have no intention of actually going
out and meeting New People. Second,

640
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:32,260
I met my girlfriend of almost a year
on Tinder and we couldn't be happier.

641
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,230
We were initially to admit to our
friends and family that we met this way.

642
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,980
But afterwards I had several people
talk about how they had success,

643
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,050
relationships blossom from these sites.

644
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,350
My cousin met her husband and father
of her child on Christian mingle.com no

645
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,570
joke, Jesus Christ. You know,

646
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:53,240
you'd think that Christians could
come up with a better fucking name,

647
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,220
Christian mingle.

648
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,770
It sounds too much like dingle and you
just picture a priest playing with some

649
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:05,770
fucking poor kids balls. Um, I dunno.

650
00:42:05,771 --> 00:42:07,490
Belt it was,
it was just Catholic church.

651
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,700
It wasn't all the other Christianity
was it by a year. You probably right.

652
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:11,840
Anyways.

653
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,430
And I learned that my two friends met
on bumble after we told them we met on

654
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:21,050
Tinder. Yeah, well that's
all. Every, everybody's on
their fucking phones anyways.

655
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,330
You go to a nightclub and people
are on their phones. All right?

656
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:28,220
You want to meet or you
gotta get in the phone.

657
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,500
You can't be standing there
being an actual person.

658
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,560
I think it freaks these
millennials though. Third,

659
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:40,070
Tinder is a great way to cut through all
the bullshit of blind dating or hitting

660
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:43,880
on chicks who you have nothing in
common with at meat market bars.

661
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,800
Dating sites are also great if you're
single in a new city without many friends

662
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:51,610
to go out with.
Like I was in conclusion piece should,

663
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,070
people should stop all the hate on dating
sites just because their relationship

664
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:58,820
failed or because they never tried it.
Love you and your comedy bill.

665
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:02,490
Come back to Philly and go fuck
yourself. All right. Thank you, sir. Ah,

666
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,420
well there you go. I mean, I think we
shit on these fucking sites enough.

667
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:09,200
It was nice to hear, you know, that was
a, and then a little bit counterpoint.

668
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,820
All right. Isis, uh, bicycling.

669
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,820
Hey, uh, pay Billy White tits.
All right, I'll take that.

670
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,060
Um, have you heard of this story? Of
the couple that went bicycling and Tez?

671
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:28,894
Gica Stan,

672
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,370
they tried to prove that
people are actually good at
heart and ended up getting

673
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:38,230
stabbed to death. What the fuck?
You haven't heard of it yet?

674
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,370
I'll attach an article for you
if you want to try to read it.

675
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,410
Uh, thanks for all the laughs during the
podcast and go fuck yourself. All right.

676
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:54,190
I don't understand why,
you know, oh my God.

677
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,650
Is this real?
It's on people.

678
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,690
people.com.
It looks like the People magazine Logo,

679
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:06,070
but God knows the Internet.

680
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:09,730
You could just cure rate
that and use it for yourself.

681
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,890
American couple who spent life savings
to bike around the world killed in ice in

682
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:17,200
Isis claimed attack.

683
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,153
Yeah.

684
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,760
Oh,
I'm not going to see these.

685
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:25,060
Poor people's names were living out
their dream of traveling the world.

686
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,250
Bicycling tragically,

687
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,280
while out doing what they
loved with five other cyclists.

688
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:34,770
Their quests was cut short when they will
run over and stabbed to death by armed

689
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:37,890
men in tech.
Tez Gica Stan on Sunday.

690
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,630
Uh,

691
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,390
uh,
let's see here.

692
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,640
The woman's parents confirmed in a
statement to CBS news that the couple who

693
00:44:48,641 --> 00:44:50,920
were both 29 were killed in the attack.

694
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,690
Isis claimed responsibility
for the attack to other tours.

695
00:44:55,691 --> 00:45:00,691
Dutch and switched national were
killed while three writers survived NPR

696
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:01,624
reports.

697
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,050
MMM.

698
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,700
These two people started their journey
in 2017 they first biked through Africa,

699
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:14,240
Europe, and Central Asia before
finding themselves and test chicken.

700
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:17,510
Stan using all of their life
savings to fund their trip.

701
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,710
The couple also documented their
travels on the blog. Simple.

702
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Simply cycling the year long bicycling
adventure with the woman and her partner.

703
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:29,530
Yeah.

704
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,580
Uh, we're in June. They were enjoying was
typical of their enthusiasm, blah, blah,

705
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:36,350
blah, blah. Okay,

706
00:45:36,351 --> 00:45:38,900
well where does it say that
they thought the world was nice?

707
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:41,783
MMM,

708
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,310
I don't get this. Any.
All Great. Here's a quote.

709
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:53,610
You watched the news and you read the
papers and you led to believe that the

710
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:56,730
world is a big scary place. Uh, people,

711
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:59,790
the narrative goes are not to
be trusted people or bad people,

712
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:04,260
evil people or ax murderers and monsters.
In worse, he wrote, badness exists.

713
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:08,910
Sure. But even that's quite
rare. By and large, humans
are kind, this is still true.

714
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,680
How many people did they bicycle past
before one continent car ended their

715
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:18,681
fucking life lives a self interest
interested sometimes myopic sometimes,

716
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:21,660
but kind,
generous and wonderful and kind.

717
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:25,410
No greater revelation has come from our
journey than this. Yeah, that's true.

718
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,470
That is true. And they got
killed because, uh, you know,

719
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,190
basically of our foreign fucking policy,
you know,

720
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:36,060
there's a lot of people out there that
don't like fuck at Americans and there's

721
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:38,040
a lot of evil fucking
twisted people out there.

722
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,260
What those people were that killed those
other people who the fuck knows, um,

723
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,610
you know, yeah. This, you know,

724
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,390
this is how you wish the world was in
the way it really is and you have to act

725
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:55,430
accordingly.
All right.

726
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,010
And you have to know when you're
doing something like that,

727
00:46:58,011 --> 00:47:00,950
that there is that chance that
that could fucking happen.

728
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,930
MMM.

729
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,680
Yeah. This, you know. Yeah. Most people.

730
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:10,770
I've always said that just walk around
and try and get a sandwich to try to find

731
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:14,850
love, you know, and we sit down and
you watch TV, you watch the news,

732
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:18,810
you get all fucking hysterical at uh,
but make no mistake.

733
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:21,290
The rest of the really fucked
up people out there at, uh,

734
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:26,560
some of them are in this country and some
of them are not, but they're out there.

735
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,630
Um, too bad. Um,

736
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,360
sounded like they almost
made it around the world

737
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,280
or at least that side of the
world, right? I Dunno. All right.

738
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,790
Boyfriend is fucking up big time.
Okay.

739
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,030
Hey Bill,
lady listening here.

740
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,620
I love when the ladies right in
desperate for some relationship helps.

741
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:51,190
So I'm getting straight to the point.

742
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,250
My boyfriend is about to lose me and
I'm desperate to get through them.

743
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,420
We are 30 bend together two years.
Both want to eventually marry each other.

744
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:05,440
They had babies together, et cetera.
The issue we need to help with his,

745
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:08,260
his ex-girlfriend they
dated for three years,

746
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,230
broke up then remained extremely
close friends. Yeah. That,

747
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:15,940
that's fucking bullshit. They had been
broken up for a little over a year.

748
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:19,120
When I initially came into the picture,
my boyfriend told me about her,

749
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,930
but originally told me they were friends
and completely failed to mention that

750
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:26,590
they were once a couple. All right. Okay,

751
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,890
and you were 28 at the time,
so I'll forgive you.

752
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,740
All right, but now you're 30 baby.
You got to read the tea leaves here.

753
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:37,410
I don't need to read the rest of this.
I actually thought I will.

754
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:41,700
I actually found out from her because
she saw us flirting on Instagram and then

755
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:42,534
messaged me.

756
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:47,490
She's a nice enough woman who now lives
with her boyfriend for the last two

757
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,150
years.

758
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,440
I've met her several times and while
I didn't particularly love the way she

759
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:55,980
looks at my man, I'm not going to
be a bitch about it either. Oh,

760
00:48:55,981 --> 00:48:58,380
you are not being a bitch on any level.

761
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,350
What's your being is too
fucking accommodating.

762
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,990
She and I used to text quite
a bit quite often. Oh God.

763
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:08,610
She's probably milking
you for information,

764
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,840
but that has come to an abrupt stop
because I've been become fed up with how

765
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:17,550
close she and my boyfriend's still are.
Are you going to tell me at night?

766
00:49:17,551 --> 00:49:21,000
You're sitting there watching TV with him
and she calls and then he talks to her

767
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,800
for like 2030 40 minutes.

768
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,920
At the beginning of our relationship
they would hang up constantly.

769
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,210
They lived in California and lived
in Colorado and I lived in Colorado,

770
00:49:30,211 --> 00:49:33,780
so my boyfriend and I were in
a long distance relationship
for over a year until

771
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:36,780
he recently moved to Colorado
to start a life with me. Uh,

772
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,690
when he was still living in California,
he and his ex would go out to eat,

773
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:43,380
go shopping, go to concerts or even
go on road trips together. Now.

774
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:46,530
What are the odds that they weren't
still fucking at that point?

775
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:48,730
Yeah,

776
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,710
they had a shared hobby of photography,

777
00:49:50,711 --> 00:49:55,690
so they would often take photos of each
other as well. Yes. This became an issue,

778
00:49:55,691 --> 00:50:00,100
a huge issue. I would, I would say things
like, I get to you guys are friends,

779
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:03,130
but I feel like you are going on a date,

780
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,570
like things with her when you are dating
me. And he would always reply with,

781
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,660
I wish I could take you,
but I can't because of the distance.

782
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,580
So am I supposed to never go
out and do anything? Oh my God,

783
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:17,140
fuck this guy.

784
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,880
Any would guilt me and then manipulate
the situation until I essentially,

785
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:26,110
it had to be okay with it. Yeah. Okay.
You know, I gotta be honest with you.

786
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:30,260
This is you. This isn't him. He's a cunt.

787
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,970
But I mean you got to fucking come on.

788
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,690
Maybe the fact that I'm reading
your own words out loud right now,

789
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:40,190
you can see how obvious this is. Yeah,
yeah. Fuck this guy. Fast forward to now.

790
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:43,640
Obviously they don't hang out like they
used to do to him moving in Colorado,

791
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,470
but they still text all the time.

792
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,770
I've talked to my boyfriend about this
and how it bothers me. I say, look,

793
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,420
I know you and whoever, we're
very close. She's a good person.

794
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,700
So are you,
I know you guys have a lot of history.

795
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:59,660
I didn't know that I knew about her from
the beginning of our relationship and

796
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:04,550
he wasn't honest with you about it.
Did you ever ask them that?

797
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,200
How come you didn't say you fucking used
to date this person? You shift the cont.

798
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,910
However, what I didn't realize is
how close you two would remain.

799
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,980
Maybe I'm naive, naive, but I thought
that naturally as you and I grew closer,

800
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,440
you and so-and-so would
grow more distant and you,

801
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:25,130
you'd focus only on our relationship
bill and I'm on in my eyes.

802
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,610
I'm pretty cool girlfriend for knowing
that my man and his ex or close friends,

803
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,410
but they are pushing.
