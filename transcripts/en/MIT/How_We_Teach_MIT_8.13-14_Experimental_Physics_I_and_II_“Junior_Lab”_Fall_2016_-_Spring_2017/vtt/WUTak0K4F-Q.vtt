JANET CONRAD: You know, for
me, experimental physics

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.980
is a true joy.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.390
I really love what I do.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.720
I do neutrino physics.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.750
I'm an experimentalist.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.220
I think it is
absolutely fantastic.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.500
And so, I believe that labs
should be really happy places.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.440
And I want the
students to really find

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.290
what they're doing to be really
interesting, to really be

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.300
something that they care about.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.030
And so, that's the
approach that I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.370
like to take when
teaching junior lab.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.530
I don't believe in this,
you break them down

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.730
to build them back up again.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.640
I think that that
doesn't really work.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.030
I really think that what you
do is you very gently lead

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.890
people and shape people.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
You have them trust you, so that
the comments that you're making

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.510
are not taken wrong, that they
understand that that's to make

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.590
them a better physicist.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.930
And I think that's
very important.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.280
So that's sort of my approach.
