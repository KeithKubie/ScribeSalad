00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.260
We’re here at the Republican National Convention where they are about to choose their next leader. Maybe it'll be me!

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.609
Hello followers, Jules here for DNews, and
we’re at the Republican National Convention,

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:12.630
where this week they’re trying to choose
the next leader of the United States. Some

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.630
are born great, some achieve greatness, and
some have greatness thrust upon 'em. When

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.499
you think of a great leader, what qualities
come to mind? In America we tend to think

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.939
of people who are charismatic or eloquent
as strong leaders. Even Donald Trump is called

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.179
a great leader as someone who isn’t afraid
to say what he thinks.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.739
But what does it take to be a Trump, or maybe
more appealingly a “Julius Caesar” or

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.670
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson? Can you become
a great leader, or do you have to be born

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.410
that way? Nature, or nurture? Well, like all
nature vs. nurture topics, it’s a little

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.620
bit of both and nobody really knows. BUT!
A study in the journal Twin Research, which

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.690
is not what it sounds like, or exactly what
it sounds like, asked 247 twin pairs to fill

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.000
out questionnaires about their behavior to
determine who among them were leaders. What

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.850
they found that was that more than half of
the traits that define a leader, (originality,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.369
popularity, sociability, judgement, aggressiveness,
desire to excel, humor, cooperativeness, liveliness,

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.340
and athletic ability), those were possibly
able to be passed down genetically, or “heritable”.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.460
Now, that’s a pretty bold claim to make,
so we’re going to take it with a grain of

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.920
salt, but it does at least point to some leadership
qualities being inborn.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.149
But what about the other half of the traits,
like persistence, or confidence? Well, another

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.590
study, yes there’s always another study,
found leaders can inspire other to be confident,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.880
and thus "imbue their subordinates with confidence
and creativity,". So leaders can potentially

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.700
teach leadership qualities to their followers.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.770
Yet another recent study published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.789
found that a good leader's brain actually
synchronizes with their followers brains as

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.750
they communicate! The experiment took a few
small groups of people, and scanned the blood

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.009
flow in their brain when they started talking
to each other. Mid-conversation, leaders emerged

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.860
in each group, and their left temporo-parietal
junctions, which is where brain-waves are

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.850
converted into speech, synced up with their
followers, whereas the followers weren’t

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.969
as synced with each other. Using this phenomenon,
researchers could predict the same effect

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.680
in future leader-follower pairs just by looking
at the brain. It’s not that leaders communicate

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.650
more, but the quality of their communication
is higher. As the researchers said, "leaders

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.090
emerge because they are able to say the right
things at the right time."

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.050
But… there’s one big caveat. When we talk
about these qualities, we’re talking about

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.780
studies that are almost exclusively based
on Americans. Yeah. In fact, a 1997 review

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.090
of studies on leadership found that 98-percent
of them were just American-focused. The studies

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.459
chose to emphasize American traits like: leaders
are superior and followers are subordinate.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.610
Or that individualism are prized, and collectivism
is shunned. But the fact is, that’s not

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.860
universally true in all cultures.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.489
The Essentials of Psychology states the best
leaders simply understand the dynamic between

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.330
leaders and group members -- whatever that
may be -- collective or individual, hands-on

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.930
or hands-off, authoritarian or egalitarian.
This is supported by the 1995 book "Emotional

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.760
Intelligence," which refers to the idea that
true leaders have the "capacity to be aware

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.390
of, control, and express [their] emotions,
and to handle interpersonal relationships

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.920
judiciously and empathetically" Being able
to judge interactions with others and handle

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.799
those complex interpersonal relationships
well, will make a pretty-good leader into

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.510
a great leader.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.560
Leadership is seemingly a more nuanced but
internal process, and while it isn’t culture

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.790
specific, the differences all stem from social
differences in interaction, not the interactions

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.750
themselves. Basically, if you’re a great
leader, then it’s because you “get”

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.560
people, and also because you’ve synced your
brain with theirs. Which is a little creepy

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.159
to be honest. Stay out of my brain.
