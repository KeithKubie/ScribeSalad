00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:05.670 align:start position:0%
either make the absolute worst thing

something<00:14:08.490><c> guys</c><00:14:08.640><c> I</c><00:14:09.000><c> think</c><00:14:09.690><c> that</c><00:14:09.839><c> would</c><00:14:09.930><c> be</c>

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
something guys I think that would be
 

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:12.530 align:start position:0%
something guys I think that would be

what's<00:14:12.660><c> the</c><00:14:12.810><c> good</c><00:14:12.990><c> I</c><00:14:13.020><c> think</c><00:14:13.350><c> it</c><00:14:13.410><c> would</c><00:14:13.500><c> turn</c>

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:13.590 align:start position:0%
what's the good I think it would turn
 

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.190 align:start position:0%
what's the good I think it would turn
out<00:14:13.740><c> something</c><00:14:13.920><c> bad</c><00:14:14.190><c> but</c><00:14:14.490><c> uh</c><00:14:14.720><c> yeah</c><00:14:15.720><c> I</c><00:14:15.990><c> know</c><00:14:16.050><c> I</c>

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
out something bad but uh yeah I know I
 

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
out something bad but uh yeah I know I
think<00:14:16.350><c> it</c><00:14:16.650><c> is</c><00:14:16.740><c> one</c><00:14:16.890><c> of</c><00:14:16.950><c> those</c><00:14:17.040><c> things</c><00:14:17.280><c> where</c>

think it is one of those things where
 

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.550 align:start position:0%
think it is one of those things where
it's<00:14:17.610><c> like</c><00:14:17.790><c> he</c><00:14:17.940><c> probably</c><00:14:18.510><c> yeah</c><00:14:18.930><c> if</c><00:14:19.230><c> only</c><00:14:19.440><c> he</c>

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's like he probably yeah if only he
