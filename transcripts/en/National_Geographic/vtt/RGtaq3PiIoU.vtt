00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.430
So what's the science we used to study
the ancient migratory paths of your

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.760
Ancestors?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.210
It's something called population genetics, and it
helps us to piece together how humans

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.989
populated the earth.

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.599
Here's how it works.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.339
Historically people close to each other
tended to share more of those genetic

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.599
markers â€“ the little DNA typos passed on from
parents to their kids - then they did with

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.490
people on the other side of the world.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.050
Makes sense, after all, who were they more
likely to meet fall in love with and have

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.079
babies with -

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.200
the people living nearby.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.390
Over time, this created regional patterns
of genetic variation, so the people

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.810
living in, say, northern Spain

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.759
had more markers in common with each
other

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.320
than they did with people in Indonesia.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.540
These regional patterns of variation
allow us to track the migratory paths of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.170
your ancestors.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.560
By looking at where in the world your
markers are found, we can figure out

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.360
where you came from

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.930
and by looking at the order in which
these markers have occurred over time

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.320
and where in the world they originated,
we can actually track the journey your

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.230
ancestors followed from an African
homeland

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.740
to where you came from more recently.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.990
How do we find these markers in the
billions of a's g's c's and t's?

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.930
It's not easy.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.600
It's a little like finding needles in a
haystack.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.009
That's because when a mom and a dad
have had a baby, their chromosomes are

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.260
copied and passed on to their child, but

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.720
not in a straightforward way.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.220
Instead, mom and dad's chromosomes are
shuffled when they are passed on to their

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.950
kids.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.200
Imagine a deck of cards containing only
Hearts,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.280
and another

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.800
containing only spades.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.270
Now shuffle them up

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.110
and look at your hand.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.180
It's going to be a mix of hearts and spades - 
the cards your parents have

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.789
but in a different combination.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.260
This makes tracking our markers really
hard for most of our chromosomes,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.160
but we found a shortcut.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.040
There's one of your twenty three pairs
of chromosomes that gets passed on

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.350
virtually unchanged it's called the
Y Chromosome.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.970
If we look at your Y chromosome, the
markers that your ancestors left you from

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.829
thousands of years ago should still be
in the same order.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.720
But there's a catch to the Y
Chromosome, it exists only in males

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.629
passed on directly from father to son.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.409
In fact, it's the Y chromosome that
makes the male a male.

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.509
There's another kind of DNA

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.289
located in a different part of the cells
it's only passed on from the mothers to

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:25.510
Children, 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.599
it's called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA
for short.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.979
It's much smaller than the DNA that makes up
our twenty three pairs of chromosomes,

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.099
but since

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.549
it contains the same kind of markers,
the little genetic typos that pass

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.519
unshuffled from generation to generation

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.509
on the maternal line.

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.619
So by looking at markers on the Y
chromosome and mitochondrial DNA

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:52.009
we can connect people alive today to
ancestors have lived tens of thousands

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.729
of years ago.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.339
Over the last several years the
Genographic Project has studied the Y

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:02.069
chromosomes and the mitochondrial DNA
of more than half a million people and

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.249
we now know that everyone on earth
belongs to one of hundreds of distinct

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.809
groups of related people based on which
markers they have on their Y chromosome

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:12.430
Or mitochondrial DNA.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.889
We call these groups haplogroups.

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.129
Each person in these groups traces their
descent from a common ancestor.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.239
Haplogroups - your branch on the human
family tree.
