00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.640
You are filling up
trays to make ice cubes.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.250
You notice that each tray holds
the exact same amount of water

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.580
but has a different number
of ice cubes that it makes.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.660
The blue tray makes 8
equally sized ice cubes.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
The pink tray makes 16
equally sized ice cubes.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.580
So let me draw the
blue tray here.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.960
The blue tray, I'll
draw it like this.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.140
That is not blue.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.690
Let me draw it in blue.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.450
So the blue tray makes 8.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.830
So this is the blue
tray right over here.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.920
And let me draw it and
divide it into 8 sections

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250
to represent the 8
equally sized ice cubes.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.357
And I'll try to do it.

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:41.940
So, let's see.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.470
That's about in
half, and then I'm

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.630
going to put each of those
in half, and then each

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.660
of those in half.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380
So there we go.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.887
This is pretty close to
8 equally sized cubes,

00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:57.970
except for this one there.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.260
Let me actually make it
a little bit cleaner.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.267
So there's the half,
half, half, half, half.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.350
All right, so this is
looking a little bit better,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.390
so 8 equally sized ice cubes.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.880
This is the blue tray.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.970
Now, the pink tray takes
the same amount of water,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.430
so I'm going to make it
the exact same length.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.320
So the pink tray is
the exact same length,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.791
but it has 16 equally
sized ice cubes.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.290
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.970
to make these same
sections here,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.960
but then I'm going to cut
these sections in two.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.760
So that's 8, and to 16, I
got to divide these into two.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.430
So almost done.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.876
This is the hard part.

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:42.730
That last one wasn't that neat.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.800
Almost done.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.910
All right.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.450
There we go.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850
Set up the problem.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.970
Now, you put 3 ice cubes from
the blue tray into your drink.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.340
So, let's do that.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.430
So, 1, 2, 3 ice cubes from
the blue tray into your drink.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.230
How many ice cubes
from the pink tray

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.039
would you need to equal the
same exact amount of ice?

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.539
So there's a bunch
of ways to do it.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.940
We can think about
it with numbers,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.009
or we can think
about it visually.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.800
Let's first think
about it with numbers.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.150
So how much of this
tray have I pulled out?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.350
Well, I have 8 equally sized
cubes and I took 3 of them out,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.210
so this literally
represents 3/8.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.890
So the question
is 3 over 8, if I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.490
take 3 out of 8 equally
sized cubes, that's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.220
the same quantity
as taking what?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.710
I want to do that in white.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.870
That's the same
quantity as taking

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.440
how many cubes out of 16, out
of 16 equally sized cubes?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.110
Well, let's look at
it over here visually.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.950
So if we want the exact
same amount of ice,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.200
so we're gonna have
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.135
We have 6/16, so this
is equal to 6/16.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.180
Now, does that
make actual sense?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.590
Well, sure.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.660
To go from 3/8 to 6/16, you
multiply the numerator by 2,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.770
and you multiply the
denominator by 2.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.910
Now, does that
actually make sense?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.720
Well, sure it does.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.420
Because for the
pink ice tray, you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.050
have 2 ice cubes for every 1
that you have in the blue ice

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.960
tray.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.709
So the blue ice tray, you
have 8 equally sized cubes.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.250
Well, for each of
those, you're going

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.580
to have 2 in the pink
ice tray, so you multiply

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.730
by 2 to have 16
equally sized cubes.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.360
And out of the blue tray,
if you take 3, well,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.650
that equivalent amount
for each of those cubes,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.600
you would get 2 from
the pink ice tray.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.015
So you're multiplying
by 2 right over there.

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:52.640
So the answer to the
question, how many

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.223
ice cubes from the
pink tray would you

00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:55.780
need to equal the
same amount of ice?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.080
Well, that is you
would need 6 cubes.
