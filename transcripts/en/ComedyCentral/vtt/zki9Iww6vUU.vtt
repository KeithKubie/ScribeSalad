00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:03.637
The gay dating app Grindr
released a bunch

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.105
of very naughty emoji this week.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.075
They're pretty LGBT cute.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.644
I know. They are.
They're pretty great.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.646
Um, I'm not gay--
not that cool--

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.584
but people do tell me
that I am allowed on Twitter.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.786
-(laughter)
-So...

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.221
-Cool or gay?
-HARDWICK: Gay.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.657
-Okay.
-HARDWICK: Not... Yeah. Uh...

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.492
So let me just translate this
just a little bit.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.794
Okay, this log with a sunrise is

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.430
-for when you have morning wood,
all right? -(applause)

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:34.134
This emoji of a peach
with a knife and fork

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:37.504
is for when you're talking
about for eating (bleep).

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.072
(laughter)

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.242
All right,
now these all look dirty,

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.178
but emoji can have
many interpretations.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.580
So comedians, what is
a safe-for-work explanation

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.415
of one
of these new Grindr emoji?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:49.816
Jessica, let's start with you.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.318
Yeah. The guy in the leather,
um--

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.187
he is reminding you that

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.622
you have Village People
in your area.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:57.591
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.560
Lonely Village People
in your area

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:00.761
-ready to meet up. Points.
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.463
Sam.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.732
Uh, the bearded guy here
is a reminder

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.402
that Zach Galifianakis has just
been attacked by a grizzly.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.603
Okay, points.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:10.871
Points.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.540
-Brian.
-The eggplant

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.176
must be this long
to get into my casser-hole.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.276
All right, points. Very good.
