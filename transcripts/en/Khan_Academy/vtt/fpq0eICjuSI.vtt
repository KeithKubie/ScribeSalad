00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.510
We've already talked about how
a benzene ring is very-- let

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.380
me draw a better looking benzene
ring than that-- that

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.220
a benzene ring is very stable,
because it's aromatic.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.510
That these electrons in these
pi orbitals that form these

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.090
double bonds, they're actually
just not in this double bond,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.140
they can keep swapping.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.140
This one can go here.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.010
This one can go there.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.160
That one can go there.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.490
Actually, they don't
go back and forth.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.280
They actually just completely
go around the entire ring.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.750
And when a molecule is aromatic,
it stabilizes it.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.180
But we've seen examples of
aromatic, or actually, in

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.750
particular, we've seen examples
of benzene rings that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.240
have other things bumping off
of them, whether they're

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.160
halides or whether they're OH
groups, and what we want to do

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.810
in this video is think about how
that might happen, how do

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.890
things get added on
to a benzene ring.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.360
We're going to learn about
electrophilic aromatic

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.590
substitution.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.080
Let me write that down.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:08.690
Electrophilic aromatic
substitution.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.260
And you might say, well, Sal,
you just said you're adding

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.020
things to the ring.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.700
But the reality is that there's
six hydrogens here.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.480
There's one hydrogen, two
hydrogens, three hydrogens,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.170
four hydrogens, five hydrogens
and six hydrogens.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.910
They're always there.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.725
If you don't draw them, they
are implicitly there.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:32.080
So what we're actually doing,
when you add a chlorine or a

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.580
bromine or an OH group, it's
actually replacing one of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.360
these hydrogens.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.030
That's why it is substitution.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.480
It's aromatic, because we're
dealing with a benzene ring.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.240
We're dealing with an aromatic
molecule, and we're going to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.770
see that we need a really strong
electrophile in order

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.510
to do this.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.710
Let's think about this
how this will happen.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.980
Before I do that, let me just
copy and paste this, because I

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.980
don't want to have
to redraw this.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.690
Let me just copy it,
just like that.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.550
So let's say we have a really
strong electrophile.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.830
And I'll give you particular
cases in the next few videos,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.530
so you can better visualize
what a really strong

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.850
electrophile is.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.380
But just from the word itself,
electrophile, you could

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.920
imagine it's something
that loves electrons.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.690
It wants electrons really,
really, really,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.500
really, really badly.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.930
And usually, it has
a positive charge.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.180
So it wants electrons badly.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.110
And actually, let me
make it very clear.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.040
Instead of saying it wants
electrons badly, because when

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.160
you're talking about
electrophiles or nucleophiles,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.060
you're actually talking about
how good something is

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.240
reacting, you're not actually
talking about the actual

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.300
energies involved.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.530
Let me put it a different way:
good at getting electrons.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.000
Really, really, really,
really, really

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.980
good at getting electrons.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.140
So what would happen?

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.310
We already said this is
already pretty stable.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.090
These guys, these electrons,
these pi electrons can

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.170
circulate all around.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.210
If it bumps just in the right
way to something that's really

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.410
good at getting electrons, what
might happen-- let's say

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.295
we have this electron
right here.

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:15.910
The way we've drawn it, it's
on this carbon right here.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.390
Obviously, the carbon is just
at the intersection.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.860
I never drew the carbon.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.060
But if this electrophile,
which is really good at

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.850
getting electrons, bumps in
just the right way, this

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.040
electron can go to that
electrophile.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.440
And then it would be left with--
so let me copy and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.930
paste our original molecule.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.490
So then what would
we be left with?

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.030
So we no longer have this
bond right here.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.570
It has now been bonded
to the electrophile.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.220
Let me make it clear.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.170
We had this electron
right here.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.320
That electron is still on this
carbon right over here at this

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.310
intersection, but the other end
of it, the other electron,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.520
has now been given to the
electrophile, the thing that's

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.130
good at getting them.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.085
So the other side has been given
to this electrophile.

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:11.050
This electrophile now
gained an electron.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.940
So it had a positive charge,
now it will be neutral.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.279
And once again, I'll show you
a particular, or several

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.730
particular cases of this
in the next few videos.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.850
Let me just make it clear.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.250
So this bond, you could now view
it as being this bond.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.150
Now, this carbon right over
here, this lost an electron.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.830
So if it lost an electron,
it will now

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.135
have a positive charge.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.350
Now, this is hard to do to a
resonance-stabilized molecule,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.370
to a benzene ring.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.100
So that, once again, and I said,
and I'm being a little

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.840
bit repetitive, this has
to be a very good

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.950
electrophile to do it.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.790
But once this is there, this
is a actually relatively

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.490
stable carbocation.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.330
The reason why it is, it's only
a secondary carbocation,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.180
but it's actually a
resonance-stabilized

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.590
carbocation because this
electron right

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.670
can be given to that.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.130
If this electron goes there,
then it would look like this.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.340
Let me redraw it.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.790
I'll draw the resonance
structures quickly.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.410
You have your hydrogen.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.490
You have your electrophile.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.510
That's not an electrophile
anymore, but you have that E

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.790
that's now been added.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.310
You have that hydrogen.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.020
You have a double bond here.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.410
Let me draw a little
bit neater.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.340
You have this hydrogen.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.130
You have this hydrogen, this
hydrogen and this hydrogen.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.780
What I said is, this
is stabilized.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.220
So an electron here can actually
jump over here.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.030
So if this electron jumps over
here, the double bond is now

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.700
over there If that goes over
there like that, the double

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.490
bond is now over here.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.750
Now this guy lost his electron
and it would

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.020
have a positive charge.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.580
And then that is resonance
stabilized.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.030
It can either go back to this
guy, or this electron over

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.750
here can jump over there.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.570
Let me redraw the whole
thing over again.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.960
Let me draw all the hydrogens.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.300
This right here, you have
the E and the hydrogen.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.340
You have a hydrogen here,
hydrogen here, hydrogen here,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.280
hydrogen here.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.290
And normally you don't worry
about the hydrogens, but one

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.950
of the hydrogens is going to
be nabbed later on in this

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.160
mechanism, so I want to draw all
the hydrogens just so you

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.730
know that they are there.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.440
But as I said, this is
resonance stabilized.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.890
If this electron right here
jumps over there, then this

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.720
double bond is now
this double bond.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.810
And now this guy over here lost
an electron, so it would

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.070
have a positive charge.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.030
And again, once you had this
double bond up here, this

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.020
double bond up there is
that double bond.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.170
So we can go back and
forth between these.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.050
The electrons are just swishing
around the ring.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.460
So it's not going to be maybe as
great as the situation that

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.830
we had when we had a nice
benzene ring that was

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.150
completely aromatic.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.750
The electrons can just go around
the p-orbitals, around

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.330
and around the ring, stabilize
the structure, but this is

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.220
still a relatively stable
carbocation, because the

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.610
electrons can move around.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.790
You can kind of view it as a
positive charge that gets

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.970
dispersed between this carbon,
this carbon, and that carbon

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.130
over there.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.500
As I said, it's still not
a great situation.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.130
The molecule wants to go back to
being aromatic, wants to go

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.230
to that really stable state.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.770
And the way it can go back to
that really stable state is

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.020
somehow an electron can be
added to this thing.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.040
And the way that an electron can
be added to this thing is,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:46.030
if we have some base flying
around, and that base nabs

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.350
this proton, this proton right
here that's on the same carbon

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.910
as where the electrophile
is attached.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.720
So if this base nabs a proton,
so it just nabs the hydrogen

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.260
nucleus, then that electron that
the hydrogen had, that

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.040
electron-- let me do that
in a different color.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.990
That electron that the hydrogen
had right over there

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.640
could then be returned to
this carbon up there.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.190
And maybe that makes it
a little confusing

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.120
when I cross lines.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.020
It can be returned to that
carbon right there.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.550
So what would it look
like after that?

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.000
After that it would
look like this.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.850
Let me draw my-- so if that
happened, and we drew it in

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:33.010
yellow, we have our
six-carbon ring.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.210
Let me draw all the hydrogens.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.240
What did I do that in?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.169
It likes like a slightly green
color I did that in.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.515
So I have all the hydrogens
on that ring.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.360
Now, I have to be careful.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.430
This hydrogen right there, just
the nucleus of it, got

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.180
nabbed by this base.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.600
So that hydrogen has now been
nabbed by the base.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.500
This electron right
here has now been

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.100
given to this hydrogen.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.540
So that electron has now been
given to this hydrogen, and

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.070
then the other electron in the
pair is still with the base.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.440
So now this is the conjugate
acid of the base.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.200
It has gained a proton.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.000
And on this carbon, right here,
we just have what was

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.250
the electrophile.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.670
And I'll do the same colors,
just to make it clear.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.260
What was the electrophile
right over there, this

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.650
bond is this bond.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.570
And then finally, we had-- and
I'll color code it here just

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:33.990
to make it clear.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.380
We had this double bond here,
which is this double bond

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.620
right over here.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.610
We had this double bond.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.140
We had this double bond, which
is that double bond there.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.630
And then this electron gets
returned to this top carbon

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.470
right here.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:55.120
So that electron-- let me make
it very, very clear.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.280
So the bond and that
electron are

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.140
returned to that top carbon.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.290
So that we have the bond and
that electron returned to that

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.330
top carbon.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.520
That top carbon is now
going to be neutral.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.540
And once again, we are
resonance stabilized.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.040
One thing I forgot, just to make
the charge stabilized,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.470
maybe this base had a negative
charge to begin with.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.520
It didn't have to.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.830
But if this base did have a
negative charge to begin with,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.050
it now gave an electron
to the hydrogen,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.620
so it is now neutral.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.780
And this should make sense
because before we had a plus

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.660
charge and a negative charge,
and then when everything

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.730
reacted, everything
is neutral again.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.490
The total net charge is zero.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.060
But this is the electrophilic
aromatic substitution.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.490
We substituted one
of the hydrogens.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.560
We substituted this hydrogen
right here with this

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.390
electrophile, or what was
previously an electrophile,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.280
but then once it got an
electron, it's just kind of a

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.650
group that is now on
the benzene ring.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.030
And by going through this little
convoluted process, we

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.780
finally got to another aromatic
molecule that now has

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.680
this E group on it.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.940
In the next video, I'll show
you this with particular

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.650
examples of electrophiles
and bases.
