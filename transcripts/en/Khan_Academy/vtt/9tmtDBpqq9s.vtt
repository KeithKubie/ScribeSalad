00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.320
We have negative 3/4
minus 7/6 minus 3/6.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.790
And there's many
ways to do this.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.520
But it immediately
jumps out at me

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.400
that these last two numbers
have a 6 in the denominator.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.270
So I'm going to worry
about these first.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.390
I'm going to view this as
negative 7/6 minus 3/6.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.540
So if we have negative
7/6 minus 3/6,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.930
that's going to be the same
thing as negative 7 minus 3

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.620
over 6.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.790
And of course, we
have this negative 3/4

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.900
out front that
we're going to add

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.110
to whatever we get over here.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.980
So this is these two terms
that I'm adding together.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.770
Negative 7 minus
3 is negative 10.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.610
So it's negative 10 over 6.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.230
And then I'm going to have
to add that to negative 3/4.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.620
And now I have to worry about
finding a common denominator.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.800
Let me write that so
they have a similar size.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.390
So now I have to worry about
finding a common denominator.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.690
What is the smallest number that
is a multiple of both 4 and 6?

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.620
Well, it might jump out
at you that it's 12.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.040
You can literally just go
through the multiples of 4.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890
Or you could look at
the prime factorization

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.850
of both of these numbers.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.308
And what's the
smallest number that

00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:20.950
has all of the prime
factors of both of these?

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.380
So you need two 2s, and
you need a 2 and a 3.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.570
So if you have two 2s and a
3, that's 4 times 3 is 12.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.520
So let's rewrite this
as something over 12

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.500
plus something over 12.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.000
Well, to get your
denominator from 4 to 12,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.860
you have to multiply by 3.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.410
So let's multiply our
numerator by 3 as well.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.120
So if we multiply
negative 3 times 3,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.130
you're going to have negative 9.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.260
And to get your
denominator from 6 to 12,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.270
you have to multiply by 2.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.322
So let's multiply our
numerator by 2 as well so

00:01:58.322 --> 00:02:00.280
that we don't change the
value of the fraction.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.890
So that's going
to be negative 20.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.490
And now we're ready to add.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.380
Our common denominator is 12.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.690
And so this is going to be
negative 9 plus negative 20,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.531
or we could even write
that as minus 20,

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:18.780
over 12, which is equal to--
and we deserve a drum roll now.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.980
This is negative 29 over 12.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.980
And 29 is a prime
number, so it's not

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.090
going to share any common
factors other than 1 with 12.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.794
So we also have this in
the most simplified form.
