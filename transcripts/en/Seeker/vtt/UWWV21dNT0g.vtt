00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.786
Don't forget to wear
a jacket, or you're

00:00:01.786 --> 00:00:03.900
going to catch a
cold-- or will you?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.580
Hey, friends, Laci Green here.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.288
Ai, ai, ai, it's that
time of year again.

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:15.730
Everyone's getting sick,
including me, sadly,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.730
still getting over a
little something something.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.980
On Facebook, our "D News"
friend Kristi Jimerson asks,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.605
could you guys do a video on why
we get sick in the winter more

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.210
than summer?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.626
I've done some
research, and there

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:26.640
doesn't seem to be
any definitive answers

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.000
and I'm really curious now.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.941
Me too, Kristi, me too.

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.440
It's conventional
wisdom that people

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.780
tend to get sick more
during the colder months.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.180
In fact, the word "influenza"
comes from the aged

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.840
Italian phrase,
"influenza di freddo,"

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.899
or "influence of the cold."

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.940
There's an odd conundrum
here, because scientists

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090
have found again and again
that being in the cold

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.040
doesn't actually make us sick
or more prone to getting sick.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.604
So that part is just a myth.

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:50.770
Even when we're shivering,
our core body temperature

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.690
stays the same.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.504
This is thanks to the
magic of homeostasis.

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:56.920
So if it's not the cold that's
making us sick, what is it?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.090
The explanation
scientists have to offer

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.186
is that when it's cold outside,
people are crowded indoors.

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:04.769
All throughout the year at any
given time, a few people around

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.755
you are infected with some
kind of contagious viruses

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:09.205
or bacteria, even though they
may not have any symptoms.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:12.040
But in the winter, we're in
closer contact with them,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.860
which makes it infinitely easier
for those bacteria and viruses

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.200
to hop from person to person.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.540
We're also in closed
air systems inside,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.210
so airborne circulate
through our homes, offices,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.030
and schools, which brings me
to my second perpetrator--

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.540
schools, or more
specifically, germy, sneezy,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.012
snot-nosed children.

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:30.720
A huge study at the
University of Warwick

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.554
pegged children as the top
spreaders of infection.

00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:34.970
It's because they
have the highest

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.820
number of daily social contacts.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.090
Children go back to school,
then they're kept indoors,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.820
with their germy peers right
around the cold season.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.350
So they infect each
other, and then

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.720
they infect their parents,
who infect their coworkers.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.150
And before you know it, the
whole freaking world is sick.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.590
The last contributing
factor pertains to the flu

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.460
specifically.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.150
Different microbes
and viruses all

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.530
survive and transmit at
different temperatures.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.370
And for the flu, it
transmits into cold.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.370
At 41 degrees Fahrenheit,
the flu virus is most stable.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.220
It's ready to infect
you and wreak havoc

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.390
on your body and life.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.650
But as it becomes warmer, it's
harder and harder for the virus

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.340
to transmit.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.060
In fact, once the
temperature hits 86 degrees,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.120
the flu virus can't be
transmitted anymore.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690
So there you go-- the key to
avoid getting sick this winter

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.732
is to avoid all contact
with other human beings.

00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:20.690
Just stay in your basement
this holiday season,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.080
like the good little internet
citizen that you are.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.962
Or maybe just head off to your
own private tropical island.

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:27.420
Thanks for joining
me for "D News."

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.060
Hope this helped answer
your question, Kristi.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.680
If you folks have any other
video topics you'd like to see,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.519

or on Twitter at D News.

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.560
And we'll check them out.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.380
Bye, bye.
