00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:08.570
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Google

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.190
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.190
Today, we are joined
by John Palfrey, who's

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.775
with us to discuss his
latest book, "Bibliotech: Why

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:18.550
Libraries Matter More Than
Ever in the Age of Google."

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.930
In "Bibliotech," Palfrey
investigates the purpose

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.730
in future libraries, when
information is broadly

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880
available on the internet.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.690
In addition to
"Bibliotech," Palfrey

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.580
is the author of
several books, including

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.680
"Born Digital" and "Interop."

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.940
He's the head of the school
Phillips Andover Academy.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.890
Previously, at Harvard,
he led the effort

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.390
to reorganize the Harvard
Law School Library,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.980
and he's the founding member
of the Digital Public Library

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.360
of America.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.105
Please join me in
welcoming John Palfrey.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.810
JOHN PALFREY: Thank you all for
making time on this busy day.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.760
And Brendan, thank you
for organizing this

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.580
and for inviting me here
to Google in Cambridge.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.350
I am thrilled to have a chance
to talk about this new book

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.800
called "Bibliotech."

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.540
Its subtitle, in fact, is
"Why Libraries Matter More

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.420
Than Ever in the
Age of Google" so I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.870
feel it's fitting to be making
this particular argument here

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.410
at Google.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.076
And since it came out
just two days ago,

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:13.950
I'm thrilled to be
doing it right here

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.250
for the first official
book talk with all of you.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.200
And I hope that especially
if I say anything

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.900
that's inappropriate or
provocative about what you're

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530
up to that you will push
back and ask the questions

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.120
in the conversational part.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.980
On some level, this book
is really a love letter

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.680
to libraries and to librarians.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.880
It's an argument that says that
we need these institutions more

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.640
than ever at this
moment in our history.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.370
Not despite what all of you are
doing at Google, but in part,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.240
because of it.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.640
And to try to make the argument
that both physical libraries as

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.010
well as digital
forms of libraries

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.700
are crucial to our democracy.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.780
That's the entire
argument right there.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.830
I'm not burying the lead.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.510
Just putting it out there.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.370
And I will then try to make
that argument in the course

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.960
of the next 20 or so minutes.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
The inspiration, in
a way, for this book

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.560
was I worked down the
street at Harvard Law School

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.610
for a long time and was the
director of its library--

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.820
the law library-- which
is, in many respects,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.090
the largest and biggest
law library in the world.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.880
And one of the items in the
collection is this image.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.740
I doubt you'll be able
to guess what it is,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.299
but it's the personal library of
Oliver Wendell Holmes jr., who

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.340
was on the Supreme Court.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.976
He was also a professor
at our law school.

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:26.350
And this picture
actually depicts

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.300
his library-- is
personal library--

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.270
in Washington, DC, when he was
on the United States Supreme

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.900
Court.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.260
And often, I think about
this particular picture

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.290
because it seems like such a
lovely place to sit and think

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.810
and to do your work.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.820
But of course, it's also,
perhaps, anachronistic,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.000
particularly with kids
who are growing up

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.480
in this particular age.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.390
I work now at a boarding
school-- Andover.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.710
And I'm grateful to have a
few of our fine graduates

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.676
here and Google staff
members as well.

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:54.050
And if you think
about the kids--

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.030
AUDIENCE: And fellow
Exeter graduates.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.520
JOHN PALFREY: Oh my gosh.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.020
All right.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.650
Fellow Exeter graduates, too.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.290
We're a purple room between
the red and the blue.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.690
But if you think about the
kids who are educating today--

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.690
and I also have
small kids-- you can

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.680
imagine that this particular
vision of what a room might

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.370
be like with all of
these books around it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.130
might not be exactly that
they have in mind as a space

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.990
to work.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.220
When I worked at the
Harvard Law School Library,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.590
we had a beautiful reading room.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.560
And it was full almost
all the time with kids

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.310
to elbow to elbow.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.770
And as they were
working in there,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.480
and they were almost always
doing what some of you

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.980
are doing.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.800
They had a laptop.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840
They had a water or
coffee or something.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.930
But almost never did they
do something like this

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.884
to actually pull a book
down off the shelves.

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:35.300
They were actually
in the space, I

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.569
think, to be with one
another in a social space.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.110
And they wanted to
be in the library.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.193
They wanted the reference
librarians and so forth.

00:03:41.193 --> 00:03:42.510
But the act was not doing this.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.260
They weren't walking
around to the shelves

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.380
and pulling something off.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.879
So the thought
experiment, in a way,

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.610
is what's a version of
this thoughtful space

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.130
that we will create for
kids who are growing up now,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.590
even if they don't
necessarily associate

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.090
this kind of a library with
the way in which they want

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.600
to be connecting with ideas.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.100
Now, I suspect that
many people will

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.920
continue to build
libraries like this one.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.660
But it will almost be books as
furniture or collectible items

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.700
or something that are
there as tangible items

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.617
as opposed to the
references they will get to.

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:10.950
But I think it's very important
that we actually come up

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.540
with an affirmative
version of what

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.339
we think would be a great space
for learning and for studying.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.370
But also note the importance
of the physical library

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.319
and the continuing
importance of that.

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.860
Because we're here
in Cambridge, I've

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.600
got a picture up of the
Boston Public Library.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.880
So the history of
libraries, I think,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.870
is a very important
piece of the story.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.690
In 1852, a philanthropist
named Joshua Bates

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.280
agreed to give $50,000
to the city of Boston

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.760
to create the first big public
library actually in the world.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.660
And the idea of having a space
where anybody in the city

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.960
can come free to
all to get access

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.510
to information or knowledge
seemed radical at the time,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.490
even though now it seems
completely obvious.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.620
But it actually
started here in Boston

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.030
in a really meaningful way.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.100
And I think the most
important part of this image

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.030
is the notion of free
to all-- the idea

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.830
that anybody can get access
to information at any time

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.310
without anybody else
making that choice for us.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.384
I think that's a cornerstone
piece of democracy.

00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:08.800
And just like that reading
room that I showed from Holmes,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.200
what will the physical library
be like in a digital era.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.000
I think it goes without saying
that part of the backdrop

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.430
here is the notion of knowledge
moving to the cloud-- the idea

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.550
that the vast majority
of time, instead

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.980
of going like this to pull
down a book, kids go like this

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.330
and pull something up.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.730
Ordinarily, going on
their Android device right

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.800
to their Google browser
and typing it in

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.840
and finding the information
that has been stored up here.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.870
And this is one of the ways in
which the book is in a sense,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.870
although not directly, it's
concerned with the notion

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.867
that the people who are
holding the information

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:45.950
are in the private sector.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.546
And that includes
you guys and it

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:51.760
includes lots of others who are
the holders of information when

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.500
it's in the cloud-based
environment.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.360
There isn't really
a public option

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.370
when it comes to the
cloud at the moment--

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.670
at least not one that's
a significant player

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.380
in the field.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.420
And actually that is one
of the arguments, which

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.310
is to think about how
do we ensure that there

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.910
is a public option in addition
to the private spaces that

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.440
are developing online?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.740
I think it becomes most acute
in the context of books.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.520
Over the last several
years, librarians

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.010
have been fretting greatly about
the future of their ability

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.220
to be libraries in
that classic way

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.760
that the Boston Public Library
and other places have been.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.260
Why?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.720
In part, because as
knowledge moves to the cloud

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.490
and to the extent
that people continue

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.600
to prefer ebooks or
electronic forms of things

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.280
over the analog forms
of things, it actually

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.520
becomes trickier for
libraries to do what

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.857
they have done traditionally.

00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:41.940
I'm just curious, actually,
because I'm doing this

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.310
at each of the talks.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.040
How many people prefer to
read a physical form of a book

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.340
like this in this room?

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.270
Little more than half.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.460
How many people
prefer a digital book?

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.960
How many people are
really agnostic?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.110
You're happy to read
either, which includes me.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.610
Yes, sir?

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.782
Another option?

00:06:59.782 --> 00:07:01.990
AUDIENCE: I would like to
point out the other option.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.972
Mine is would love to read it
in paper, don't want to carry

00:07:04.972 --> 00:07:06.104
the paper.

00:07:06.104 --> 00:07:07.020
JOHN PALFREY: Awesome.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.610
And so there therefore
you download it

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.040
to a Kindle or some other
device, whatever it might.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.040
iBooks.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.074
AUDIENCE: Android phone.

00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:14.240
JOHN PALFREY: Android phone.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.740
Oh, right.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.670
Excellent, excellent.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.550
What is the--

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.844
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] just poor
functionality on many ebooks

00:07:20.844 --> 00:07:23.740
that are badly transformed.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.469
JOHN PALFREY: Right
I don't think anybody

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:27.260
has really cracked that
code, particularly,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.284
nor made it more useful.

00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:29.700
One of the very
interesting things

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.150
is actually in the context of
law school, these unbelievably

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.390
expensive books-- $150
books that kids use still

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.760
for their case books--
they're full of cases

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.010
that are in the public domain.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.240
They're materials that
you could get anywhere.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.000
And yet we have not yet
gone to digital case books.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.890
How is that possible
given the enormous cost.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.473
If you're in law
school, you're taking

00:07:50.473 --> 00:07:52.510
a handful of classes.
$150 each for these books.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.136
Almost no uptake for
the digital books.

00:07:54.136 --> 00:07:55.843
I think it is the
interface is no better.

00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:57.750
The annotation is
terrible and so forth.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.460
And it just seems to me
that's a fairly obvious thing.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.040
But let's just
imagine for a second

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.460
that we all trend toward-- at
least for some of our usage--

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.460
toward preferring a digital
format that's actually

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.460
excellent and can be
accessed through an Android

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.360
phone or otherwise very easily.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.670
One of the problems is
that publishers have not

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.680
been willing,
traditionally, to allow

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.305
libraries to lend
on the same basis

00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:20.430
that they have in the past.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.320
Many of the publishers
have said no.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.790
Even with our most
popular books,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.540
we won't lend them
at all to libraries

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.410
or allow a license
in the libraries

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.630
to allow them to lend.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.910
But if you think that
even more fundamentally,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.841
even if the publishers
do allow libraries to do,

00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:35.340
what's happened is
that there's been

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.250
a fundamental change in what
libraries are actually doing,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.210
which is in the current age,
they but a physical book

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:41.890
like this.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.265
And they put it on the shelf
and they have it accessible,

00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:46.970
and if you are living in
Arlington or Watertown

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.580
and your library doesn't have
it, they can call Cambridge.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.830
And Cambridge can send it
along with interlibrary loan

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.400
and so forth.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.470
In the digital era, that
isn't necessarily true.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.410
And by and large, the contracts
that libraries are getting

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.312
do not allow them
ultimately to own

00:08:59.312 --> 00:09:00.520
the book in any physical way.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.705
They're just leasing
or loaning them.

00:09:02.705 --> 00:09:05.080
If the publisher goes out a
business, that's one problem.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.782
If the library stops
paying the license,

00:09:07.782 --> 00:09:08.740
that's another problem.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.810
But fundamentally, libraries do
not then own their collections

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:12.734
in the digital world.

00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:14.400
And that has as much
to do with contract

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.430
as it does with the
background copyright law.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.516
But the notion is
that librarians

00:09:19.516 --> 00:09:20.890
are fearful that
they will not be

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.889
able to fulfill the
function they have fulfilled

00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:24.887
in democracies in a
digital era as they

00:09:24.887 --> 00:09:26.720
have in the analog era,
which itself is just

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.567
a perverse outcome.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.900
We should have more access
to knowledge and information,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.840
not less.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.110
And yet the way in
which it is playing out

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.550
doesn't make that likely.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.400
So I think at this
moment where we

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.747
stand is we have a
moment where we're

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:41.830
going to build the future.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.288
We'll build the
future of libraries

00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:45.550
and of knowledge and
information in a way that's

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.880
akin to building the great
public libraries from 150 years

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.930
ago or so.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.150
This is a view of the
Boston Public Library

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.250
as it was being built. And I
think we're at a similar moment

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.340
when it comes to
thinking about the hybrid

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.130
of digital and analog libraries.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.070
I think we are at
a design moment

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.410
where it's crucial that we
figure out what we actually

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.850
want this information or this
Knowledge Commons to look like.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.580
And then we actually
do it in the way

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.340
that we have in the past.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.550
If you are imagining
building a new building--

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.580
and this is a side
elevation of the building

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.100
I worked in at
Harvard Law School--

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.740
you would in fact bring
together architects, presumably,

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.580
with the teachers and
librarians and maybe

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.579
some of the students
you're trying to consultant

00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:26.110
and build the space for.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.640
And you would do a process.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.170
Maybe it's a design charrette.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.230
But you would come
up with an idea.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.771
What should the
classrooms look like?

00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:34.395
What should the library reading
rooms look like and so forth?

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:35.770
And I feel like
that's the moment

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.350
that we have right
now in libraries

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.380
is to do that for
a digital era--

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.300
to bring together people,
like all of you who

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.500
work in the information
space and information

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.750
architects, along with
physical architects

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.920
and figure out what does
this hybrid environment look

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.760
like going forward?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.470
And how can we make sure that
it has all of the excitement

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.190
and innovation of the
information economy

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.580
while also having a preservation
for knowledge in the long run

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.380
and also those democratic ideals
of access of being free to all?

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.330
And I think it's entirely
possible to do that.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.920
The case that I
make in this book

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.530
is that one of the
things we should

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.180
do in addition to supporting
traditional libraries

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.220
is actually work together to
create a digital public library

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.210
system.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.630
Just as we did 150 years
ago, create a system--

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.760
funded by Mr. Carnegie and
others-- of little libraries

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.170
all around the world.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.030
The United States
being one part of it,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.420
but the same notion
has spread globally.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.450
We should be building digital
libraries at the same time.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.920
I understand, of
course, that many

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.774
of the early efforts
in this space

00:11:35.774 --> 00:11:37.690
happen right here for
Google and Google Books.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.580
Did anybody work on
Google Books or does?

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.080
Awesome.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.450
So we have some veterans or
current members of the team.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.490
The inspiration of the
Google Books project

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.140
led a bunch of people to
come into a room in Harvard

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.330
about four years ago to seek
to do something complementary,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.730
which was to create, actually,
a digital public library

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.510
system for the country, to
take advantage of the ability

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.560
to digitize enormous
amounts of works

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.550
and make them available
in a broad way.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.580
And that actually has been going
for the last several years.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.050
It started with
a single sentence

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.030
that was agreed to by a
series of law professors,

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.550
to begin with, but also
librarians and information

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.520
architects and some
foundation presidents.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.480
And the idea was to create an
open and distributed network

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.070
of online resources drawn
from all over the country

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.860
in order to create the
backbone, the platform,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.610
for a digital library
system for the future.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.720
And amazingly enough, we've
been working on doing that.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.830
And it is a part
of the argument I

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.792
want to make for the
future of libraries.

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:40.500
So one way to think
about this, actually,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.600
is to step back and
say, what actually

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.280
is a library in a digital age?

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.680
What is essential about it?

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.170
What are the pieces of it?

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.440
And I think that they are
slightly different than they

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.590
were in the analog age.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.330
If you start with
the idea of code,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.720
I actually think
libraries are, in fact,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.130
in a digital space about code.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.080
It is my strong preference that
that could be open source code

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.980
and made available very broadly.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.580
So one of the
efforts in creating

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.400
a digital public
library, I think,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.350
is the creation of a
GitHub for libraries--

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.810
the notion of creating
a huge amount of code

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.650
that anybody can take and
reuse in a variety of ways.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.000
We started by
offering to the world

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.840
the chance to code
anything you wanted

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.270
and to put it into a
common environment.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.540
This was called a beta sprint.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.570
And it actually
attracted about 50 people

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.170
who came forward
to build what they

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.780
thought a digital public
library ought to look like.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.074
We required,
amazingly, that they

00:13:37.074 --> 00:13:38.740
retain no intellectual
property rights--

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.680
that they agree to give those
rights to the public domain--

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.592
and that they get no
compensation for it.

00:13:44.592 --> 00:13:47.050
And the amazing thing was that
people stepped up and wanted

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.050
to do this.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.730
Because there's a huge reservoir
of interest in creating

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.650
a digital future for libraries.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.710
So as we have built the
digital public library,

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.510
it has come with a
series of releases

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.200
and ultimately been a
technical project to start.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.660
Second, libraries
are about metadata.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.050
They are about the data that
describe where the data are.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.810
So if you think about a
book as a bunch of data,

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.130
you have a huge amount
of metadata about it.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.390
I don't have to make that
case here in this room.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.710
But it is an essential piece
of what libraries hold.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.570
So a catalog record would be an
example of that-- circulation

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.770
records, who was it who wanted
that material, what its subject

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.440
headings are, and so forth.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.890
And secondly, if you think about
what a library needs to have,

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.460
it needs to have this
huge store metadata.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.950
Libraries spend a huge
amount of time and money

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.660
creating often duplicative
versions of metadata.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.080
And often they also worry
about the intellectual property

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.210
claims of this, that maybe
there are copyright interests

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.724
in the metadata.

00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:51.140
I would submit
that there actually

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.650
aren't good copyright claims
for most forms of metadata.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.800
And in fact, if libraries
were much more collaborative

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.450
in terms of sharing
their metadata,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.210
there would be many, many fewer
forms of duplicative effort.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.800
And ultimately, part of
this digital library system

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.685
is a huge store of metadata.

00:15:08.685 --> 00:15:10.560
There's something called
Library Cloud, which

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.690
is one experiment in this way.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.747
And the DPLA is a part of that.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.580
AUDIENCE: So isn't OCLC
supposed to do that?

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.720
JOHN PALFREY: I think
OCLC should do that

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.230
and should do that
in a more open way.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.410
And there are lots
of ways if those

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.160
who are holding information in
a fairly proprietary fashion

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.050
would in fact share
it more broadly,

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.420
we would reduce a lot
of duplicative effort.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.800
So yes, I think if
OCLC were in essence

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.660
to create all of
it's information

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.780
on an open access basis,
we will be better off.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.410
Individual institutions
have been saying back

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.870
to OCLC-- which is a great
collaborative and a very

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.200
important thing-- if you
were to allow us to do this,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.010
we would be able
to have something

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.860
that a huge amount of innovation
could be done on top of.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.530
And I think that's actually
starting to happen.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.521
Third, the digital library
is itself about content,

00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:03.020
of course.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.436
And I think one
of the big efforts

00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:07.710
is to do what Google Books has
done but to do it in a highly

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.020
distributed way, which is, in
fact, to digitize as much as we

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.140
can that is enormously useful.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.590
Of course, there are
intellectual property topics

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.124
that arise in this
context, as you well know.

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:21.040
But I actually think
there's much more that we

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.720
could be doing than we are.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.520
So the third part of what
a digital library could be

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.470
is in fact the
objects themselves

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.380
and to figure out how to harness
all the digitization that is

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.290
happening all around the world.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.600
Fourth, I think libraries are in
fact about tools and services.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.760
They are about ways
of getting information

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.210
to people who wish to use
them and to engage with them.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.600
And very often, libraries
are creating the same thing

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.710
over and over again.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.190
You might think
about each library

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.030
creating a separate Android
app rather than having

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.600
a series of open code that
they could use and reuse

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.620
in a simple format.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.080
Another example is
the idea that we

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.670
have been working with
about having a "scanebago"--

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.200
the idea that librarians
could get a Winnebago

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.280
and put a scanner
in the back and have

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.380
maybe a retired librarian
or a library student

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.800
drive the Winnebago
around a community,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.390
go into places like
historical societies,

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.990
and digitize materials
and share the more broadly

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.099
with the world.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.576
This is an idea that
has lots of antecedents.

00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:23.950
So in Massachusetts, there's
something called the Digital

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:27.630
Commonwealth, an effort that
allows all of the 351 cities

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.770
and towns to digitize their
materials at the Boston Public

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.390
Library.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.660
You can imagine the distributed
network that is possible

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.580
if you were in a sense
to be spreading out

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.010
across the country
and digitizing

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.050
materials and bringing them
together into a common place.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.970
And last, I think
libraries are fundamentally

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.020
about human beings.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.360
They are about the librarians.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.990
They are about
the people who are

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.140
the interface
between the library

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.744
users and the information.

00:17:53.744 --> 00:17:55.160
And even though
this is something,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.493
of course, that Google does
extremely well in the search

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:59.640
business, we also
know particularly

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.530
from studying people's search
patterns that it is crucial.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.980
You have humans who can be
an interface between a kid

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.450
and information.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.600
I'm teaching a course in
the United States history

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.190
at a high school I work at.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.965
This is the third year.

00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:16.870
You all probably
took History 300.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.330
And at the end of it, you
write a very long paper.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.090
If students relied
only upon what

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.660
they could find on the
web, I can guarantee you

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.850
that it would be a much
less good paper, in fact,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.920
than the ones that are done
when human librarians are

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.540
part of that interface.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.310
And I think that
may be something

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.944
that over time
could be conquered

00:18:35.944 --> 00:18:37.610
throughout algorithms,
but no time soon.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.880
And it's quite clear
that librarians

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.890
as human guides within the
information environment

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.880
often digitally-- but in
addition to the analog--

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.760
are crucial.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.720
So that is the fifth element
of what a library needs to be.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.060
So one way to think about
it in more technical terms

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.100
is to think of
libraries not so much as

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.510
standalone institutions--
institutions

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.470
that are collecting information
often in a competitive way.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.960
In other words, trying to
collect the same information

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.300
into each of these
different physical spaces.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.420
Think instead of
libraries as platforms--

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.080
as platforms that enable
people to do things

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.970
with information
and with knowledge.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.820
So the design that we've created
for this Digital Public Library

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.300
is, in fact, to
create exactly that.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.930
So in very simple
form, it's really

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.530
a collection of
metadata about objects

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.310
that are around
the world that have

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.920
been curated in various
ways related to America.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.320
That's in this
metadata repository.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.180
There's a mechanism
for ingesting it.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.270
So the notion is that there
are many different contributors

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.740
of information into this
particular platform.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.290
And on top of it, an open API
is a crucial part of the design.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.400
And on the far end
is a mode of export--

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.520
a mode of export that
says if anybody wants

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.710
to take all of this code, all
of this metadata, anything

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.484
that we've created, and create
a better one, you can do that.

00:19:58.484 --> 00:19:59.900
The notion that
if somebody wanted

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.370
to create something that
would take literally

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.620
all of this effort and make it
a competitor that is vastly more

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.980
effective, I actually think
that would be a huge success

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.710
if it were to happen.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.050
Fundamentally, I think the we
will create in this digital era

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.770
things that we
can't imagine today.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.970
But there also is a
need, I think, for a way

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.580
to access information that is
in all of the libraries that

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.180
are collected.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.080
So the Digital Public
Library has a front end--

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.470
it's DPLA if you
want to go to it.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.980
It is a reasonably
simple interface.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.819
I think it works OK in terms
of presenting information.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.610
But most important, I
think, it directs you

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.660
to the various applications and
the other ways in which people

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.340
have thought about
creating access

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.570
to the same store
of information.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.020
And I would love
to see libraries

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.570
across the country and
archives and museums taking

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.160
the same information
and curating it

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.530
for their local communities--
a very different way

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.440
to think about
their job, which is

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.840
to go into an enormous store of
information that's been curated

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.090
at a national level, but
then think about how it's

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.160
made available
directly to individuals

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.180
in a local environment.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.950
Another piece of building it out
is thinking about the sources--

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.800
how do you get the information
into such a platform?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.290
And I think this
is, in part, why

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.730
the system can be so
effectively distributed broadly.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.210
The notion is to create a
series of different hubs

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.050
that are digitizing materials
and then sharing them

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.900
with others through the on
ramp that is the Digital Public

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.880
Library of America.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.730
There are a couple
different types of hubs.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.340
One is being called
a service hub

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.580
that really is often a state.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.210
So in Massachusetts, it's
the Digital Commonwealth.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.840
So at the Boston Public
Library are a handful

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.010
of people who work very
effectively at digitizing

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.000
materials and then ensuring
that they're available locally

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.987
and then shared globally.

00:21:50.987 --> 00:21:53.320
And there are a series of
different states that have it.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.910
There are also content hubs.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.520
These are places
that have digitized

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.450
a huge amount of information.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.539
So an example would
be Harvard University

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:02.330
down the street or New
York Public Library,

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.810
which has contributed about
a million objects to at.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.720
Google Books could
be a great example.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.590
We would love to
have contributions

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.140
from that project in the DPLA.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.660
But the notion is you have
large stores of information that

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.360
have been digitized
at big institutions

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.230
and then you have states that
create places for individuals

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.550
to share the information
up into this library.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.140
Roughly speaking,
as of today, these

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.410
are places that have
already contributed

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.540
into this national
store of information.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.150
It is about a third
of the country.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.274
And the effort right now
over the next couple years

00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:38.850
is to complete
the map, to ensure

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.150
that every part of
the country has a way

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.830
to contribute this information
into the digital store that

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.954
will be available.

00:22:46.954 --> 00:22:49.120
And then of course, the
value of it, the power of it

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.170
becomes much, much greater.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.220
So if you look on
the map, you can

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.160
see the ones that are orange
red are the service hubs up

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.026
and running.

00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.400
There are a bunch
in development.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.170
And the yellow dots
are representative

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.970
of big institutions that
are contributing information

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.790
from libraries, from
archives, and from museums.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.100
And again, we'd be very
happy to have private sector

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.800
partners in that effort.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.590
In a slightly more
technical mode,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.630
this is the notion of
the platform itself.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.120
I would say that one piece
that we have not focused on

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.160
as well as we might and
where should Google engineers

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.230
wish to be helpful or
designers is really

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.590
on the user interface side.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.520
Again, anybody could
take the information

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.600
and could create an
application that would

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.730
make it more useful to others.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.094
The notion of the platform
is that libraries ultimately

00:23:35.094 --> 00:23:36.510
should be in this
business, should

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:41.620
be focused on making information
more useful to users.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.340
Actually, one of my great
fears about libraries becoming

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.100
obsolete, in a sense,
is if the interfaces

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.580
are ones that never
have libraries

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.260
in the first set
of search results.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.650
So if you think about the
patterns the graduate students

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.440
or the students who are
trying to access information

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.140
go through, they almost
always start with you guys--

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.130
with Google.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.150
And they will look in
the search results,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.941
and they will often
click on, for instance,

00:24:06.941 --> 00:24:09.280
Wikipedia as one of
the early entrants.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.360
They might click on Amazon
and find a work there.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.010
They might click on a
recommendation for Amazon.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.210
But I actually think libraries
have often found themselves out

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.680
of that particular mix.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.180
And I feel like as
information moves increasingly

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.770
to the cloud,
librarians actually

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.230
need to be in that research
and development space.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.450
They need to be
creating applications

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.670
that ensure that in
that search process,

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.520
libraries are a part of the
relevant search results.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.620
And I think if the emphasis
were in part on developing

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.320
applications that were
useful in that process,

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.700
I think that could happen.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.970
And hopefully through
this design, it might.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.970
One particular example of
the kinds of things libraries

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.450
have developed.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.590
This is a version
called Stack View.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.860
This was created at the
Harvard Law School Library

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.710
through a group called the
library innovation lab.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.600
And the idea went this way.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.620
It was to think
about the process

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.960
of browsing in the stacks.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.790
If you think about the thing
that people usually tell you

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.090
they love about libraries,
it's that experience

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.760
of getting a call number and
then walking into some stacks

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.100
and trying to find a book.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.520
And then you see the book
there, but you actually

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.050
see other books
you want around it.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.010
Because that's part of
the fun of libraries.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.620
And you come out
with a huge number

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.980
of books in your arms
from the stacks--

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.170
many more books often
than you can carry.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.564
And the fear is that if what
happens in the digital age

00:25:30.564 --> 00:25:31.980
is you simply
search for something

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.270
and you find exactly what
you want in a pinpoint way,

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.400
you might lose that
form of serendipity.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.970
You may have heard
the same critique

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.450
about the newspaper moving
from the physical newspaper

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.950
to the online space that if
you're reading the New York

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.680
Times in the morning, you often
see an article you didn't think

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.470
you needed off to the right.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.010
I'm sure you think
about this a lot

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.050
in the context of presenting
material in Google.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.760
But it seemed to me
another way to see

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.210
this is to flip it around and
say as much as we can worry

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.550
about the loss of serendipity
and the loss of stacks--

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.080
and to be very
clear, I think stacks

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.410
are a great thing and
a very important part

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.660
of the interface in libraries.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.020
And we ought to have them.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.280
I actually think it's
possible that in a digital age

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.470
we could do better than we
do in the physical space.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.030
So I'll give you one example.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.154
The Harvard libraries,
which are, in effect,

00:26:18.154 --> 00:26:18.820
down the street.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.028
Or you could think about
the MIT libraries closer by.

00:26:21.028 --> 00:26:23.350
They actually don't have
a single stack where you

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.820
can find all the information.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.080
In the context of Harvard, there
are 73 different libraries.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.750
And In fact, there's a library
depository 20 miles away.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.240
And the notion that
anybody could actually

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.220
look at a stack of things and
see where all the books are

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.345
is implausible for
most library systems.

00:26:42.345 --> 00:26:42.970
Think about it.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.455
How could we combine the MIT
library system and the Harvard

00:26:45.455 --> 00:26:46.080
library system?

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.660
Or think about metro
New York and how many

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.382
different libraries there are.

00:26:50.382 --> 00:26:52.090
But digitally, of
course, we can do that.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.360
And we could do that,
in fact, much better.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.820
And the idea here
of Stack View is

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.460
to say what if you
combined entire collections

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.210
and then had basically
an infinite stack

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.580
you could go through.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.820
You could imagine paging
along in your Android device

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.680
and seeing this infinite
stack presented.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.300
And then if you
could imagine, also,

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.300
using all that metadata
that we've created and made

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.110
accessible to fuse other
ways to surface things

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.510
that might be interesting.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.890
So in this particular
example, somebody

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.667
has come along in a search
for "Gravity's Rainbow."

00:27:20.667 --> 00:27:23.000
And what they see is, of
course, the "Gravity's Rainbow"

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.090
they went for.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.910
But they've also got
a whole bunch of data

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.510
that I think has
been well anonymized

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.920
at this point from 2009
in a circulation heat map.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.730
And the idea is to say who
in fact has been accessing

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.720
these works based on some
of their demographics,

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.920
and which works have
been read to the most.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.340
You could imagine the
context of searching for,

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.260
say, "The Iliad."

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.650
Which version of a whole bunch
of editions of "The Iliad"

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.824
should you access?

00:27:48.824 --> 00:27:50.240
And if you are a
student who wants

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.073
to know how many times
a professor has taken

00:27:52.073 --> 00:27:54.940
that particular translation or
that particular forward, you

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.370
could use the metadata to
figure out which example

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:58.800
you wanted to take.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.330
Use this just as one example to
say I think that in the future

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.400
we have so many
different ways that we

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.540
could improve upon the
information and knowledge

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.540
architecture that we've
created, but only if we create

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:14.230
this platform and only if
we engage libraries as well

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.110
as individuals in doing that.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.440
Another thing that happens
if we think about libraries

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.450
in this highly
collaborative way is also

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.370
that we surface huge amounts of
really interesting information

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.380
that has been
curated very locally

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.530
and not actually yet digitized--
not yet accessible in a Google

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.890
search because it hasn't
yet been put onto the grid.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.390
And in a very short
while, these are

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.980
a few of the things
that have been digitized

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.260
as part of this effort to
create the national on ramp

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.990
and add them into
what a library is.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.450
And many of the
things are regional.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.490
So tiny little
examples, for instance,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.310
of Appalachian culture.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.250
But also things that are
broadly of interest--

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.630
by and large things around war.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.580
Civil War, World War
I, World War II--

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.000
these are things that
have enormous appeal.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.790
Geology would be
another example.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.450
Ultimately, I think we are at a
very early stage of developing

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.360
what digital libraries will be.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.600
And importantly, they
need to be combined

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.176
with the physical library
infrastructure that we have.

00:29:13.176 --> 00:29:14.550
And I think that's
part of what's

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.400
exciting is to say
how do we actually

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.250
think about the problems that
need solving in communities?

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.700
How do we then combine what
we can do incredibly well

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.300
in the digital environment with
what libraries do so crucially

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.900
in the physical world
and put them together

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.670
as we are building this future?

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.620
I often think about the most
beautiful of the library spaces

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.410
as we're imagining
what we could build.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.640
This is the Adam's
Library nearby in Quincy.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.820
And the appeal of
this in some respects

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.430
is those beautiful
reference books

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.280
that are out on this
table and the idea

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.470
that people would come to a
physical space we would come

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.500
to find the nuggets
of information

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.810
that they have been missing.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.635
And I don't think
actually that reference

00:29:56.635 --> 00:29:58.830
is something that's
ever going to return

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.120
to physical spaces
like libraries.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.430
And I think that's something
that we can safely say

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.392
has been conquered by Google
and Wikipedia and others.

00:30:06.392 --> 00:30:07.850
So I doubt people
are going to come

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.000
for these huge books
that are encyclopedias

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.950
to a particular space.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.320
But I do think the idea,
the joy of actually coming

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.550
to a physical space in a
community to access information

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.040
that we need for one reason
or another is something

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.080
we could and should preserve.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.130
And trying to figure out
what is something just

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.380
as beautiful as this that
actually would attract people

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.860
to come together in
a cultural setting,

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.910
I think that is a huge part
of the challenge of ensuring

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.570
that libraries thrive
in a digital era.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.680
I think it needs to be
done in a global context.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.030
I actually think this is one of
the huge upsides for libraries

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.230
in the digital era-- the
notion that we actually

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:48.780
can imagine connecting a lot
of different things together.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.317
There's a guy named
Siva Vaidhyanathan who

00:30:51.317 --> 00:30:53.400
wrote a book called "A
Googlization of Everything"

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.490
you may have read.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.020
And in the end of his book,
Siva wrote about the notion

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.880
that you could imagine a
global digital library--

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.980
something that
connects the knowledge

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.860
of the world in the way a
digital library of Alexandria

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.810
might.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.790
And in that book,
I think he presents

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.400
a really compelling vision.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.170
And it's something
that I don't think

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.330
has to happen in just a
one size fits all way.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:19.640
I think ultimately we can
create this kind of future

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.500
also by doing it locally, by
drawing upon the distributed

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.450
nature of the web,
and actually learning

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.600
from the way in which the web
was built in order to create

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.890
this global vision.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.260
So I'm very excited
about the notion

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.720
that individually, communities--
and it could be communities

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.120
at the state level
or communities

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.230
at the national level--
can create things and then

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.790
make them interoperable.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.040
So as we've created this Digital
Public Library of America,

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.710
part of our argument
has been to say,

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.860
we don't have to have
something exactly the same

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.730
in every one of the 200 or
so countries in the world.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.310
But rather, just make them
interoperate effectively.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.100
So the very first thing we
did, even as it was just

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.600
getting started, was
to have an agreement

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.330
with the European
version called Europeana.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.000
And so through a memorandum
of understanding,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.740
there is in fact
a series of cross

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.260
walks that allow
you as a user to go

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.820
through the information
that's in Europeana

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.070
through to the things that
are in the Digital Public

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.930
Library of America.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.430
And the easy way
to think about this

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.100
is you can curate exhibits
in a digital away.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.370
So the first exhibit was
to look at immigration

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.640
between the old world and
the new and vice versa.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.560
To imagine curating
materials from both sides.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.320
So just as these little
national digital libraries

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.190
start popping up, I
don't think the point

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:34.082
is we have to create one huge
digital library of Alexandria.

00:32:34.082 --> 00:32:36.290
I think we just have to
agree on a series of things--

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.640
really dry things like metadata
standards and licensing

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.730
agreements and so forth.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.490
But I actually think
by doing that, we

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.120
can create something
that's enormously

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.150
powerful on a global level.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.540
Ultimately, I think it is not
going to be a utopian future.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.810
I don't think there's
the possibility

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.421
that by just designing it well,
we'll have something completely

00:32:57.421 --> 00:32:57.920
perfect.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.250
Copyright completely
stands in the way

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.020
of doing what I
would want to do.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.850
So I acknowledge this
huge elephant in the room.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.910
If we could have a more
friendly copyright statute,

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.642
that would be very,
very helpful to creating

00:33:10.642 --> 00:33:12.100
something that
would be approaching

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.270
a utopian future for libraries.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.030
But we don't, so part
of it would be advocacy.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.870
But I do actually
think it's worth

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.950
thinking in these
very broad terms,

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.890
thinking in utopian
terms, thinking

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.434
about what we want a library
to be in a digital era.

00:33:26.434 --> 00:33:27.850
And I think by
doing that, we will

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.540
draw upon what's so
essential about libraries

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.890
in the physical area.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.460
We will create some
things that is,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.800
in effect, a very,
very powerful hybrid.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.660
And I think it's something
that can be done.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.430
Essentially, it needs to be
done in a collaborative manner,

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.945
though.

00:33:41.945 --> 00:33:43.320
I think this is
one of the things

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.160
that libraries have done well
in the context of something

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.040
like OCLC, which used
to be a collaboration

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.850
within some libraries in
Ohio but now a very important

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.030
national collaboration.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.590
So libraries do it often
in a very good way.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.920
Interlibrary Loan would
be another example.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.720
But I think too
often, still, there's

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.135
competition between
individual libraries

00:34:04.135 --> 00:34:06.510
and there's often too much
competition between the public

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.950
and the private sector.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.020
And my argument would
be the best approach

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.260
would be one where we
actually were doing this

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.739
in collaboration-- that
a company like Google

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.580
would work with
libraries to do it

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.340
rather than to have a
standalone series of projects

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.770
in the private sector and a
standalone series of projects

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.894
in the public sector.

00:34:23.894 --> 00:34:26.310
So I'm a big believer that
this is something that actually

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.420
could be good for the
public in a broad way

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.684
if we were to embrace a
series of common principles.

00:34:32.684 --> 00:34:36.159
And I would say just by way
of closing that I actually

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.989
think that this
is a project that

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:41.639
is enormously important to
the success of our democracy.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.730
And this may seem
like an overstatement,

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.739
but I think that if we were
to lose physical libraries

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.800
or we were to lose the
possibility of creating

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.230
a series of digital
interfaces and objects

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:58.280
and really an innovative
future that lies ahead of us

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.124
that we will be much poorer
than we would be otherwise.

00:35:01.124 --> 00:35:03.540
And I think if we get it right,
we can be much the richer.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.660
I think it can be a very
powerful aspect of democracy

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.890
moving forward if we
get this platform right

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:13.477
and if we get the design and
essence of digital libraries

00:35:13.477 --> 00:35:14.060
going forward.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.476
And I actually think it will
not undercut local libraries.

00:35:16.476 --> 00:35:19.450
I think it will drive people
back into physical libraries

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.360
and be a very powerful
force for good.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.110
Thank you so much.

00:35:27.102 --> 00:35:28.100
Yes, sir.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm a great
lover-- is this working?

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.800
I'm a great lover of libraries--
the Academy Library at Exeter,

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.378
a fantastic building.

00:35:36.378 --> 00:35:38.365
JOHN PALFREY: It's
an amazing building.

00:35:38.365 --> 00:35:39.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
less interesting,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.530
but lots of good stuff in there.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.820
Widener-- I love looking
at the stacks and so on.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.300
What worries me a little
bit is that your talk

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:54.190
seems to be based on existing
ways that libraries work.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.870
So the notion of the
book as the unit.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:01.650
The notion of metadata rather
than content being shared.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.010
So metadata is wonderful.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.240
I use it a lot.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.482
The notion of metadata-- if
you look at the library rules,

00:36:08.482 --> 00:36:09.940
they say you're
not allowed to have

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.356
more than, whatever
the number is,

00:36:11.356 --> 00:36:12.842
five library cards per book.

00:36:12.842 --> 00:36:15.300
So you have an author card, a
title card, and three subject

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.860
cards, which is absurd.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.269
We don't need that kind
of restriction anymore.

00:36:20.269 --> 00:36:22.310
But on the other hand,
the economics of libraries

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.250
depend on some of
these characteristics

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.720
to like you have to
buy a physical book.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.740
And first sale doctrine
says once you buy it,

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.641
you can do whatever
you want with it.

00:36:31.641 --> 00:36:34.140
But now, if you could distribute
it instantaneously anywhere

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.020
in the world, that model no
longer works economically.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.780
Who's going to pay for
the author, the publisher?

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.670
So the economics seem to be
missing from your proposal.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:45.790
How is this actually going
to fit into the publishing

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.744
ecosystem?

00:36:46.744 --> 00:36:47.910
I think I should stop there.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.950
I have lots of stuff because
I'm fascinated by this topic.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:50.760
But I'll stop there.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.843
JOHN PALFREY: That's good.

00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:54.280
Well, I'm imagining from
the nature of your questions

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.850
that we agree quite violently
in terms of where we need to go.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.800
And I don't promise
in any way to have

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.750
all of the aspects of a
huge proposal for the future

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.850
of libraries figured out.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:06.410
In fact, that's sort of
essential to this story is

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.530
to say one of the
things I don't want

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.500
to do is foreclose
what might be possible.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.701
I haven't figured out what
the right interfaces are

00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:14.200
going to be.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.590
I haven't figured out
what the right business

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.880
models are going to be.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.940
But I do think that if we create
something that allows people

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.820
to build together, I
think that's something

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.640
that will result in really
great experimentation.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.540
So when you talk about
metadata, I couldn't agree more.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.910
I think the series of
rules that constrain

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.740
what counts as metadata
is really a potentially

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.650
destructive thing.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.301
I think the fact that
there's so much more

00:37:37.301 --> 00:37:39.800
in the form of metadata-- maybe
I'm using a word that itself

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.466
is too restrictive,
so you might help me

00:37:41.466 --> 00:37:45.500
there-- restraints libraries
from doing some of things

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.120
that they could in terms of
making the knowledge much more

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.030
accessible.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.630
You talk about the content
being restricted to the codex.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.040
I don't think so at all.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.260
I do think that is
a fear for libraries

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.520
that by focusing only on one or
a series a particular formats,

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.550
that's constraining.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.680
So I think when I talk
about content, maybe, again,

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.555
I need a better word.

00:38:03.555 --> 00:38:06.490
But the point is I think we
should break down the units

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.660
and change the units enormously.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.670
I just don't think
libraries themselves

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.290
as institutions
are very involved

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.870
in that particular game.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.110
So the vast majority of
people who work in libraries

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.979
are focused on acquiring
things that look like this

00:38:19.979 --> 00:38:21.520
and bringing them
to a physical space

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.120
and helping people find them.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.550
When I was working at the
Harvard Law School Library,

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.380
I had an early
conversation where

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.340
we looked at what
everybody was doing out

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.180
of the 100 or so people who
were there who were awesome.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.480
And when you looked at all their
job descriptions, more or less,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.310
99.5 of the 100 we're
focused on something that

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.770
related to the physical object.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.930
And there was really
0.5 of somebody

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:44.680
who is focused on
the web interface

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.090
and the digital interface,
through which lots of people

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:47.655
are coming.

00:38:47.655 --> 00:38:49.780
Then I went and talked to
a lot of the students who

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.520
were involved and
the faculty members,

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.479
and it looked like
about 50% of the time

00:38:53.479 --> 00:38:55.520
they were walking through
the physical front door

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.850
and doing something
with objects.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.340
And about 50% of the time they
were coming through that web

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.820
interface-- our
digital front door.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.350
We're completely
misaligned in that way.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.310
And I think libraries
need to be more engaged

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:09.440
in basically that redesign of
what that interface looks like.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.200
And your last point about the
business models-- figuring out

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.967
something with publishers
for ebooks and everything

00:39:14.967 --> 00:39:17.300
that will come after I think
is an essential part of it.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.550
So most recently, the
Digital Public Library

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.190
along with President
Obama and New York Public

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.830
and a whole pile of publishers
came to an agreement

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.830
to distribute children's books
as a starting point-- a way

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.592
to think about this.

00:39:32.592 --> 00:39:33.300
I agree with you.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.350
There are a series of
different business models

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.880
that would be very helpful.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.180
Alternative
compensation mechanisms

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.940
for authors and publishers
that could ensure the publisher

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.920
still gets adequately
paid, but ultimately

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.469
without needing all of
those warehouses and all

00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:49.635
that printing time and all
those things that happen.

00:39:49.635 --> 00:39:52.120
I actually think there
might be another model that

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.439
will work very well and will
compensate authors fairly

00:39:55.439 --> 00:39:56.480
for what they've created.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.380
So I think there's a huge
amount of opportunity

00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.400
in exactly what
you're saying, which

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.100
is break down a
bunch of these units

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.057
and then rebuild it
in an interesting way.

00:40:03.057 --> 00:40:04.640
I guess what I am
fundamentally saying

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.240
is let's do so in a way
that actually preserves

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.220
a public option and has a
really good role for libraries

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.887
because I think that's
going to persist.

00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:12.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.060
JOHN PALFREY: Thank you.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.650
An awesome multi-part,
impossible-to-answer question,

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.930
but just great.

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.410
AUDIENCE: That was only 10%.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.390
JOHN PALFREY: I bet.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.130
So I've seen a trend with
libraries locking away

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.340
their rarest works.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.665
For example, Harvard has
the original manuscripts

00:40:29.665 --> 00:40:32.545
of Emily Dickinson, and
you can't get at them.

00:40:32.545 --> 00:40:34.680
The only format that
they're available in

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.240
is the format
that's been edited,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.120
and they say, well, this is
establishing a new copyright.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.140
So even though the originals
are in the public domain,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.620
the edited version isn't.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.670
This seems harmful
to getting things

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.330
in the hands of the public
and disseminating information.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.810
How do we show them that there
is an error in their way?

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.900
Or are they actually right and
they should be locking away

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.025
these rarest-of-rare works.

00:40:58.025 --> 00:40:59.400
JOHN PALFREY:
Well, I don't think

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.080
anything should be
locked away that is

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.720
useful in public discourse.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.840
So I can't imagine a
version which I would

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.490
say it's right to lock it away.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.900
I think it should be
digitized and made available

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.350
in a whole variety
of ways that are

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.090
useful to humanity and to the
furthering of scholarship.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.600
So absolutely at that level.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.499
The Emily Dickinson archive
is a very interesting example

00:41:20.499 --> 00:41:22.290
because as you probably
know, the works are

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:23.600
held in multiple institutions.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.516
So Amherst has a bunch
and Harvard has a bunch

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:26.130
and so forth.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.963
And they are actually
one of the things that

00:41:27.963 --> 00:41:29.655
has been digitized,
in part, and shared

00:41:29.655 --> 00:41:31.780
through this particular
system-- the Digital Public

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.302
Library of America system.

00:41:34.302 --> 00:41:35.010
I agree with you.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.740
I think it actually is
inappropriate and crass

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.250
to assert a new
copyright in works

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.560
associated with a great
19th-century author.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.180
I think there's no
value in doing that.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.310
I think that the
institutions like Harvard

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.660
and others who hold
these materials in trust

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.750
do so in the public
interest and therefore

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.320
ought to make them
freely available.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.790
I think there is
an advocacy role.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.450
I think librarians themselves
have been fantastic

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.510
advocates on things like
copyright and on privacy.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:05.160
And actually, as a law
professor working in that area,

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.449
I would often be going to
a conference or an event

00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:09.490
or something and librarians
were the first people

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:13.800
at the beginning of the line
making these great arguments.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.680
I can't imagine what
the downside is.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.895
I think sometimes
the argument that I

00:42:17.895 --> 00:42:20.320
hear is that we have
these unique materials

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.240
and someday there will be a
future business model that

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.995
will allow us to rest a
little bit of profit out of it

00:42:25.995 --> 00:42:27.870
and that will pay for
all these other things.

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:28.440
I don't know.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.160
That future business
model objection

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.259
doesn't make a whole
lot of sense to me.

00:42:32.259 --> 00:42:34.050
I've never really heard
any other objection

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:37.110
that makes any better sense.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.225
One thing that I think,
individually, librarians

00:42:39.225 --> 00:42:41.600
and archivists sometimes worry
about-- and museums, too--

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.520
is if we digitize
it, people will stop

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.460
coming to the physical space.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.080
And I actually, as
a library director,

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.630
found exactly the opposite.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.320
When we digitize things,
people wanted to come.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.300
They wanted to come and see
the objects and touch them

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.270
and so forth.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.230
And I actually think
that's the better argument

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.157
is make these things
available more broadly

00:42:59.157 --> 00:43:01.240
and encourage people to
interact with them in ways

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.310
that are really productive.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.768
And I actually
think that if we did

00:43:03.768 --> 00:43:06.390
a large-scale empirical study,
that's what would happen.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.580
And you think about it.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.400
You all work in
the digital space.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.200
I think people get
on airplanes more

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.566
because they want to be
face to face or drink beer

00:43:13.566 --> 00:43:15.940
or have a coffee with somebody
when you meet them online.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.740
So I actually think
in both of those ways,

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.750
those objections are false.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.685
Thank you.

00:43:22.685 --> 00:43:25.310
AUDIENCE: Actually, expanding on
that last point you just made,

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.450
you presented a very romantic
view of a lot of library spaces

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.260
in this talk and
meanwhile talked

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.600
a lot about digitizing
a lot of these works.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.250
And I'm just wondering why
libraries should continue

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.820
as a physical space--
what you think

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.990
justifies that-- as opposed to,
as you just suggested, almost

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.080
turning them into a museum where
someone could come and interact

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.372
with something they saw online.

00:43:45.372 --> 00:43:46.996
JOHN PALFREY: That's
a wonderful point.

00:43:46.996 --> 00:43:48.470
And I guess that's
partly what I'm

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:52.040
trying to say with this book
is I think both are valuable.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.360
There is a value of having
public, open, accessible

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.980
third spaces that don't happen
to be a Starbucks or McDonald's

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.269
or owned by a company.

00:44:01.269 --> 00:44:02.810
There's nothing
wrong with Starbucks.

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.710
I've frequented it myself.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.570
But I do think that in
communities we need spaces

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.070
where people come and are joined
around ideas and knowledge.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.700
You could make an argument that
libraries could just as well

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.570
be, say, community centers.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.770
I don't make that argument.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.420
I actually think
that if libraries

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.119
were to become just
community centers,

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:22.160
you would miss something.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.430
So I think it's about
the physical space,

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.110
it is about the coming together,
it is about the other humans

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.240
who are there-- whether they're
the patrons or the librarians.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.198
But it's also about the
ideas and the knowledge

00:44:31.198 --> 00:44:32.170
in an important way.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.090
And I think that
romanticism is really

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.780
deeply connected to
an active democracy

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.680
and an act of being a citizen.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.850
On the other side, I think if
we let that argument-- saying

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.030
librarians have no
role or libraries have

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.810
no role in a digital era-- I
think that means we're going

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.110
to lose those physical space.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:48.750
Why?

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.125
Just because of the number of
times-- and you've probably

00:44:51.125 --> 00:44:53.490
had this discussion-- in
communities when you're trying

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.800
to decide whether money goes to
fire or to police or to schools

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.990
or to administrators or
any of the other things

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:01.720
that are competing,
if you don't make

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.110
a good argument for libraries--
and, in fact, people just

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.430
say I can get what
I want an Amazon

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.013
or get what I want
on Google-- I think

00:45:07.013 --> 00:45:10.280
we will lose those
essential spaces.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.924
I think, though, if
we allow nostalgia

00:45:13.924 --> 00:45:15.340
to be the driver--
in other words,

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.890
that memory of what
a library was-- I

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:19.350
think that will erode over time.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.760
I think the idea
has to be something

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.170
that creates new nostalgia.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.200
It creates new ideas and
new excitement around what

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.650
a library can be and
will be the basis

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.820
on which we will continue
to reinforce this very

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.110
powerful public option.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:37.030
So I think it's a great point.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.265
AUDIENCE: I have a
multi-part question.

00:45:39.265 --> 00:45:40.181
JOHN PALFREY: Awesome.

00:45:40.181 --> 00:45:41.720
No surprise at Google Cambridge.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.770
AUDIENCE: Also, I've been
working on Google Book Search

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:46.070
for over seven years now.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:49.830
My wife worked in acquisitions
at the Harvard Business School

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.950
Library before we met and
my father was a printer.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:55.670
And my mother was a bookseller.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.234
JOHN PALFREY: You have the
entire industry covered.

00:45:58.234 --> 00:46:00.620
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.760
Metadata, I applaud
your drive there.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.040
This is mostly just a comment.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.630
I didn't work on metadata
directly as Francis did.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:12.850
But the metadata availability
is a mess, and I'm all for it

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.094
getting homogenized.

00:46:14.094 --> 00:46:16.260
I'm glad there's an open
project like this to do it.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.051
JOHN PALFREY: Why do
you think it's a mess?

00:46:18.051 --> 00:46:19.950
I agree, I'm just curious.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.960
AUDIENCE: We have a bookstore--
Google Playbooks is now

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.710
what it's called-- we discovered
that the Great Gatsby showed up

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.390
as a computer book.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:31.700
And we dug into the metadata--
OCLC is where they came from.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.250
Amazon also showed it like that.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.410
But because people weren't
buying it as a computer book,

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:39.360
that bit of metadata was so
buried down that no one ever

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.470
found it on Amazon that way.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:45.980
But it showed up when we put
a shelf of computer books up.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:49.430
And when this happens, when
a book like the Great Gatsby

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:52.520
has the genre
computer programming

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.660
or whatever was associated with
it, you know there's a problem.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.140
It's hard to correct.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.650
You're going through
a central organization

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.260
that tries to get the original
provider of the data to fix it.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.880
So much of the data
comes from things

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.570
scribbled on cards
that were later

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:10.150
typed in by low wage workers.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:14.460
I heard a story-- I will not
name individuals involved--

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.100
where someone
working in a library

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.447
came across a second bar
code associated with the book

00:47:20.447 --> 00:47:23.030
and thought, oh, this must be a
mistake and was deleting them.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.140
And it turned out they
were essential information.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.610
It was just assumed
by this hourly worker

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:29.830
to be irrelevant, a
mistake, and deleted.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:34.370
And the pencil scratches and
pen markings on the paper card

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:38.270
catalog cards, you can imagine
all sorts of transcription

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.930
errors by somebody
who isn't a librarian

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.840
and doesn't understand and
even some from the librarians.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.920
So getting the
metadata such that it

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.900
isn't swimming upstream for any
organization to try to keep it

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.370
ordered.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.320
Recovering from
metadata that is here

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.420
is an item on the
shelf that has a card

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.550
and, instead, here is an
entity described on the card

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.100
that maybe half a dozen
different editions

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.760
on the shelves,
some of which are in

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.510
multi-book bound volumes and
some of which are individual.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.880
The clustering problem.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.970
We've been spending years
on it, and it is still

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:20.740
very much an ongoing battle.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.480
And it's a problem that
needs to be solved so that we

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.810
can wrap our culture
around these books

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:29.640
and find the ones that
people are looking

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.390
for when they go looking.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:36.830
Librarians-- one of the
auxiliary uses of librarians

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.640
is you walk into a library
and you ask how do I find out

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.540
what buses run downtown?

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:49.330
And a librarian, being a
general knowledge assistant,

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.910
you might say, can say
either we have something

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:54.240
in the library
about that or here's

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.460
a phone number I believe if
you called you'd find out.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.040
A lot of people who need
the information the most

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.400
are the ones who were
isolated from information.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.470
Maybe you're at home--
like was Matilda the name

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.080
with the family that just
watched TV and didn't read

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.190
books-- and you don't
have a good place

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.650
to ask general questions.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.156
Google and Bing and
things like that, you

00:49:15.156 --> 00:49:17.250
can get some answers that way.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.070
But to get a human-interpreted
question answered

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.280
is very difficult.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.950
Libraries and the
librarians, in particular,

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:29.370
I see moving into a realm of
general information assistance

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.750
with certain information
resources stored there

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:35.720
where they're available and
other ones they can point you

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.860
to the computers.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.910
Computers I think have
become part of libraries

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.720
only because it's
a convenient place

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.970
to put a town-wide
accessible resource.

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:50.410
So that's how I think
libraries might go

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:53.210
and librarians in particular
and the spaces might go.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.450
Do you have any comment on that?

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.050
JOHN PALFREY: I think there is
a plausible future that you're

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:02.260
describing is adjusting the
role the reference library

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.020
and of course one of
the subsets of people

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.360
who work in libraries.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.600
And I think one part where
I would strongly agree

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.820
is that libraries
exist for all of us,

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.660
but they are most
important for a subset

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.330
of people in our society.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:19.310
And at least in the context
of big urban environments,

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.810
it is enormously
essential for places

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.390
who are seeking
jobs, people who are

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.990
new immigrants to the country,
people who are learning

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.560
to read in a variety of ways.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.892
Very often-- in fact,
in most libraries,

00:50:29.892 --> 00:50:31.350
the largest users
are young people.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:33.190
They are kids who are
coming out of school.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.890
They actually don't have a great
place to go in the afternoon,

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.820
and they go to a library
for several hours.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.040
And they have a series of
basic needs, some of which

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.260
relate to doing their homework
and sometimes that free Wi-Fi

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.850
is the only good
free Wi-Fi they can

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.040
get to complete their homework.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.630
And sometimes it is that there
is someone there an adult

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.660
who is in their life and
can be a mentor for them.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.480
So I actually think one of
the key reasons for defending

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.330
library budgets is to say that
for a lot of purposes that

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:03.930
are fairly broadly
written actually

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:07.630
don't have anything to do with
anything that looks like this.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.270
That's an essential
part in our society.

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:11.910
And is that a policeman?

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:12.940
Not quite.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.379
Is it someone who works in fire?

00:51:14.379 --> 00:51:15.670
Someone who works in town hall?

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.210
No, there is some
value to people

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.510
whose role in the community
is to help people access

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.900
the information that they
need to be effective citizens

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.940
or to be thriving or
joyful in their society.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.845
So that's a slightly
broader version

00:51:29.845 --> 00:51:32.470
of what you're suggesting, but
I think ultimately that's right.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:36.034
And I don't think it can only
be provided at a distance

00:51:36.034 --> 00:51:37.200
through a digital interface.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.770
Now, can you imagine a
group of librarians-- maybe

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.540
people who've retired from
librarianship-- spending

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.390
time being general
information reference

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:49.030
people through digital
interfaces for someone who

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.790
is shut in?

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:50.719
Absolutely.

00:51:50.719 --> 00:51:53.010
And actually, I think if you
get this overall interface

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.017
right and this overall
platform right, that

00:51:55.017 --> 00:51:56.850
could be a wonderful
thing for people to do.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:59.000
And maybe it's a way
for people, ultimately,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.510
to connect to one another if
you're a retired librarian who

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:03.620
actually isn't mobile
anymore but wants

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.327
to participate in an active way.

00:52:05.327 --> 00:52:07.785
That's something that actually
can be a very powerful thing

00:52:07.785 --> 00:52:08.980
for them to do.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.664
And so it's a
wonderful opening, I

00:52:10.664 --> 00:52:12.830
think, to think about what
the role could look like.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:13.805
AUDIENCE: And
finally, since I don't

00:52:13.805 --> 00:52:15.670
see anyone else
waiting for a question,

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:18.020
the elephant in the room.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:21.210
Copyright, something
that Google has

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:24.990
done that we haven't had
available to libraries-- maybe

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:26.610
it hasn't come up
in the thinking

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.920
so much-- is when a
publisher has a book,

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.660
if the government
says you have to make

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.370
it available to
everyone electronically,

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:36.070
you can't keep it
locked down as long

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:38.530
as they're looking at one
page every 10 seconds.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.350
The publishers are going to,
of course, be up in arms.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:46.070
It's very hard to
convince something

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.195
like that to go through
when they could potentially

00:52:48.195 --> 00:52:49.980
lose a lot of the
profit that motivates

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.350
them to publish this books.

00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:53.480
And if it's not available,
if it's only metadata,

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:58.000
then we lose a lot of the
value of libraries potentially.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.430
Google does like
10% to 20% preview.

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.490
Is that the sort of thing that
now that technology enables

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:09.360
it you folks are considering
it as a way to advocate

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.770
for greater book availability?

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:11.230
JOHN PALFREY: Sure.

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.438
I mean, is that a good thing?

00:53:12.438 --> 00:53:13.550
It absolutely is.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.720
And can we find the
version of fair use

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.610
that is maximally able to
make books more accessible?

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:22.110
Totally.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:24.047
I'm completely in favor of it.

00:53:24.047 --> 00:53:25.630
AUDIENCE: Just to
clarify, that is not

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:29.340
our view of fair use or
implementation of fair use.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.640
That is our implementation of
we put a clause in the contract

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.110
with the rights owner that
would allow us to do that.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.110
JOHN PALFREY: Thank you.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:37.540
This is recorded
and put on YouTube

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:38.960
and you have your own
legal interpretation.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.440
My legal interpretation is
you can do that under fair use

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.350
and it's great you have
that nice contract clause.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:46.860
So increasingly,
I think we ought

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.070
to try things that do press
what the boundaries of fair use

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.415
are in a positive way.

00:53:51.415 --> 00:53:52.790
And I ultimately
think that there

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:55.880
are ways that the authors
like myself and publishers

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:59.130
to publish these books
will get amply compensated

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.490
in this digital environment.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:02.989
I think there's going to be a
huge amount of experimentation

00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:05.571
with business models going
to that first question.

00:54:05.571 --> 00:54:07.320
And a little bit of
that is happening now.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.450
And I think more will
happen over time.

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:11.640
I think very specifically--
to get slightly geeky

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.140
on copyright law-- I
think section 108 ought

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.210
to be amended, which is
the special set of things

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:19.110
that allow libraries to
make things available.

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.630
I think there are ways to think
about it quite differently.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:23.990
Also for disabled people
it's a very important element

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.570
of things.

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.380
I think adjusting
the orphan works

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:32.220
rule would be the obvious
and almost stupidest rule

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.920
out there in the
sense that if somebody

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.420
has a work that where you don't
actually know who the copyright

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.780
holder is, the fact that
the default is that we can't

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.940
actually digitize it and
make it available in order

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.100
to let that person come to
the form, it is amazing.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.680
Who benefits from not changing
the orphan works rules?

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.540
Nobody.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.450
So I think there are
a whole pile of things

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:55.790
that we could do that are really
blindingly obvious and helpful.

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:58.310
Is it OK to take
one more, Brendan?

00:54:58.310 --> 00:54:58.810
One more.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.700
Yes, ma'am?

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:04.570
I was just curious
if you have comments

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.360
on the population of
people who are librarians

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:11.430
and whether the ones we now
have the right kinds of skills

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:13.500
and interests to help
build this thing.

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.220
Whether the librarian
education now

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.020
is teaching the
right sort of stuff.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.750
And are the people coming
through that now interested

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:25.660
in having the same
kinds of roles

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.020
as current librarians have?

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.520
JOHN PALFREY: It's
a great question,

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.360
and it's an important
one, ultimately.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.850
And I think for those who wring
their hands about the future

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:36.350
of libraries, often
the critique is

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:38.870
saying we have an aging
population of librarians who

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.160
actually don't really
think about the future.

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.790
And our library schools are not
training people for the things

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:45.620
we actually need to get done.

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.651
And is there some
argument there?

00:55:47.651 --> 00:55:49.150
Of course there's
an argument there.

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:50.640
That's not my
experience, though,

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.170
having worked in libraries.

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:56.130
And I think there is a
very large pivot going on.

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:58.050
And I think that
pivot involves people

00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:01.200
who are incredibly
devoted to ensuring

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.640
the future of libraries figuring
out a role for librarians

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.860
the does bring the digital
into the environment.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.062
It doesn't throw away the good
things that are being done.

00:56:11.062 --> 00:56:13.270
I think the hard part is,
honestly, making trade offs

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.436
and saying we actually don't
need to do that anymore

00:56:15.436 --> 00:56:19.230
or that old rule about only five
elements of metadata in a world

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.170
in which there's much
more available-- things

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:24.260
have to go the way
of the dodo bird

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.430
and the horse and
buggy and all the rest

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:29.460
and have to be replaced with
things that are wonderful.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.630
So my concern is actually
just the rate at which

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:33.460
that shift is happening.

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.300
And when people say, oh, people
aren't moving to digital books

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:36.800
so much.

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.610
They're still focused
on physical books,

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.610
and we still love libraries
and whatever, I just

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:43.870
fear that those are just
two thin reeds to cling to.

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:46.754
The world is changing vastly
more quickly than that.

00:56:46.754 --> 00:56:48.920
I actually think that many
libraries schools are now

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.770
called information
schools or I-schools.

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:52.270
Many of the faculty
in those schools

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:54.270
absolutely see what's going on.

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:56.555
And I think that's
only a good thing.

00:56:56.555 --> 00:56:57.930
But I think there's
a huge amount

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:01.650
to be done, which would take
the excitement and the things

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:05.100
that you all do in digital
technology environments

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.870
and bring that much
more into libraries.

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:09.160
And that's why I'm excited about
things like the Digital Public

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.868
Library of America
effort because I think

00:57:10.868 --> 00:57:13.610
it says all the stuff that built
the web and the internet and so

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:16.310
forth, those same principles,
those same skills,

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.996
those can make amazing things
happen in the public interest.

00:57:18.996 --> 00:57:21.120
And lots of people are
doing it, but lots of people

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.020
are doing it in for-profits
that actually do great things.

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:29.210
But too few are doing it in the
context of R&amp;D in libraries.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:32.382
And I think that's why I'd love
to see more of a shift toward.

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:34.840
But do I think that the people
who are working in libraries

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.320
are amazing and forward looking?

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.486
Absolutely.

00:57:37.486 --> 00:57:39.860
Thank you so much for having
me here at Google Cambridge.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.760
I'm very grateful.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.269
