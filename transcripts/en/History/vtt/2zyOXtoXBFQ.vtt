00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.001
- I want to talk

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.937
This thing is crazy cool.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.271
Twig furniture.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.040
A lot of people call this
Adirondack furniture, you know?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.341
MATT: Yep.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.044
MIKE WOLFE: Would have been
up in like, resort areas.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.179
That could be
over 100 years old.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.114
It's got a great look.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.616
I see it's got a
major repair here.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.951
What are you thinking?

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.552
$8,000.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.888
[laughter]

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.690
I mean, I've been around
this stuff quite a bit.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.325
I mean, this one is a
little bit different.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.193
But they're all different,
to be honest with you,

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.161
because they're handmade.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.829
Rosie's in my ear.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:30.797
She's saying $500.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.399
$450, work with
me a little bit.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.004
All right, I'll do $450.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.906
OK, very cool.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.741
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER): We
love picking the East Coast,

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.309
because there's so
much opportunity

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.445
to find Americana at its best.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.448
That's the kind of
stuff we're looking for.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.116
Yeah, I know where this goes.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.186
Yeah, that's been in
this store my whole life.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.688
I know that had to come out
of one of Rosie's classrooms.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.957
She was a school
teacher for 44 years.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.159
MIKE WOLFE: No kidding!

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.994
MATT: Yeah, she taught
the world to read.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.962
And if you look at the
countries on there,

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.466
they're so old that that's got
to be from the '40s or '50s,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.567
you know?

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.035
You look at Europe,
and it's all different.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.437
The only thing is--

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.372
I mean, there's a lot of loss
of just little pieces of paper

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.706
all over the place
on it, where it's

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.708
starting-- but other than
that, I mean, it's really cool.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.410
MATT: Cool enough
for you to buy it?

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.778
I'm in a selling mood, fella.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:19.913
75 bucks.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.548
Tell you what, make it $100.
It's vintage.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.449
I'm doing it.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.050
All right, awesome.
Thank you.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.051
I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.820
See, and you can adjust it, so--

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.221
I never even knew
that it adjusted.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.355
MIKE WOLFE: --so
Frank can see it.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.123
[laughter]

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.058
You know it.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.994
Hey, Frank, look at this
fine vintage Monticello

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.596
Distributing Company.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:37.797
Ooh, I like it.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.098
FRANK FRITZ (VOICEOVER):
The Monticello Distillery

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.533
was known for its rye whiskey.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.669
The company was named
after Thomas Jefferson's

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.170
house, which was in Virginia.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.039
But the distillery was
actually in Maryland.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.241
Special reserve,
it's all whiskey.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.309
You know what I like about this?

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.677
I mean, it's got some
nice color on it.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:51.778
There is a lot going on here.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:52.812
It's got horses.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.080
It's got the hounds.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.381
It's a metal sign.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.784
I've seen these sell
for like around $400.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.020
So I'm thinking like, $250?

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.089
How about $300?

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:06.459
How about split
it with me, $275?

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.927
- I think we can do that.
- Do that?

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.496
All right!
- $275, it's all yours.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.698
I'm getting into the liquor
situation here, I love it.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.533
What are you looking
at over here, Frankie?

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.336
I'm thinking this must
have been your grandfather's?

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.005
MATT: Well, both my grandfather
and my great Uncle Joe

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.173
were both dentists.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.908
I would probably say
this was Joseph's,

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.476
just because it's here.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.212
They actually used
this as a means

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.413
to hide the truck
from the street.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.214
This was part
of the camouflage?

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.315
Yeah.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.117
This would have had
milk glass shelves that

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.519
would have been inside of here.
MATT: Yeah.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.120
FRANK FRITZ (VOICEOVER):
This is a nice item.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.688
It has etched
glass on the front.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.357
It has a marble top.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.758
This is a great piece.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.093
Well, can I make
you an offer on it?

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.395
Sure.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.464
How about $800?

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.399
How about $850?

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.834
Leaves a little on the
bone for you, right?

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.668
Let's do it.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:49.669
Yeah, you bet, let's do it.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.004
FRANK FRITZ (VOICEOVER):
Now that Matt's

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.305
responsible for
cleaning up this place,

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.040
he's ready to get
rid of some things

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.441
that he's not
emotionally attached to.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.048
I got that radiator
from the '31 Chevy,

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.616
Mike, I know you like that.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.717
MIKE WOLFE: Ooh, this is cool.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.288
I found this scale.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.090
How about 35 bucks?

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.892
$40 and it's yours.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.895
What do you want for
the Chevrolet grille?

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.767
'31 Chevy.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:21.568
Yep.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.769
Got the badge.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.636
Car or truck.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.204
The radiator's in it.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.606
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
I love car grills.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.908
Because I think a lot of
the guys that designed

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.544
the cars designed them
from the grill back.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.948
What do you think, 100 bucks?

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.482
So, $100--

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:39.519
$140.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.486
[laughter]

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.589
All right, $140.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.990
All right, this is the
second thing that's

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.692
been sold out of this truck.
- There you go.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.060
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
Somebody out

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.330
there is looking for this grill
to finish their restoration.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.864
All right, Frankie.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.166
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
Their story

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.603
is the great American story,
to come here with nothing

00:03:56.603 --> 00:04:00.073
and to make something that
supported so many people,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.309
and that was such an intricate
part of their community--

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.510
that's the American dream.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.212
Thanks for sharing your
family's history with us.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.114
MATT: I learned a bunch
of things from them today.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.682
So some of this stuff
is going to move,

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:11.484
and other people are
going to get to enjoy it.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.251
See you guys.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.052
FRANK FRITZ: Later, Matt.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.821
Bye, Matt, god bless!
