00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.820
There are very blurred boundaries now between

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.580
objects and machines and humans
in ways that are new.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.400
We collectively are adding to a kind of engine
that is going to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.480
probably escape or exceed our control.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.520
The artist now has more access to new kinds
of high technologies.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.380
New kinds of assemblies and bodies and images
and devices.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.860
Art can function as a kind of early warning
signal, speculating about different kinds

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.560
of dystopian as well as utopian scenarios.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.800
Art is always a form of experimentation.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.360
By experiment, I mean that they donâ€™t know
what the end result is going to be.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.440
What the end result is going to be.
