00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
The sum of four consecutive
odd integers is 136.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.390
What are the four integers?

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.020
So before even
attempting to tackle it,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.970
let's think about
what it means to be

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.460
a consecutive odd integer, what
four consecutive odd integers

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.880
could be referring to.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.900
So we could start,
let's say, we had 3.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.580
The next odd integer-- so we
want consecutive odd integers.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.600
So we want the next odd
integer-- would be 5.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.820
Then the one after that
would be 7, and the one

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.090
after that would be 9.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.310
These are consecutive
odd integers.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.270
Another example-- we
could start at 11.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.390
Then the next odd integer is 13.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.010
The next one is 15.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.650
The next one is 17.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.510
The example of
non-consecutive odd integers,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.870
if someone went from
3 straight to 7,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.280
these are not consecutive.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.340
The next odd integer
after 3 is 5, not 7.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.010
So these are examples of
consecutive odd integers.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.940
These are not
consecutive odd integers.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.750
So with that out of
the way, let's actually

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.410
try to tackle this question.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.330
And I encourage you to pause
this video right now and try

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.150
to tackle this on your own
before I take a go at it.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.400
Well as you can imagine,
a little bit of algebra

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.860
might be handy here.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.460
So let's let x be equal to
the smallest of the four.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.440
So if x is the smallest of the
four consecutive odd integers,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.850
how can we express the
other three in terms of x?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.740
We'll just use these
examples right over here.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.650
If that is x, then how would
we express this in terms of x?

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.810
Well, this would be x plus 2.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.020
The next odd integer
is going to be

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.530
the previous odd integer plus 2.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.707
You're essentially
skipping the next number,

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:54.790
which is going to be even.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.650
So if you added 1, you'd
just get to an even number,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.770
so you have to add 2 to
get to the next odd one.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.880
Well if you add 2 again,
if you add 2 to x plus 2,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.790
well now you get to x plus 4.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.080
You add 2 to that.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.240
You get to x plus 6.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.550
And you see that
again right over here.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.490
If this was x, then
this is x plus 2.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.230
This is x plus 4,
and this is x plus 6.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.520
So in general, if x is the
smallest of the integers,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.140
we can define the other
three as x plus 2, x plus 4,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.410
and x plus 6.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.080
And let's take the sum of
them and set that equal to 136

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.560
and then solve for x.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.690
So the smallest one is x.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.500
Now the next smallest one
is going to be x plus 2.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.160
Now the one after that's
going to be x plus 4,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.090
and then the one after that
is going to be x plus 6.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.880
So this is the sum of the
four consecutive odd integers,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.480
and they tell us that that
is going to be equal to 136.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.050
This is equal to 136.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.210
And now we can just
literally solve for x.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.500
We have this one unknown here.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.710
So let's add these
x terms together.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.030
So we have one x, two
x's, three x's, four x's.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.940
So we can rewrite
those literally as 4x.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.080
And then we have 2 plus 4, which
is 6, plus another 6 is 12.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.720
4x plus 12 is equal to 136.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.610
So to solve for x, a
good starting point

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.620
would be to just to
isolate the x terms

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.269
on one side of the equation
or try to get rid of this 12.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.810
Well to get rid of
that 12, we'd want

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.490
to subtract 12 from
the left-hand side.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.980
But we can't just do it
from the left-hand side.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.760
Then this equality
wouldn't hold anymore.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.980
If these two things were equal
before subtracting the 12,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.800
well then if we want
to keep them equal,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
if we want the left and
the right to stay equal,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.720
we've got to subtract
12 from both sides.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.770
So subtracting 12
from both sides

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.210
gives us, well on the left-hand
side, we're just left with 4x.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.840
And on the right-hand side,
we are left with 136 minus 12

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.587
is 124.

00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:04.420
Did I do that right?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.280
Yeah, 124.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.960
So what is x?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.750
Well, we just divide both
sides by 4 to solve for x.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.560
And we get-- do that in
the same, original color--

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.210
x is equal to 124 divided by 4.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.900
So let's see.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.720
100 divided by 4 is 25.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.730
24 divided by 4 is 6.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.386
25 plus 6 is 31.

00:04:32.386 --> 00:04:34.510
And if you don't feel like
doing that in your head,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.843
you could also, of course,
do traditional long division.

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:40.390
Goes into 124-- 4
doesn't go into 1.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.780
4 goes into 12 three times.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.140
3 times 4 is 12.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.216
You subtract, bring
down the next 4.

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:49.230
4 goes into 4 one time.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.460
You get no remainder.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.690
So x is equal to 31.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.890
So x is the smallest
of the four integers.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.290
So this right over
here, x is 31.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.210
x plus 2 is going to be 33.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.560
x plus 4 is going to be 35.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.240
And x plus 6 is going to be 37.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.340
So our four consecutive
odd integers

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.500
are 31, 33, 35, and 37.
