first of all we're going to have a
problem in about 10 years right now

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
problem in about 10 years right now

we've got to take into account longevity

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059
we've got to take into account longevity

people live to be 65 now they live to be
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.049
people live to be 65 now they live to be
85 and so we need to do something about

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
85 and so we need to do something about
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.630
85 and so we need to do something about
that but this is this is not rocket

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
that but this is this is not rocket
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910
that but this is this is not rocket
science this is something that we could

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
science this is something that we could
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830
science this is something that we could
do if we sat down and the two parties

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
do if we sat down and the two parties
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.590
do if we sat down and the two parties
reason together and so that what makes

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
reason together and so that what makes

standpoint Medicare is not sustainable
in its current form but that's because

current form Medicare is a kind of a
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410
current form Medicare is a kind of a
subset of health care and it's the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
subset of health care and it's the
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.969
subset of health care and it's the
health care system that we have to fix

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979
 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.160

the easy one what we could do is is get
the two parties together and what I've

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
the two parties together and what I've
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.270
the two parties together and what I've
been saying in Congress is look it's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
been saying in Congress is look it's
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.249

going to take two miracles to fix Social
 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469
going to take two miracles to fix Social
Security one miracle is that you

Republicans and Democrats are going to
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740
Republicans and Democrats are going to
have to sit down at the same table and

have to sit down at the same table and
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.289
have to sit down at the same table and
reason together and come up with a fair

equitable plan for long-term solvency
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510
equitable plan for long-term solvency
and the second miracle is that the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
and the second miracle is that the
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.969
and the second miracle is that the
public is going to have to buy it and I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
public is going to have to buy it and I
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010
public is going to have to buy it and I
think that AARP can help deliver on that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
think that AARP can help deliver on that
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.469
think that AARP can help deliver on that
second miracle when we go out and talk

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
second miracle when we go out and talk
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.660
second miracle when we go out and talk
to our members and other you know

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
to our members and other you know
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719

Security we tell them what the problems

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
Security we tell them what the problems
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.830
Security we tell them what the problems
are and they are willing to engage it's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
not the third rail that politicians like
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660
not the third rail that politicians like
to talk about so we can get that one

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
to talk about so we can get that one
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.430
to talk about so we can get that one
done political will is what we need the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
done political will is what we need the
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.370

the conversation we had on health care

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960
the conversation we had on health care
 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.380
the conversation we had on health care
is where we have to go we've got to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
is where we have to go we've got to
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.900
is where we have to go we've got to
squeeze down costs which we can do we've

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
squeeze down costs which we can do we've
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.640
squeeze down costs which we can do we've
got to cover the uninsured which we can

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
got to cover the uninsured which we can
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.770
got to cover the uninsured which we can
do and we've got to improve quality of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
do and we've got to improve quality of
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.420
do and we've got to improve quality of
care through things like health

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
care through things like health

prescribing so that we cut down the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
prescribing so that we cut down the
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.440
prescribing so that we cut down the
errors in health care and improve the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
errors in health care and improve the
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.570
errors in health care and improve the
quality of care we can do all these

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
quality of care we can do all these
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.550
quality of care we can do all these
things but it's very hard because of the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
things but it's very hard because of the
 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.860
things but it's very hard because of the
complexity of the system and because of

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
complexity of the system and because of
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.360
complexity of the system and because of
the political stalemate in which we find

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370
the political stalemate in which we find
 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:50.330
the political stalemate in which we find
ourselves it's a tough question people

ourselves it's a tough question people

ourselves it's a tough question people
do not like that idea now you know if

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
do not like that idea now you know if
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.190
do not like that idea now you know if
you're 41 or under right now you're

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
you're 41 or under right now you're
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880
you're 41 or under right now you're
going to have to work to your 67 but at

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
going to have to work to your 67 but at
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.310
going to have to work to your 67 but at
the same time many people want to work

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320
the same time many people want to work
 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.430
the same time many people want to work
into their older years there's another

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
into their older years there's another
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.720
into their older years there's another
way to think about it which has been

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
way to think about it which has been
 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.670
way to think about it which has been
called longevity indexing and some

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
called longevity indexing and some
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.410
called longevity indexing and some
countries do this and what they

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
countries do this and what they
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.120
countries do this and what they
basically say is ok let's actually

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
basically say is ok let's actually
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.030
basically say is ok let's actually
figure out how long you're expected to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040
figure out how long you're expected to
 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.310
figure out how long you're expected to
live and we'll give you your Social

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320
live and we'll give you your Social
 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.530
live and we'll give you your Social
Security money stretched out over that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
Security money stretched out over that
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.290
Security money stretched out over that
period of time so you get less money per

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300
period of time so you get less money per
 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.230
period of time so you get less money per
year over a longer period of years

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240
year over a longer period of years
 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.940
year over a longer period of years
that's one way to think about it there

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
that's one way to think about it there
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.560
that's one way to think about it there
are a lot of ways to consider fixing

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
are a lot of ways to consider fixing
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.690
are a lot of ways to consider fixing
this
