00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:15.779
war or opposed to their involvement in
the war but that was just a sign of the

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:15.789
the war but that was just a sign of the
 

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:18.029
the war but that was just a sign of the
times as well so they had different

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039
times as well so they had different
 

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:19.709
times as well so they had different
reasons for doing that but yeah there's

00:21:19.709 --> 00:21:19.719
reasons for doing that but yeah there's
 

00:21:19.719 --> 00:21:21.379
reasons for doing that but yeah there's
a there's a wonderful documentary of

00:21:21.379 --> 00:21:21.389
a there's a wonderful documentary of
 

00:21:21.389 --> 00:21:24.119
a there's a wonderful documentary of
speaking of documentaries on case on and

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:24.129
speaking of documentaries on case on and
 

00:21:24.129 --> 00:21:25.799
speaking of documentaries on case on and
there's some questions that are asked

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:25.809
there's some questions that are asked
 

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:26.789
there's some questions that are asked
about do you know why are you wearing

00:21:30.209 --> 00:21:30.219
in a marine and case on things like well
 

00:21:30.219 --> 00:21:31.499
in a marine and case on things like well
I'm doing because everyone else is doing

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:31.509
I'm doing because everyone else is doing
 

00:21:31.509 --> 00:21:34.769
I'm doing because everyone else is doing
it oh absolutely some were very very

00:21:34.769 --> 00:21:34.779
it oh absolutely some were very very
 

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:37.409
it oh absolutely some were very very
much very much absolutely and it's a

00:21:37.409 --> 00:21:37.419
much very much absolutely and it's a
 

00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:39.149
much very much absolutely and it's a
very very powerful symbol as well so but

00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159
very very powerful symbol as well so but
 

00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:42.959
very very powerful symbol as well so but
it spreads the the you know the reasons

00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:42.969
it spreads the the you know the reasons
 

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:59.560
it spreads the the you know the reasons
behind that yeah

00:21:59.560 --> 00:21:59.570
 
 

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.120
 
absolutely and I think just in this very

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.130
absolutely and I think just in this very
 

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.150
absolutely and I think just in this very
brief extra so yeah go ahead sorry in

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:05.160
brief extra so yeah go ahead sorry in
 

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.130
brief extra so yeah go ahead sorry in
the documentary they showed the general

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140
the documentary they showed the general
 

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.100
the documentary they showed the general
ball execution the actual execution that

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.110
ball execution the actual execution that
 

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.910
ball execution the actual execution that
yielded that iconic image and the

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:12.920
yielded that iconic image and the
 

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.620
yielded that iconic image and the
juxtaposition of those two is really

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:15.630
juxtaposition of those two is really
 

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.780
juxtaposition of those two is really
profound is that having seen that image

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:17.790
profound is that having seen that image
 

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.630
profound is that having seen that image
so many times but then to see him in the

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640
so many times but then to see him in the
 

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.299
so many times but then to see him in the
casual way that he points the gun fires

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:23.309
casual way that he points the gun fires
 

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:28.010
casual way that he points the gun fires
he's walking it's really disturbing it

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020
he's walking it's really disturbing it
 

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.740
he's walking it's really disturbing it
was it was very disturbing for many in

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:30.750
was it was very disturbing for many in
 

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.930
was it was very disturbing for many in
the United States who didn't understand

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940
the United States who didn't understand
 

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.030
the United States who didn't understand
the story behind it absolutely and it's

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:35.040
the story behind it absolutely and it's
 

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.799
the story behind it absolutely and it's
a longer story and a very controversial

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:36.809
a longer story and a very controversial
 

00:22:36.809 --> 00:22:38.240
a longer story and a very controversial
story in terms of what was but that

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.250
story in terms of what was but that
 

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.590
story in terms of what was but that
image really begins to capture what many

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600
image really begins to capture what many
 

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.299
image really begins to capture what many
individuals in the United States how

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:44.309
individuals in the United States how
 

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:46.310
individuals in the United States how
they sort of experience the war and

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320
they sort of experience the war and
 

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.380
they sort of experience the war and
began to express their their feelings

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:48.390
began to express their their feelings
 

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.480
began to express their their feelings
emotions about the war I think just in

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:50.490
emotions about the war I think just in
 

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.850
emotions about the war I think just in
looking at this briefly that reinforces

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860
looking at this briefly that reinforces
 

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.740
looking at this briefly that reinforces
a lot of what Tracy just said about how

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:54.750
a lot of what Tracy just said about how
 

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.360
a lot of what Tracy just said about how
we we look at images and how we

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:56.370
we we look at images and how we
 

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.820
we we look at images and how we
interpret images and the significance of

00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:58.830
interpret images and the significance of
 

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.860
interpret images and the significance of
that and what we're going to do is we

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:00.870
that and what we're going to do is we
 

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.260
that and what we're going to do is we
have three sets of images that we're

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:03.270
have three sets of images that we're
 

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.470
have three sets of images that we're
going to look at and work on and this

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480
going to look at and work on and this
 

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.140
going to look at and work on and this
this first image I think we'll go

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:09.150
this first image I think we'll go
 

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.970
this first image I think we'll go
through if I might we'll go through the

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980
through if I might we'll go through the
 

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.220
through if I might we'll go through the
worksheet and maybe we'll just do it as

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.230
worksheet and maybe we'll just do it as
 

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.460
worksheet and maybe we'll just do it as
a group look at the the different things

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:16.470
a group look at the the different things
 

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.799
a group look at the the different things
the the observations the inference and

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:18.809
the the observations the inference and
 

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:21.530
the the observations the inference and
the questions and kind of get a sense of

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:21.540
the questions and kind of get a sense of
 

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.560
the questions and kind of get a sense of
what you make of this image but you know

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.570
what you make of this image but you know
 

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.120
what you make of this image but you know
as you say one of the other things that

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.130
as you say one of the other things that
 

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.680
as you say one of the other things that
we can think about in terms of images

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:27.690
we can think about in terms of images
 

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.450
we can think about in terms of images
that certainly comes across with the

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460
that certainly comes across with the
 

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.130
that certainly comes across with the
lynching example I gave and also our

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140
lynching example I gave and also our
 

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.169
lynching example I gave and also our
conversation about images that we think

00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179
conversation about images that we think
 

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:35.930
conversation about images that we think
of we think of Vietnam as educators we

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940
of we think of Vietnam as educators we
 

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.990
of we think of Vietnam as educators we
talk often about being sensitive to what

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000
talk often about being sensitive to what
 

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.039
talk often about being sensitive to what
our students bring into the classroom

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:40.049
our students bring into the classroom
 

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:45.020
our students bring into the classroom
particularly to the prior knowledge but

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.030
particularly to the prior knowledge but
 

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.030
particularly to the prior knowledge but
i think they also we know they bring in

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.040
i think they also we know they bring in
 

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.010
i think they also we know they bring in
emotions as well about all kinds of

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020
emotions as well about all kinds of
 

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.360
emotions as well about all kinds of
things particularly about difficult to

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:50.370
things particularly about difficult to
 

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.700
things particularly about difficult to
discuss things race being one example

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:52.710
discuss things race being one example
 

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.100
discuss things race being one example
and so one of the things that images do

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:55.110
and so one of the things that images do
 

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.810
and so one of the things that images do
I think sometimes more powerfully than

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820
I think sometimes more powerfully than
 

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.620
I think sometimes more powerfully than
print sources do is touch into those

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:00.630
print sources do is touch into those
 

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.560
print sources do is touch into those
deeply held

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:02.570
deeply held
 

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.710
deeply held
beliefs and convictions those kind of

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720
beliefs and convictions those kind of
 

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.600
beliefs and convictions those kind of
emotions and those beliefs not just

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:08.610
emotions and those beliefs not just
 

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.830
emotions and those beliefs not just
their knowledge because sometimes the

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840
their knowledge because sometimes the
 

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.799
their knowledge because sometimes the
feeling and the belief and the

00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:12.809
feeling and the belief and the
 

00:24:12.809 --> 00:24:14.870
feeling and the belief and the
conviction are at odds with the

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880
conviction are at odds with the
 

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.419
conviction are at odds with the
knowledge and so it's helpful again to

00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:17.429
knowledge and so it's helpful again to
 

00:24:17.429 --> 00:24:18.769
knowledge and so it's helpful again to
think about this principle of juxta

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:18.779
think about this principle of juxta
 

00:24:18.779 --> 00:24:20.720
think about this principle of juxta
bisson juxtaposition we're not just

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:20.730
bisson juxtaposition we're not just
 

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.659
bisson juxtaposition we're not just
juxtaposing a photograph in a

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:23.669
juxtaposing a photograph in a
 

00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:25.490
juxtaposing a photograph in a
documentary source we're often in the

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500
documentary source we're often in the
 

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.500
documentary source we're often in the
process juxtaposing belief and knowledge

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:27.510
process juxtaposing belief and knowledge
 

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:32.180
process juxtaposing belief and knowledge
and emotion and the Vietnam War is you

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.190
and emotion and the Vietnam War is you
 

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.010
and emotion and the Vietnam War is you
probably already know and experience

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020
probably already know and experience
 

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.570
probably already know and experience
over the last couple days will challenge

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580
over the last couple days will challenge
 

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.299
over the last couple days will challenge
all the beliefs and all the emotions

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:38.309
all the beliefs and all the emotions
 

00:24:38.309 --> 00:24:40.700
all the beliefs and all the emotions
that that you bring into it and will

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:40.710
that that you bring into it and will
 

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.250
that that you bring into it and will
continue to challenge those those ideas

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260
continue to challenge those those ideas
 

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.930
continue to challenge those those ideas
as you will find them and shape them as

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940
as you will find them and shape them as
 

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.960
as you will find them and shape them as
you teach them to your students so we

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:47.970
you teach them to your students so we
 

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.850
you teach them to your students so we
will take this image will do this as a

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860
will take this image will do this as a
 

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.889
will take this image will do this as a
group because I'm not going to give you

00:24:51.889 --> 00:24:51.899
group because I'm not going to give you
 

00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:53.690
group because I'm not going to give you
any background to the image but i'll

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700
any background to the image but i'll
 

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.070
any background to the image but i'll
tell you a little story about it maybe

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080
tell you a little story about it maybe
 

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.260
tell you a little story about it maybe
after we finish this part of the

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:57.270
after we finish this part of the
 

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.190
after we finish this part of the
exercise but as you look at this image

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200
exercise but as you look at this image
 

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.310
exercise but as you look at this image
what are the observables here what draws

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320
what are the observables here what draws
 

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:12.289
what are the observables here what draws
you yeah thank you ok so we have do we

00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299
you yeah thank you ok so we have do we
 

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:13.639
you yeah thank you ok so we have do we
want to buy my quadrant was that the

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:13.649
want to buy my quadrant was that the
 

00:25:13.649 --> 00:25:15.860
want to buy my quadrant was that the
idea or doesn't matter isn't it just ok

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:15.870
idea or doesn't matter isn't it just ok
 

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.470
idea or doesn't matter isn't it just ok
ok so yeah just you know take it take a

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480
ok so yeah just you know take it take a
 

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.180
ok so yeah just you know take it take a
min or two and take a look at it so

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:20.190
min or two and take a look at it so
 

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:34.519
min or two and take a look at it so
certainly race yeah ok ok so certainly

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:34.529
certainly race yeah ok ok so certainly
 

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:36.440
certainly race yeah ok ok so certainly
there's a difference in a tire and

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.450
there's a difference in a tire and
 

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.159
there's a difference in a tire and
that's so good observable is going yes

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:40.169
that's so good observable is going yes
 

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:42.830
that's so good observable is going yes
sir kind of the juxtaposition of old and

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840
sir kind of the juxtaposition of old and
 

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.899
sir kind of the juxtaposition of old and
young it was sort of an older gentleman

00:25:44.899 --> 00:25:44.909
young it was sort of an older gentleman
 

00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:47.539
young it was sort of an older gentleman
in the background that then is small why

00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:47.549
in the background that then is small why
 

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:52.450
in the background that then is small why
right Franz ok so old and young

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:52.460
right Franz ok so old and young
 

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.980
right Franz ok so old and young
absolutely so what else do you see yeah

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:54.990
absolutely so what else do you see yeah
 

00:25:54.990 --> 00:26:02.090
absolutely so what else do you see yeah
no yeah all right absolutely which

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100
no yeah all right absolutely which
 

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.980
no yeah all right absolutely which
raises that question will get into the

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:03.990
raises that question will get into the
 

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:09.139
raises that question will get into the
inverters of why well let's do yeah they

00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:09.149
inverters of why well let's do yeah they
 

00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:10.610
inverters of why well let's do yeah they
look like they're in the middle of doing

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620
look like they're in the middle of doing
 

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.830
look like they're in the middle of doing
something or on their way in there's

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840
something or on their way in there's
 

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.649
something or on their way in there's
activity it's not staged photo yeah

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659
activity it's not staged photo yeah
 

00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:16.909
activity it's not staged photo yeah
there's there's motion there's an

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919
there's there's motion there's an
 

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:18.139
there's there's motion there's an
activity something's going there's

activity something's going there's
 

00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:36.590
activity something's going there's
action ok so there's certainly the yet

action ok so there's certainly the yet
 

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.510
action ok so there's certainly the yet
there's a there's a military component

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520
there's a there's a military component
 

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.480
there's a there's a military component
here they're actually both Navy but but

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:41.490
here they're actually both Navy but but
 

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.680
here they're actually both Navy but but
there's the rosette no military

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:42.690
there's the rosette no military
 

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:49.769
there's the rosette no military
component

00:26:49.769 --> 00:26:49.779
 
 

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:53.070
 
image the way that the gentleman the

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080
image the way that the gentleman the
 

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.609
image the way that the gentleman the
left is dress looks like he could serve

00:26:56.609 --> 00:26:56.619
left is dress looks like he could serve
 

00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:58.560

some kind of religious purpose or

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:58.570
some kind of religious purpose or
 

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.190
some kind of religious purpose or
ceremonial purpose and this woman on the

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200
ceremonial purpose and this woman on the
 

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:08.089
ceremonial purpose and this woman on the
right side of our to tell she is the

00:27:08.089 --> 00:27:08.099
right side of our to tell she is the
 

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:10.529
right side of our to tell she is the
head what she's wearing in her head I

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:10.539
head what she's wearing in her head I
 

00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:23.530
head what she's wearing in her head I
don't know

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:23.540
 
 

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.820
 
okay so certainly we can observe there

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:25.830
okay so certainly we can observe there
 

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.140
okay so certainly we can observe there
is there is a religious component

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:27.150
is there is a religious component
 

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:43.430
is there is a religious component
attached to the image okay so there you

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440
attached to the image okay so there you
 

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.260
attached to the image okay so there you
can observe a clash of cultures I guess

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:45.270
can observe a clash of cultures I guess
 

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.400
can observe a clash of cultures I guess
maybe we didn't Fuhrer clash of cultures

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:46.410
maybe we didn't Fuhrer clash of cultures
 

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.230
maybe we didn't Fuhrer clash of cultures
with Jim's inferred you could probably

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240
with Jim's inferred you could probably
 

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.600
with Jim's inferred you could probably
do both by suppose but absolutely but

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:50.610
do both by suppose but absolutely but
 

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.130
do both by suppose but absolutely but
there's there's there is the the

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140
there's there's there is the the
 

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.700
there's there's there is the the
appearance of language difficulty and

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:55.710
appearance of language difficulty and
 

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.230
appearance of language difficulty and
certainly there's a difference of

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240
certainly there's a difference of
 

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:11.300
certainly there's a difference of
culture ya know okay but she's in it

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:11.310
culture ya know okay but she's in it
 

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.100
culture ya know okay but she's in it
within that action there's caring there

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.110
within that action there's caring there
 

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:24.740
within that action there's caring there
seems to be possessions involved okay

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:24.750
seems to be possessions involved okay
 

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.570
seems to be possessions involved okay
yeah any other descriptions yeah

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580
yeah any other descriptions yeah
 

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.370
yeah any other descriptions yeah
anything else that you see it's hard it

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380
anything else that you see it's hard it
 

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.860
anything else that you see it's hard it
you're right but it's hard we we do

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:30.870
you're right but it's hard we we do
 

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.420
you're right but it's hard we we do
every one skips that first step and I

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:32.430
every one skips that first step and I
 

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.950
every one skips that first step and I
did too when I first look at the image

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960
did too when I first look at the image
 

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:41.210
did too when I first look at the image
so

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220
 
 

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.290
 
okay certainly had the facial

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:43.300
okay certainly had the facial
 

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.360
okay certainly had the facial
expressions i think tell potentially a

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:45.370
expressions i think tell potentially a
 

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:59.040
expressions i think tell potentially a
story here as well yes sir absolutely

00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.050
story here as well yes sir absolutely
 

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.770
story here as well yes sir absolutely

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:01.780
says she is stage center she's the focus
 

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.960
says she is stage center she's the focus

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:03.970
of the imaging well the gesture and a
 

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:09.780
of the imaging well the gesture and a
lot of people draws you towards the the

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:09.790
lot of people draws you towards the the
 

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.540
lot of people draws you towards the the
arm it towards this piece in the

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:12.550
arm it towards this piece in the
 

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.330
arm it towards this piece in the
photograph which is undefined and then

you just got this arms who else is sort

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:20.980
you just got this arms who else is sort
 

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.170
you just got this arms who else is sort
of in this scene that we're not see is a

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:25.180
of in this scene that we're not see is a
 

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:37.500
of in this scene that we're not see is a
possibility of cropping or yes it within

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:37.510
possibility of cropping or yes it within
 

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.600
possibility of cropping or yes it within
that sort of the action or the motions

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:39.610
that sort of the action or the motions
 

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.550
that sort of the action or the motions
is moving in this direction looking at

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:41.560
is moving in this direction looking at
 

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.890
is moving in this direction looking at
that person whoever it is well we

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:46.900
that person whoever it is well we
 

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.870
that person whoever it is well we
observe yeah yeah we go in terms of the

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880
observe yeah yeah we go in terms of the
 

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.090
observe yeah yeah we go in terms of the
observables I mean she's she's I think

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:51.100
observables I mean she's she's I think
 

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.180
observables I mean she's she's I think
the expression is well that's what drew

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:54.190
the expression is well that's what drew
 

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.040
the expression is well that's what drew
me to the picture and when I first

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.050
me to the picture and when I first
 

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.100
me to the picture and when I first
looked at it so and then in terms of

00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.110
looked at it so and then in terms of
 

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.560
looked at it so and then in terms of
inference what would we we've already

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:01.570
inference what would we we've already
 

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.690
inference what would we we've already
begun to sort of infer what the picture

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:03.700
begun to sort of infer what the picture
 

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:16.980
begun to sort of infer what the picture
means yes sir he's trying to get

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:16.990
means yes sir he's trying to get
 

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:25.650
means yes sir he's trying to get
instructions but

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:25.660
 
 

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.850
 
alright let's focus on him for a second

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:27.860
alright let's focus on him for a second
 

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.780
alright let's focus on him for a second
then we have the the lieutenant in the

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:30.790
then we have the the lieutenant in the
 

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.660
then we have the the lieutenant in the
sort of center left of the image when we

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:34.670
sort of center left of the image when we
 

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.640
sort of center left of the image when we
could infer that he's perhaps annoyed

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:36.650
could infer that he's perhaps annoyed
 

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.280
could infer that he's perhaps annoyed
what else could we infer from that from

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:39.290
what else could we infer from that from
 

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.440
what else could we infer from that from
looking at that so I think you can make

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:41.450
looking at that so I think you can make
 

00:30:41.450 --> 00:31:01.440
looking at that so I think you can make
many different inferences yes

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:01.450
 
 

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.599
 
anybody ever served in the Navy here

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:03.609
anybody ever served in the Navy here
 

00:31:03.609 --> 00:31:05.379
anybody ever served in the Navy here
they would never say they're well fed

00:31:05.379 --> 00:31:05.389
they would never say they're well fed
 

00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:07.570
they would never say they're well fed
maybe but yeah but you're right i mean

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:07.580
maybe but yeah but you're right i mean
 

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.209
maybe but yeah but you're right i mean
that if that says so we can we can infer

00:31:10.209 --> 00:31:10.219
that if that says so we can we can infer
 

00:31:10.219 --> 00:31:14.320
that if that says so we can we can infer
that that perhaps she's a refugee and in

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:14.330
that that perhaps she's a refugee and in
 

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.639
that that perhaps she's a refugee and in
this observation who we have a

00:31:15.639 --> 00:31:15.649
this observation who we have a
 

00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:19.119
this observation who we have a
difference in in how we observe it he

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:19.129
difference in in how we observe it he
 

00:31:19.129 --> 00:31:21.219
difference in in how we observe it he
doesn't appear annoyed in your sense he

00:31:21.219 --> 00:31:21.229
doesn't appear annoyed in your sense he
 

00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:23.049

there's a number of these images at the
 

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.750
there's a number of these images at the
website we're going to be looking at

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760
website we're going to be looking at
 

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.700
website we're going to be looking at
later on the Vietnam archive website you

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:23.710
later on the Vietnam archive website you
 

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:25.200
later on the Vietnam archive website you
can see a number of these pictures and I

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.210
can see a number of these pictures and I
 

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:27.150
can see a number of these pictures and I
actually included a number from after I

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160
actually included a number from after I
 

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.650
actually included a number from after I
finished my research but you can see

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:28.660
finished my research but you can see
 

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.850
finished my research but you can see
that this sort of the chaos that's

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:29.860
that this sort of the chaos that's
 

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.430
that this sort of the chaos that's
involved in the operation let's go to

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440
involved in the operation let's go to
 

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.320
involved in the operation let's go to
the next one I think in terms of just

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:34.330
the next one I think in terms of just
 

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:37.110
the next one I think in terms of just
our art time we want to do something

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:37.120
our art time we want to do something
 

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.050
our art time we want to do something
similar to what we did to the first but

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.060
similar to what we did to the first but
 

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.760
similar to what we did to the first but
I think if I'm correct what we're going

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:41.770
I think if I'm correct what we're going
 

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.260
I think if I'm correct what we're going
to do is divide the class sort of

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:43.270
to do is divide the class sort of
 

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:44.940
to do is divide the class sort of

00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:16.420
yeah yeah cut out the star daj to be
okay put a bit but it but that's the

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:16.430
okay put a bit but it but that's the
 

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:20.589
okay put a bit but it but that's the
beauty of how we interpret documents

00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599
beauty of how we interpret documents
 

00:59:20.599 --> 00:59:22.690
beauty of how we interpret documents
oral histories in this case and images

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:22.700
oral histories in this case and images
 

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:56.859
oral histories in this case and images
because we into this time high and don't

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:56.869
because we into this time high and don't
 

00:59:56.869 --> 01:00:08.109
because we into this time high and don't
know that when these photos absolutely

01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119
know that when these photos absolutely
 

01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:09.670
know that when these photos absolutely
and one of the reasons why we didn't put

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680
and one of the reasons why we didn't put
 

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.220
and one of the reasons why we didn't put
that identification on which we wanted

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:12.230
that identification on which we wanted
 

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:14.920
that identification on which we wanted
people to ask themselves as a matter of

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:14.930
people to ask themselves as a matter of
 

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:18.099
people to ask themselves as a matter of
protocol well when that was the question

01:00:18.099 --> 01:00:18.109
protocol well when that was the question
 

01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:20.109
protocol well when that was the question
that you didn't know and then we could

01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119
that you didn't know and then we could
 

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:23.650
that you didn't know and then we could
ask ourselves once we do knows 2001 you

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:23.660
ask ourselves once we do knows 2001 you
 

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.140
ask ourselves once we do knows 2001 you
know if it was 1954 how would that be

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:26.150
know if it was 1954 how would that be
 

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.299
know if it was 1954 how would that be
different yeah because the issue of

01:00:28.299 --> 01:00:28.309
different yeah because the issue of
 

01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:33.999
different yeah because the issue of
history and memory exactly the war the

01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:34.009
history and memory exactly the war the
 

01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:35.979
history and memory exactly the war the
issue about the wall and everything

01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:35.989
issue about the wall and everything
 

01:00:35.989 --> 01:00:40.180
issue about the wall and everything
about how so to me this makes a huge

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:40.190
about how so to me this makes a huge
 

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:43.440
about how so to me this makes a huge
difference filtered through this person

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:43.450
difference filtered through this person
 

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:46.630
difference filtered through this person
and then oh it's a big chunk of years oh

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640
and then oh it's a big chunk of years oh
 

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.430
and then oh it's a big chunk of years oh
yeah yeah and there's no way to do if I

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440
yeah yeah and there's no way to do if I
 

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.499
yeah yeah and there's no way to do if I
was no way to ascertain from the texts

01:00:50.499 --> 01:00:50.509
was no way to ascertain from the texts
 

01:00:50.509 --> 01:00:58.380
was no way to ascertain from the texts
themselves

01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:58.390
 
 

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:00.460
 
brighton well we wanted you to fly a

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:00.470
brighton well we wanted you to fly a
 

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:12.150
brighton well we wanted you to fly a
little bit line it's not just a culture

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160
 
 

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:22.030
 
which is much so this in my opinion

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:22.040
which is much so this in my opinion
 

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:32.290
which is much so this in my opinion
would be explaining right he obviously

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:32.300
would be explaining right he obviously
 

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.050
would be explaining right he obviously
wasn't good yeah here's a j2ee here

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:35.060
wasn't good yeah here's a j2ee here
 

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.330
wasn't good yeah here's a j2ee here
right now lieutenant JG that's what he

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:37.340
right now lieutenant JG that's what he
 

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:41.830
right now lieutenant JG that's what he
was there so they gave my interpreters

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:41.840
was there so they gave my interpreters
 

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:53.460
was there so they gave my interpreters
to their troops you know common order

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:53.470
 
 

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:56.110
 
that's right kind of like the joke was

01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:56.120
that's right kind of like the joke was
 

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.090
that's right kind of like the joke was
on us that we didn't get that from the

01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:58.100
on us that we didn't get that from the
 

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:09.630
on us that we didn't get that from the
get-go

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640
 
 

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.850
 
but I also you know it's clearly

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:12.860
but I also you know it's clearly
 

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.430
but I also you know it's clearly
interviewed was

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440
 
 

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.469
 
raises the question of whether if you

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:19.479
raises the question of whether if you
 

01:02:19.479 --> 01:02:39.739
raises the question of whether if you
were framed this one piece yeah it was

01:02:39.739 --> 01:02:39.749
were framed this one piece yeah it was
 

01:02:39.749 --> 01:02:43.079
were framed this one piece yeah it was
yeah yeah it was a couple hums in hauz

01:02:43.079 --> 01:02:43.089
yeah yeah it was a couple hums in hauz
 

01:02:43.089 --> 01:02:45.809
yeah yeah it was a couple hums in hauz
there was there were no actual words I

01:02:45.809 --> 01:02:45.819
there was there were no actual words I
 

01:02:45.819 --> 01:02:48.420
there was there were no actual words I
mean no actual no no words that convey

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:48.430
mean no actual no no words that convey
 

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:56.339
mean no actual no no words that convey
meaning but yeah they had their own yeah

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:56.349
meaning but yeah they had their own yeah
 

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:58.710
meaning but yeah they had their own yeah
and when you go well the oral histories

01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720
and when you go well the oral histories
 

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.239
and when you go well the oral histories
are I know if you guys have a lesson on

01:03:00.239 --> 01:03:00.249
are I know if you guys have a lesson on
 

01:03:00.249 --> 01:03:01.739
are I know if you guys have a lesson on
oral histories that's another whole day

01:03:01.739 --> 01:03:01.749
oral histories that's another whole day
 

01:03:01.749 --> 01:03:07.019
oral histories that's another whole day
or if you've already had it okay yeah in

01:03:07.019 --> 01:03:07.029
or if you've already had it okay yeah in
 

01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:09.180
or if you've already had it okay yeah in
terms of how one approaches oral

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:09.190
terms of how one approaches oral
 

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:10.529
terms of how one approaches oral
histories and certainly with memory

01:03:10.529 --> 01:03:10.539
histories and certainly with memory
 

01:03:10.539 --> 01:03:12.479
histories and certainly with memory
because this is again 45 years after day

01:03:12.479 --> 01:03:12.489
because this is again 45 years after day
 

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.359
because this is again 45 years after day
so I went through a longer process of

01:03:14.359 --> 01:03:14.369
so I went through a longer process of
 

01:03:14.369 --> 01:03:16.289
so I went through a longer process of
usually some some pre interview

01:03:16.289 --> 01:03:16.299
usually some some pre interview
 

01:03:16.299 --> 01:03:20.009
usually some some pre interview
questions and most of them offered

01:03:20.009 --> 01:03:20.019
questions and most of them offered
 

01:03:20.019 --> 01:03:21.690
questions and most of them offered
photographs and we would work through

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:21.700
photographs and we would work through
 

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.549
photographs and we would work through
those photographs or i would i would

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559
those photographs or i would i would
 

01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:26.670
those photographs or i would i would
offer them some some images but you

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680
offer them some some images but you
 

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.259
offer them some some images but you
don't want to taint the world history by

01:03:28.259 --> 01:03:28.269
don't want to taint the world history by
 

01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:30.660
don't want to taint the world history by
providing a spin on how you want it to

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:30.670
providing a spin on how you want it to
 

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:33.329
providing a spin on how you want it to
be how you want it to happen because my

01:03:33.329 --> 01:03:33.339
be how you want it to happen because my
 

01:03:33.339 --> 01:03:34.680
be how you want it to happen because my
purpose was just to get their their

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:34.690
purpose was just to get their their
 

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:38.459
purpose was just to get their their
their emotions i had the history and

01:03:38.459 --> 01:03:38.469
their emotions i had the history and
 

01:03:38.469 --> 01:03:39.719
their emotions i had the history and
actually a lot of them forgot the

01:03:39.719 --> 01:03:39.729
actually a lot of them forgot the
 

01:03:39.729 --> 01:03:42.150
actually a lot of them forgot the
history because again this is for them

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160
history because again this is for them
 

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.579
history because again this is for them
the 326 12-day period but what struck me

01:03:44.579 --> 01:03:44.589
the 326 12-day period but what struck me
 

01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:46.170
the 326 12-day period but what struck me
is amazing when i talk to these guys is

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:46.180
is amazing when i talk to these guys is
 

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.209
is amazing when i talk to these guys is
they remember detailed events of the

01:03:48.209 --> 01:03:48.219
they remember detailed events of the
 

01:03:48.219 --> 01:03:49.259
they remember detailed events of the
three days they spent with the

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:49.269
three days they spent with the
 

01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:52.200
three days they spent with the
vietnamese 46 years after now they

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:52.210
vietnamese 46 years after now they
 

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.959
vietnamese 46 years after now they
couldn't remember you know anything else

01:03:54.959 --> 01:03:54.969
couldn't remember you know anything else
 

01:03:54.969 --> 01:03:56.549
couldn't remember you know anything else
about their military experience but they

01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559
about their military experience but they
 

01:03:56.559 --> 01:03:58.200
about their military experience but they
remembered operation passage for freedom

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:58.210
remembered operation passage for freedom
 

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.599
remembered operation passage for freedom
and the impact it had on them their

01:04:00.599 --> 01:04:00.609
and the impact it had on them their
 

01:04:00.609 --> 01:04:03.329
and the impact it had on them their
emotional impact or the sense of moral

01:04:03.329 --> 01:04:03.339
emotional impact or the sense of moral
 

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:06.299
emotional impact or the sense of moral
purpose that they they derive from the

01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:06.309
purpose that they they derive from the
 

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:07.739
purpose that they they derive from the
experience they have in the vietnamese

01:04:07.739 --> 01:04:07.749
experience they have in the vietnamese
 

01:04:07.749 --> 01:04:09.569
experience they have in the vietnamese
and especially I mean maybe we'll give

01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:09.579
and especially I mean maybe we'll give
 

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:11.430
and especially I mean maybe we'll give
this way but there's within the image

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440
this way but there's within the image
 

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.529
this way but there's within the image
itself there's an important part that

01:04:13.529 --> 01:04:13.539
itself there's an important part that
 

01:04:13.539 --> 01:04:15.180
itself there's an important part that
maybe someone will come up in terms of

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:15.190
maybe someone will come up in terms of
 

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:18.570
maybe someone will come up in terms of
conclusions whether yeah

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:18.580
 
 

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:25.290
 
peace in science that was about research

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:25.300
peace in science that was about research
 

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.290
peace in science that was about research
related to non visual culture but

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:28.300
related to non visual culture but
 

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.070
related to non visual culture but
auditory culture and how a lot of what

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:32.080
auditory culture and how a lot of what
 

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.140
auditory culture and how a lot of what
we sense into the open environment is

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:34.150
we sense into the open environment is
 

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:36.750
we sense into the open environment is
actually auditory rather than visual and

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760
actually auditory rather than visual and
 

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.970
actually auditory rather than visual and
I think that it raises when you talk

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:38.980
I think that it raises when you talk
 

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.670
I think that it raises when you talk
about the transcription that that

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680
about the transcription that that
 

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.980
about the transcription that that
meaning is necessarily lost your

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:43.990
meaning is necessarily lost your
 

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:45.960
meaning is necessarily lost your
transcription correct there's a lot that

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:45.970
transcription correct there's a lot that
 

01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:48.120
transcription correct there's a lot that
gets communicated just the way that we

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:48.130
gets communicated just the way that we
 

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:49.950
gets communicated just the way that we
speak in what we hear in the background

01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960
speak in what we hear in the background
 

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.680
speak in what we hear in the background
sounds and all of that that simply can't

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:52.690
sounds and all of that that simply can't
 

01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:55.440
sounds and all of that that simply can't
be captured but adds a lot of layers of

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:55.450
be captured but adds a lot of layers of
 

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:56.790
be captured but adds a lot of layers of
meaning that you know are not

01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:56.800
meaning that you know are not
 

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.630
