00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.990
Back in the 1690s there were only two countries
on the island of Great Britain: The Kingdom

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.080
of Scotland and the Kingdom of England.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.469
England and the other great european powers
were doing rather well for themselves by expanding

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.190
their empires through the cunning use of flags.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.200
Scotland had no empire but wanted to join
in the game, and thus needed to establish

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.410
a colony of her very own.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.900
But where to build it?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.900
"Panama!" declared Scotland.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.370
She imagined the colony's strategic location
would make trade with the far east safer and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.900
faster by eliminating the long journey around
the hazardous Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.120
where both wind and wave delight in smashing
ships against rock and ice.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.540
"Who will lend me money to make this great
idea a reality?" asked Scotland.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.540
No one, was the answer.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.109
Instead of helping, the european empires started
trade wars with Scotland to limit the power

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.289
of their future rival.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.610
So, poor Scotland had to fund the project
herself. She gathered up all the money she

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.899
could, literally put it all in a big box and,
capital thusly raised, sent off a colonial

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.899
ship.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.749
400,000 pounds, 8,000 kilometers and 111 days
later, 2,500 Scotsmen landed on the shores

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.469
of Panama, named it 'New Caledonia' and immediately
discovered a few small problems with their

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.760
plan:

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.500
First, the mountains on the western side of
Panama were a wee bit larger than expected,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.109
making overland trade pretty much impossible.
Even if they had thought of building a canal,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.259
the technology to do so was still 200 years
away.

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.020
Second, The woolen goods brought to trade
with the locals was useless in the endless

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.159
heat and humidity.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.600
Third, the Spanish Conquistadors had already
planted flags on the sandy beaches and weren't

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.189
too happy to see the scots arrive.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.030
And fourth, without adequate supplies, disease
such as the perennial tropical favorite, Dysentery,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.110
spread quickly.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.229
Two years and 2,000 dead scots later, they
abandoned the project.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.439
Now, this wasn't the first failed attempt
at Scottish empire -- early colonies had been

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.780
tried and abandoned in Nova Scotia, New Jersey
and Carolina, but the Panama debacle was particularly

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.390
devastating to Scotland because she was over-invested.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.140
Remember that money-in-a-box? Turns out it
was a fifth of the wealth of the whole country.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.210
Oops.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.961
Scotland's sudden impoverishment proved a
golden opportunity for The Kingdom of England

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.650
who was growing increasingly worried that
her neighbor to the North would ally with

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.650
an enemy.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.940
England offered Scotland a deal that would
reimburse Scotland for her losses if she voted

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.600
for union. In 1707 Scotland agreed and the
Kingdom of Great Britain was born.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.600
While the surrender of independence was unpopular
in Scotland, her economy improved with access

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.909
to once English (now British) trade routes
and she played a formative role in what would

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.240
soon be the largest empire in human history.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.399
That being said, still more than 300 years
later, Scotland has never fully given up her

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.200
national identity and thoughts of independence.
