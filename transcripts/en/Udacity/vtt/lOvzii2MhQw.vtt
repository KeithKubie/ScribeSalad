00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.664
In the last section, we learned how to solve equations. We're going to use this

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:07.074
knowledge to help us solve some word problems. We're going to learn some

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:10.510
strategies to help us solve these word problems. We're going to identify

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:14.249
unknowns, draw diagrams, and try and create a plan to solve. By the end of this

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:18.398
section, I hope you will gain some insights into writing expressions and solving

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.798
equations. Let's get started.
