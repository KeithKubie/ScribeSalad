00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.939
It’s the middle of the night, let’s imagine,
and we’ve been on the earth for about three

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:11.320
months. A lot is still very unclear. We are
profoundly helpless, barely able to move our

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.550
own head and utterly at the mercy of others.
The sources of our suffering and joy lie far

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.159
outside our understanding. Hugely powerful
needs pass through us at regular intervals

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.220
and we have no way of making sense of them
to ourselves – let alone of communicating

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.000
them reliably to others. A minute ago, we
were asleep in a dark enveloping warmth. Now

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.390
we’re awake, bereft, isolated and very uncomfortable.
There seems to be a pain somewhere in our

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.710
stomach, but the agony is more general; we
are lonely and profoundly sad. The room is

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.170
dark and there’s a mysterious set of shadows
on the wall that appear and vanish at random.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.470
In a rising panic, we start to scream out
in the darkness. Nothing happens. We pause

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.750
to recover our breath – and then scream
even louder. Our lungs strain with the effort.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.120
Still nothing and the darkness and loneliness
grow ever more threatening. Now true desperation

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.030
sets in; this feels like the end of everything
good and true – and we scream as if to ward

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.720
off death. At last, just when it seems we
could not go on any further, the door opens.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.830
A warm orange light is turned on. It is a
familiar face. They smile at us, say the name

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.470
they often use around us, pick us up and put
us against their shoulder. We can hear a familiar

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.870
heart beating next to ours and a warm hand
caressing the top of our head. They gently

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.450
move us to and fro, and sing a tender, sweet
song. Our sobs start to abate, we pull a weak

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.510
smile; it feels like the vicious demons and
merciless goblins have been sent packing – and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.030
that life could be bearable after all. Image

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.580
is one of the kindest gestures that humans
ever perform for one another. It must lie

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.119
close to the core of love – and is what
can make the difference between a desire to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.260
die and the capacity to endure. Awkwardly,
it tends to be very hard to soothe ourselves

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.720
unless we have first – usually in childhood
– been properly soothed by someone else.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.680
A capacity for self-soothing is the legacy
of a history of nurture. If we have been picked

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.870
up enough times early on, and sufficiently
reassured in the midst of panic that we will

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.850
make it, then one part of the mind learns
the art and can practice it on the other – and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.330
eventually, on people outside us too. At moments
of crisis, we find ourselves able to access

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.990
a voice that calms the waves of fear and the
blows of self-hatred: we can sort this out;

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.190
we’ll have a conversation with them; people
understand; screw them if they don’t; what

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.920
matters is you; you are good and valuable.
We have available an unflustered, resolute

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.709
response as much to the most awful events
as to routine panics. We have a faith that

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.319
we can endure, that something will show up
and that we don’t deserve the worst. Reflecting

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.620
on the art of soothing may bring into focus
just how much we are missing. We are not mysteriously

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.140
deficient, we were brought up by adults who
were themselves not soothed. We need to grow

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.280
attentive and deeply sympathetic to the missing
pieces of our psyche. It is because we didn’t

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.180
benefit from soothing that life is so much
harder than it should be; that nowadays rejection

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.060
is so bitter, social media is so frightening,
disapproval feels so fatal, ambiguity is so

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.200
unbearable, sleep feels so unearnt, holidays
are so worrying, the caresses of others feel

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.920
so alien – and so many of our days and nights
are rocked by what feel like near-death experiences.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.500

There are – one must believe – substitutes

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.060
and opportunities for catching up. We can
have recourse to music, diaries, beds, baths

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.430
but, most importantly, other people. However,
seeking out the sort of people who can soothe

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.380
us may be the hardest step. We may mistake
a capacity to soothe for weakness or naivety.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.520
We may take the soother for a fool. We may
need soothing so much, we find ourselves unable

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.340
to ask for it nicely, shouting counter-productively
instead – or else we withdraw into defensive

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.199
independence, because help feels like it hasn’t
come soon enough. Those in the greatest need

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.000
of soothing often have no idea of what is
missing, no sensible way of articulating their

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.060
need – and a dogged suspicion of kindness
were it to be offered to them. We should strive

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.210
not to make things constantly scarier in our
own minds than they are in reality. We should

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.300
offer soothing continuously to others – and
insist to the more sceptical and parched parts

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.540
of our own minds that they too deserve one
day to be the beneficiaries of kindness

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.780
and reassurance.
