00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.649
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Toyota’s Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, Leave

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:05.649
your mark.

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:07.580
Toyota, let’s go places.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.510
Hydrogen-powered cars are hitting the road
this year, and eventually one will be in a

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.510
crash.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.510
What... would happen?

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.250
Would it explode?

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:27.901
When you think of hydrogen you probably think
of the SUN or the HINDENBURG EXPLOSION, but

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:32.860
hydrogen does so much more than go up in flames,
especially when looked after properly.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.190
Hydrogen is atomic number 1.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.310
The bestest element.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.199
It burns efficiently resulting only water
vapor and tiny amounts of nitrates when done

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.390
at high temperatures.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.870
It's made by electrolysis[1], which is essentially
using electrical energy to split water into

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.870
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.569
The first ideas of using hydrogen gas as a
fuel cell were published in the late 1830s,

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.999
and now[2], 185 years later, fuel-cell cars
are heading onto the roads.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.229
We already use it for rocket engines, so why
not for cars?

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.219
When we think of hydrogen on the road, we
might worry about tiny little Hindenburgs

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.630
driving around out there, which couldn't be
further from the truth.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.630
Hydrogen gas is very explosive, it's true,
even more so than natural gas[3] which is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.369
also used in moving vehicles; gasoline VAPOR
is ALSO explosive.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.280
Hydrogen can alite with airborne concentrations
as low as 4-percent or as HIGH as 75 percent!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.580
Thats a lot!

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.240
Even so, gasoline burns at even lower concentrations
of 1.1 to 3.3%.[4] I read documents from specialists

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.899
in hydrogen storage and transportation safety,
and they say the concern is if the gas is

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.329
trapped in an enclosed space; otherwise, you're
probably alright.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.200
Hydrogen is way lighter than air, which is
why it was (theoretically) great for airships.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.079
If you were to fill three balloons with natural
gas, hydrogen and helium, [a]and let them

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.840
all go, hydrogen is going to rise at 45 mph
(20m/s) - twice as fast as helium and six

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.130
times natural gas[5].

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.810
When a movie needs to make a car crash, even
more terrible than car crashes really are…

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
they add a small fire and a HUGE tank of leaking
gasoline.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.020
Sidebar: Everyone always has a full tank of
gas in movies, you ever think about that?

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.020
Anyway…

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.020
What about hydrogen?

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.900
Well, gasoline evaporates slowly so when a
crash does occur, it CAN drip out, but hydrogen

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.970
fuel is stored pressurized, because it doesn't
WANT to be a liquid.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.930
Tanks onboard the newest hydrogen cars to
enter U.S. highways store hydrogen at 10,000

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.930
psi[6]!

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.390
This means, if a crash were to occur between
a gasoline car, and a hydrogen car where BOTH

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.550
of their fuel reservoirs were punctured, the
hydrogen car would be safer, fuel-wise.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.030
If there WAS a fire, the hydrogen would burn
completely and rapidly, whereas gasoline would

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.910
burn more slowly as it vaporizes.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.300
But at that point, it would be difficult to
tell which wasn't as fun.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.871
And its heavier than air vapors would pool
around the crash site, providing vapors for

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:50.030
any resulting fires to consume.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.420
But when you combine a pressurized tank and
a lighter-than-air gas like hydrogen, the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.630
result will likely be dissipation rather than
combustion.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.990
Which means it would almost instantaneously
escape into the atmosphere.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.700
That’s hardly a Hindenburg.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.700
BUT TRACE!

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.250
What about the FUELING STATIONS!

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.341
Hydrogen fuel infrastructure is relatively
new, but people catch their cars on fire at

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:18.590
gas stations all the time -- 3,000 times a
year[7]!

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.040
NASA has used liquid hydrogen since the middle
of the last century to lift astronauts into

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.810
orbit, and so far it's been pretty okay.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.280
If a leak is detected, they use helium to
flush the liquid hydrogen out into the air,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.010
so it quickly dissipates.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.870
Helium is a noble gas, which means it's SUPER
stable and doesn't really combust.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.730
With the right safety precautions in place,
maybe hydrogen fueling stations will adopt

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.730
this too?

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.580
Then if a leak happens we'll all sound like
chipmunks!

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.580
ADORBZ.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.500
We'd like to take a second and give a shout
out to Toyota for supporting DNews.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.650
They were at CES this month and released their
patents for new fuel-cell technology, and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.720
revealed THEIR fuel cell car to the world,
the Mirai.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.630
They’re hoping these royalty-free patents
will spurn a hydrogen-fuel-based future and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:20.850
spent the last decade reducing the cost of
fuel cell production 95 percent.
