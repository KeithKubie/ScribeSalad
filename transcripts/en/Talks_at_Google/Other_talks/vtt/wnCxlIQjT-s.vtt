&gt;&gt;Male Commentator:
Thanks everybody for coming to part of the

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:07.650
series on being fiscally fit. We're deeply
honored and appreciative today to have Dr.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.169
Burton Malkiel join us from Princeton.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.269
Dr. Malkiel is a seminal figure in finance
and economics and particularly in personal

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.269
finance.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.240
Dr. Malkiel not only has a distinguished career
which I'll tell you briefly about, but in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.099
many ways was-was the first person to have
the insight about what is the optimal investment

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.769
strategy, and one that's actually been proven
overtime to-to be effective.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.682
And while there's a lot of debate about it,
it is one where if you examine the data you'll

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:38.050
find it actually works over just about any
measurement period, over any economic period

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.690
in the United States, which is a remarkable
achievement.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.630
He received his Bachelor's Degree and his
MBA from Harvard University and originally

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.309
went into the business world, but always had
an interest in academic economics and eventually

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.090
earned a Doctorate from Princeton University.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.780
He's the Chemical Bank's Chairman's Professor
of Economics at Princeton and is a two-time

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.739
Chairman of the Economics Department there.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.770
He served as a member of the Council of Economic
Advisors from 1975 to 1977; President of the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.500
American Finance Association; and Dean of
the Yale School of Management.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.920
He also spent 28 years as a Director of the
Vandard-guard Group and is still very actively

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.900
involved in it and a member I believe of the
Board of their international operations.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.990
One of the things I think you'll learn is
that people vary wildly in their ability to

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.390
assess risk, particularly when it comes to
their personal finances, and Dr. Malkiel will

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.030
give you a tremendous amount of insight into
what works and what doesn't.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.890
Beyond that the advice I think he'll share
today with you actually has proven to be true,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.020
it actually works, which is a useful thing
when it comes to advice.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
Many of you had a copy, found a copy of his
Elements of Investing which is his latest

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.210
book; a follow-up to his decades old best-seller
A Random Walk Down Wall Street. I think you'll

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:01.009
enjoy his talk a great deal and I welcome
Dr. Malkiel to Google.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.119
[applause]

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.770
&gt;&gt;Dr. Malkiel:
Thanks very much for your kind introduction

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.880
and thank you all for coming. I'm just delighted
to see all of you guys for as-as far as the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.110
eye can see.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.350
What I'm gonna do is talk to you today, I-I
call this talk "Timeless Lessons for Investors"

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.990
'cause I wanna talk about what I think are
the timeless lessons and some of them which

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.850
are in fact in question right now.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.640
[sound of phone ringing in background]

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.500
So let me begin by talking about some things
that people now say we have presumably learned

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.000
given the past financial crisis.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.451
One of the things that they presumably have
learned is that now you have to time the market.

00:02:54.451 --> 00:03:01.830
After all we realize that we've just been
through a period where the market tanked,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.520
went down almost 50%, and this shows you that
buy and hold is dead, that that's the wrong

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.620
thing to do.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:20.720
And basically I don't think that that's correct.
I still believe in buy and hold for the following

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.620
reason; obviously if we knew that 2007 was
the top of the market. If we knew that, yes

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:40.770
we should have sold then and then bought back
in March of, of 2008, 2009 which turned out

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.340
to be the bottom of the market.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.350
But nobody can do that. You know I've been
in the investment business for a long number

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:58.410
of years. I have never known anyone who could
consistently time the market, individual or

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.910
professional. And I've never known anyone
who knows anybody who could consistently time

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:14.170
the market. And the problem is if you try
to do it you are much more likely to be wrong

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.019
than to be right.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.980
Now, this gives you an example of what people
actually do. And what we've superimposed here

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:35.680
is the solid line shows you the performance
of the world stock markets and the bar graph

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:44.190
shows the flow of funds into equity mutual
funds superimposed on how the market is doing.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.030
And what you notice is that when the market
is high that's when people put their money

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.980
into the market and when the market is low
that's where people take their money out.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:08.870
More money went into the market during the
Internet boom in late 1999 and early 2000

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.620
than ever before. And then in October of 2002
which was the bottom of the market, more money

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:26.060
went out than ever before. Similarly in the
late part of the first decade of the 2000's

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.950
when the market was high, the money poured
in.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:40.200
And when did the money come out? The money
came out in early, late 2008 and early 2009that

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.870
turned out to be the bottom of the market.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.020
So, what happens when you try to do that and
you let your emotions tell you? Because after

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.760
all what's happening is at the top of the
market all the stories are its optimistic,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.010
everything's gonna be perfect; at the bottom
of the market the sky is falling, the world's

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.190
gonna end. That's when people take their money
out.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:08.560
And so I'd much rather be a buy and hold investor
and just, 'cause I know I can't do it and

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.570
I don't think anybody can do it.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.560
And the fact is, remember when you try to
time the market you've got to be right now

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.900
once but twice. You gotta be right when you
get out; you gotta be right when you get back

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.010
in.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:28.900
And because when there are reversals in the
market they happen to quickly, it you take

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:36.880
a period and this was done from '94 to 2008
where the buy and hold investor had some,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.980
and this was not a great time to be in the
market; it had a 7% return. If you had in

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.690
fact just missed the best 10 days your return
got down to practically nothing. And if you

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:57.490
had missed the best 30 days and remember those
best days typically were the-the-the leaps

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.240
up right at the bottom of the market when
everyone is pessimistic, you miss those days

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.419
and you actually had a negative return. So,
I say, don't try to time the market. You can't

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.500
do it. It's very dangerous.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.490
Now not only do people make mistakes when
they try to time the market because they get

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.240
in at the top and out at the bottom, but they
buy the wrong kinds of funds.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.610
Remember I told you more money went into the
stock market in late 1999 and early 2000 than

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:36.890
ever before? Well what did it go into? It
went into high-tech funds. It didn't go into

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:43.889
the value funds which were actually very cheap
then, and value stocks actually did well at

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:51.340
the beginning of the 2000's, but it went into
all of the Internet stocks.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:08:01.560
You know, I remember so vividly as a Director
of the Vanguard Group. Our flagship Vanguard

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.550
has generally had a lot of value funds. Our
flagship value funds were losing assets and

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:17.340
all the assets were being taken out and you
sort of wonder where they were going, because

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:23.240
when you're in a mutual fund complex and there's
a redemption of a fund it goes into the money

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.240
fund.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.050
So, you have to look at where the checks were
written from the money fund. They were all

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:33.820
written to this company in Denver called Janus
and they went to something called the Janus

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.480
Twenty Fund which was twenty of their best
stocks, they were all Internet stocks.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:47.580
So-so this also this selection penalty that
money went into Internet stocks and out of

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:53.779
value stocks at the top and again I, without
going through all of the buys and things in

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:57.050
there, there's also a selection penalty.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:04.180
There's a study that was done by a company
called DALBAR. And what it did was it tried

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:13.490
to compare the returns that are published
by the mutual funds or when you say the stock

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:22.240
market did a certain rate of return from how
individuals fared. In other words, if let's

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:29.250
say there's a period and this is a period
from 1988 that this was the DALBAR Study to

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:35.640
2007. So, it did go to the top of the market.
It's not, this is not indicative of what the

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.260
stock market is gonna do in every period.
You had an 11.6% rate of return.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:48.870
But if you look at how the average investor
did realizing that the average investor wasn't

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:54.360
necessarily in the market at the time; that
the average investor didn't buy and hold,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.100
wasn't buying at the beginning and holding
all the way through, the average investor

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.120
got only 4½%.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:07.910
And again, that's the danger of trying to
do the timing. You can't do it. It's very

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:13.790
dangerous. Obviously, with perfect hindsight,
yes you should have timed the market. You

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.410
can't do it. Don't do it. You're more likely
to do it wrong than right.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:26.910
And incidentally, this is true not only of
individuals but for institutional investors.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:33.240
I have looked at the cash positions of active
managers, whether they're pension funds or

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.270
mutual funds, institutional investors have
more cash at the bottom and the least amount

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:45.310
of cash at the top. Nobody can do it; neither
amateur nor professional.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:56.310
The second timeless lesson is what I will
call the Dollar Cost Averaging lesson.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:01.930
Again the argument is, and most of you who
are accumulating, who are saving over time,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:10.630
are taking advantage of this. There is an
advantage for putting money into the market

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.500
regularly over time.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:20.330
So, what this shows you is that even though
the market was rising in what's to the right

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:30.430
of the screen, you actually made more money
in this volatile flat market than you did

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.430
in the rising market.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:37.450
Now, it's not always true. The dollar, obviously
if the market is continuously rising you wanna

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.660
put all your money in at the beginning.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:48.550
But if, in fact, we're in a situation of pretty
volatile times, you're more likely to be on

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.940
the left hand side of the screen and at the
very least you're gonna reduce your risk this

00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:01.180
way and the regret that comes if you happen
to put all your money at the, at a market

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.180
top.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:08.600
I'm very fond of the advice of Warren Buffett
who likes to give this quiz. So, you plan

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.920
to eat hamburgers all of your life. What would
you prefer? Do want lower prices of hamburgers

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.730
in the future or higher prices? And you know
obviously if you're gonna buy hamburgers you'd

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:25.450
like lower prices in the future. Or you wanna
buy automobiles throughout your life and you're

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:32.320
not an automobile manufacturer, you'd prefer
the automobiles to be lower in the future.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.940
And now for the final exam Warren Buffett
says that most people get wrong. So you're

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:44.070
gonna be an-an investor all of your life,
do you want higher prices or lowers prices?

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:49.709
And the answer is no, you actually would want
lower prices. It's as if you're buying cheaper

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:53.040
hamburgers or cheaper automobiles.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:59.601
It's only when you're close to retirement
that you wanna get into the safer stuff where

00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:05.890
you take things out. And incidentally what
you have actually as part of your options,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.660
for those of you who are getting closer to
retirement, that's why you have target-maturity

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:18.860
funds that in fact make sure that you're not
at a time at the end where everything's in

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:25.870
the stock market when the stock market might
be, might be low and the target funds do exactly

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.330
that for you.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:37.090
Now, the other thing that is I think a timeless
lesson is to rebalance, and I say yearly.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:47.050
My own work suggests that one oughta rebalance
yearly and this gives you an example from

00:13:47.050 --> 00:14:00.540
January 1996 through December of last year.
That the bottom row says if you were not rebalanced

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:10.800
you simply start off with a balanced portfolio
of 60% stocks and we'll say you're in an index

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:18.050
fund what is called generally a total stock
market index fund, which in the Vanguard case

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:30.630
is with the Russell 3000. and 40% the Broad
Bond Market Index which this says the Lehman,

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.070
unfortunately it's now called the Barclay's
Club of --

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.696
I know something must have happened to Lehman
along the way --

00:14:36.696 --> 00:14:37.696
[laughter]

00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:41.260
I'm not sure what it -- what it was.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.870
So, if you were not rebalanced you had an
8¾% return.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:55.320
And then if you just simply said I wanna be
60/40 and I'm gonna rebalance every year,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:01.519
that's what the top row suggests. So, every
year you look at the portfolio if you're away

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:10.700
from 60/40 you go back to 60/40. And you have
a rate of return that's well over 1% point

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.700
higher.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.860
So, why does it work? Well, it works for the
following reason. Just think. You can't time

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:22.180
the market but let's say we're gonna rebalance
in January of every year.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:31.920
So, you started off 60/40, we're now in, say,
January of 2000. You don't know it's the top

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:37.840
of the market. Nobody knows it's the top of
the market. But what you do know is that your

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.810
stocks are sky high and the Federal Reserve
was increasing interest rates which means

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:50.459
bond prices fell and your bonds were low.
So, you might have had 75%t in stocks and

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:55.709
25% in bonds, and so you say you take some
money off the table, you take it from the

00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:58.610
stocks and put it into the bonds.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:04.480
You're then January of 2003. You don't know
you're just after the lull of the market,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.130
but what you found was the Federal Reserve
had lowered interest rates so bond prices

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:16.150
were up. So, your bonds might have been 50,
55%; stocks were in the tank. So, stocks were

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.950
well below your target and so you then sold
some bonds and bought some stocks.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:30.320
That's why this works and rebalancing, again
if the stock market does nothing but go up,

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:38.360
go straight up even then what it-it'll work
in that it gives you much less volatility,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.410
but you won't quite get the extra return.
But again, if we're gonna be in volatile markets,

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:50.140
rebalancing is-is gonna not only reduce your
volatility but it's going to increase your

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.149
rate of return.

00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:58.570
Now, the other timeless lesson that I hear
all the time saying, "Boy diversification

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:09.750
doesn't work anymore." We learned that in
2008 and early 2009 there were few places

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:17.889
to hide: everything went down together; emerging
markets went down; the U.S. market went down.

00:17:17.889 --> 00:17:24.059
Diversification doesn't work anymore. That's
I-I can't tell ya how often I read that.

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:32.999
Well, first of all if you were in bonds, if
you had some bonds in your portfolio, diversification

00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:33.999
did work.

00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:40.799
What we know about diversification, you get
the most benefit when you buy an asset class

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:50.510
that tends to be uncorrelated or very lowly
correlated with, say your main asset is U.S.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:57.340
Stocks. Bonds actually have become a better
diversifier over time in that the correlations

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.980
have actually fallen. So, there were places
to hide.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:08.090
In fact, in fact what happened with bonds
was the Federal Reserve was reducing interest

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:16.669
rates to essentially zero and bond prices
were going up. So, bonds were a place to hide.

00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:24.409
Now. it's true that all world stock markets
became very highly correlated, and globalization

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:32.600
has tended to increase the correlations among
markets. But even though the correlations

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:42.019
have gone up, it still paid to be diversified
internationally because here you have a graph

00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:51.230
of the emerging markets in the decade from
2000 to 2010.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.389
And it's something that people often call
the lost decade because it was not a good

00:18:56.389 --> 00:19:04.159
time. These are worldwide stocks. It was not
a good time to be in the stock market. You

00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:10.879
ended up about the same place that you began,
but emerging markets gave you a 10% annual

00:19:10.879 --> 00:19:12.109
rate of return.

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:19.070
So, even though the ups and downs are the
same, it-it's the fact that they look like

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.649
they're very highly correlated and they are
highly correlated, that still didn't mean

00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:29.419
that you didn't wanna be diversified because
you did much better if you were diversified

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:33.129
and had some of the emerging markets.

00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:39.690
And again, let's sort of put these things
together, the advantages of diversification,

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.609
rebalancing, and Dollar Cost Averaging.

00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:49.620
You have at the bottom of the slide the lost
decade, you were in the S&amp;P 500, you didn't

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:55.749
make a penny, you in fact lost some money.
And in the tops part of the graph it says

00:19:55.749 --> 00:20:01.889
you're diversified, you have bonds, you have
some international stocks including emerging

00:20:01.889 --> 00:20:08.360
market stocks, and you do a little bit of
Dollar Cost Averaging. And in the first case

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.759
your hundred thousand dollars declines to
eighty thousand dollars and in the second

00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:19.690
case your hundred thousand dollars goes up
to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:28.559
So, it basically just gives you some numbers
to go away with what I've called the timeless

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:35.389
lessons, that by diversifying, Dollar Cost
Averaging, and rebalancing you get a much

00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:36.820
better investment performance.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:44.580
The next slide - and I'll try to tell you
who, those of you who don't see the slides

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.419
what this shows you is that costs matter.

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:55.570
You know, I think all of us need to be very
modest about what we know about financial

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:02.080
markets and what we don't know, but I will
tell ya the one thing that I am absolutely

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:12.210
certain of. And the one thing I'm absolutely
certain of is the lower the costs charged

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:18.299
by the purveyor of the investment service,
the more there will be for you.

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:20.989
[laughter]

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:33.850
You know it sounds so obvious, but it is just
absolutely the case. As the founder of the

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:41.830
Vanguard Group, Jack Bogle, likes to say,
"In the investment business, you get what

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.979
you don't pay for."

00:21:43.979 --> 00:21:44.979
[laughter]

00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:51.730
And what this does is it breaks down all mutual
funds and these are not just, these are actively

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:57.799
managed funds, this is every mutual fund there
is in the United States, and it divides them

00:21:57.799 --> 00:22:07.039
into quartiles. The low-cost quartile has
lowest turnover and the lowest explicit expense

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:17.049
ratio. The high-cost quartile has the highest
costs and the highest portfolio turnover.

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:26.869
And the low-cost quartile gives you an 8.66%rate
of return. The high co-cost quartile gave

00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:36.629
you a 6.66 and this is the period 1994 through
the end of last year - the end of '09. So

00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:40.119
you've got two percentage points more a year.

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:46.929
And I've done all kinds of studies for how
do ya pick the mutual funds that do best.

00:22:46.929 --> 00:22:55.720
The only thing that is reliably related to
how mutual funds do is the costs they charge.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:03.299
And so, the one thing you can control of the
costs you pay, you want to have funds that

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:08.600
charge the lowest in expenses.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:14.919
And that brings me to one of my favorite subjects
is that you ought to also use, at least to

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:24.379
some extent, index funds because the quintessential
lo- cost funds are index funds that simply

00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:33.620
buy and hold a broad portfolio and charge
minimal, I mean it, they're very close to

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.260
zero expense ratios.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:42.360
Now, I've always argued that index funds make
sense first of all because markets are reasonably

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:49.419
efficient. You know, there are a lot of very
smart people out there looking for every opportunity

00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:57.919
to buy cheap stocks and they therefore give
you a tableau of market prices that makes

00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:01.919
it very difficult to find really cheap stuff.

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:07.149
You know, the way we academics like to tell
this is the sort of story about the efficient

00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:12.340
market professor who is walking along with
a couple of graduate students and the graduate

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.419
students see a hundred dollar bill on the
ground and one of the graduate students stoops

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:22.559
to pick it up and the professors says, "Don't
bother to pick it up. If it were really a

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:24.309
hundred dollar bill it wouldn't be there."

00:24:24.309 --> 00:24:25.309
[laughter]

00:24:25.309 --> 00:24:31.139
You know I'm not quite that extreme. I tell,
I tell the graduate student, "Pick it up right

00:24:31.139 --> 00:24:33.039
away because it isn't gonna be there for long."

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:34.039
[laughter]

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:40.330
I mean we-we just don't leave hundred dollar
bills on the ground very long.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:45.119
So, that's one reason why you oughta be in
index funds, but even if you don't agree with

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:51.330
me that markets are pretty efficient, indexing
still have to be an optimal strategy because

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:58.769
when you think about it investing has to be
a zero-sum game.

00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:07.919
That is to say we're all different investors,
we buy different stocks, it's since all the

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:16.409
stocks have to be held by somebody, it must
be that if I just buy the stocks that go up

00:25:16.409 --> 00:25:26.139
the most, somebody else has had to have the
stocks that didn't go up. Th-this is just

00:25:26.139 --> 00:25:34.820
we-we don't live in Lake Wobegon. We cannot
all be above; we can't all be above average.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:41.049
So, if you think of it then, that if half
the people are better than the market, half

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:46.960
of them have to be below the market, you realize
it's a zero-sum game. But in the presence

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:56.249
of costs, if you now say that on average,
and this is the, this is true, that on average

00:25:56.249 --> 00:26:03.970
purveyors of investment products charge one
percentage point in costs, that means that

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:13.229
if the market does 8% you've shifted the whole
distribution over in that everybody's gonna

00:26:13.229 --> 00:26:20.879
get whatever they got from their portfolio
minus the 1% of cost. It then must be that

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:23.080
most people will underperform the market.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:31.279
If you could buy an index fund that has the
whole market at essentially zero cost and

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:38.009
that's really the, you know, it's a matter
of arithmetic that since index funds are available

00:26:38.009 --> 00:26:46.009
at, you know, something like a ri-right around
a tenth of 1%, essentially zero cost, it has

00:26:46.009 --> 00:26:52.019
to be that as a matter of logic they're going
to outperform most other managers.

00:26:52.019 --> 00:26:59.799
And I look at this stuff I-I said you oughta
be in index funds before index funds even

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:00.799
existed.

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:06.049
I'm actually working on the tenth edition
of my book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:11.720
And every time I do it and these are data
that I'll put in the new edition, every time

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:19.529
I look at it, look at the last year, look
at the last 20 years, you see generally ? of

00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:25.549
investors of funds are beaten by an index
fund.

00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:34.250
And it doesn't matter whether it's a-all funds,
all large cap funds, all mid cap funds, all

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.659
small cap funds, multi-cap funds, global,
international.

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:47.789
Even in emerging markets, 90% of active managers
are beaten. And the reason that more are beaten

00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:54.759
in emerging markets which are probably less
efficient is that they, the expenses of dealing

00:27:54.759 --> 00:28:00.190
with emerging markets and the problems of
tryin' to do a lot of turnover in trading

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:06.659
because there are stamp taxes, they're a lot
of taxes in emerging markets, even there indexing

00:28:06.659 --> 00:28:09.269
works even better.

00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:17.600
When you look at a-a very long period and
I will just tell the people who can't see

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:27.320
the charts, what I've done here is taken a
look at every mutual fund that existed in

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:37.090
1970. And in 1970, there were 358 mutual funds.
There's so every mutual fund that existed.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:45.519
And then I look at how they did up through
2009. And the first thing that you, people

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:57.739
will notice who can see the chart is there
were only 119 that are still around, from

00:28:57.739 --> 00:28:59.480
the 358 that started.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.820
And all I can do is plot how the 119 did.
So, these data have what we call survivorship

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:12.499
bias in them, because the 239 that didn't
survive I can assure you had much worse records.

00:29:12.499 --> 00:29:19.779
Because there's kind of a, a nasty young,
a nasty secret in the mutual fund business

00:29:19.779 --> 00:29:25.849
and that is mutual funds are normally in big
complexes. You know the Fidelity Group, the

00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:28.009
American Funds Group.

00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:34.129
If you have in your complex a fund that hasn't
done well, you normally kill the fund by merging

00:29:34.129 --> 00:29:39.289
it into a fund that had a better record. So,
that's why there's a lot of survivorship bias

00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:46.830
in this, but even with the survivorship what
it shows you is the distribution looks like

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:52.909
the theoretical distribution that most of
its on the negative side. And in fact, you

00:29:52.909 --> 00:30:00.519
can count on the fingers of one hand, the
number of funds that started in 1970 that

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:02.639
had beaten the market by two percentage points
or more.

00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:10.779
It's not that you can't, it's not that there
are no examples. I sometimes say, "You know

00:30:10.779 --> 00:30:14.179
if I'd know Warren Buffett would have been
Warren Buffett, I might have said in my books

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:20.460
that was first published in 1973 by Berkshire
Hathaway, "forget about index funds."

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:25.049
And you know what? There will be some Warren
Buffetts in the future. There may be several

00:30:25.049 --> 00:30:29.730
of them. But the problem is I don't know who
they are and I'll bet you don't know who they

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:35.019
are and when you try to find, them you're
much more likely to be on the negative side

00:30:35.019 --> 00:30:41.179
of the distribution. It's like looking for
a needle in the haystack and I guess what

00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:45.250
I'm saying is buy the low cost haystack instead.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.250
[laughter]

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:54.809
Now, you always will see examples of and-and-and
the financial press loves to do that. These

00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:59.450
funds beat the index ten times in a row. You
see this all the time.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.590
So this, I didn't even do this chart, I picked
it up from the Wall Street Journal a year

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:11.919
ago. And it said there were 14 funds that
had beaten the index for 9 consecutive years

00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:20.159
and then how many actually beat the index
the next year. And out of the 14 there was

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:25.240
only 1 that beat the index; 13 of the 14 did
worse than the index.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:31.960
What it shows you is you can't pick a fund
by simply saying, "This manager beat the index

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:38.289
for a certain number of years." It doesn't
work that way. The only thing, and I've done

00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:45.539
statistical work on this for years, the only
thing that's reliably related to fund returns

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:48.029
is the costs that they charge.

00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:56.499
In the bond market area, it's exactly the
same thing. Bonds are very close to commodity

00:31:56.499 --> 00:32:07.019
products and again ? or more of bond managers
are beaten by a bond index funds.

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:14.849
Now, I don't say and I don't even myself simply
have every bit of my money in index funds.

00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:23.339
But what I do suggest one does is what professional
investors do more and more and that is at

00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:29.600
least the core of one's portfolio, there's
enough evidence that indexing works, that

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:38.369
at least the core of your portfolio oughta
be in low cost index funds. And then if you

00:32:38.369 --> 00:32:52.549
wanna buy an individual stock or take a-a-a
flyer on buying Cambodian stock, fine you

00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:58.529
can do it with much less risk if the core
of your portfolio is indexed.

00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:06.900
And this is what professional investors increasingly
do. Pension funds and even universities that

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.580
do a lot of private investing, to the extent
that they hold public stock they will index

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:19.460
the public part of it and then do the private
stuff, stuff as active.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:25.599
So, let me go back to diversification again
and this'll be the last point that I will

00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:29.539
make 'cause I do wanna leave some time for
questions.

00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:44.779
I have suggested to you that what you want
to do is to be broadly indexed. You don't

00:33:44.779 --> 00:33:55.159
want just one stock. And incidentally even
though you guys will all have positions in

00:33:55.159 --> 00:34:02.440
a great stock, Google, you don't want all
of your money in Google because ev, bad things

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:09.210
sometimes even happen to good companies. It's
not, and-and-and your human capital is tied

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:15.350
up in-in Google and remember what happened
to the people who work worked for Enron; not

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.700
that Google is anything like Enron, but --

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.350
[laughter]

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:28.820
you can lose your, the company goes under
and you lose your livelihood and you lose

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.500
your 401k.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.090
Or, what happened to the people at General
Motors?

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:41.770
So look, Google's a fine stock. I'm not saying
you shouldn't own Google, but you don't want

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.179
everything in Google.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:50.890
And you don't want everything in the United
States. What we know about investing is that

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:59.060
people have a home country bias, they have
much too much of their money in their home

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.060
country.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:07.410
For example, in France institutional, France
is 3% of the world's GDP. Institutional investors

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:13.581
in France have 97% of their holdings in French
securities. That's what we call the home country

00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:14.581
bias.

00:35:14.581 --> 00:35:21.080
The U.S. is only 40% of the world economy.
The emerging markets are growing much faster

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.730
than the developed markets.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:30.090
I know that the word "China" is a dirty word
around here --

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.090
[laughter]

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:38.020
but the growth of China has been absolutely
unprecedented. China has grown after inflation

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:44.110
over the last 20 years at growth rates between
9 and 10%.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:51.800
China has surpassed Japan this year as the
world's second largest economy and the Chinese

00:35:51.800 --> 00:36:00.030
Yuan or RMB is a severely undervalued currency.
So, I wanna argue for much more diversification.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:10.200
China's a very interesting story. China in
the early 1800's had about a third of the

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:17.340
world's GDP and then all hell broke loose.
They were beaten in two opium wars by the

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:25.850
British. They were invaded by Japan, in the
1900's. Japan wasn't thrown out 'till 1945.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.180
There was a damaging civil war.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:34.940
Then Mao came in and the end of the Mao years
was a so-called cultural revolution where

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:41.190
the universities were closed. Anybody with
any knowledge was sent out to the countryside

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:50.130
to be reeducated and you ended up in 1980
with China maybe between 3and 4% of the world's

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:51.130
GDP.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:56.700
And then this remarkable man Deng Xiaopingcame
in who was everything that Mao wasn't. Mao

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:05.550
was an ideologue. Deng Xiaoping was an intensely
practical person. He would say, "I don't care

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:13.820
if the cat is black or white just as long
it catches mice. To be rich is glorious. I

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.030
don't know whether stock markets are good
or bad, but let's try them."

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:27.590
And you ushered in this remarkable era of
30 years of unprecedented growth. China's

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:34.610
never grown; no country in history has grown
as fast as China. China is probably 12% of

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:43.300
the world's GDP now and according to IMF estimates
will be between 15 and 20%of the world's GDP

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.800
by 2014.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.010
Now one of the things that the reason I think
China will grow is all the growth thus far

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:59.120
has been in the Eastern part of the country.
The center and West are still dirt poor and

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.780
people are restless there. There's a lot of
unrest in this area. The government wants

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:10.600
to stay in power and so government policy
is, "We've got to keep this growth machine

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.950
going."

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:19.390
And China had a fiscal stimulus program. They
were the first to get out of the worldwide

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.330
recession. They had a fiscal stimulus that
was much bigger than ours relative to GDP

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.320
and they've got the wherewithal to do it.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.480
We now have a deb- to-GDP ratio in the United
States that's getting close to a 100%. Europe's

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:38.040
is close to a 100%. We know what's happening
in Greece right now because people are worried

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:47.450
about buying Greek debt. Japan's is over 200%
of the world's GDP; debt-to-GDP is over 200%;

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:56.300
China's is 20%. So, they've got a very strong
fiscal balance and tremendous human capital.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:02.600
The Chinese have revered education since the
time of Confucius. They are hard working.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:07.550
They're entrepreneurial. They have a gambling
spirit which is I think anybody's who's gonna

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:17.000
be an entrepreneur has to be a bit of a gambler.
It is a growth story that I am sure will continue.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.870
How would you access China? Well, the same
kinda story that I have suggested before for

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:35.510
U.S. Why not do it through index funds? And
relatively low, but not as low cost as U.S.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:43.940
index funds 'cause it's more expensive to
invest abroad, but there are exchange traded

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:52.920
funds. The most popular one is called FXI.
It trades on the New York Stock Exchange.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.320
It's FTSE XINHUA 25 Stock Index. It's like
the DOW of Chinese stocks available in the

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.300
international market.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:12.010
I think it's much too narrow. It's 50% financial,
it's about 80% financial and oil and energy,

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:18.000
essentially no consumer, almost no technology.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.850
And so the newest ETF trades under the ticker
symbol Y-A-O and I've been associated with

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:33.530
this through a little company called AlphaShares
that I work with out here.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:45.930
YAO has 150companies. it's much more diversified.
It has some consumer stocks in it; the largest

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:50.820
package noodle manufacturer; sneaker manufacturer.
We've got consumer stocks; we've got technology

00:40:50.820 --> 00:41:00.401
stock, Baidu for example, isn't in FXI and
is in YAO and Baidu's certainly been a, you

00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:05.190
talk about things with having correlations
that are too high, Baidu's certainly has had

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:12.990
a good negative correlation with the stock
[chuckles] that's in, I'm sure all of your

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.550
portfolios.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.110
[laughter]

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:26.820
We also have a small cap ETF. It's an index
fund, but it's small in capitalization stocks;

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:34.640
trades on the New York Stock Exchange under
the ticker symbol H-A-O. Low cost, relatively

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:41.610
low cost, and the nice thing about the small
cap is many of the larger cap companies in

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:46.840
China are half owned by the government. So,
when the government owns half of your stock

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.140
you don't know that they're necessarily gonna
do something that's in the interest of the

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.730
stock holders.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:42:00.450
HAO, the small cap ETF, has much more in terms
of the more entrepreneurial and privately

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:06.910
owned companies where the government doesn't
own a share, and we would say that both of

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:08.390
those are great.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:21.730
We've also got a-a technology ETF and I would
say for those of you who were wealthy enough

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:33.680
to have a-a large amount of money that they
want to diversify into China, we have even

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:40.580
lower cost separately managed accounts with
about a third of the expense ratio of the

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:45.090
ETF's which are also pretty low expense.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:55.390
So, those were my, those were my prepared
remarks. I think we have 15 or 20, by my watch

00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:00.600
we have at least 15 minutes for questions
and I would be delighted to try to respond

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.600
to questions.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.340
[pause]

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:11.990
Oh, and if you would in asking a question
if you could move to the microphone then I

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.260
won't have to repeat the question.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.260
[pause]

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.260
&gt;&gt;male in audience #1:
Hi.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.260
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
Hi.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.260
&gt;&gt;#1:
You talked about dollar cost averaging -

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.260
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
Yes.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.260
&gt;&gt;#1:
In the context of like your regular savings,

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:26.970
but in Random Walk you were a little ambiguous
about when you have a big chunk of money to

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.450
invest, put it all in at once or spread it
out to get dollar cost averaging. Is there

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:35.570
a conclusion on that or is it just we don't
know?

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:43.440
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
Well, the problem is that if you looked over

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:53.000
history the reason for the ambiguity is that
when there is a long term uptrend to the stock

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:01.630
market, you can lose out by putting, by not
putting your money in earlier rather than

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:05.160
later. And that was the reason for the ambiguity.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:10.720
Frankly, I'm less ambiguous now because of
some of the lessons that we learn from behavioral

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.340
finance. And one of the lessons is this lesson
of regret.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:22.730
The problem with putting it in particularly
as markets have become more volatile, which

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:30.310
they have, when you put it in all at once
there is a chance that you're going to put

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:40.920
it in at a period like January or-or even
worse March of 2000 and you have a terrible

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:52.560
decade, a terrible performance, and that regret
can actually make some people say, "My God,

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.230
I don't want t-to be in the stock market at
all."

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:04.020
And I guess I'm less ambiguous now is it might
not always be optimal, in that the lo - I'm

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:14.820
a, still, I'm still not, I didn't mean to
suggest I was negative about the United States.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:19.510
We've still got the most flexible economy
in the world. We are still the people who

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:27.710
basically invent Googles and invent iPads
and iPhones and so forth.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:35.870
This is still a-a great, wonderful country
and is going to be, but because the danger

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:44.390
of the-the risk and the potential regret if
you do happen to get in at the high and I've

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:54.060
told 'ya nobody knows when that is, and the
reduction in volatility that you get and the

00:45:54.060 --> 00:46:01.480
feeling that I and certainly some other people
have is that we probably have a good bit more

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:10.730
instability in our markets and volatility
today than we probably thought. We-we probably

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:17.050
should have realized that we had more volatility
than we did, but we got fooled because things

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:26.950
seemed so stable in the '80s and '90s. I think
because of that even though I understand it

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:34.110
might not always be optimal, at least some
of it I think oughta be a Dollar Cost Average.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.690
And I wouldn't put it all in at once.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.660
&gt;&gt;#1:
Is there any guideline about how long to spread

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:43.410
it out, like six months or like ten years
or depends on the amount of money?

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:48.350
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
There, I would say right now I probably wouldn't

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:54.530
spread it out too long because it also depends
upon what the alternative is.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:47:02.230
If you were in a period where short term interest
rates were 10% I'd spread it out over a longer

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:07.590
period because your alternative might have
been to put it into a short term instrument

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:08.650
that paid 10%.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:16.350
The problem today is that the alternative
is making zero. And so I can't tell you exactly

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:22.520
what it would be, but I think I'd spread it
out less now then I would if the alternatives

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520
were better.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.520
&gt;&gt;#1:
Thank you very much.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
You bet.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520
[pause]

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.520
&gt;&gt;male in audience #2:
[Indian accent]

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.990
Hi, I think I read your Random Walk book about
15 years ago and I'm very happy that I did

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:42.800
that because I've been sort of a buy and hold
investor all along. So it's a great thing.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:52.730
With respect to your presentation I think
while I completely, as I said I agree with-with

00:47:52.730 --> 00:48:00.270
the, with the thrust of the presentation that
a couple of I would say statistical numbers

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:09.520
that a person that I sort of disagree with.
For example, this an often repeated thing

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.510
that if you miss the best 10 days of the first
decade then you-you're return goes way down.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.210
That people who present that particular factor
never talks about what would happen if you

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:19.280
could miss the 10 worst days of the past [chuckles]
decade. I mean statistically both that are

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.280
about the same.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.350
Another example is you presented under the
portfolio, how would you have grown over the

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:33.960
last decade of your Dollar Cost Average and
what I've heard, but it sort masks the fact

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:42.800
you had a thousand dollars going in every
month, which adds up to a hundred and thirty

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800
thousand, so I think I see some biases in
the presentation is what I'm trying to say.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.860
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
You are certainly correct that it is right

00:48:46.860 --> 00:49:00.140
that while you would have killed your return
if you had missed the 10 best days. It's also

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:08.960
true that your return wouldn't have been nearly
as bad if you had missed the 10 worst days.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:20.940
But there, I-I think I come back to say you
probably can't do either and would go back

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:32.490
to the graph showing that when you try to
do it you're more likely to be incorrect than,

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.380
than correct.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:42.440
You're also right, and as a matter of fact
I'm gonna redo the graph that I showed you,

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:50.940
there's a bit of bias in the graph which those
of you in the other room didn't see, that

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:59.200
shows, "Gee you would have lost money, but
gone up from a 100,000 to 250,000 by doing

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:06.300
a little dollar cost averaging." You did put
a bit more money in; you put 12,000 dollars

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.180
a year more into it.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:14.100
I'm gonna redo that so that you put exactly
the same amount in and it would reduce it

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:20.020
a little bit, but the point is still right
that you would have done a good deal more.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:26.840
But you're very perceptive; there was a small
bias in it but not a huge one.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.840
[laughter]

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.270
&gt;&gt;male in audience #3:
So, I have something of an abstract question

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:37.510
here. In the ideal world where a majority,
a majority or a plurality of individual investors

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:40.990
follow your advice and-and hold most of their
money in index funds, what are the consequences

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:42.530
for corporate governance when you have a large
class of investors holding on to voting stock

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:51.340
essentially just to get their share of the
potential uplift instead of to be part of

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:57.560
holding on, part of the company?

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.180
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
When you began that question I thought you

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:07.630
were gonna say, "What if everybody indexes?
Would it then make indexing a non-optimal

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:15.610
strategy?" And I often answer that when 90%
of people index I'm gonna start to be worried

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.610
about that.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:26.980
But in terms of the governance question, I
think it might even improve corporate governance

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:37.710
for the following reason: think of, say, Vanguard
has active and passively managed funds. But

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:46.780
when you think of a passively managed fund
it's often said, "That when an active manager

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:51.460
doesn't like what corporate management is
doing, they just sell the stock."

00:51:51.460 --> 00:52:03.060
The index fund can't do that and I would think
that it would make passive managers even better,

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:10.440
more interested in corporate governance; more
interested in voting their shares; more interested

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:18.700
in writing letters to management to look very
carefully about things they're doing that

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:22.690
the manager doesn't like because the manager
can't sell the stock.

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:29.320
So, my sense is that I think it might actually
make things even better because the active

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.390
manager will say, "Listen, I'm not gonna bother
with that I'm just gonna sell the stock."

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:38.400
The passive manager can't, and so the passive
manager has to take the action and my own

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:45.840
experience as a board member in Vanguard is
over time we spent more and more time worrying

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.090
about proxy issues and actually taking a stand.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:53:01.070
So I think it's a, I think it's potentially
an advantage of passive management not a disadvantage.

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:02.070
&gt;&gt;#3:
Thank you.

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:03.070
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4:
Professor, I have two investment strategies

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.140
I would like to get your take on.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.140
[laughter]

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:13.680
The first one if you look at Warren Buffett's
top ten stock holdings, a lot of them are

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.680
dividend based. In other words he'll hold
stocks that pay out dividends regularly.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:26.460
And the second question was I wonder what
your thoughts were on the Vanguard REIT Index

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.460
Fund for the States?

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.210
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
O-okay, on, let me just do the second question

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:39.860
first. The Vanguard REIT Real, Real Estate
Investment Trust. Real estate is I think potentially

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:48.580
a-a very good asset class that isn't perfectly
correlated with the others.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:55.460
Real estate has been a terrible place to be.
Commercial real estate has been a terrible

00:53:55.460 --> 00:54:03.090
place to be. I think real estate right, who
knows if it's the bottom or not. But I think

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:15.420
it's a very good diversifier. It's something
I own in my own portfolio and I definitely,

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.410
definitely like.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:28.660
On Warren Buffett, I think one thing you must
understand is that because of his size now,

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:33.130
Warren Buffett can do things that really other
people can't do.

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:44.190
I mean for example, when he put his money
into Goldman Sachs, getting a 10% coupon on

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:53.220
a preferred stock and scads and scads of equity
is something that wasn't available to other

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.220
people.

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:59.619
In fact, I wish the government in its "bale
out of the financial institutions" could have,

00:54:59.619 --> 00:55:04.310
could have used Warren Buffett's template
to make a better deal [chuckles] with the

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:07.250
institutions that the government put money
into.

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:15.050
But Warren Buffett has very often taken such
large positions, and this gets back to the

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:24.070
governance issue, that he can actually help
in improving the management.

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:29.560
In fact, one of the earliest wonderful investments
he made was a failing company, The Washington

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:37.920
Post. And Katherine Graham when she heard
that Buffett had bought 10% said, "Oh my God,

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.770
he's trying to take over the company and throw
me out." He said, "No, I did it as an investment."

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:50.650
She then said to him, "We're in real trouble.
Please help me." And Buffet went on the Board;

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:57.090
helped her get a, she was an editorial person,
helped her get a good management in.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:04.300
So, Buffett is almost closer to being a private
equity person and look there's no question

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:14.040
about it, Buffett's one of the smartest investment
people there, there is and we know that now

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.870
and there will be other Buffett's.

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:21.050
And as one of the satellite portfolios, if
you think you've got another Buffett, I see

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:27.680
no reason for doing it, but I wouldn't put
everything in that because it is, he is really

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:36.840
a needle in the haystack and it's much easier
to find the people who went downhill then

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.840
to find the Warren Buffett's.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.110
&gt;&gt;#4:
Yeah, thank you.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:40.110
[pause]

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:43.880
&gt;&gt;female in audience #1:
Hi, I have a question from the San Bruno office.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.340
Do you recommend that your 401k portfolio
reflects the same investments as your other

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:53.110
general portfolio? My financial advisor recommended
that I do the exact same breakdown in both

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:55.440
401k and brokerage accounts.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.600
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
Well, I think it really de, I think it really

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:06.340
depends. And I think I would say the answer
is no. And I'll tell you why because I just

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:13.590
did have a chance to look at the options in
the Google 401k.

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:22.260
And for example, I have suggested to you that
I think everybody ought to have some investments

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:28.940
in directly in China and I'd probably make
the same case for India; probably make the

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.430
same case for Brazil.

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:41.240
So, to the extent that that is not directly
in your 401k, I think you get nicely diversified

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:48.800
with a lot of index funds in your 401k and
then I think for your individual investments

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:56.171
you might very well stray from that and use
them as the kind of satellite portfolios where

00:57:56.171 --> 00:58:04.910
you do things like take a big, or at least
a significant position in a place like China

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:15.990
which tends to be under represented in-in
general international index funds. And I might

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:18.720
just tell you why.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:25.230
Index funds, international index funds are
so-called float adjusted. That is to say,

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:33.600
the weight of the country depends upon the
value of the floated shares.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:41.140
Now what do I mean by floated shares? What
I mean is that when the government owns half

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:52.119
of a company what the index fund uses as a
weight is only the part that trades freely,

00:58:52.119 --> 00:58:55.430
not the part that's owned by the government.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:59:02.340
Another thing about China that's so peculiar,
China has currency controls. And a lot of

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:12.330
the Chinese equities are traded in local markets
in Shanghai and Shenzhen which are not available

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:16.700
to international investors. They are not part
of the float.

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:23.820
So, in international portfolios, China which
I suggested to you is 12 or 13% of the world's

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:30.630
GDP now, is probably one or one and a half
percent of the index portfolios because of

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:36.920
the peculiar nature of the Chinese markets
and the still significant amount of government

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.920
ownership.

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:46.110
So, I think you wanna look at your indices
and when there are problems where particular

00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:54.430
countries or types of stocks get under weighted,
that doing the adjustment in your personal

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:56.619
portfolio makes sense.

00:59:56.619 --> 01:00:01.860
And so I don't think you ne, I think you wanna
look at the whole portfolio together, but

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.500
I don't think that means you oughta do exactly
the same thing in your personal portfolio

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.870
that you do in your 401k portfolio.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:08.870
&gt;&gt;female in audience #1:
Thank you.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:09.870

[Eastern European accent}]

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:11.870
Hello. Thank you for coming.

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:21.430
You actually just answered part of my question
which was so like in an ideal world we would

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:30.180
allocate our index funds globally probably
following some GDP metric or if-if the U.S.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:36.070
is 40% of the world's GDP I would allocate
40% to the portfolio.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:47.790
But my question was, ties into that so how-how
do we correct for what is, what is the, let's

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:50.140
call it a non-GDP measure and it-it doesn't
have to be a measure. I mean like the fact

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.970
that China is not really a democracy of-of
a like Western-type democracy or the fact

01:00:53.970 --> 01:01:01.430
that the United States is running deficits
that is worsen to some.

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:10.420
So how, like what, what correction would you
apply into the ideal formula? Like given some

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.200
of the geo-political things going on in-in
some of these largest economies?

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.420
Thank you.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:21.570
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
I think that's a very, I think that's a very

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:31.680
difficult question and I think different people
will have to answer that differently. I would

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:45.130
have to tell you that I think in a way there
are political risks all over the world.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:59.690
I think there's a big political risk in Europe
where I am not sure that the Eurozone is sustainable.

01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:07.480
I've always been a kind of a skeptic of this.
What you, it can work in the United States

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:14.380
because we have labor mobility. It can work
in the United States because we have a way

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.320
of compensating the losers.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:24.200
If there's a lot of unemployment in Appalachia,
we will pay unemployment benefits. We will

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.040
have wel, we will have food stamps and so
forth. That doesn't happen in Europe. There's

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.640
no central government.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:39.060
So yes, there are political problems absolutely
in China, but I would say that they are the

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:44.119
same kinds of things all over the world.

01:02:44.119 --> 01:02:50.760
So, I'm not sure exactly how you would make
those adjustments and I think probably, and

01:02:50.760 --> 01:03:04.380
I think part of it also has to be how comfortable
you feel about doing this. And it may be that

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:14.609
you don't feel that comfortable realizing
that the U.S. is only 40% of the world's GDP.

01:03:14.609 --> 01:03:21.490
You might want 60% in the U.S., although I
think there are certainly political, I'm not

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:27.780
sure that the political stability and our
tax structure, I mean we, there's a lot of

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.920
worries in the United States.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:35.359
We've made promises that given our current
tax structure we can't keep. And I think we've

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:39.640
got, if we don't come to terms with a lot
of this. So, I think there are risks all over

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.640
the world.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:48.530
We'd probably all answer it differently and
I'm not necessarily suggesting to you that

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:54.990
you have to take my template of saying, "The
U.S. is 40%; only have 40% in the U.S." But

01:03:54.990 --> 01:04:02.090
I do suggest that you think, "The U.S. is
40% of world's GDP and maybe if I look at

01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:09.910
my 401k it's a 100% in the U.S." Then probably
one ought to at least think that we oughta

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:17.970
move in the direction of more of it going
overseas despite the fact that as you say

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:20.030
there are certainly problems.

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:26.980
But I do think if we looked honestly at what
we had, we'd have to say that for all of the

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:32.720
problems there is this home country bias and
we probably oughta look carefully and ask

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720
whether we really are diversified enough.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720
&gt;&gt;#5: Thank you.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.780
&gt;&gt;female in audience #2: Just out of curiosity
I was wondering if you had say a million dollars

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:48.270
in cash, how would you invest that? And if
you, if you can't name the specific percentages

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:50.280
maybe just some index funds that you would
suggest.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:57.190
&gt;&gt;Professor Maliel: Well, I think again it
would depend in part, de, in part on one's

01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:04.690
age. Let's say that you were talking about
somebody who is getting close to retirement.

01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:16.609
I'd think I would use one of the target funds
targeted to the year at which one was planning

01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:20.859
to retire for a significant part of it.

01:05:20.859 --> 01:05:30.960
If I was in my 20's my sense would be where,
where my biggest asset are the earning that

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.680
I have throughout my lifetime, I would probably
think in terms of my investments of being

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:45.490
far more aggressive. I'd have more equities
than bonds. I would tend to be more international

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:49.869
despite some of the risks then less international.

01:05:49.869 --> 01:06:02.580
And it also depends upon my temperament. Because
if it's one thing I know, I-I've become the

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:12.980
informal advisor to a-a number of the widow's
of faculty members at Princeton. And I really

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:24.490
do understand how emotions and one's capacity
to take risk is important.

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:31.020
There was one widow, she was only fifty years
old, her husband died very young, and she

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:37.480
was just so nervous and we were trying to
think of what's an optimal mix of stocks and

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:44.670
bonds. And normally for someone who is fifty
you'd think that at least half in stocks,

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:47.780
maybe more would be appropriate.

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:59.440
But she was just so terribly nervous we agreed
on, we agreed on one-third stocks and two-thirds

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:11.010
bonds. And it's now the beginning of last
year, all hell is breaking loose, and she

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:16.790
comes into my office in absolute tears, "I
can't take it anymore. I have to sell all

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:17.970
my stocks."

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:25.570
Now, if I were just coldly thinking of the
right thing to do I'd say, "Hey, this is the

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:29.160
time to rebalance; put more into the stock
[chuckles] market."

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.160
[laughter]

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.800
All I could do is keep her from selling her
stocks –

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.800
[laughter]

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:39.720
and-and so that's a factor as well. Some,
one's temperament is certainly a factor. The-the

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:48.241
old line was the, J.P. Morgan was asked by
a friend, the friend said, "Hey, look what

01:07:48.241 --> 01:07:54.830
should I do? The stock market's going up and
down; I can't take it anymore. I can't sleep

01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:59.790
at night. What should I do?" And J.P. Morgan
said, "Well, sell down to the sleeping point."

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:00.790
[laughter]

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:06.930
So it really is partly and-and this is partly
an emotional thing, so I think all of those

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:13.330
are factors. And I can't just give you one,
one answer, but I think given you some idea

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.150
of the direction in which I would put things.

01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:18.779
[pause]

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:21.250
One more question, th-the hook is coming.

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:22.250
[laughter]

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.170
&gt;&gt;male in audience #6:
Thank you. In your book you talk a lot about

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:30.249
saving as well as an in-investing and I'm
wondering if you could give some guidance

01:08:30.249 --> 01:08:35.630
a-as to what would be a good targets to save
maybe at different ages and percentages.

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:42.759
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
Yeah, I think for most people I would just

01:08:42.759 --> 01:08:45.089
say more. I mean it's --

01:08:45.089 --> 01:08:46.089
[laughter]

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:55.239
it-it's, I don't think preaching to you guys
I have to do because I have learned at lunch

01:08:55.239 --> 01:09:00.909
that you now have a 401k where 99% of the
people are in.

01:09:00.909 --> 01:09:08.889
Where I really have to do the-the-the saving
pre-preaching is so many people in so many

01:09:08.889 --> 01:09:20.929
companies are not part of their 401k and they
save absolutely, they save absolutely nothing.

01:09:20.929 --> 01:09:28.549
And some people don't even join the company
401k when up to the match of the company.

01:09:28.549 --> 01:09:38.579
So I-I'm not sure that with your 401k that
you have here that this is something where

01:09:38.579 --> 01:09:45.080
you all are doing something that's, that's
wrong.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:54.279
But I think in general I would say, I would
say this: I don't think you have to save quite

01:09:54.279 --> 01:10:00.179
as much if you start early because you've
got that compounding affect.

01:10:00.179 --> 01:10:09.080
And where I think you really need to save
which could be 15 or 20% or even more of your

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:15.889
income are those people who did no saving
at all when they were young and they're now

01:10:15.889 --> 01:10:24.219
looking at retiring in 15 years and those
folks have to save a very high percentage.

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:32.479
So I'd say again, I don't wanna give a particular
number, but less if you're young, more if

01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:38.219
you're older.
And also to think and people I think don't

01:10:38.219 --> 01:10:44.120
do this, but maybe every once in a while,
even if you don't keep a budget, to look at,

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:50.210
"What did I spend money on last month." And
ask yourself, "Do I really have a lot of stuff

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:59.329
that really didn't give me much satisfaction?
Did I need all of that stuff?"

01:10:59.329 --> 01:11:06.940
Remembering that the opportunity cost of not
saving when you're in your 20's the opportunity

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:17.789
cost of not saving a dollar might be 10, 15,
20 dollars in your 50's and 60's. So, the

01:11:17.789 --> 01:11:30.239
opportunity cost is higher when you're younger.
And you ought to at least think of those,

01:11:30.239 --> 01:11:34.489
think of those kinds of things, but I think
you guys are --

01:11:34.489 --> 01:11:35.489
&gt;&gt;female voice:
Hello, hello.

01:11:35.489 --> 01:11:36.489
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
you guys are generally okay.

01:11:36.489 --> 01:11:38.340
&gt;&gt;male in audience #6:
Thank you.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.479
&gt;&gt;Professor Malkiel:
Okay, thank you all very, very much.

01:11:40.479 --> 01:11:40.649
[applause]
