00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.930
Susan takes your hand and she leads you
to the ribbon she is wearing rags and

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:24.689
feathers from Salvation Army counter and
the Sun falls down like money on our

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.960
leave the heart and she shows you where
to look

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.760
Thank you very much!

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.260
As I think Susanne mentioned

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.600
this is unfortunately going to be a very bad lecture.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.340
I brought you all under the false pretense as you will learn almost nothing

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.800
You will come away from this talk disappointed thinking that

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.180
I’ve let you down.  That you learned almost nothing,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.720
that your life is not being enhanced.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.080
Things will then start getting worse

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.980
and you will come to the realization that life is essentially meaningless; that your efforts are headed nowhere.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.340
And then at some point you will be struck down by death

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.300
and your loved ones and all your achievements will wither and be returned to dust.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.680
These are the basic facts of human life though they are often denied.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.880
But here, we have come together today to put darkness on the table

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520
and to look at it fairly and squarely.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.460
So, I want to sing a hymn in praise of looking at the glass half-empty

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.240
and do want to emphasize

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.480
to you the wisdom, and indeed the beauty

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.740
of thinking of life as an essentially deeply troubled and compromised affair.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.540
We are currently living in troubled times

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.940
and many of us respond to these troubled times

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.020
with a feeling of injured self-pity,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.320
as though something that is supposed to have gone right, has gone wrong.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.380
I would like to reverse the equation.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.540
Nothing was entirely supposed to go right

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.300
and so nothing has particularly gone wrong. We have simply

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.000
returned to a state of crisis which is the norm in human history.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.980
It’s sometimes the principle of newspapers

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.060
that murder, disease, crisis is the exception.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.460
It makes the news.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.360
But in fact, this is the news. This is all that ever happens.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.900
So, as I say,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.240
this feeling of being in a historically abnormal postition

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.920
is really a misreading of the true facts

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.780
of existence which is an almost continuous series of crises.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.140
Let’s try and remember. None of us were particularly happy in 2004

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.280
when things were going supposedly so well.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.060
We had all sorts of troubles on our mind, certainly, I did.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.780
I don’t remember these boom times being so great. Nothing boomed for me.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.680
So, it’s really a return, as I say, to the same.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.460
We do have in our world-culture, two very important strands of thought:

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.840
Buddhism and Christianity that have emphasized

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.540
that life is essentially an imperfect business from an entirely secular point of view.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.320
And we are a secular organization talking in this secular hall.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.660
I’d like to recover some of that wisdom.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.320
Some of the wisdom of thinking that, essentially, life is suffering,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.020
and the human-being is a fallen creature.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.860
I love the idea of fallenness.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.120
It’s a wonderful starting point; very good in a marriage or a relationship

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.980
- “Don’t expect... I never said I was perfect. I am a fallen creature.”

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.040
It’s very hard for people to comeback at us on that one.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.540
So,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.100
really, I am just trying to emphasize the ever present nature of suffering and unhappiness.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.340
But really, I want to talk about impotence first.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.760
Who here has been impotent recently? The devil...

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.240
Anyone else suffered from impotence?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.680
You are just not being honest!

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.860
Please, someone put up their hand, apart from me.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.780
Ok, thank you, thank you!

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.000
Lady,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.100
Ok, right, so impotence

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.400
it's a fact of life now, very interesting thing about impotence

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.940
impotence is all to do with pessimism and optimism

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.200
its when there is a huge expectation on you for things to go really well

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.500
thats when people get impotent, and really this goes to the heart of what I wanted to be talking about today

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.250
there's a lovely for those of you who
knows Monte know montagnes essays

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.160
Montaigne 16th century French
philosopher wrote a wonderful essay what

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.100
about impotence in which his essential
drift is if you if you arrive in the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.660
bedroom or bedchamber as he put it with
high expectations there's a very serious

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.600
risk that things will go wrong so he
counsels there was a man there's a true

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.890
story
there was a man near his his village who

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.030
had failed with a woman as he put it and
had cut off his member and had sent it

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.340
to the woman in atonement for his error
and this had so disturbed the local

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.850
community and so disturbed Montaigne
that he picked up a pen to try and write

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.419
about listen and and his essential
conclusion was when entering the bedroom

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.190
always say that you are a bad lover this
is the only way really in which you can

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.210
ever stand the chance of making it a
good impression must always lower the

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.820
expectations of performance that's the
way in which you can be a good lover but

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.610
I think there's a deeper point a this is
not just about sexual performance this

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.220
is about life performance that somehow
raising expectations and and and

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.090
suggesting that all will go well is the
surest way to get very nervous and with

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.190
nervousness comes failure so there's a
curious debt of success on a complete

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.780
familiarity with failure if you expect
to succeed you will almost certainly

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.000
fail so pessimism doesn't necessarily
have to lead to a lack of achievement or

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.140
a complete resignation but very
strangely we have to start I think I

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:04.400
want to argue from a feeling that that
things are not going to go well nowadays

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.110
our philosophers and thinkers and and
public figures are often in the business

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.169
of trying to tell us how to cope with
how to make life better somehow the

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.910
improvement of life is the way in which
most problems are viewed how can we make

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.840
things go better I want to direct your
thoughts to a school of philosophy that

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.830
flourished in ancient Rome and that took
a completely different approach I'm

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.730
talking about stoicism and the stoic
school of philosophy when we speak of

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.220
someone being stoic in the face of it of
a disaster we are very much plugged in

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:45.240
to an ancestral memory of how the Stoics
of ancient Rome went about things one of

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.550
my favorite stoic philosophers is the
philosopher Seneca who lived in the time

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.620
of Nero a very troubled time for the
Roman Empire if we think we haven't got

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.750
it bad look at Nero's reign for what was
going on then and he very much believed

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.470
that philosophy was a discipline to keep
you sane in troubled times and that one

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.280
of the best ways to be sane was
precisely to master pessimism to make

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.150
yourself at home in pessimism to become
a master of this strange and perhaps

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.560
depressing seeming but not actually
depressing philosophy Seneca wrote a

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.250
book on anger very interesting thing
about anger now many of us nowadays

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.820
think that anger is an almost
physiological problem it's to do with

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.930
sort of being hot-blooded or something
Seneca thought that was nonsense he

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.430
believed that anger we get angry for a
very simple reason optimism optimism

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.510
makes us angry and he compared a very
interesting thing he asked why people

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.370
don't get angry when it rains
particularly in Northern Europe the

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.539
reason why people don't get angry when
it rains is that we expect it to rain

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:53.250
ticking in England it's amazing if it
doesn't rain so it would not occur to

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.600
anybody to get angry at the fact it is
raining now the interesting thing is we

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.889
don't adopt this very wise approach in
all areas of life and think about our

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:06.810
keys you know we start shouting when we
lose the house keys or how we behave

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.650
when they were stuck in traffic we you
know we insult people we think how come

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.490
we're in traffic now essentially that is
because we believe implicitly in a world

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.270
in which keys never go astray and the
roads are always mysteriously traffic

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:23.440
free a very very odd starting
for life so it's our it's our

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.920
expectations that defines what will
anger us that's not to say we won't ever

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.070
feel sad but there's a difference
between sad sadness and anger and I

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.200
think Senecas point was will be a lot
wiser if we manage to expect a lot more

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.659
that our sense of what is normal to
expect is hugely reduced so we get very

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:44.800
surprised when people suddenly die or
when things suddenly go wrong he urges

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.870
to think Seneca that our fate is really
in the hands of the goddess of fortune

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.339
now the goddess of fortune was held to
be a woman who commanded all of our

00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:58.510
destinies and the thing about her is
that he's entirely fickle she's cruel

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:03.870
vain and made any point decide that we
will die and somebody else will succeed

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:10.360
essentially she's uncontrollable entity
in our lives and in ancient Rome the

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.030
goddess of fortune was everywhere there
was her Statue everywhere she was on the

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.490
back of coins etc and her message was
most of our life is in the hands of

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:23.350
somebody else and however much we try
and achieve rational control we will you

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:29.350
know we will she'll probably at some
point get us in order to try and cope

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.970
with the vagaries of fortune Seneca
counseled us to undertake what he called

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:39.940
a in Latin a prime edit RTO a curious
exercise called a premeditation he

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:45.370
advised that every morning in bed before
getting up you should essentially run

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.960
through in your mind the whole day ahead
of you and imagine every single disaster

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.070
that could occur to you not because it
would necessarily occur but in order to

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:59.230
protect you if it might and I just want
us to go through what Seneca says in his

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.580
premeditation he says some the wise will
start each day with the thought that

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.080
fortune gives us nothing which we can
really own nothing whether public or

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.150
private is stable the destinies of men
no less than those of cities are in a

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:18.040
whirl how often of cities in Asia been
laid load by a single shock of an

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.700
earthquake how many towns in Syria we
live in the middle of things which have

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.440
all been destined to die mortal have you
been born and to mortals have you given

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.540
birth so reckon on everything expect
everything a year later the town of

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.910
Pompeii was destroyed in other words we
of on unstable ground and we must accept

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:42.610
this in a very fundamental starting
point we must not react with injured

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.260
surprise to bad things these bad things
are written into the contract of life no

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.700
one should have a child wrote Seneca
without the ability to tolerate the

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:58.680
thought that that child may be may be
dead by evening here I have two children

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.740
he gives some lovely quotes which are
oddly cheering he says what need is

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:09.340
there to weep over parts of life he says
the whole of it calls for tears there's

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.990
also a lovely quote from him he where he
says a man must swallow a toad every

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.530
morning to be sure of not meeting with
anything more disgusting and the whole

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:23.260
day ahead we try to have toad cereal
here for you today but it didn't it

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.560
didn't come about but essentially the
starting point has to be much more

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.100
pessimistic the interesting thing is I
always cheer up when I read this sort of

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.330
stuff and I think the reason is that
some of the darkest thinkers are

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.780
consoling the reason I wanted Leonard
Cohen is that listening to Leonard Cohen

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:43.900
particularly when you listen it on CD
cheers you up it it makes you feel that

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.530
somehow you're not alone in your sadness
that sadness which can seem like an

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:53.770
aberration a departure from the norm is
in fact the basic default mode of human

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.150
beings and so the works of art have a
huge role to play I think in confirming

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:03.700
those dark hunches it's very unfortunate
as I said a minute ago that we live in a

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.500
world full of hope we live in a world
surrounded by self-help books and one of

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.160
the things about self-help books is
they're constantly telling us to get out

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.100
get out of bed and achieve things and do
wonderful things and I undertook a few

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.780
years ago a bit of a study of the
self-help of genre and I found I came

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.860
across a self-help book which was
perhaps one of the most depressing books

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.930
I think I've ever read unintentionally
it's by a man called Anthony Robbins and

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.100
if any of you know him please don't read
him if you don't a few years ago he read

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.110
he wrote a book called awaken the giant
within and the the essential point is

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.770
that all of us are small he said but all
of us have a potential giant and by

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:52.700
reading his book $16
on Amazon he we can start to grow and do

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.630
do amazing things and he described how
he had once been poor and small and

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:02.240
depressed but he and fat as well but he
went on a diet etc I've got a little

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.050
quote for you here he goes um I
discovered a magical power in me to take

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.880
back control of my physical well-being I
permanently rid myself a 38 pounds of

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.420
fat through this dramatic weight loss I
attracted the woman of my dreams I

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.980
married her and I created the family I'd
always desired I used my power to change

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.480
my income from subsistence level to over
ten million dollars a year this moved me

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.200
from a tiny apartment where I was wish
washing my dishes in the bathtub because

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.340
there was no kitchen - my family's
current home the spanish-style Del Mar

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:37.700
castle a picture of which he helpfully
includes in his in his book okay we all

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.570
know the type of book they're out there
in water stones and everywhere else and

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.390
they're a very very depressing but
they're part of a wider movement and

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.850
that is the feeling that everybody can
succeed that opportunity is not just for

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.670
the few it's for the many this is the
message we hear from every single

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:57.650
politician who ever stands up on a
pulpit everyone can do it no one should

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:02.450
hold you back you can do it it's a
beautiful idea except it's got some

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.990
serious drawbacks one of the most
serious drawbacks is it constantly feels

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.770
leaves us feeling envious let me talk to
you about Envy the interesting thing

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:15.080
about Envy is you don't envy everybody
it's I think very unusual for anyone in

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.670
this room to Envy the Queen anybody envy
the Queen I don't envy the Queen the

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.570
reason the reason we don't envy the
Queen is she's too weird she's just

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.590
someone
she's just so remote from us we can't

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.300
really relate to her she lives in this
odd Palace et cetera however who in this

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.730
room has not envied someone at a school
reunion or at a university riu nor by

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.000
reading something in the paper about
someone they were once at school with or

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.160
interested with anyone not felt that
emotion no few but not very many about

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.120
the same level as impotence so basically
the reason for this is a sense of

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.290
opportunity we don't feel that we will
envy the Queen because she feels too

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.720
strange she feels distant from us we
don't feel equal

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.530
to her as soon as you feel equal to
somebody soon as you feel I'm basically

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.330
more or less like this person and I
could do this too but you haven't you

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.030
will start to get envious and depressed
so a feeling of opportunity and equality

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:18.560
and the fact that everybody can make it
this is strangely a really really

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.270
depressing a starting point which
constantly leaves us a feeling that we

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.940
haven't achieved enough there's an
interesting thing when I was doing my

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.850
little study of American self-help books
it struck me that if you look at

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.230
self-help shelves in in America but I
think probably all over there are really

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.550
two kinds of books the first kind of
book is like the Anthony Robbins type of

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:42.320
book you can do it you can make it it's
out there the other kind of book is a

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.260
books telling you how to cope with
what's euphemistically termed low

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.760
self-esteem and I think there's a real
relationship a society that tells people

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.760
that they can achieve anything
we'll also be a society that very

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.650
swiftly develops a problem of
self-esteem because simply if everybody

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.640
expects to achieve everything you're
going to get an awful lot of people who

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.100
are feeling that something's gone
dramatically wrong with their lives it

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:12.020
probably is unlikely today that you
could become successful as Bill Gates as

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.470
it was unlikely in the 17th century that
you could join the ranks of the French

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:19.840
aristocracy but it doesn't feel like
that it feels from opening most

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.730
magazines etc that you know if you had a
garage and knew that what about software

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.900
and had a few bright ideas few contacts
you could get there simple really

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.370
it's not statistically it is
unbelievably small I was talking to

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.100
somebody in venture capital the other
day who said to me that something like

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:42.650
98% of all business ideas ever submitted
will fail we don't hear that we don't

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.660
hear those stories we are focused on a
very very small minority another thing

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:53.720
that you always hear another very
optimistic but very depressing idea that

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.250
is proposed in our optimistic Society is
the idea of meritocracy now what is

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.300
meritocracy meritocracy is the idea that
if we all work hard enough at making

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:08.929
society fair we will be able to build a
world where anybody can make it and you

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:12.020
know you hear politicians on all sides
of the political spectrum praising

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.140
meritocracy
how can we get the school system working

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.760
well enough that it can make a
meritocratic world come true now the

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.250
interesting thing about a meritocracy is
that it's got some very nasty cruel side

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.720
effects if you really believe that we
can build a world where everybody is

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.340
going to end up where they merit to be
where they deserve to be you'll also end

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.440
up with a society in which anybody who
doesn't as it were make it deserves not

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.880
to make it if you believe in a world
where those people who get to the top

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.020
merit their success you're implicitly
also standing up a society where people

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:52.660
deserve to fail and merits to fail and
the more people believe that we do live

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:58.780
in a meritocracy the more people will be
very hard on themselves if they fail and

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.520
very tough on others I remember a little
while ago I was them I was in America

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.600
which is after all the land the center
of meritocracy in many ways of belief in

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.390
meritocracy and and and there was some
at a dinner with some friends and

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.290
everyone had a bit too much to drink and
there were lot of jokes being made about

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.910
white trash and trailer trash and there
was lots of hilarity about trailer trash

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.230
and how funny was that people were
living on the edge of cities in caravans

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.530
and having children with their children
and all this sort of thing and I said oh

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.200
hang on a minute this doesn't sound
particularly funny here I mean what's

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.740
going on in this friend of mine piped up
she said you know this really makes me

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:41.080
feel my blood boil you know because you
know you come from Europe and you know

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.120
you're all socialist and essentially you
believe you know that that there's

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.270
something wrong with this kind of
attitude whereas really I only got to

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.840
where I got and she was quite a
high-powered person I only got to where

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.050
I got because I worked hard you know
she's my father's an alcoholic

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.740
but I made it and I made it because of
me and so I deserve to be at the top and

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.900
if someone's in a trailer home well
they're in a trailer home and that's

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.110
their problem and don't expect me to pay
for them now that's an attitude you

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.720
sometimes hear and it's the attitude
that's precisely the result of

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.370
meritocracy now I think it's absolutely
impossible to have a meritocracy it's

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:17.320
completely crazy to imagine that we will
ever reach a society where people will

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.750
really deserve their success and totally
deserve their failure there is simply

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.290
too many factors in anybody's life and
to expect that you can simply take a

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.380
read
of somebody's life and and determine

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.620
from that whether they deserve to be
there or not is is simply unbelievable

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:40.330
again if we go back to our Romans and
our Stoics you know think of the goddess

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.020
of fortune an ancient Roman who did well
did not think that he or she was

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.770
entirely responsible for success they
knew that it was the goddess of fortune

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.160
the goddess of fortune had done it and
so instantly if something went right you

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.160
went to give an offering to the goddess
of fortune to basically say thank you

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.360
you know I didn't sell my company for
millions of pounds I didn't you know win

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.920
public office the goddess of fortune
gave this to me it's a gift and that

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.790
gift may be taken away I don't own it
that gift says nothing about me that

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.630
gift is really as it were in the hands
of somebody else

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.440
again we've lost sight of this we've
become much more optimistic we believe

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.070
that we are in control of our destinies
and with that belief in control comes

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.510
serious self-esteem people commit
suicide weirdly a lot more nowadays and

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.440
a lot more in societies which are felt
to be individualistic where the

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.890
individual is felt to be entirely in
control of his destiny the rates of

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:34.630
suicide goes up and the reason for that
is that all failure is assumed to be a

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:41.290
personal point of blame so people assume
their success and they assume personally

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.190
they're their failure and that's why
rates of suicide are higher the

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.780
interesting thing about a recession is
that racine recessions certain kinds of

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.710
suicide go down in number why is that
because suddenly there is a public

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:58.630
explanation for failure and that public
explanation is a huge burden that's

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.230
lifted off our backs
in fact people continue to fail at all

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.610
times of the economic cycle but suddenly
there's a story a publicly available

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:12.100
story for why there is a failure and
that and that publicly available story

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.730
is very important and what I want to
suggest is really that these stories of

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.420
public failure have disappeared in the
narrative that we tell ourselves about

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.240
what life is like I mean if we look at
the history of work and how people view

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:30.490
work you know for nowadays people expect
that their work will be an arena of

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.780
fulfillment and happiness that is the
sort of basic assumption that we have

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.680
and that constantly is held before us a
completely insane idea historically

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.340
where work was assumed to be I mean if
you listen to the ancient Greeks work is

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:48.410
slavery and if you want have a good life
you you simply have to take yourself out

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:53.060
of the financial system you cannot you
know the pleasurable sides of existence

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.830
are not those certain circumscribed
within the boundaries of work and in

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:02.840
early Christianity a similar kind of
belief that that work is essentially a

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.980
punishment for the sins of Adam that's
why we toil that idea starts to

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.040
disappear by the time you get to the
18th century various bourgeois

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.700
philosophers are singing the praises of
work work as a place to realize yourself

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:20.630
to become yourself to to become you know
someone who's someone who can take out

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.110
of yourself something that's precious
and put it out there and get paid for it

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.830
a beautiful idea
but again an idea with all sorts of

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.630
casualties because it incidentally the
optimistic idea of work kicks in at

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:37.490
roughly the same time that the
optimistic idea of love comes about the

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.900
18th century is a curious time mid 18th
century a lot of bourgeois philosophers

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.950
come up with a new idea of love the idea
is that suddenly you should marry

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:51.830
someone that you love pletely mad idea
historically previously you don't marry

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.400
someone you love you marry somebody's
got a farm next door you hand over the

00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.200
family property that's how you do it but
suddenly a new idea note you should

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.830
marry someone that you love and that's
how marriage should work and and

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.950
similarly you should get a job and that
you love as well you should realize

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:12.140
yourself so suddenly these two vital
safety valves the hobby and the mistress

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.450
go out of the window
for hundreds of years hundreds of years

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:24.020
you know your real working life happens
happens on your you realize your real

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.290
life not real your real life happens on
the weekend and evenings in your spare

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.740
time that's that's the time of enjoyment
and similarly your real love life goes

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.810
on in extra curricular activity but
suddenly this new better idea I know

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.470
some people who are very happily married
and I know some people who really enjoy

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:44.960
their jobs but they're a real minority I
would estimate around 5% of people I've

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.750
ever come across
or in that lucky band so it's very odd

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:54.470
that the other 95% of us have before us
as idea of normality an ideal which has

00:23:54.470 --> 00:24:00.230
failed 95 percent of us it's a very very
bizarre philosophy of life that we

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:06.080
should be holding up as normal something
which is clearly almost a you know

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.460
beautifully rare so we have holding up
before us as an idea of normality

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:18.290
something which is anything other than
normal I want to talk more about the the

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.520
cheerful sides of pessimism and how to
be happily sad one of the things that I

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:28.700
think we should all do a lot more is
some put skulls on our desks in the in

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.080
the Middle Ages and the early modern
period a vital piece of interior design

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.130
was a skull if you'd finished a
beautiful desk mahogany desk whatever

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.850
one of the way you know put your quill
pen but also skull a skull was something

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.790
you'd always put on your desk and the
reason for that is that as you're doing

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.560
your work
you'll always look at the skull and

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.060
think I'm going to be like him in a
little while and the point was not to

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.170
despair but precisely to focus on what's
important because I think one of the

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.930
things about the thought of death is it
doesn't make you think that life is

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.740
meaningless far from it it simply
readjusts your priorities any of us

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.030
who've been in a near-death experience
or let's face it all of us are in

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.940
near-death experiences we're in a
near-death experience right now because

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.910
you know you could fall on your head and
you would be dead so life is a

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.730
near-death experience but any of us
who've come really close to a near-death

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.770
experience
will report the following thing that

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.650
some things started to matter a lot and
other things started to matter a bit

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.660
less and the things that tend to matter
a lot less are what other people think

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.280
about you and certain aspects of your
career so and the things that's not to

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.730
matter
lotmore are what people you really like

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.030
think of you
very unusual idea but something that

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:38.920
only tends to occur to us on our
deathbed you know and so the

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.650
contemplation of death a very very
important part of a healthy life and I

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:49.030
didn't don't have a skull but as I said
I would like all of us to reflect on

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:53.170
death more regularly and hopefully
there'll be time at the end for us to do

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:58.180
that other things to do if you're if
you're if you're a tourist ruins I don't

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.960
know if and if you like ruins
I love ruins but head out to see some

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.800
ruins there's some wonderful ruins
obviously in ancient Egypt in Greece

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.190
they're quite good too but also there's
some modern industrial ruins you know

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.370
head up north to parts of northern
England head to the Mojave Desert

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.660
weathers a plain famous plain graveyard
where most of the world's airlines are

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.980
currently parking their airliners it's
good to see modern civilization in

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.570
crumbling to bits it's good to see what
will happen to us in time to make

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:31.180
ourselves properly at home I think we
you know we live in a world where human

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.010
achievement is right at the center of
what we do and we constantly have held

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.550
before us great human achievements it's
very important to balance that by

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:46.000
getting out into nature getting out into
bits of history where we see the marks

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.230
of time written into the landscape
anything which as it were puts us into

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.910
perspective in some way there's a nice
we're feeling small I suppose I want to

00:26:54.910 --> 00:27:00.520
say very often we made you feel small by
people you know at work or in social

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.680
life who patronize us etc I want to
invite us to feel small in relation to

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.700
the really big things eternity time
death these are good things to feel

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.150
small in front of and it's I think
that's why many of us enjoy going off to

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.530
see a glacier say or looking down at the
Earth from an aeroplane or going

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:22.330
thinking about the polar icecaps these
vast empty spaces make us feel small in

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.230
a way which alleviates us from that
agonizing sense of self-importance and

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.850
egoism which is otherwise clinging to us
like a bad smell so head out to glaciers

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:35.860
head out to anywhere which makes you
feel properly small and as I say put a

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.999
skull on
on your table the other thing of course

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:46.399
that that you can do with sadness is to
discover works of art that are sad and

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:50.479
if you are feeling a little bit sad my
advice to you is to find an artist who

00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:54.769
somehow says not you know life is
cheerful that's a devil's talk that life

00:27:54.769 --> 00:28:00.649
is cheer the an artist who somehow makes
it even grimmer so read someone like the

00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:04.989
philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer read
Pascal listen to Leonard Cohen or indeed

00:28:04.989 --> 00:28:12.559
listen to Elton John there's a I want to
there's a lovely song by Elton John

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:16.700
called called sad songs and listen to
the first verse guess there are times

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.289
when we all need to share a little pain
and ironing out the rough spots is the

00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:26.029
hardest part when memories remain and
it's times like these when we all need

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:30.379
to hear the radio because from the lips
of some old singer we can share the

00:28:30.379 --> 00:28:34.609
troubles that we already know so in
other words a sense of confirmation it's

00:28:34.609 --> 00:28:38.779
through the sad song that our own
sadness is alleviated and on that note I

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:43.969
like to play and all of you to sing if
you can a little bit of sad songs take

00:28:43.969 --> 00:28:51.169
it away sad songs by Elton John is it
coming should here we are and like

00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:57.860
you're just sing and I'll sing too
give it a bit louder

00:29:00.469 --> 00:29:04.519
one two three

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:12.580
guess there are times when be you need
to share

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:26.880
and for us what is the hardest part when
memories remain a times like these when

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.309
we want me to give her

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:52.779
we already know come on louder on Ted on
those sides when hope is gone

00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:56.489
love you too

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.860
your loo just
do you feel

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.519
gosh

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.920
of this goal

00:30:14.699 --> 00:30:19.389
okay we're gonna cover there thank you
thank you Scott thank you

00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:26.349
all right thank you can I get for it no
now now thank you now the other thing

00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:30.609
that the other thing that sadness and
sad songs and pessimism generally can do

00:30:30.609 --> 00:30:34.359
is to improve your sex appeal it's a
little known fact

00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:38.079
very rarely spoken off in the pages of
fashion magazines and other such things

00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:42.729
that sadness as I say can bring you
dates and it's very often thought that

00:30:42.729 --> 00:30:47.019
if you're not getting out enough if
you're not feeling attractive if if

00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:50.529
you're not pulling people in that maybe
you should feel happy as more cheerful

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:55.179
and suggests an image that your life is
going well I'd like to draw your

00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:59.289
attention to the leaflet that came the
parish newsletter where on the back of

00:30:59.289 --> 00:31:03.599
it you should find a picture by Edward
Hopper called automat painted in 1929

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:08.949
here's a woman in a cafe and I think
she's rather cute

00:31:08.949 --> 00:31:15.249
and I think one of the reasons why she's
cute is because she's sad now I think

00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:20.529
that contra imagined this woman with a
group of her girlfriends giggling away

00:31:20.529 --> 00:31:24.519
things have gone really happy she's got
a promotion she's so happy she's waving

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:30.249
her arms about instantly I find a rather
less attractive I think the reason is

00:31:30.249 --> 00:31:33.999
that when we think about love and
falling in love one of the things I

00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:37.869
think we want to do is to touch other
people's sadness could sound rather

00:31:37.869 --> 00:31:42.429
creepy but really what we want in a
relationship is to share the sad things

00:31:42.429 --> 00:31:45.369
I mean what's the point of having a
relationship in which you're cheerful

00:31:45.369 --> 00:31:48.519
all the time you want to have a
relationship where you can somehow unite

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:52.479
your sadness with somebody else's
sadness relationships are built around

00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:57.940
shared griefs and letting a little bit
of that shared grief show even on a

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:02.349
first date is a good thing but
confessing how lonely you've recently

00:32:02.349 --> 00:32:05.550
been is
a good thing cheekily I think there's a

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.330
gender divide I have to be honest I
think that I think most men speak

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:13.410
personally most men do very much like
someone who's been in a lot we feel

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:17.520
relaxed and coming back to impotence
very cheered up by the sense that a

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.130
woman has not got too many dates and
that she's a little bit alone so we need

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:26.880
to admit to that Oh time is ticking on
so I'm gonna I'm gonna bring things to a

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.920
close but I think one of the things that
I want you to take away from today is

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:40.920
the advantages of living your dark
moments fully living your sadness to the

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.450
full not seeing it as some aberration
but seeing it as something that is an

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.900
intrinsic part of life and something
that you shouldn't run away from you

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:56.910
should embrace and standing in your room
with Elton John at full blast you should

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:01.650
as I say embrace the sounds also read
some Nietzsche let me let me equation a

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.670
bit from Nietzsche he says to those
human beings who are of any concern to

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.630
me
I wish suffering desolation sickness ill

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:14.190
treatment indignities and illness I wish
that these friends of mine should not

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:18.870
remain unfamiliar with profound self
contempt the torture of self mistrust

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:23.460
the wretchedness of the vanquished in
other words Nietzsche one of the

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.420
greatest philosophers of the 19th
century possibly of all time is advising

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.050
us that anyone he cares about he wants
to suffer now what on earth is going on

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.980
there the reason is simple Nietzsche
believed like many of those many those

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.880
have studied the question that somehow
there is a real relationship between the

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.890
ability to suffer the ability to endure
suffering and live suffering and look

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:49.860
suffering in the face and the capacity
to do anything important or good let me

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.400
read you another bit from Nietzsche if
you refuse to let your suffering lie

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.900
upon you for even an hour and if you
constantly try and prevent and forestall

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:03.060
all possible distress way ahead of time
if you experience suffering and

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.500
displeasure as evil hateful worthy of
annihilation and as a defect of

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.260
existence then it is clear that you
Harbor in your heart

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.900
the religion of comfortableness how
little you know of human happiness you

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.460
can
little people for happiness and

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.839
unhappiness our sisters and even twins
that either grow up together or as in

00:34:22.839 --> 00:34:26.710
your case child remains small together
in other words there's a real

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:32.440
relationship between the capacity to
endure suffering and the capacity to do

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.139
to do great things it's not a
coincidence that Nietzsche was a

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:39.639
teetotaler his favorite drink was milk
and he advised us never to drink please

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.460
know none of you if you want to be
Nietzsche and don't go to the pub now

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.659
the reason for this is let's think about
what alcohol does alcohol is one of

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.960
those things if you if you feel a little
bit sad got some problems what do you do

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.290
drink and then what happens after you've
had a few drinks you feel a bit more

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:57.579
cheerful now this is absolutely
disastrous advice for Nietzsche because

00:34:57.579 --> 00:35:00.550
Nietzsche believed that it's in moments
of darkness that we have our best

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:05.890
insights into what we need in life if we
try and stop feeling envious immediately

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:09.940
if we try and stop feeling bad if when
we're writing a book we feel happy with

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.320
it immediately we will never do anything
good the capacity to tolerate suffering

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.520
the capacity to be pessimistic
comfortably to endure passages of

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.400
pessimism is absolutely essential and
that's why

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.290
Nietzsche thought that alcohol was a
very very bad idea now and it's

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.050
something else that Nietzsche thought
was a very bad idea and I'm speaking in

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.730
an appropriate place and that's
Christianity famously and he called

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:39.250
Christianity and alcohol the two great
narcotics of European civilization and

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:43.180
he believed that Christianity was bad
for the very same reason that alcohol is

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:48.579
bad the reason that Christianity is bad
do you excuse anybody here who's a

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:52.300
believer the reason he believed that
Christianity was bad is because it makes

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.200
us feel good too quickly if you're
worried about timidity the New Testament

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.560
tells you blessed are the meek for they
shall inherit the earth if you're

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.770
worried about having no friends the New
Testament says blessed are ye when men

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.890
shall hate you and when they shall
separate you from their company if

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:09.430
you're worried about an exploitative job
the New Testament advises servants obey

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:14.380
in all things your masters according to
the flesh so in other words you quickly

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.310
feel better about a lot of things now
Nietzsche famously argued that all of us

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.810
actually want many good things like we
want an active sex life we don't want to

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:27.540
be meek we quite want to be clever we
want to have good jobs but

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.920
some of us give up too quickly and we
give up too quickly because we are

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.430
addicted to comfortableness we want to
be comfortable so quickly and

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.520
Christianity for Nietzsche was a
religion that turned all these things on

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.010
its head it was a hypocritical creed
which denounces what people actually

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:50.740
want but a too often too weak to fight
for and it praises what many of us don't

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:55.120
want but happen to have so in the
Christian view powerlessness becomes

00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:00.250
goodness baseness becomes humility
submission to people one hates becomes

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.900
obedience and in each us phrase not
being able to take revenge turns into

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:09.880
forgiveness now Nietzsche thought that
was all a very very bad idea and he very

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.890
much believed now incidentally he was
poor totally forgotten and in many ways

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:18.340
wretched but the very different the
difference he thought was that he

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:24.610
embraced the darkness he didn't say he
didn't say I'm sad but he didn't say

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.700
there are things wrong with my life but
they're not really wrong he said there

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.940
are things wrong with my life and I'm
sad about it he embraced the pessimism

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:35.890
he admitted to the pessimism and this is
really the essence of what I'm trying to

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:39.580
say now that pessimism is a feature of
life it's a feature of life that we

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:44.620
often try to run away from by running
away from it too quickly we cut

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:48.970
ourselves off from the opportunity to
embrace this darkness and to embrace the

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:53.350
lessons that it often brings and we
often also cut ourselves off from the

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.170
deepest kind of relationships which we
can have with other human beings which

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:01.300
are relationships based around a
confession of suffering and I think that

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.350
essentially all good friendships are
about confession one sort or another

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:10.570
they're a confession of things that the
rest of the world thinks of as

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:16.030
unacceptable but are in fact part of
human life so all of us now we can have

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.060
a little bit of time to have some tea
and cakes and also there's get a

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:22.840
confessional box but really what I want
to what I hope that will take away from

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.850
the next few minutes is going to be a
sense of shared communion around the

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:33.360
dark things and a capacity to admit
among ourselves just how hard we find

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:39.390
everybody a life so join me in joining
me in being sad

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:44.640
and in eating some misfortune cookies
which will also be at the back but thank

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:52.130
you all very much and and I hope that
today goes quite badly thank you
