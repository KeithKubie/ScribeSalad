Hey guys! Welcome back, thanks for joining us today on The King of Random.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.859
Today we're going to be looking at how to build your very own laser light show that is perfectly synced with the music.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.359
This is a pretty easy project that you can do with some basic supplies in a single afternoon. All the supplies

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.379
we'll need is a number 10 can, some normal balloons either some small mirrors

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.160
or a single mirror that you can cut into smaller pieces, some double-sided tape and a laser pointer.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.580
Now we have all of our supplies, let's start building.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.160
First, we need our number 10 can with the top and bottom removed, so we just have a metal cylinder this particular can is full of rice

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
So I'm gonna cut off the lid, pour off the rice into a container to save it for later

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.960
and then cut off the bottom.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.120
March 21st 1996. I don't know if that's when its packaged or it's theoretically expired.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.280
Probably packaged. I don't think it expires really.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.940
It's rice

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.989
With the top and bottom cut off of our can, we want to take a balloon and stretch it over the mouth of the can.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.680
The first step is we're going to blow the balloon up almost as much as it will go.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.449
Now it's stretched out, and we'll have an easier time fitting over the can. We want to cut it about

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.489
1/2 of the total balloon length down, not at the very widest part, but just above that.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.699
Stretching the balloon over the mouth is going to be a lot easier if you have another pair of hands to help.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.139
Once it's stretched into place, use a little bit of electrical tape around the edge to keep it from coming off.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.690
Now if your goal is just to make yourself a miniature drum, congratulations! You're done.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.480
However, we're trying to make a laser light show.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.179
So we're not quite there yet. The next step is we need to attach about a one-inch square piece of mirror to our latex

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.400
balloon. Most types of mirrors are made from glass and it's hard to cut them, but this type is made from plastic because it's designed

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.459
to be used in the shower. I guess it's protection in case it drops.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.419
Since its plastic, we're gonna see if we can cut through it and just make a piece about that size.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.909
Now that the fact that it's cracking like that gives me an idea.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.700
I'm gonna try and score it with a knife and see if I can break it along that line, instead of using a saw.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.920
Although, that was working

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.820
Alright. Here goes...

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.059
Huh, well it broke.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Just not where I thought it was going to.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440
There we go.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.699
I'm gonna try throwing this in the vise and see if that will help give me a cleaner edge to break along.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.969
There we have it, I'm just going use some sandpaper to clean at the edges

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.359
There we have it. Our one-inch square piece of mirror.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.690
Now we're just going to attach that to the centre of the balloon using some double-sided tape.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.519
Reach inside and make sure it's pressed nicely down on there.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.419
Now we know it's gonna stick, no problem.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.880
Now with the mirror attached, we have the basis for what we're going to use to make our laser light show work.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.320
We're going to set this can up in front of a speaker and when the air waves coming out of the speaker hit the rubber,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.759
it's going to make it vibrate. The laser pointer will be shining right on the mirror and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.659
reflecting onto the wall. As the latex vibrates with the music, the pattern on the wall will move in some sort of spirograph

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.900
patterns that match the vibrations of the sound we listening to.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.269
First, let's take a little bit of electrical tape and wrap it tightly around the button so the laser pointer stays on.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.619
There are lots of options of how to keep your laser pointed nicely at your mirror, but since I had some rice,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.120
I poured some into a plate and I'll use that to hold my laser still as it points to the mirror.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.489
We know our setup works, let's try it with some music.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.660
Heh, that is great

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.650
Our laser light show is working pretty well,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.910
but we want to take it to the next level so what we have here is a fog machine and then we're gonna turn off

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.000
some of the lights as well. Let's see how this works.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:05.380
♫ Music ♫

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.680
Quick update, we've had a few upgrades.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.469
We've added another can in front of another speaker and

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.519
instead of the one little laser that we had before, we have this brighter green laser,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.180
we have this purple laser

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.520
and we also have this extremely powerful blueish green laser.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.140
[AHH!! MY EYES!! HALP!]

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.340
So we're gonna get all three of those pointed at the mirrors reflecting onto the walls, and then crank up the music.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.079
Well, I've melted a couple small holes into my balloon with my mega powerful laser,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.720
so let's get the music started before anything else goes wrong.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.930
Power already died. [RIP Blue Laser 2017 - 2017]

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.889
There you go.

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.960
Now you know how to take a number ten can, a balloon and a mirror to make your very own laser light show?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.960
You can get laser pointers online for surprisingly cheap. We've got a couple links down in the description for you can get some.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.920
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we look forward to the next one. Talk to you then.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.880
That smells kinda funny...

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.680
Man...so that powerful blue laser.

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:37.889
I just I would miss the mirror, just a little bit while I was setting it up

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.478
and it just kind of melted holes in the balloon immediately. I've got four little holes going on.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.320
I think that also messed with the sound vibration

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.140
because some of the air was able to get out so it stopped moving the mirror of quite as much.

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.009
You right there. The one who just watched this video to the end.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.909
You are the reason that we work so hard to make these videos. It's for people like you.

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.708
Thank you very kindly for being as supportive as you are. You keep watching the videos and we'll keep making more.
