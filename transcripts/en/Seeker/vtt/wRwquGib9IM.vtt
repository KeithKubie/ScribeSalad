00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.530
They say you can tell a lot about someone
by looking in their eyes.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.729
And when it comes to having a crush, they’re
right.

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.820
That's awkward.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.040
Hey love bugs, It’s Trace.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.730
When you’re looking at someone you like,
I mean, like like, your body actually changes

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.730
in a variety of ways.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.250
And one of the things that happens is you
go all googly eyed.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.370
No really, your pupils dilate.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.470
Your pupil size is controlled by your autonomic
nervous system, which regulates all of your

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.750
involuntary actions like breathing, heart
rate, and sweating.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.090
A branch of this system called the sympathetic
nervous system, or SNS, is responsible for

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.300
your body’s fight or flight mechanism.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.570
This mechanism acts up when you’re under
stress, like when you’re talking to your

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.390
crush, and releases the hormone noradrenaline,
causing your pupils to dilate.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.430
This same hormone also causes you to sweat
more and your heart to beat faster around

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.550
someone you like.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.070
And having dilated pupils might actually serve
a purpose.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.070
In a series of studies done in the 1960s and
70s, researchers learned that men find women

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.070
with larger pupils more attractive.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.390
Another study published in 2004 in Evolution
and Human Behavior supported these findings

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.500
and also showed that women were more attracted
to men with medium or large sized pupils.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.940
Even as far back as 500 years ago in Italy,
women trying to attract men would put the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.220
extract of the Belladona plant into their
eyes to dilate their pupils.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.460
Another sign of attraction is that flushed
look on your face anytime you get up the courage

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.610
to talk to someone you like.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.230
Blushing is also a result of your SNS, which
causes the blood vessels in your face to dilate,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.990
increasing blood flow and giving you rosey
red cheeks.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.740
It’s more common in women than men, and
although there are a few theories as to why

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.740
this happens, scientists still aren’t clear
on the purpose of blushing.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.340
But even if you aren’t the blushing type,
your crush might still be able to tell that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.070
you like them when you speak to them.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.440
There have been numerous studies done on what
happens to your voice when you are attracted

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.020
to someone, and they all seem to agree that
it changes… but they don’t necessarily

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.310
agree on how.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.270
According to a 2014 study published in Evolution
and Human Behavior, males speak in a more

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.700
melodic fashion when they are talking with
someone they like... almost the way you might

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.000
speak to a baby… and also deepen their voice.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.880
Another study published in Nonverbal Behavior
supports this, noting that both sexes had

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.300
lower pitched voices when they were talking
to someone they found attractive.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.310
(Tries it out) “Excuse me, young lady, you’re
looking awfully nice tonight!”.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.050
Mmm...Maybe I should work on that.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.450
In both those studies, participants looked
at potential partners that they found attractive.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.260
But a study done on people in relationships
had different results.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.390
Research published in the Journal of Nonverbal
Behavior took people in new relationships

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.240
and had strangers listen in on their conversations.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.600
The strangers had to guess if the subjects
were talking to platonic friends or romantic

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600
partners.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.120
Listeners noted that the tones people used
with their partners were, quote, “more pleasant,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.970
sexier, and reflecting greater romantic interest”.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.550
They also found that males and females changed
their voice to closely match or mimic the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.910
other’s tone.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.200
Males spoke in a higher pitch, while ladies
deepened their voices.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.410
It’s almost as if they were trying to come
together in harmony and make sweet, sweet

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.410
beautiful music.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.000
So obviously, more research is needed to tell
exactly how (and why) your voice changes when

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.260
you’re talking to a crush.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.200
Just remember that even if you’re trying
play it cool, you’re still giving off physical

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.510
cues that you’re one smitten kitten.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.670
And if things get serious, remember for 100
years every kiss begins with Kay….

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.099
Once you and your crush have finally gotten
past the awkward beginnings, you may be ready

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.370
for some cuddle bug time.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.881
Check out this video to find out how spooning
is good for your health.

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:28.190
