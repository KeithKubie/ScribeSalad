00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.385 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, NOW, WHO'S PUMPED FOR
SUPER BOWL SUNDAY?

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:23.556 align:start position:0% line:91%

OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.024 align:start position:0% line:85%

GOING OUT ON A LIMB, GOING OUT
ON A LIMB.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.697 align:start position:0% line:91%
HERE'S MY PREDICTION EYE WILL BE
DRUNK BY THE COIN TOSS.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.333 align:start position:0% line:91%
<i> ( CHEERS )</i>
JUST SAYING.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAKE ME UP FOR KATY PERRY,
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.306 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THIS HAS BEEN A

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.710 line:91%
ROUGH YEAR FOR THE NFL WITH ALL
THEIR OFF-THE-FIELD SCANDAL, SO

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:48.281 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S GOT TO BE A RELIEF FOR FANS
OUT THERE TO FINALLY HAVE THE

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.115 align:start position:0% line:85%
SCANDAL ON THE FIELD.

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.584 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE SO-CALLED DEFLATE-GATE
SCANDAL.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.954 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE NFL IS INVESTIGATING
ALLEGATIONS THAT 11 OF THE 12

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.257 line:91%
FOOTBALLS THAT THE PATRIOTS USED
IN THEIR A.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP WIN

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.462 align:start position:0% line:91%
OVER THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS WERE
UNDER-INFLATED.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:06.065 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE SINCE
UNDER-INFLATED FOOTBALLS ARE

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.134 size:78% position:39% line:85%
EASIER TO GRIP AND CATCH.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.470 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
NOW, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:15.141 line:91%
EXPECTING ME TO DO A GRATUITOUS
BALL JOKE HERE, AND AS TEMPTING

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS IT IS, YOU KNOW, FRANKLY,
THAT'S ALL I'VE BEEN HEARING FOR

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.178 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE PAST WEEK.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.013 align:start position:0% line:91%
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TRAFFIC
IN THAT.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:30.957 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED MIKE YARD
AND RICKY VELEZ TO DO IT.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.725 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALRIGHT GUYS, YOU HAVE 30 ON THE
BALL CLOCK.

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:33.993 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY, GET TO IT.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:38.364 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO TOM BRADY'S BALLS AND
FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE IN COMMON.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:39.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT, RICKY?
&gt;&gt; THEY BOTH FEAR INFLATION.

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.335 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY DID TOM BRADY GO TO THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN?

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.102 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHY?

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:46.072 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE GOT REJECTED FROM BALL
STATE.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:50.576 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A PRIEST, RABBI, AND TWO
DEFLATED BALLS WALK INTO A BAR.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.477 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED?

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.147 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE PRIEST FONDLED THE
DEFLATED BALLS.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.516 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE WORST JOB IN
SPORTS?

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.484 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SUCKING THE AIR OUT OF TOM
BRADY'S BALLS.

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:02.922 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT
COULD COME BETWEEN TOM BRADY'S

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:04.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEFLATED BALLS AND THE SUPER
BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP?

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.627 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT
&gt;&gt; THE GIANTS, TWICE.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.829 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HEY, RICKY, MY BALLS ARE SO
BIG.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:10.796 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HOW BIG ARE THEY?

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.498 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE JUST BIG, MAN.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.067 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.802 align:start position:0% line:85%
GREAT JOB, GUYS.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:20.540 align:start position:0% line:91%
GIVE THEM A NICE ROUND OF
APPLAUSE.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:24.010 align:start position:0% line:91%
<i> ( CHEERS )</i>
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:28.948 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO HOW DID THE MAN AT THE CENTER
OF DEFLATE-GATE HANDLE THIS?

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:29.615 align:start position:0% line:85%
MR. BUNDCHEN?

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.583 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:35.321 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN-- I-- I-- I HAVE NO
EXPLANATION FOR IT.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:36.088 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I DO.

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.523 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU CHEATED.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:38.390 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.892 align:start position:0% line:91%
( APPLAUSE )
JUST LIKE WHEN YOUR TEAM GOT

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.762 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAUGHT IN 2007 ILLEGALLY SPYING
ON OTHER TEAMS.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:43.830 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT BAD, THOUGH.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.599 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, YOU WENT SEVEN WHOLE
YEARS WITHOUT A CHEATING

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:47.433 align:start position:0% line:85%
SCANDAL.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:50.203 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
FOR THE PATRIOTS, THAT'S A

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.170 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRETTY GOOD RUN.

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:52.171 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT BAD.

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:56.042 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT, ANYHOW, BACK TO BRADY'S
NON-VIGOROUS DENIAL.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.477 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IS TOM BRADY A CHEATER?

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.051 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:05.918 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT.

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:09.188 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TOM BRADY,
RIGHT?

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.592 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW THEY'RE ASKING YOU THAT
QUESTION, RIGHT?

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.827 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE YOU SAID, "I DON'T
BELIEVE SO."

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.797 line:85%
AS IF YOU'VE NEVER MET YOURSELF.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.233 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
AND YOU SHOULD MEET YOURSELF.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:24.637 size:78% position:39% line:85%
YOU HAVE A VERY HOT WIFE.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.540 align:start position:0% line:91%

NOW, IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE'S

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:28.908 line:85%
LYING-- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.577 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.312 line:85%
PLAY THAT FOR ME ONE MORE TIME.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.181 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IS TOM BRADY A CHEATER?

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.415 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:41.354 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALWAYS
PLAYED WITHIN THE RULES.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.957 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, GUYS, LET, ALL
RIGHT, THIS IS NOT LYING, ALL

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.591 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:46.725 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE HERE.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.828 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK THIS
DOWN FOR YOU IN A WHOLE

DIFFERENT WAY.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.266 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW THIS SHOW IS ALL ABOUT
TELLING THE TRUTH OR AS WE

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.734 size:75% position:38% line:85%
CALL IT, KEEPING IT 100.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.135 align:start position:0% line:91%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:59.772 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, BUT WHAT'S WEIRD ABOUT
BRADY IS THAT THIS DOESN'T FEEL

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:03.175 size:88% position:44% line:91%
LIKE A LIE BUT IT DEFINITELY
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE TRUTH.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:04.710 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE'S KEEPING IT 70.

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:09.282 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW I KNOW THIS IS NEW, BUT STAY
WITH ME.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:14.587 line:91%
KEEPING IT AT 70 IS WHERE YOU
MEAN WHAT YOU SAY BUT YOU DON'T

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.056 align:start position:0% line:85%
SAY WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.024 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.192 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.328 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHEN HE SAYS, "I DON'T
BELIEVE SO," HE MEANS BECAUSE I

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.529 align:start position:0% line:85%
KNOW SO.

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:24.029 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:26.098 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
RIGHT?

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:31.003 line:91%
AND WHEN HE SAYS, "I FEEL LIKE
I'VE PLAYED WITHIN THE RULES,"

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S LEAVING OUT, "THAT I SET
FOR MYSELF."

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:35.374 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:36.508 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.544 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, TO HELP YOU BETTER
UNDERSTAND KEEPING IT 70, LET ME

00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:41.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHOW YOU WHAT AN ATHLETE KEEPING
IT 100 LOOKS LIKE.

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:47.219 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M THE BEST CORNER IN THE
GAME.

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:49.288 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S THE RESULT YOU'RE GOING
TO GET.

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:54.093 line:85%
DON'T YOU EVER TALK ABOUT ME!

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:55.528 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SEE, SEE?

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.363 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S 100, RIGHT?

00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:01.434 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW HOW SCARED
AMERICA WAS FOR THAT WHITE

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:01.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOMAN?

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.436 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, MY GOD.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.303 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHOO!

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE AREN'T USED TO ATHLETES
BEING 100.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.974 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF MAKING US
COMFORTABLE.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:09.741 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:13.379 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO KEEPING IT 70 IS THE NFL'S
JAM.

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:16.082 line:91%

&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, HERE'S THE

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:39.965 line:91%
PROBLEM, SEE, TIGER KEEPS IT 70
SO MUCH, EVEN WHEN HE MIGHT BE

00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:43.202 align:start position:0% line:91%
KEEPING IT 100, I DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN TRUST HIM.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:48.574 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S LIKE THE BOY WHO CRIED
70.

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:51.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
FEELS THAT WAY.

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:55.815 line:91%
&gt;&gt; TIGER STICKING TO HIS STORY
DESPITE THE FACT RACE ORGANIZERS

00:06:55.848 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
TOLD THE PRESS NO OFFICIAL
REPORTS WERE FILED AND, "THERE

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:02.621 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAS NO SUCH INCIDENT."

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:03.855 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: A TOOTH?

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:06.692 line:91%
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TRUST HAS
TO BE LOST FOR US NOT TO BELIEVE

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:08.060 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU ABOUT A TOOTH?

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:10.963 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WHERE'S THE TOOTH, TIGER?

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:15.267 align:start position:0% line:91%
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
DAMN TOOTH!

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.537 size:88% position:44% line:91%
OKAY, LOOK, ANOTHER ONE, NOW
LET'S TAKE LANCE ARMSTRONG.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.173 line:91%
NOW, REMEMBER HE LIED ABOUT THE
WHOLE STEROID THING, THEN HE

00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:22.408 size:81% position:41% line:85%
FINALLY GOT CAUGHT, RIGHT?

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:24.276 line:85%
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID RECENTLY.

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:27.279 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
MISTAKES OF MY LIFE.

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:32.985 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I'D PROBABLY DO IT AGAIN.

00:07:33.018 --> 00:07:35.221 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:38.157 align:start position:0% line:91%
LANCE ARMSTRONG KEPT IT ZERO HIS
WHOLE CAREER, AND NOW HE'S

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.960 line:85%
TRYING TO CRANK IT UP TO 100?

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:45.831 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVEN ON STEROIDS, YOU CAN'T GO
FROM 0 TO 100 THAT FAST.

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU SAY.

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:52.171 line:91%
IRONICALLY, IF HE HAD JUST
CRUISED AT 70 THE WHOLE TIME,

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:53.572 line:85%
HE'D PROBABLY STILL BE RACING.

00:07:53.605 --> 00:07:56.775 line:91%
BUT THEN TO BE SO CAVALIER
SAYING HE'D DO IT AGAIN, THAT

00:07:56.808 --> 00:08:00.846 align:start position:0% line:85%
TAKES A LOT OF BALL.

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:03.182 align:start position:0% line:91%
( APPLAUSE )
COME ON.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.752 align:start position:0% line:85%
COME ON, GUYS!

00:08:06.785 --> 00:08:07.386 align:start position:0% line:85%
SERIOUSLY!

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:10.022 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I HAD TO MAKE ONE BALL JOKE.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.857 align:start position:0% line:85%
OOPS, DID IT AGAIN!

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.425 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
