00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:02.375
- [Voiceover] This right
over here is the graph

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:05.104
of x plus y is equal to one.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:10.104
Let's say the region
that's below this graph

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:13.633
but still in the first
quadrant, that this is the base

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.617
of a three dimensional figure.

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:19.381
So this region right over here is the base

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.126
of a three dimensional figure.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:24.186
What we know about this
three dimensional figure is

00:00:24.186 --> 00:00:28.314
if we were to take cross
sections that are perpendicular

00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:32.379
to the x axis, so cross
sections I guess we could say

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.771
that are parallel to the y
axis, so let's say we were

00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:36.938
taking a cross-section like that,

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:39.976
we know that this will be a semi-circle.

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:41.648
If we take a slightly different view

00:00:41.648 --> 00:00:43.814
of the same three-dimensional,

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:44.830
we would see something like this.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.234
I've laid the coordinate plane down flat

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:48.845
and I'm looking at it from above.

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:52.303
This cross-section, if we're
looking at it at an angle,

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:54.878
and if the figure were transparent,

00:00:54.878 --> 00:00:58.439
it would be this
cross-section right over here.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:00.309
It would be that
cross-section right over here,

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.309
which is a semi-circle.

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:07.770
If we were to take this cross
section right over here,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.290
along the y axis, that
would be this cross section.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.574
This larger semi-circle.

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:18.617
Given what I've just told
you, I encourage you to pause

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:21.203
the video and see if you can figure out

00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:26.203
the volume of this thing that
I've shaded in a little bit.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.776
The volume of this thing
that I've just started.

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:31.180
This three dimensional figure

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.869
that we are attempting to visualize.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.456
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:39.983
One way to think about it
is, well let's just think

00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:42.766
about each of these,
let's split up the figure

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:46.200
into a bunch of discs.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:51.148
If you figure out the volume
of each of those discs,

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:55.312
and sum them up then that would be

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:56.686
a pretty good approximation

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.370
for the volume of the whole thing.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.776
Then, if you took the limit
as you get an infinite

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:03.777
number of discs that are infinitely thin,

00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:06.641
then you're going to get the exact volume.

00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:10.245
Let's just take the
approximating case first.

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:14.102
Let's say that right over here at x,

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:19.102
what is going to be the
diameter of the disc at x.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.644
Well, to think about that
we just have to re-express

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.112
x plus y is equal to one.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.512
That's the same thing as
saying that the function

00:02:28.512 --> 00:02:33.512
that F of x or y is equal to F
of x is equal to one minus x.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.306
The diameter of this
circle right over here,

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:44.643
let me make it clear, the
diameter of this circle

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:47.310
is going to be this height,
is going to be the difference

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.090
between one minus x and the x axis,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.172
or between one minus x and x equals zero.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.833
This is just going to
be, as a function of x,

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:59.108
the diameter's going to be one minus x.

00:02:59.108 --> 00:03:03.362
Now, if you want to find the
surface area for a circle,

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:06.304
or if we want to find
the area of a circle,

00:03:06.304 --> 00:03:08.711
we know that area is pi r-squared.

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.108
For our semi-circle, you're
going to divide by two.

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.174
So what's the radius going to be?

00:03:13.174 --> 00:03:15.383
Just let me zoom in a little bit.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:22.229
What is the radius of one of
these semi-circles going to be?

00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:24.843
The radius I could draw it like this.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:27.078
My best attempt to draw
one of these things.

00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:28.413
It's gonna look something like this.

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:30.309
I'm trying to draw it at an angle.

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.700
The radius, what's gonna
be half the diameter?

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.447
The diameter is one minus x.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:39.441
The radius is going to
be one minus x over two.

00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:41.237
Right, that distance is
one minus x over two.

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:43.042
That distance is one minus x over two.

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:45.369
That distance is one minus x over two.

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:50.369
So, that is one minus x over
two is equal to the radius.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:57.998
What would be the area of of
this side right over here?

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:04.901
Well, if it was a full circle,
it would be pi r-squared,

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:08.743
but it's a semi-circle so
it's pi r-squared over two.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.840
Let me write this, so the
area is equal to pi r-squared

00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:19.939
over two 'cause it's a semi-circle.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.585
In terms of x, our area as a
function of x right over there,

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:26.909
let me write it that way,
our area as a function of x,

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.108
is gonna be pi over two.

00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:32.843
It's gonna be pi over two

00:04:32.843 --> 00:04:36.907
times one minus x over two squared.

00:04:36.907 --> 00:04:41.907
It's one minus x over two squared.

00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:49.578
If I wanted a volume of just
this disc right over here,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.574
I, then, multiply that
area times the depth.

00:04:53.574 --> 00:04:58.213
I just multiply the area
times this depth here.

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:05.040
We could call that d x or
we could call that delta x.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.040
We could call the depth there delta x.

00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:17.040
Actually, let me be
clear, that's the area.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.040
The volume of one of those
shells is going to be equal

00:05:22.704 --> 00:05:24.110
to, and I'll just write this in one color,

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.777
is gonna be pi over two times one minus x

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:30.963
over two squared, times the depth.

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.902
The area times the depth.

00:05:32.902 --> 00:05:37.902
This is volume of one of these half discs.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:43.768
The volume of the whole thing
we can approximate is the sum

00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:47.177
of these, or we can take the
limit is our delta x's get

00:05:47.177 --> 00:05:49.646
much, much, much, much,
smaller and we have an infinite

00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:52.106
number of these things,
which is essentially,

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:53.181
if we're taking that limit,

00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:55.175
we're gonna take the definite integral.

00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:56.511
We could take the definite integral,

00:05:56.511 --> 00:06:00.443
so the volume that we care
about, the volume of this figure,

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:03.975
is going to be equal to
the definite integral

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:06.576
from x equals zero to x equals one.

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:08.900
That's where we intersect the x axis.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.254
X equals zero to x equals
one of, we're integrating

00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:18.254
an infinite number of these
things that are infinitely thin.

00:06:18.513 --> 00:06:23.513
It's going to be pi over two times,

00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:27.373
what's one minus x-squared?

00:06:27.373 --> 00:06:29.510
Let me just expand it out
for fun right over here.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.302
That's the same thing
as x minus one squared.

00:06:32.302 --> 00:06:37.302
So it's going to be x
squared minus two x plus one,

00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:42.576
and then two squared is four, over four.

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:46.042
Instead of delta x, I'm
going to right d x now.

00:06:46.042 --> 00:06:48.039
I'm gonna write d x because
I'm taking the limit

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.773
as these become infinitely small

00:06:49.773 --> 00:06:50.770
and I have an infinite nine.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.578
I'm summing an infinite number of them.

00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:55.178
The volume is just going
to be, we just have

00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:57.166
to evaluate this definite integral.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:01.034
If you feel so inspired,
feel free to pause

00:07:01.034 --> 00:07:04.435
and try to evaluate
this definite integral.

00:07:04.435 --> 00:07:06.371
Let's just take some
of these constants out.

00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:09.108
Let's take pi over eight out.

00:07:09.108 --> 00:07:14.108
Our volume is going to be
equal to pi over eight times

00:07:18.574 --> 00:07:21.443
the definite integral from zero to one

00:07:21.443 --> 00:07:26.443
of x-squared minus two x plus one d x,

00:07:31.303 --> 00:07:36.303
which is equal to pi over eight.

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:41.435
The antiderivative of this
is x to the third over three

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.772
minus x-squared plus x.

00:07:46.772 --> 00:07:51.772
We're going to evaluate
that at zero and one.

00:07:51.798 --> 00:07:56.526
This is going to be
equal to pi over eight.

00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:58.314
When you evaluate it at one,

00:07:58.314 --> 00:08:01.035
you get one third minus one plus one.

00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:02.839
It's going to be one third.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.966
When you evaluate at zero,

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:05.707
you get zero minus zero plus zero.

00:08:05.707 --> 00:08:08.267
It's going to be minus zero so
it's just pi over eight times

00:08:08.267 --> 00:08:12.267
one third which is equal to
pi over 24 and we are done.
