00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.640
D3, I want to unpack that name a bit because I think that speaks to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.310
why the library was created and how it integrates data with a webpage.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.540
Data driven documents.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.620
Data in this case refers to some information we are trying to visualize.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.525
Be it CSV or JSON, loaded externally, or

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:27.110
simply a JavaScript object or variables.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.390
Documents is a reference to a webpage or web document, rather,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.010
a collection of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG often.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.470
But hey, data driven html or

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.180
data driven pages, just didn't have the same ring to it.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.040
And driven, D3, binds data to the document, or

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.660
rather more concretely, rows of a CSV or JSON to SVG elements.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.599
More formally, documents doesn't only refer to the source of the page,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:10.080
and the content of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or SVG, but

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.200
it could also refer to what's called the Document Object Model, or DOM.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.920
Web browsers can be thought to store two versions of the web page or

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.110
rather two views.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.618
One of which is the initial source, as I mentioned,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:31.050
that gets returned from the web server, and the other is a parsed DOM object.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.194
The Document Object Model is a specification, much like HTML and CSS,

00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:42.820
that specifies a common programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.080
Once the source of the HTML is returned from the server, the web browser

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.040
parses the file and transforms it into a hierarchical object that can

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.530
accessed programmatically, most often through JavaScript, called the DOM.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.140
D3 actually binds data to the DOM rather than the source or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.610
visual elements of the HTML.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.660
But since the DOM actually represents and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.680
can interact with what's displayed visually, when we bind data to the DOM,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.580
D3 drives the document, in this case the visual representation of the DOM,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.250
and creates a chart based on the data that's in the DOM.
