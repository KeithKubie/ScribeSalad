00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.360
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.282
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.990
LEWIS DARTNELL: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.830
Thank you all very
much for coming along.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.520
My name's Lewis.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.930
I'm a research Fellow up at
the University of Leicester,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.630
although I commute
from North London

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.240
up to Leicester every day.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.270
And I completed my
PhD a couple of years

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.810
ago just down the road at
University College London, UCL.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.800
And the field of
my actual research,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.940
my day job in the
science labs, is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.200
in a new field of research,
a new field of science,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.270
called astrobiology,
which is all about looking

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.006
at the possibility of there
being life beyond the Earth.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.630
So I come from a
biological background,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.088
and in the last
couple of years got

00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:46.730
an enormous amount of planetary
science, and particle physics,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.780
and computer modeling,
and mathematical analysis

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.420
techniques to look into
the big question about

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.780
whether there's life out
there, if there's, perhaps,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.700
bacterial life on
the surface of Mars.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.230
And what I've been thinking
about for the last two years,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.645
for this new project, the
hobby I've been doing along

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:04.730
the side, for this new
book, "The Knowledge:

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.119
How to Rebuild Our
World from Scratch,"

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.660
is on something
completely different.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.590
I've gone from the science and
helping the hunt for aliens

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.060
to talking about how you
might reboot civilization

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.200
from scratch.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
And this is the starting
point of a thought experiment.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.870
Let's say that
this has happened.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.820
There's been some kind
of global catastrophe,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.911
some kind of doomsday event,
some kind of apocalypse.

00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:30.841
And you've woken up, let's say
with a hangover, the morning

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.924
after the day before, the
day when the world as we

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:34.179
know it has ended.

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.720
And you've kind of
picked yourself up

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.800
from the rubble and dust off
the dust, dust yourself off.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.300
And you've fallen in with
a crowd of other survivors.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.350
You're in a kind of
post-apocalyptic world

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.761
with a community of survivors.

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:47.260
And this is the
kind of trope that I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.175
think we're all pretty
familiar with already.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.660
This has been in plenty of
cinema films and sci-fi novels,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.840
from "I Am Legend" to "The
Road" or "The Death of Grass."

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.580
There's a good
history of this kind

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.435
of post-apocalyptic narrative.

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:03.310
But the question that
I've been trying to ask

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.260
is what to do next.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.960
What happens now?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.655
How can you pick
yourself up, right

00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:11.630
from the basics, from
the very fundamentals,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.939
and rebuild a
technological civilization

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:15.730
from the ground up?

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.140
What kind of stuff do you need?

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.946
What kind of fundamental
processes and principles

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:23.350
would you need to know?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.410
What would you want to have
condensed down to a single book

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.130
that you'd want to
have handed to you

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.880
in this post-apocalyptic world
that told you how to rebuild,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.405
how to reboot the civilization?

00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:35.530
And the conceit is that
that's the book in your lap

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.220
right now, that "The Knowledge"
is this single tome that

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.420
tells you how to
redo or rebuild all

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.730
the functions of a
modern civilization,

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.790
of a technological civilization.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.550
And the reason I wrote this is,
first, I was fascinated by it.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.000
It's an interesting thought
experiment to go through.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.630
But I think it's also quite
relevant and perhaps topical,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.980
especially right now.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.010
Because I get the sense that
all of us in the modern world

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.460
today have this kind of
feeling of disconnect,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.885
that we don't really have
that much of a real sense,

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:08.260
real understanding,
and certainly

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.940
no hands-on,
practical experience

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.570
of how a lot of stuff
is really done or how

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.110
things are made in the
modern world today.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.326
And if you really had
to, let's say if you're

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:20.110
in this post-apocalyptic
scenario,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.758
if you're knocked back to
first principles, do any of us

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:27.452
really have the foggiest idea
how to take a handful of seed

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:29.060
and walk out to a
muddy field and make

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.740
food come out of that field?

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.150
How do you reinstate
agriculture?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.010
What are the
fundamental principles

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.510
you need to know to
reinstate farming?

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.560
Because it is not as
simple as you might think.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.612
Farming is a ludicrously
artificial process

00:03:43.612 --> 00:03:44.570
you have to go through.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.350
Even though plants
grow naturally,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.953
it is not in nature's
best interest,

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:52.162
if you like, to have
a monoculture of all

00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:54.120
the same crops growing
in very high density all

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.002
in the same place
and not have it

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.210
hit by disease or by pathogens
or pests or something.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.140
You're trying to
rigorously control

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.780
the ecology of a farm, a field
to grow food for yourself.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.630
So how do you do that?

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.280
How do you get
metal out of rocks?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.240
How do you make the materials
that we rely upon today?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.925
If you can reach
into your pocket now,

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:16.170
there are probably a
combination of metals,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.220
and plastics, and then
perhaps some glass.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.149
How do you make
that for yourself?

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.990
How do you dig raw
substances, base substances,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.322
out of the ground, and then
process them or transform them

00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:29.030
into the materials
which are most useful?

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.405
How do you go from
a raw material

00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:32.057
to something which
is useful, that you

00:04:32.057 --> 00:04:33.015
can use for a function?

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.570
And this is what I've
been trying to talk about.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.090
This is the research I've
been doing for "The Knowledge"

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.350
and trying to piece
together, chapter by chapter,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.600
these different themes of
communication technologies

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.130
and transport technologies
and mechanisms

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.142
and substances and chemicals.

00:04:51.142 --> 00:04:53.054
And the very
beginning of the book

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:55.095
is playing around
with this idea of what

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:56.250
I call the "grace period."

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.200
Because if there were to
be some kind of-- let's say

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.960
that the best possible
way for the world to end

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.800
would not be an asteroid
strike or a nuclear war,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.100
because it would leave
the world in tatters.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.790
You'd find devastation
around you,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.380
and it would be very, very
hard to reinstate farming

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.360
when the fields
themselves are poisoned,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.770
when there's radioactivity
from the fallout.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.952
So the starting
point for the thought

00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:20.270
experiment that I
picked up on, the best

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.840
possible way for
the world to end

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.060
was some kind of viral pandemic,
perhaps something like avian

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.650
flu or swine flu, that
spreads incredibly quickly,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.640
with our high-density,
urban lifestyles today

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.005
and intercontinental flights and
transmission of diseases very,

00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:35.840
very readily.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.500
And it wipes out 99.99%
of the world's population.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.450
So the people have
gone, and there's

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.360
only a small community
of survivors left.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.720
But the stuff is still here.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.990
You can still go and
scavenge in a city

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.200
and get the glass,
and the metal,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.610
and the timber and stuff
you need to repurpose

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.811
and rejig and jerry-rig
stuff to keep yourself going.

00:05:56.811 --> 00:05:59.310
So the first chapter of the
book is talking about this grace

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.570
period, how you get this
buffer zone, if you like,

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.530
where you get a couple
of years, perhaps,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.840
maybe a couple of decades, maybe
a generation to work things out

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.745
for yourself, to go through
this process of trial and error

00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:13.870
before it becomes a
mater of life and death

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.090
to grow food for yourself.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.000
And one of the calculations
that I sat down and scratched

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.180
my head was a sub-thought
experiment, if you like.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.730
If you were to be locked
in an average supermarket

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.940
with fresh water, unlimited
fresh water, a way of disposing

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.980
of your waste, so kind
of sanitary conditions,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.320
how long could you survive
in an average supermarket

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.486
before you starved to death?

00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:38.610
How long would the food in the
supermarket sustain you for?

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.940
And so clearly
you'd want to plan,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.399
play some kind of
optimal strategy.

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.273
You eat the fresh fruit
and bread [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:45.273 --> 00:06:47.455
first, because they'll
go in a matter of days,

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:49.160
perhaps a week or two.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.600
You could then move on to the
dried pasta and the rice, which

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.390
have a persistence time of
several months to years.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.760
And the largest reserve
of preserved food

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.490
would clearly be tin cans,
would be the canned food.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.540
So I went around an
average supermarket,

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.640
which was the one in
[? Angel Islington, ?] and I

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.550
noted down and counted up and
multiplied up all the food that

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.300
was in there, and
knowing the persistence

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.575
times of each category
of food, and worked out

00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:21.070
that you could support
yourself for 55 years living

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.362
on the sustenance of just
a single supermarket.

00:07:24.362 --> 00:07:27.280
And that would go up
to 63 years if you

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.825
don't mind eating the cat
food and the dog food.

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:31.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.576
LEWIS DARTNELL: So you've
got time to play with.

00:07:33.576 --> 00:07:35.820
If you multiply it out to
the society as a whole,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.660
to the stored sustenance
of the United Kingdom,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.490
the nation as a whole, for
a small community of perhaps

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.600
several thousand, maybe a few
tens of thousands of people,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.960
you've got decades before
that food would run out,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.830
and you'd have to work out
the principles of farming

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.670
to keep yourself going.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.450
Water, of course, is going to
be another primary consideration

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.570
for you, and it goes by
repurposing everyday substances

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.955
you can scavenge from the dead
cities, the abandoned cities.

00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:05.040
You can purify water very,
very adequately using something

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.760
like kitchen bleach or swimming
pool chlorine, so sodium

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.260
hypochlorite and
calcium hypochlorite,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.715
and you just dilute them enough.

00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:14.090
And this is exactly
the compounds

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.470
they use in the public water
supply to purify water for you.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.590
Or even more simply
than that, all

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.470
you need is an empty plastic
bottle, like this one here,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.162
and you fill it with water
and leave it in the sun.

00:08:26.162 --> 00:08:28.370
And then there's a process
called solar disinfection,

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.640
or SODIS, which is
recommended by the WHO,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.700
by the World Health
Organization,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.860
in the third world as a tried
and tested method for purifying

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.880
drinking water for the very
simple and fundamental reason

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.547
that the last thing you
want to catch in a world

00:08:43.547 --> 00:08:46.130
without antibiotics is a really
simple infection that could be

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.262
prevented by just having
your wits about you

00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:51.770
and being aware of germ
theory and basic hygiene.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.810
So use SODIS to purify
drinking water for yourself

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.930
by just scavenging some
empty plastic bottles.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.450
And you'd want to keep an
electrified lifestyle going

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:02.950
for you.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.980
This is a car alternator.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.100
You can rip out
the bonnet of a car

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.120
and jerry-rig them to some kind
of windmill or water wheel,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.627
turn the spindle, and
regardless of what speed

00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:14.210
you turn that spindle,
if you generate

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.176
12 volts across the tunnels,
you can recharge deep cycle

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:19.050
batteries, which you
can scavenge from things

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.596
like golf buggies or
yachts or RVs or caravans.

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:25.920
They're the best kind of battery
for storing power long-term

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.540
compared to a car engine.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.269
And what I keep trying
to do in the book

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:33.220
is come back to real
examples in our own history

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.280
where similar scenarios
have occurred.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.160
And this is a city
called Garazda,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.365
which was cut off in
the Bosnian-Serbian war

00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:43.666
by the Bosnian army.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.710
And they had food
drops and medical drops

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.700
from the Red Cross, but
they were completely

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.963
isolated from the
national grid, from power.

00:09:50.963 --> 00:09:51.885
It had no electricity.

00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:55.000
And so they jerry-rigged, they
bodged, and created these water

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.100
wheels for themselves, using
scavenged car alternators

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.020
with these wheels
turning the current,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.080
and from these platforms
they tethered to a bridge.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.990
So a lot of this you can root
back down into real examples.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.979
This isn't just speculation and
arm waving for the sake of it.

00:10:09.979 --> 00:10:11.520
There are some really
great examples.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.624
And I've come back to
POW camps a couple times

00:10:13.624 --> 00:10:15.290
where people have
bodged stuff together,

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.910
things they can scavenge
from around them.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.430
If you want to keep your
cars going after the diesel

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.500
and petrol has run
out, there's a process

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.860
known as gasification.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.240
And I've got a very short
video to show you in a second.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.090
But this is my gasified
stove that I made for myself

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.900
for this video that's up on
YouTube and on the book's

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.816
website as well.

00:10:36.816 --> 00:10:38.440
And this is, again,
ludicrously simple.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.670
It's just a big,
[INAUDIBLE] tin can,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.130
with some holes around the
bottom, a smaller tin can

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.430
in the middle, again, with
some holes at the bottom.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.160
And when you put your fuel,
your bits of wood in there,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.880
the holes at the bottom draw in
through the air and the oxygen,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.017
and it burns nice and intensely.

00:10:54.017 --> 00:10:55.600
But that's kind of
what we're familiar

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.490
with from any barbecue.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.910
What's novel about
these gasified stoves

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.590
is you have a ring of
holes at the top as well,

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.890
and that draws in
fresh oxygen, which

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.150
meets, is reintroduced, into
the hot gasses, the vapor,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.385
and the smoke, which
is itself combustible,

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:14.260
is re-mixed with oxygen, and
you get secondary combustion.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.970
So it's a very,
very efficient way

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.030
of using the fuel in the stove.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.580
And I've got, as I said,
a very short video to show

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.060
you that process.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.578
So let's get this fired
up and see it working.

00:11:25.578 --> 00:11:31.045
I'll load it up with some simple
kindle, kindling and tinder

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:36.315
here with just some
newspaper and some

00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:41.075
dried twigs, which
we push down in here.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.298
If I light the
underneath with a lighter

00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:55.304
I've been able to scavenge--

00:11:55.304 --> 00:11:56.970
And if you think
that's a massive cheat,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.280
the previous video
to this is how

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.863
you can use things
other than lighters

00:11:59.863 --> 00:12:02.209
and matches to start a fire
if you can't scavenge those.

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:04.000
And you can use something
like a fire alarm

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.040
to start the fire with
or a bottle of water

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.300
to start a fire with.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.690
And when it smokes
at the start--

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.148
That's why the
epidemic [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:10.148 --> 00:12:11.104
for real in the room.

00:12:11.104 --> 00:12:12.812
--we'll put a slightly
higher flue on it.

00:12:12.812 --> 00:12:14.540
And already, that's
roaring away,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.613
with the air and the
oxygen being drawn up.

00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:22.050
So we'll get that going
nice and intensely,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.529
burning down that fuel.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.434
And before I take off
this flue now-- it's

00:12:30.434 --> 00:12:34.810
also called a rocket stove,
perhaps for obvious reasons.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.490
If I take off that flue--

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.175
So this is just from a
small handful of twigs.

00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:42.226
There's very, very
little fuel in there.

00:12:42.226 --> 00:12:43.601
If you come in
here and look, you

00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:45.554
can see that upper
ring of air holes,

00:12:45.554 --> 00:12:48.482
there are jets of
flame coming out there

00:12:48.482 --> 00:12:50.440
where the oxygen's
being drawn in

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.540
and igniting all those producer
gases coming off from the wood

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.495
as it undergoes
pyrolysis and gives off

00:12:56.495 --> 00:12:57.990
the vapor and the gas.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.330
And the smoke itself
is combustible.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.690
So burning all of that.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.528
It's a very, very efficient
way of using the fuel.

00:13:04.528 --> 00:13:06.420
So I reckon that's
about ready for cooking.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.192
And then I cook
some custard, which

00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:10.900
I'd opened in one of
the previous videos.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.477
And the reason this
is important is

00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:14.143
it allows you to build
a gasified stove,

00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:16.267
but that was more for the
process of demonstration,

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:19.691
but you can also do
amazing stuff like this.

00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:21.890
This is a gasifier-powered car.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.220
This is a wood-powered car.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.870
And you basically have
the stove strapped

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.142
in a big dust bin on the back.

00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:30.225
This is where you drive
that process of pyrolysis.

00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:32.160
You use the heat of
combustion to break down

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.690
the complex molecules
of the wood,

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.780
release those producer
gases and the vapors,

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.300
which you then
simply just pipe down

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.127
at the cylinders of your
engine, mix with oxygen,

00:13:42.127 --> 00:13:43.960
as would happen with
your carborator anyway,

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.430
and then drive your
car based on wood

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.840
rather than liquid fuels,
rather than fossil fuels.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.256
So this is the
kind of technology,

00:13:50.256 --> 00:13:52.050
and again this was done
very, very commonly

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.049
in the Second World War.

00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:54.980
There were over a
million gasified vehicles

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.070
in the Second World War.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.730
And the German army even had
a division of Panzer tanks

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.330
that were
wood-powered, that were

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.600
driven by these things
strapped to the back of them,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.300
because they were
facing such acute fuel

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.190
shortages towards
the end of the war.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.960
So it's this kind of
technology or resurrection

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.730
of historical
techniques that you

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.820
can use to keep yourself
going in the grace

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.860
period of the apocalypse.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.610
But more interestingly,
to myself as a scientist,

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.130
was this thought
experiment, this process

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.555
of thinking how you could reboot
a civilization from scratch,

00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:25.430
how you would actually
go through the process

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.594
of rebuilding everything
from the agriculture

00:14:28.594 --> 00:14:30.760
and the transport technologies
and the communication

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.110
technologies and the
materials and the substances

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.830
that all of our lives rely upon.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.330
And, as I said, we
don't really have

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.590
any direct sense
of how that works.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.460
And so clearly agriculture and
being able to feed yourself

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.600
is one of the key fundamentals.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.315
These are the cereal crops.

00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:48.530
All humanity eats grass.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.715
The cereal crops are
all species of grass.

00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:52.387
And if you don't
eat wheat directly,

00:14:52.387 --> 00:14:53.970
you're eating something
fed the grain,

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.270
and they're giving you a steak.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.870
So we all eat grass.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.420
These three crops here,
the wheat, rice, and maze,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.480
have supported civilizations
throughout human history.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.650
The European, Asian, and
North American civilizations

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.930
have all been founded on
those three staple crops.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.990
And in the book,
there's a map of how

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.310
to find the Millennium Seed
Bank, where you can rescue

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.124
heirloom grains, seed
corn, to reboot agriculture

00:15:21.124 --> 00:15:22.790
if you can't find
anything in the fields

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.950
because it's been too long,
given with the latitude

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.330
and longitude coordinates.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.705
And it explains
later in the book

00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:30.020
how you can reinvent
those, how you can find out

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.728
exactly where this
place is in the world.

00:15:31.728 --> 00:15:35.680
You need technology mechanisms
to harvest that grain for you.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.510
And one of the major features
of the history of civilization

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.670
has been the application
of power and mechanisms

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.440
and harnessing natural
power sources like water,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.570
or wind in this example,
to relieve civilization

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.600
from having to use
your own muscles,

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.530
from having to go out
into the field yourself

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.450
or grind grain into flour
with just a pestle and mortar.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.630
And so the key components
of this windmill

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.041
here are these millstones
at the bottom, which

00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:06.415
grind the grain into flour,
which you then make bread out

00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:09.350
of and then can consume that
nutrition from the grass

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.790
that you've harvested.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.690
So in a sense then,
these millstones

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.160
are a technological extension
of your molar teeth.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.370
They're a way we've
invented to push

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.870
beyond the limitations of our
human body and use technology

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.160
to enhance it with
those millstones there.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.590
Pottery and being able to
cook food and ferment food

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.650
is an extension of our stomachs.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.240
We've basically invented
external digestive systems.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.280
And there's a whole load
of similar examples.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.710
And it's not just
mechanisms you need

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.495
to be able to
reinvent and reboot.

00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:45.286
The poster boy of the
Industrial Revolution

00:16:45.286 --> 00:16:49.050
was the steam engine and
these big bits of machinery

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.990
and the fire and the
power behind it all.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.730
But just as importantly,
there's been the application

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.020
of chemistry, of creating
the substances needed

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.910
to support civilization,
things like soda

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.570
or nitrates for your fields.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.990
And this example
here, again, goes back

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.740
to the gasified stove
and the uses of wood,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.369
where if you warm the wood,
it starts breaking down

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.700
and gives off all these
very, very useful compounds.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.119
And before the 1900s, and the
application of coal, and then

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.149
crude oil is the feed stop for
petrochemicals and everything

00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:25.640
that feeds into the
chemical industry today,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.829
it was all timber-based.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.070
This is the more
rudimentary basis

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.580
you need to drop back down
to, to leapfrog to, and then

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.320
start recovering
your capabilities.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.330
I wanted to show just two
other pictures, slightly more

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.872
egotistical.

00:17:43.872 --> 00:17:46.330
Because a lot of with research
for this book in writing it,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.746
clearly wasn't
just at the library

00:17:47.746 --> 00:17:51.320
or at home reading text
and digesting information.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.830
It was doing things for real
and getting hands-on expertise.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.860
And this is a day spent
in a 1700s blacksmith,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.520
working by a coke-fired hearth
with bellows pumping away,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.640
getting bits of
metal to be red hot,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.390
and then hammering
the life out of them

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.465
on an anvil with a big
blacksmith's hammer.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:13.860
And I created a steel knife
for myself from scratch.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.295
I transformed a blank
of steel into a knife,

00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:19.260
which I then, very
smugly, very gleefully,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.815
took home and cut some bread,
and some cheddar and made

00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:26.500
myself a post-apocalyptic
cheese toastie from scratch,

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.910
and then discovered, immediately
afterwards, a ruinous crack

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.530
in the handle of my knife
that I made from scratch.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.802
I'd done a pretty awful job.

00:18:34.802 --> 00:18:36.260
But the point behind
this though is

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.900
that I now know how to go back
and try again and do better.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.790
And it's that process
of reiteration,

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.040
on a microcosm with
me making a knife

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.310
for myself, a tool from scratch.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.960
It's exactly the same
process that civilization's

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.880
gone through over
thousands of years,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.540
and you want to have some
kind of effort at least

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.770
accelerating that process
to perhaps just a couple

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.310
of generations or a
couple of centuries.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.060
And if you look on
the inside cover

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.435
of the books in your
laps, I was really keen

00:19:02.435 --> 00:19:06.060
for the author photo to
not just be a digital photo

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.300
that we snapped and chopped
into Photoshop and printed.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.170
This is a photo we
made from scratch.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.090
I went to the Fox Talbot Museum,
where photography was invented

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.151
back in the 1830s, 1840s, and
we mixed up the silver chemistry

00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:20.650
ourselves.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.691
We made these compounds
from scratch, dumped them

00:19:22.691 --> 00:19:27.010
onto a plate of glass, exposed
in a very rudimentary camera

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.280
with just a single lens up
front for a 16-second exposure.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.620
It is ludicrously
hard to hold something

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.550
that doesn't look like a
death grimace for 16 seconds

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.540
without blurring.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.880
And what you can't
see is behind my back,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.080
there is an
honest-to-God metal brace

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.440
that clamps at the
base of your skull

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.280
to hold your head as still as
possible so it doesn't blur

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.600
in this very, very
long exposure.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.762
And that's the reason why most
photos of Edwardian gentlemen

00:19:52.762 --> 00:19:54.470
and Victorian
gentleman may look so

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.340
funless and joyless because
they're standing still,

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.602
sitting still for 15 seconds
with a metal clamp behind them.

00:20:00.602 --> 00:20:02.310
The other interesting
thing to point out,

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.670
the very simple
chemistry we've used here

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.170
is much more sensitive
to ultraviolet radiation,

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.340
UV rays from sun, from
the visible light.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.460
So this isn't actually
what your eyes would see.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.990
It's slightly distorted.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.600
And your lips come out as
being very white, very pale,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.420
because they
reflect a lot of UV.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.300
And you're actually seeing into
a deeper layer of your skin,

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.426
kind of into the
dermis, which is

00:20:22.426 --> 00:20:24.652
why it's a bit more
blotchy and dark.

00:20:24.652 --> 00:20:26.485
But I was quite chuffed
to be able to create

00:20:26.485 --> 00:20:33.040
a photo for myself and of myself
for the back page of the book.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.480
There's a website linked
into "The Knowledge"

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.480
as well with a whole load
of content and the videos

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.286
that we created I've
mentioned already.

00:20:41.286 --> 00:20:42.910
This is a video about
how to start fire

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.522
using only things
from an IKEA shop.

00:20:44.522 --> 00:20:45.980
And they're creating
fire blown out

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.940
of one of their coat
hangers that I've

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.162
found from someone
else and uploaded.

00:20:52.162 --> 00:20:53.245
So it's been a lot of fun.

00:20:53.245 --> 00:20:55.280
I've enjoyed these
last two years.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.150
And the conceit, at
least, is that this

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.700
is the one tome,
the one book you

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.300
would need to reboot
civilization from scratch

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.660
with all these different
functions of the modern world

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.710
you would need to recreate.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.770
I said, there's the website you
can explore for a little bit

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:15.350
more information and detail
and a Twitter stream as well.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.080
But I don't want to
drone on too long.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.330
I thought I'd just say some
things for 15, 20 minutes,

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.567
and introduce a bit about
what the book goes on about.

00:21:22.567 --> 00:21:24.150
But for me, the most
interesting thing

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.233
is talking to you about
it and hearing your ideas.

00:21:26.233 --> 00:21:28.170
What would be the most
crucial information

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.610
you would want to
preserve if there were

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.491
to be some kind of
apocalyptic scenario,

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.240
and you'd have to right
back from scratch?

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.290
What would be the
crucial information

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.544
that you'd want to
have handed to you?

00:21:39.544 --> 00:21:40.960
So thank you, guys,
for listening.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.293
I'd say we do have some time
for questions or discussion

00:21:43.293 --> 00:21:44.016
or chat.

00:21:44.016 --> 00:21:45.432
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much!

00:21:45.432 --> 00:21:46.851
LEWIS DARTNELL: Cheers.

00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:50.635
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:50.635 --> 00:21:52.780
MALE SPEAKER: OK, I
have a microphone.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.462
Does anyone have any questions?

00:21:54.462 --> 00:21:55.212
Right in the back.

00:21:58.527 --> 00:21:59.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.440
That was very, very interesting.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.350
So one of the questions was--
so all that knowledge and how

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.150
to do all those things
right now is preserved

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:14.010
on things like YouTube and
digital books and things that.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.750
How can we make sure that we
don't lose that knowledge so

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.637
that we can actually do those
things when we get to that day?

00:22:21.637 --> 00:22:23.470
LEWIS DARTNELL: Well,
a very similar problem

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.887
was encountered in the
latter half of the 1700s

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.720
when the very first
encyclopedias were being

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.360
compiled about people
like Dennis Diderot.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.590
And they came across a
very similar problem.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.120
How can you explain
practical skills

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.760
like weaving, or making
nets, or harvesting,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.972
bringing in a harvest
in the fields?

00:22:42.972 --> 00:22:44.930
How can you explain these
very practical skills

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.450
that you learn over the
course of many years,

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.320
working with someone who
already knows how to do it

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.820
and showing you and correcting
you if you're doing it wrong?

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.030
How can you communicate
and condense that

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.850
into just words in an
encyclopedia or perhaps just

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.180
some diagrams?

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.800
And the only
encyclopedia compilers,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.354
and there's a blog post on
exactly this on the website,

00:23:03.354 --> 00:23:06.020
they were acutely aware, perhaps
even more so than we are today,

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.430
of just how fragile and
vulnerable civilizations are.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.007
The Roman Empire collapsed, the
Greek civilization collapsed,

00:23:12.007 --> 00:23:14.465
the Mayans and Incans, which
we've discovered subsequently,

00:23:14.465 --> 00:23:17.280
have all collapsed.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.470
So what could you do
to preserve the sum

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.550
total of human knowledge?

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.700
And they made genuine attempts
to record everything back then.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.770
We know a bit more
nowadays, so that

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.660
would be perhaps impossible, and
even something like Wikipedia

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.630
doesn't even come close.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.785
So the conceit, the kind of
cheeky answer, if you like,

00:23:34.785 --> 00:23:38.040
up the website is you would
get an iPad or another kind

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.730
of tablet, you would
jerry-rig with a solar panel

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.630
or an alternator from a car to
regenerate power for yourself

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.305
and recharge your
batteries, and you

00:23:46.305 --> 00:23:48.138
would download some of
the apps I recommend.

00:23:48.138 --> 00:23:50.610
We can rip off, scoop
off videos from YouTube,

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.619
and save them on this
hard disk of your tablet.

00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:54.910
So when the internet goes
down, which will happen very,

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.319
very quickly after the
apocalypse, you've still got,

00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:59.110
not just the words of
"The Knowledge" book,

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.110
but also these
kind of demo videos

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.060
stored for prosperity
as it were.

00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:08.880
AUDIENCE: Well, I was
just going to ask,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.680
do you think we might
have been in a better

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.350
position to reinvent [INAUDIBLE]
maybe a hundred years ago

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.260
before the internet?

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.380
Because the internet
makes people's minds lazy,

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.780
and you don't have
to know stuff,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.690
because you can look
it up on the internet.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.989
And so, therefore, that's how
civilization spread early,

00:24:24.989 --> 00:24:27.280
orally being passed down from
generation-to-generation,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.547
skills, stories,
mythologies, et cetera.

00:24:29.547 --> 00:24:31.130
LEWIS DARTNELL: Yeah,
my gut reaction,

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.830
my impression is that we'd
probably be worse off today

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.610
than a century ago if this
hypothetical scenario were

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.162
to happen, if you do have
to go back to scratch.

00:24:39.162 --> 00:24:40.870
Because even during
the Second World War,

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.078
there was an enormous amount
of ingenuity and problem

00:24:43.078 --> 00:24:46.380
solving during the scarcity
of the Second World War,

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.670
and most people had an
allotment in the back garden,

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.961
and they grew stuff themselves.

00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:52.330
They grew vegetables and
food to feed themselves.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.830
How many of us do that today?

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:54.330
No.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.930
There's perhaps not
that many hipsters

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.310
in London that have even
got access to an allotment

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.340
to be able to grow.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.500
And I did try when
I was living down

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.166
in Angel to get an
allotment for myself,

00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:04.720
and there was something like
a nine-year waiting list.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.640
So all of these skills
are just dissolving away.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.490
They're disappearing.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.480
You don't repair things
for yourself anymore.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.400
You can't get your
radio and take out

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.640
the valve that isn't working
anymore and replace it.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.500
You can't look and understand
the mechanism of the things

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.970
we use, because--

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.970
You know, your iPhone,
the mechanism inside that

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.610
is literally visibly small.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.630
You'd need a microscope to be
able to see the kind of city

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.686
landscape of the
circuitry there.

00:25:30.686 --> 00:25:33.310
And it's not something that you
could ever repair for yourself.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.380
And in fact, you're
not even expected

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.020
to take the back off
technology nowadays.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.436
You just take it
back to the shop,

00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:40.820
and a genius will
repair it for you.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.249
And I think that's sad.

00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:44.790
I think it's lamentable we're
losing that connection with how

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.540
things are made or done
in a fundamental sense.

00:25:53.975 --> 00:25:56.330
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.490
Really interesting talk.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:57.940
LEWIS DARTNELL: Thank you.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.490
Two related questions.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.690
As you went through all
of your research for this,

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.620
and you were focusing on
things that we were missing,

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.466
were there any kind of objects
or processes that you thought,

00:26:10.466 --> 00:26:11.380
you know what?

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.670
Actually, we could
just forget that.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:19.230
And kind of related to that,
are there any social constructs

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:25.550
that you came across that you
thought how would we implement

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.122
law or government
or whatever it is?

00:26:28.122 --> 00:26:30.205
LEWIS DARTNELL: Yeah, so,
two very good questions.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.310
One of the recurring themes I
tried to keep coming back to

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.550
through the book
was this network,

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.880
this web of scientific
discoveries,

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.650
which enable you to make new
technological innovations,

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.280
which then allow
you to investigate

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.739
the world in a new way and make
new scientific discoveries.

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:48.988
So that kind of back-and-forth
process between science

00:26:48.988 --> 00:26:51.490
and technology and exploring
this vast web of knowledge we

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.440
have today.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.547
So for example, mastering
the substance of glass

00:26:54.547 --> 00:26:56.630
and grinding it into a
lens to build a microscope,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.610
which allows you to explore
the invisible realm.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.394
But with hindsight, we
now know red herrings

00:27:02.394 --> 00:27:04.810
we took in history, science,
and technology, or stuff that

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.190
turn out to be not all
that very useful, or things

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.010
like electricity that
are so useful in so

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.290
many different ways you
want to beeline directly

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.130
to that gateway
technology, as I call it,

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.750
and it opens up a whole
load of other stuff.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.040
So there's a video about
electrolysis on the website,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.350
about how you can use
electricity not just for power

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.430
and moving things
with motors for you,

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.630
but generating
crucial substances,

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.980
like bleach or
chlorine and things.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.600
So you want to leapfrog
something like electricity

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.590
and the printing press
for similar reasons

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.230
and also the social
ramifications of that.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.474
But, it being a
popular science book,

00:27:37.474 --> 00:27:39.140
and already being
quite difficult to fit

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.581
all the scientific knowledge
into just 300 pages,

00:27:41.581 --> 00:27:43.830
one of the early decisions,
one of the early editorial

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.690
decisions was to leave out
more of the social sciences,

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.850
the politics and economics
and a description

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.180
of how to build a
democracy from scratch.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.960
Because, while undeniably
important, I think

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.810
there's a clear distinction
between art and music

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.850
and politics and science, and
that science is universal.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.920
The laws will be true no matter
where you are or when you are.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.020
Humanity will have the same
requirements and demands

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.910
that technology
must provide for.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.890
So science and technology,
in a sense, are universal,

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.350
but politics isn't really.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.710
And my suspicion was if I wrote
this twee little 10-step guide

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.395
to building a parliamentary
democracy, it doesn't matter,

00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:24.770
because whoever's
got the biggest

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.440
gun gets to be the boss anyway.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.398
And they're not going to
relinquish their power

00:28:28.398 --> 00:28:30.240
unless you go
through, perhaps, 100,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.600
200 years of social
revolution and slow change.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.280
So you can provide key kernels
or principles of science,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.640
but you can't really do the same
thing for social constructs.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.277
I think they have to arise
organically or naturally.

00:28:44.277 --> 00:28:46.360
And it probably wouldn't
make that much difference

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.920
if you described democracy,
because it would-- no one would

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.500
pay any attention unless
they're ready for it anyway.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.550
You'd perhaps live
with a feudal system

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.950
for 50 years or whatever.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.420
MALE SPEAKER: Time for one more.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.441
AUDIENCE: So, thanks
for presenting,

00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:02.440
and thanks for the book.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.550
I've been waiting for
something like this

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.350
since I discovered
science fiction, because,

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.891
all these post-apocalyptic
scenarios,

00:29:06.891 --> 00:29:10.400
it's good to know that now we
know how to fend for ourselves.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.680
Personal question for you.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.210
If the apocalypse in
the way you described

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.230
came, and 99.99% of the
population with decimated,

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.116
beyond locking yourself up in a
supermarket for food and water

00:29:21.116 --> 00:29:22.490
for the next 55
years, what would

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.230
be your personal next steps?

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:27.310
Medicine?

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.730
Go and find the biggest gun?

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:29.360
Something else?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.850
LEWIS DARTNELL: Yeah, so
there's been a bunch of reviews

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.621
on the Amazon US site,
and there's allegedly

00:29:34.621 --> 00:29:36.370
been a bunch of preppers
who have reviewed

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.390
this book about
rebuilding civilization.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:39.854
And they just love their guns.

00:29:39.854 --> 00:29:41.270
And one of the
major questions is,

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.517
you haven't talked about
weaponry in your book.

00:29:43.517 --> 00:29:44.600
And, of course, it's true.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.560
But again, the resounding bottom
line is, if you've got a gun,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.080
you're fine.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.772
If you don't have
a gun, find one.

00:29:49.772 --> 00:29:51.230
It's not an
interesting discussion.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.242
There's no interesting
answer to be had there.

00:29:53.242 --> 00:29:55.450
And the knowledge isn't
going to help you either way.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.120
So I avoided guns right
from the beginning,

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.980
for the same reason I avoid
the politics and stuff.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.920
But clearly, for this
book to be relevant,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.370
you have to be in a world
that isn't like "The Road."

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:07.780
You have to be
beyond that stage.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.050
This is what happens next.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.980
And you have got some
semblance of stable society,

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.560
where people are now
ready to start progressing

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.845
and rebuilding, as
happened in 1340s

00:30:16.845 --> 00:30:18.720
after the bubonic plague
and the Black Death.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.769
A lot of people died.

00:30:19.769 --> 00:30:21.810
People shrugged their
shoulders, stiff upper lip,

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.655
and got on with it.

00:30:24.655 --> 00:30:27.355
So the next step, the
one piece of information

00:30:27.355 --> 00:30:30.770
that I think would be most
critical out of all knowledge

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.370
that you would really want
to preserve and not forget,

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.875
I've hinted at
already, is this idea

00:30:34.875 --> 00:30:36.650
of germ theory and hygiene.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.780
There is nothing you can do more
for yourself to keep yourself

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.050
healthy and alive than
stopping yourself picking up

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.090
a transmissible infection
in the first place.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.270
And the basic tenets of
germ theory and hygiene

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.936
are what will really
help you out there,

00:30:48.936 --> 00:30:50.690
when there aren't
antibiotics anymore.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.520
So, we aren't
being too prurient.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.607
Make sure you're not
drinking your own excrement,

00:30:54.607 --> 00:30:56.440
making sure no one else
is putting excrement

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.564
into the river where you're
taking your water from.

00:30:58.564 --> 00:31:01.530
And you laugh now, and this is
obviously a disgusting thing.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.450
As late as the
1850s, 1860s, that's

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.020
what happened in London,
the capital of the most

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.885
powerful empire
in the world, they

00:31:07.885 --> 00:31:09.760
were pouring their poo
into the River Thames,

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.870
and someone else 20 yards
down the road, down the river,

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.520
was pulling up a
bucket and drinking it.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.061
And tens of thousands
of people would

00:31:15.061 --> 00:31:17.540
be dying in a week with
cholera, but for really easily

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.249
preventable ways.

00:31:18.249 --> 00:31:20.040
So one of the key
technologies I talk about

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.440
is how to make a microscope,
ludicrously simple,

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.115
to prove to yourself that
there are these organisms, that

00:31:25.115 --> 00:31:27.490
are too small to see
that cause disease,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.165
and you want to break that
cycle with things like hygiene.

00:31:31.165 --> 00:31:34.890
It demonstrates
scientifically, with evidence,

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.277
why this is important.

00:31:37.277 --> 00:31:39.860
[INAUDIBLE] I think Rob is going
to drag me onto the tube to--

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.490
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we're
going to go to [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:41.230
LEWIS DARTNELL: To
your other main site.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.630
MALE SPEAKER: So, please, join
me in a round of applause.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:43.930
Thank you, Lewis Dartnell.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.263
LEWIS DARTNELL: Thank you, guys.

00:31:45.263 --> 00:31:46.380
[APPLAUSE]
