00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.210
- Gentlemen, this is the
strength test.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.210
To test the structural
integrity of your blades,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.500
the hardness of your steel, and
the strength of your pommel,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.380
I'll be taking a
hammer and knocking

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.380
your blades through these sheets
of steel like a railroad spike.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.210
Dwight, you're up first.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.710
Are you ready?

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.540
You want me to do it?

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.790
No, no.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.500
[laughing]

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000
DWIGHT: When I seen that they
was going to be hammering

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.040
through that piece of
steel, I'm thinking

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.670
that handle may not hold up.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540
[music playing]

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.710
Well, Dwight, your
tip held up beautifully.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.170
Still tight.
Still in one piece.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.000
Your handle is a little
on the clunky side,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.420
but I only had to
hold it that way,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.040
so it's not a big deal to me.
Well done.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.420
Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.040
Billy Bob, you're up next.
Are you ready?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.750
Let's do it.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.250
When I realized he's whacking
it three times, I'm thinking,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.540
Oh God, this is going
to be the toughest test.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.290
[music playing]

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.290
Well, Billy Bob, your
tip held up beautifully.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.540
I was sweating it.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.290
Without any glue
in there, I thought

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.790
for sure this thing was going to
at least wriggle or jiggle or--

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.580
Both of us was.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.920
Very well done.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.120
- Thank you, sir.
- Mark, you're up next.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.250
Are you ready?
- Pull the trigger.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.880
My heart rate does
go up quite a bit.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.290
But it's got a good point on it.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.750
I know I got it good and sharp.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.120
And I think it'll do well.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.960
[music playing]

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.460
Mark, your knife
did take some damage.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.830
Has a little bit glinting
on the edge up here

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.460
and there's pieces came
off the handle here.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.170
And there's some gapping
that happened in the impact.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.290
I still think that the
handle is secure enough to go

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.080
on to the sharpness testing.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.120
All right, gentlemen.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.790
To see if your blades have
held their tip and their edge,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.750
I'll be slashing and stabbing
into our Sandman dummy here.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.420
Now, unlike the other test,
this is all about what

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.290
your blades do that bag.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.830
Dwight, you're up first.
- I'm ready.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.580
Go for it.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.460
Long cutting edge, and I wasn't
sure I had my knife really,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.670
really sharp.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.380
Mine may not cut this thing.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.210
[music playing]

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.540
He dead.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.960
All right, Dwight.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.710
Your blade's got some
serious weight to it.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.120
Right.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.830
But these cuts are
just beautifully clean

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.880
and there was just
no resistance.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.210
Thanks.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.500
All right, Billy Bob.
You're up.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.960
- Let's do it.
- OK.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.790
[music playing]

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.210
All right, Billy Bob.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.330
Much lighter knife, lots faster.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.880
And you can see, those
cuts are like razors.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.750
Really clean.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.750
Nicely done.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.210
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.250
All right, Mark.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.750
It's up to you.
- OK.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.250
Let's do it.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.580
Having part of your blade
break is pretty serious.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.380
But the handle is
still quite solid,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.250
and I think it will
still perform well.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.080
[music playing]

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.960
All right, Mark.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.790
It's really, really sweet.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.420
Just lays right into my hand.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.880
And the blade geometry
on this is really nice.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.620
Good job.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.420
Thank you.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.290
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberations.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.120
It's time for one of
you to leave the forge.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.920
Mark, your blade did
not make the cut.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.540
Doug will explain.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.880
Mark, you took on
three master bladesmiths.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.710
The twist Damascus is beautiful.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.460
The bounds and
sharpness of your blade

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.500
easily sliced the sandman.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.330
But at the end of the day,
your blade took some damage

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.790
and your handle chipped.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.960
And that's the reason
we're letting you go.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.500
Yeah.
Absolutely agree with you.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.750
Thank you.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.120
Mark, please
surrender your blade.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.830
I think that the judges
made the right decision

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.170
for the right reasons.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.920
Had I put the brass
guard on there,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.920
my blade would have stood
up to the punishment.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.170
But I felt like I gained a
lot out of the experience.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.830
It was a great
opportunity to come here

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.830
and to test myself
against the best.
