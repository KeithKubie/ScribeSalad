JONATHAN BERI: Hi, I'm Jonathan
Beri and I'm on the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.930
developer relations
team for Google+.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.560
Today I'm going to introduce
you to the

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.620
Google+ Hangouts API.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.470
Hangouts let you set up a one
click video conversation with

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.480
friends, family, coworkers
and interesting people

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.070
from around the world.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.510
You can catch up with your
fantasy football teammates,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.660
get face to face feedback on
your vocal solo, meet other

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.820
model train lovers, or
collaborate with remote

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.830
colleagues on a shared document
in real time.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.759
All over a high quality,
easy to use video chat.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.280
If Hangouts are a room where you
can bring people together,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.920
Hangout Apps are the kitchen
table you're all sitting at.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.680
A shared space for board games,
sketchbooks, sewing

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.370
machines, or calendars.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.130
They're the feature that
spark the conversation.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.550
The Google+ Hangouts API
allows you to develop

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.320
collaborative Apps that run
inside of Google+ Handout.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.900
Hangout Apps are normal web apps
that can take advantage

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.732
of rich, real time
functionality in

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:57.630
the Hangouts API.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.970
Apps have the ability to control
aspects of the user

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.390
interface, synchronize data
between people, and respond to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.190
events in the Hangout.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.415
With Hangouts it's better to
show you then to tell you, so

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.510
I'll fire up a Hangout and
invite a few of my friends

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.190
from the Hangouts page.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.900
I'll log in to Hangout and
invite my friends from

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.700
developer relations,
Wolf and Jenny.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.440
Hey Jenny.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.661
Hey Wolf.

00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:20.112
JENNY: Hi Wolf.

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.820
WOLF: Hey Jenny.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.380
JONATHAN BERI: We have a
team offsite coming up.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.310
Why don't we use a Hangout
App to plan out our trip?

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.286
WOLF: Sounds good.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.410
JENNY: Sounds like
a great idea.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.090
JONATHAN BERI: I'll
pull up one of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.900
the Apps we've developed.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620
So what you're seeing here is
a Hangout App running inside

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.000
of a Hangout.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.740
This is a demo using the Google
Earth plug-in and I'm

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.250
going to go fly around the
world, pick some cool places

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100
to go to, and we're going
to collaborate

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.500
on that list together.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.614
So I'm thinking Malpais,
Costa Rica.

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:53.025
WOLF: I hear exciting things
are happening in Mountain

00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:54.680
View, California.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.750
JONATHAN BERI: See what
just happened there?

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.820
Wolf picked Mountain View,
California, on his map and it

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.350
showed up on my screen using
the data channel API.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.320
So if I tag it, he'll see
Malpais on his map.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.120
And as Jenny's looking
for a cool place,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.650
that'll show up as well.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.539
Tagged by Jenny, nice.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.030
It's a very simple API that
allows you to synchronize any

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.950
type of information
across the App.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.240
But we can do more than just
locations on a map.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.490
We can actually follow each
other using that same API.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.940
So I'm going to click on Wolf
and see what he sees.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.120
WOLF: Well, I'm thinking we
should take our offsite to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.213
McMurdo Station in Antarctica.

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:31.175
It's pretty cool.

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:32.555
We can look around here.

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:35.660
Pull back.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.950
JONATHAN BERI: Neat.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.630
So we're using the same API that
we used to synchronize

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.890
the locations.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.280
We can do more than just sync
data across the Apps.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.700
We can do fun things like
moustaches and overlays.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.690
I'll show you with
the costume App.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.900
Now here are a bunch
of costumes that

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.780
I can try out virtually.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.490
Let's say, top hat.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.170
Oh yeah, looks pretty good.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.960
What we're actually doing here
is using our overlay API.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.460
With the overlay API I can pick
a resource, create it

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.330
inside the plug-in, and attach
it to any parts of our face.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.950
And then that overlay
tracks along.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.660
Looking stylish, Jenny.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.050
Wolf, I think you've got to get
a little bit smaller on

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.210
that mustache.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.960
WOLF: No, I think--

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.970
I've had almost any size
mustache here and I'm not

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.970
sure, I'm thinking this kind.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.110
JONATHAN BERI: Wolf's using
the ability to scale and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.420
offset his mustache using
the API as well.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.860
Now, because this is an API we
can use great features of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.340
HTML5 to do more than
just images.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.000
For example, we can actually
draw our costume.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.140
So switch over to the drawing
canvas, pick a cursor, I think

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.065
I'm going to make a
crown for myself.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.690
Yeah.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.680
Yeah, it's a good crown.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.766
How do I look guys?

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:51.890
WOLF: You look like
a king or somebody

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.100
wearing a sponge cake.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.250
JONATHAN BERI: Wolf, you
look way better.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.320
Glasses on glasses.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.088
WOLF: I look this good all the
time even without overlays.

00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:04.418
There you go, Jenny.

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:06.480
JONATHAN BERI: So now you have
goggles and glasses.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.570
JENNY: Exactly, multi-goggle.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.050
JONATHAN BERI: Let's now
demonstrate how you can add

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.510
animations into your App.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.410
Switch over to the animate
mode, guys.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.019
The API also includes the
ability to access parts of the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.110
hardware, such as
the mic volume.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.680
So I like PBR, I'm going to
click the PBR option.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.964
Now I've got a cool fedora with
my hipster character.

00:04:28.964 --> 00:04:33.959
WOLF: I've always wanted to be
a bear, so now I'm a bear.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:34.412
JONATHAN BERI: Nice.

00:04:34.412 --> 00:04:36.224
JENNY: And I had techno
colored hair

00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:36.740
before, it was cool.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.470
So, oh perfect.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.870
Blue hair.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.700
WOLF: There you go.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.800
JONATHAN BERI: We can all
talk in sync right?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.600
WOLF: Yes.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.070
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.410
JENNY: Can indeed.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.540
JONATHAN BERI: We've also added
the ability for you to

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.050
respond to facial motion within
your application.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.680
Let me share a cool demo.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.010
So in this demo I've loaded up
a WebGL of a giant funny head

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.890
and it's actually responding
to my facial movement.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.640
Literally your face can
become a controller.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.000
I can zoom in, I can zoom out.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.120
Left, right, up, down.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.340
And for kicks we've added the
ability to track your mouth

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.690
movement using your volume.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.600
Pretty neat, huh?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.120
It's just that easy.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.930
You can find all the details
that you need, including

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.590
sample code, tutorials, and
reference documentation, on

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.700
the Google+ Developer
site today.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.080
This means you can get
started right now.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.330
Thanks for watching.
