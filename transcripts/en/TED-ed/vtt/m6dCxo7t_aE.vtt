00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:09.421
In all times and places in our history,

00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.938
human beings have wondered,

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:12.192
"Where did we come from?

00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:14.165
What's our place in the world?

00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:16.505
What happens to us after we die?"

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:18.568
Religions are systems of belief

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:20.634
that have developed and evolved over time

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:21.803
in response to these

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:23.924
and other eternal mysteries,

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.660
driven by the feeling that some questions

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.834
can only be answered by faith

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:29.214
and based on an intuition

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:31.385
that there is something greater than ourselves,

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:33.584
a higher power we must answer to,

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:35.927
or some source we all spring from

00:00:35.927 --> 00:00:38.342
and to which we must return.

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:41.695
Hinduism means the religions of India.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:42.910
It's not a single religion

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.933
but rather a variety of related beliefs

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.858
and spiritual practices.

00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:48.907
It dates back five millennia

00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:50.373
to the time of Krishna,

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:51.850
a man of such virtue

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.441
that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu,

00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.402
an incarnation of the god in human form.

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:59.637
He taught that all life follows karma,

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:01.337
the law of cause and effect,

00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:04.561
and our job is to do our duty, or dharma,

00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.473
according to our place in society

00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:09.048
without worrying how things turn out.

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:12.190
When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.655
If we followed our dharma

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.814
and did our proper duty in our past life,

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:17.185
we get good karma,

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:20.352
which sends our soul upward in the social scale.

00:01:20.352 --> 00:01:21.934
Our rebirth into the next life

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.888
is thus determined by what we do in this one.

00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:28.253
The wheel of rebirths is called samsara.

00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:30.199
It's possible for a very holy person

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.611
to lead a life with enough good karma

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:34.409
to escape the wheel.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.869
This escape is called moksha.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.817
Hinduism teaches that everything is one.

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:40.765
The whole universe is

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:43.856
one transcendent reality called Brahman,

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:45.717
and there's just one Brahman

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:47.260
but many gods within it,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.179
and their roles, aspects, and forms differ

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.470
according to various traditions.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.387
Brahma is the creator,

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:56.089
Vishnu is the preserver

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:58.624
who sometimes takes on human form,

00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:00.910
and Shiva is the transformer,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.572
or Lord of the Dance.

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:06.069
Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.939
Ganesha has an elephant head

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.486
and is the wise patron of success.

00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:14.717
Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world.

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:17.075
And although most Hindus live in India,

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.123
they can be found on every continent,

00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:21.288
one billion strong.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.366
Now, let's travel west,

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:24.978
across deserts and mountains

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.253
to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago.

00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:30.040
Judaism began with God calling

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.842
Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:35.486
and migrate to the land of Canaan.

00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:38.481
In return for their faith in the one true God,

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:39.885
a revolutionary concept

00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:42.436
in the polytheistic world of that time,

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:45.652
they would have land and many descendants.

00:02:45.652 --> 00:02:47.736
From this promise came the land of Israel

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:49.436
and the chosen people,

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:50.734
but staying in that land

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:52.236
and keeping those people together

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:54.356
was going to be very difficult.

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:56.947
The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt,

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:58.897
but God freed them with the help

00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:00.456
of the prophet Moses,

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:02.112
who received the Ten Commandments

00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:04.532
and later hundreds more.

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:06.296
They conquered the Promised Land,

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:09.376
but could only keep it for a few hundred years.

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:11.402
Israel sits at a crossroads

00:03:11.402 --> 00:03:12.771
through which many armies

00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:14.309
marched over the centuries.

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.509
And in the year 70,

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.912
the Romans destroyed the temple

00:03:16.912 --> 00:03:19.277
in their capital, Jerusalem.

00:03:19.277 --> 00:03:21.154
So, the religion transformed itself

00:03:21.154 --> 00:03:22.487
from a temple religion

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:23.897
with sacrifices and priests

00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:25.970
to a religion of the book.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.263
Because of this, Judaism is a faith

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:31.270
of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.901
tied to the literature of its history.

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.366
The many sacred scriptures make up

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:37.358
the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh,

00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:39.572
and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations

00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:42.238
are contained in an expansive compendium

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:43.458
of deeper meanings,

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:45.061
called the Talmud.

00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.977
Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.110
At the Passover meal,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.946
every item on the menu symbolizes

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:53.696
an aspect of the escape from slavery.

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.016
The importance of growing up

00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:56.867
is emphasized when young people

00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:59.171
reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah,

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.443
ceremonies during which they assume responsibility

00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:02.380
for their actions

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.644
and celebrate the weaving

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:04.692
of their own lives

00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:06.678
into the faith, history, and texts

00:04:06.678 --> 00:04:08.357
of the Jewish people.

00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:11.266
There are 14 million Jews in the world today,

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:12.738
6 million in Israel,

00:04:12.738 --> 00:04:14.119
which became independent

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.233
following the horrors of genocide in World War II,

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:19.824
and 5 million in the United States.

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:23.806
But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:25.116
where Buddhism began

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:27.883
with a young prince named Siddhartha.

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:29.137
On the night he was conceived,

00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:30.696
his mother, Queen Maya,

00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:32.886
is said to have been visited in her sleep

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:35.809
by a white elephant who entered her side.

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.806
Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born

00:04:37.806 --> 00:04:39.558
into a life of luxury.

00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:41.974
Venturing forth from his sheltered existence

00:04:41.974 --> 00:04:43.088
as a young man,

00:04:43.088 --> 00:04:44.516
he witnessed the human suffering

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:45.926
that had been hidden from him

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:49.310
and immediately set out to investigate its sources.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.502
Why must people endure suffering?

00:04:51.502 --> 00:04:54.605
Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives?

00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:56.019
At first he thought the problem

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:58.055
was attachment to material things,

00:04:58.055 --> 00:04:59.943
so he gave up his possessions.

00:04:59.943 --> 00:05:01.669
He became a wandering beggar,

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.994
which he discovered certainly made him no happier.

00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:07.693
Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student,

00:05:07.693 --> 00:05:09.947
"Don't tighten the string too much, it will break.

00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:11.657
But don't let it go too slack,

00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:13.584
or it will not sound."

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:14.752
In a flash, he realized

00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:16.916
that looking for answers at the extremes

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.343
was a mistake.

00:05:18.343 --> 00:05:20.847
The middle way between luxury and poverty

00:05:20.847 --> 00:05:22.133
seemed wisest.

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:24.419
And while meditating under a bodhi tree,

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.588
the rest of the answer came to him.

00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:29.344
All of life abounds with suffering.

00:05:29.344 --> 00:05:31.209
It's caused by selfish craving

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.556
for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others.

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:36.058
Following an eight-step plan

00:05:36.058 --> 00:05:38.224
can teach us to reduce that craving,

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:40.641
and thus reduce the suffering.

00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:43.799
On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha,

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:45.307
the enlightened one.

00:05:45.307 --> 00:05:47.681
Not the only one, but the first one.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.152
The Buddhist plan is called

00:05:49.152 --> 00:05:50.414
the Eightfold Path,

00:05:50.414 --> 00:05:51.916
and though it is not easy to follow,

00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:52.991
it has pointed the way

00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:55.060
for millions to enlightenment,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.144
which is what Buddhahood means,

00:05:57.144 --> 00:05:58.285
a state of compassion,

00:05:58.285 --> 00:05:59.080
insight,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.934
peace,

00:05:59.934 --> 00:06:01.807
and steadfastness.

00:06:01.807 --> 00:06:03.989
From the time he got up from under that tree

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.097
to the moment of his death as an old man,

00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:08.251
the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened:

00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:09.008
right speech,

00:06:09.008 --> 00:06:09.805
right goals,

00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:11.939
a mind focused on what is real,

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.688
and a heart focused on loving others.

00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:17.181
Many Buddhists believe in God or gods,

00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.269
but actions are more important than beliefs.

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:21.808
There are nearly a billion Buddhists

00:06:21.808 --> 00:06:23.117
in the world today,

00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:27.057
mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia.

00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:31.221
2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land,

00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.237
Christianity was born.

00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:36.439
Just as Hindus called Krishna "God in Human Form,"

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.609
Christians say the same thing about Jesus,

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:40.361
and Christianity grew out of Judaism

00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:43.463
just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism.

00:06:43.463 --> 00:06:45.946
The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham

00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:47.860
to ask a young woman named Mary

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.195
to become the mother of his son.

00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:51.694
The son was Jesus,

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:53.214
raised as a carpenter

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:55.136
by Mary and her husband Joseph,

00:06:55.136 --> 00:06:56.859
until he turned 30,

00:06:56.859 --> 00:06:58.644
when he began his public career

00:06:58.644 --> 00:07:00.808
as the living word of God.

00:07:00.808 --> 00:07:02.816
Less interested in religiousness

00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:04.060
than in justice and mercy,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.612
Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds

00:07:06.612 --> 00:07:09.608
and then taught them about his heavenly father --

00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:12.524
affectionate, forgiving, and attentive.

00:07:12.524 --> 00:07:14.737
Then, he would invite everyone to a common table

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:17.489
to illustrate his Kingdom of God,

00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:21.576
outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together.

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:22.612
He had only three years

00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:24.381
before his unconventional wisdom

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:25.659
got him into trouble.

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:26.860
His enemies had him arrested,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.635
and he was executed by Rome

00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:29.840
in the standard means

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.511
by which rabble-rousers were put to death,

00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:34.114
crucifixion.

00:07:34.114 --> 00:07:36.197
But shortly after he was buried,

00:07:36.197 --> 00:07:38.194
women found his tomb empty

00:07:38.194 --> 00:07:39.520
and quickly spread word,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.553
convinced that he had been raised from the dead.

00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:43.940
The first Christians described

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.023
his resurrected appearances,

00:07:46.023 --> 00:07:49.118
inspiring confidence that his message was true.

00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:53.307
The message: love one another as I have loved you.

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:55.350
Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.443
in December at Christmas,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.706
and his suffering, death, and resurrection

00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:01.915
during Holy Week in the spring.

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.246
In the ceremony of baptism,

00:08:03.246 --> 00:08:04.686
a washing away of sin

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:06.961
and welcoming into the Christian community,

00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:08.787
recall Jesus's own baptism

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:10.958
when he left his life as a carpenter.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.430
In the rite of Communion,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.461
Christians eat the bread and drink the wine

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:17.127
blessed as the body and blood of Jesus,

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:19.593
recalling Jesus's last supper.

00:08:19.593 --> 00:08:22.017
There are two billion Christians worldwide,

00:08:22.017 --> 00:08:25.821
representing almost a third of the world's people.

00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:29.568
Islam began 1400 years ago

00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:31.359
with a man of great virtue,

00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:33.028
meditating in a mountain cave

00:08:33.028 --> 00:08:34.743
in the Arabian desert.

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:36.997
The man was Muhammad.

00:08:36.997 --> 00:08:39.249
He was visited by a divine messenger,

00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:41.162
again the angel Gabriel,

00:08:41.162 --> 00:08:43.335
in Arabic, Jibril,

00:08:43.335 --> 00:08:46.002
delivering to him the words of Allah,

00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:48.028
the one God of Abraham.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.212
In the next few years,

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:50.849
more and more messages came,

00:08:50.849 --> 00:08:53.108
and he memorized and taught them.

00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:55.814
The verses he recited were full of wise sayings,

00:08:55.814 --> 00:08:56.846
beautiful rhymes,

00:08:56.846 --> 00:08:58.981
and mysterious metaphors.

00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.764
But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet.

00:09:01.764 --> 00:09:03.321
Many agreed the verses

00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:05.015
were indeed the words of God,

00:09:05.015 --> 00:09:08.011
and these believers became the first Muslims.

00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:11.016
The word Muslim means one who surrenders,

00:09:11.016 --> 00:09:14.334
meaning a person who submits to the will of God.

00:09:14.334 --> 00:09:16.368
A Muslim's five most important duties

00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:18.516
are called the Five Pillars:

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:21.626
Shahada, Muslims declare publicly,

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:24.681
there is no other God but Allah,

00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:27.502
and Muhammad is his final prophet;

00:09:27.502 --> 00:09:31.436
Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca;

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:34.050
Zakat, every Muslim is required

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.852
to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor;

00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:41.163
Sawm, they fast during daylight hours

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.001
for the lunar month of Ramadan

00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:44.551
to strengthen their willpower

00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.598
and their reliance on God;

00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:49.510
and Hajj, once in a lifetime,

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.605
every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage

00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:53.499
to the holy city of Mecca,

00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:54.440
rehearsing for the time

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.941
when they will stand before God

00:09:55.941 --> 00:09:58.061
to be judged worthy or unworthy

00:09:58.061 --> 00:10:00.388
of eternal life with Him.

00:10:00.388 --> 00:10:01.522
The words of God,

00:10:01.522 --> 00:10:04.340
revealed to the prophet over 23 years,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.161
are collected in the Quran,

00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:09.995
which literally translates into "the recitation."

00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.355
Muslims believe it to be the only holy book

00:10:12.355 --> 00:10:14.244
free of human corruption.

00:10:14.244 --> 00:10:15.745
It's also considered by many

00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:17.157
to be the finest work of literature

00:10:17.157 --> 00:10:19.315
in the Arabic language.

00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:21.662
Islam is the world's second largest religion,

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:25.714
practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.973
Religion has been an aspect of culture

00:10:28.973 --> 00:10:30.803
for as long as it has existed,

00:10:30.803 --> 00:10:34.137
and there are countless variations of its practice.

00:10:34.137 --> 00:10:35.572
But common to all religions

00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:37.720
is an appeal for meaning

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.861
beyond the empty vanities

00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:41.634
and lowly realities of existence,

00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:42.732
beyond sin,

00:10:42.732 --> 00:10:43.564
suffering,

00:10:43.564 --> 00:10:45.665
and death,

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:47.248
beyond fear,

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:49.376
and beyond ourselves.
