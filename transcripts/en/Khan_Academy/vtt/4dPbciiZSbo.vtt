00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:01.031
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.031 --> 00:00:03.730
Today, we're talking
about verbs and bears.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.089
We had previously established at least

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.449
one thing about the verb,

00:00:07.449 --> 00:00:10.099
and that was that it can show actions.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.402
But today I'd like to introduce the idea

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:17.255
that the verb can link
ideas to one another.

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:19.309
In fact, we have this whole class of verbs

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.630
that we call "linking verbs."

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.035
Or, if you want to call
it something fancier,

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:27.136
we call that "state of being verbs."

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:29.537
These linking verbs include all forms

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:31.489
of the verb "to be," which I have

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.893
handily written out for you.

00:00:32.893 --> 00:00:37.243
So, I am, he is we are,
be nice, they were being,

00:00:37.243 --> 00:00:40.857
they have been, he was, we were.

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:44.229
Now we use a linking verb when we want

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.219
to connect one idea to another.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.098
So what I'm gonna do is

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:48.553
I'm gonna divide the screen in half

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:51.307
between the action side and
the state of being side,

00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:54.777
just to show you what I mean.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.557
So we use action verbs to
show what something does,

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:02.988
whereas we use state of being verbs

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:05.868
to show what something is.

00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:08.790
So let's bring it back to this bear.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.787
Let's think of an action
for this bear to do.

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:12.992
What is a bear-like thing to do?

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:16.452
The bear eats a fish. That's an action.

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:19.804
That's something the bear is doing.

00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:22.706
The bear is hungry,
however, is not something

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:25.537
that the bear is doing, it's
something that the bear is.

00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:27.596
So what "is" is doing here, is connecting

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:30.484
the word "hungry," to the word "bear."

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:31.819
It's linking it.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.817
Some verbs can be used both ways.

00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:37.022
They can be used both as
actions, and as linking verbs.

00:01:37.022 --> 00:01:39.926
I'll show you an example of that.

00:01:39.926 --> 00:01:43.198
You could say, "The bear looked at me."

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:45.457
Which is to say the bear is doing a thing,

00:01:45.457 --> 00:01:48.359
looking, at something, namely me.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.861
But we could also say,
using the same verb,

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.287
"The bear looked lonely."

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:57.443
Now in this case, this is
describing how the bear looks.

00:01:57.443 --> 00:01:59.707
What the bear looks like.

00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:01.703
This looking is not
something the bear is doing,

00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:05.001
it is how the bear appears to a viewer.

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.525
So, "looked" is connecting

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:10.705
"lonely" to "bear."

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:12.142
It is linking "lonely" to "bear."

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:13.581
It is a linking verb.

00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:16.243
By the same token, we
could say, for an action,

00:02:16.243 --> 00:02:18.816
"The bear smells a person."
What is it smelling?

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:20.433
A person.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:21.756
But we could also say,

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:23.520
"The bear smells like cinnamon."

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.299
Which, I grant you, is pretty unlikely.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.303
Don't go smelling bears.

00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:31.276
But what "smells" is
doing here is connecting

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:34.245
the idea of cinnamon, to the bear.

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:35.938
The bear isn't smelling the cinnamon,

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:38.182
the bear smells like cinnamon.

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:39.267
And that's the difference between

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:41.386
a linking verb and an action verb.

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:43.930
A linking verb shows what something is,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.378
an action verb shows what something does.

00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:49.886
So the bear is hungry,
the bear looked lonely,

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:52.290
the bear smells like cinnamon.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.411
These all reflect something
about what the bear is.

00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:56.994
How it's being.

00:02:58.174 --> 00:03:00.735
You can learn anything, David out.
