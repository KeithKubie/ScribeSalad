00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.311
What about this example?

00:00:01.311 --> 00:00:05.290
Out of 500 grads, 200 got business jobs.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.240
Can you enter this as a ratio?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.190
And be careful about what
goes in the numerator and

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.210
what goes in the denominator.
