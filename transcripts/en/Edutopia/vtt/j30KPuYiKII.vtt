&gt;&gt;Daniel: What we're
calling today social

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:17.096
and emotional learning actually has
many of its roots back in the '80s

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:21.056
when kids were having lots of
problems with things like drugs,

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:26.746
unwanted teen pregnancies,
drop outs, violence in schools

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:33.116
and the federal government mandated
programs to prevent these things.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:39.006
There was a war on bullying, there
was a war on drugs, there was a war

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:45.206
on violence in schools and about
the time I as a science journalist

00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:51.156
at the New York Times was
looking around at what I ended

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:52.736
up calling emotional intelligence.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:01:00.056
About that time a foundation, the WT
Grant Foundation funded study of all

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:03.666
of these programs because people
realized some of these programs work

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:07.246
and a lot of them don't and
they want to know what's working

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:11.256
and so they did an analysis of
the different components and so on

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:16.436
and they realized that the programs
that worked all shared a common set

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:17.796
of ingredients and what were they?

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:20.986
They're helping kids
become more self aware,

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:24.266
they're helping them manage
their distressing feelings,

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.116
they're helping them be more
empathic, control impulse,

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:32.296
make sound social decisions
like how can I say no to drugs

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:38.656
and keep my friends and that
essence has been extracted

00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:43.736
from those programs and
brought to the classroom

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:45.596
as social emotional learning.

00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:53.666
Today they've completed a mega study
of more than 200 independent analyses

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:56.896
that look at kids who have these
programs and kids who don't,

00:01:57.306 --> 00:02:03.726
comparable kids and they find
that if kid's get the training

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:09.946
in social emotional learning
that all pro social behaviors,

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:15.356
things like attendance, behaving
well in class, liking school.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:22.366
They all go up about nine or ten
percentile points and the things

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:27.436
that they're trying to prevent, the
drug use, the violence in schools,

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:30.396
the bullying, all of that
goes down by the same margin

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:35.756
and the real kicker I think is
that academic achievement goes

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:41.216
up eleven percentile points and
if you look at the difference

00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:45.896
between groups of kids who
don't do well and groups who do,

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:49.366
the difference in their
achievement is about the same range.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:53.416
I mean this pretty much closes the
achievement gap and it works best

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:54.976
for the kids who need it the most.

00:02:55.546 --> 00:03:00.476
So today I think that the social
emotional learning movement has the

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:04.506
ammunition to go to the next
level, really to take it scale,

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:08.466
to make it available to every
kid, everywhere in the country.

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:17.476
I think to get this kind of education
for every kid we have to first get

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:22.026
over our fixation on
academic achievement tests

00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:24.286
as the end all and
be all of education.

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:28.196
We have to remember we're educating
the whole child and if you talk

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:30.366
to people in companies as I often do,

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:35.096
you find that they don't just want
bright kids with technical skills,

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:38.236
they want bright skills with
technical skills who know how

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:41.636
to get along, who can cooperate,
who can be good team members,

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:45.906
who could relate well to customers,
who manage their emotions well,

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:49.106
who stay motivated,
who take initiative.

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:51.476
Those are social emotional skills.

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:56.276
So what makes kids prepared for the
work place is yes it's the academics

00:03:56.316 --> 00:04:00.836
but it's this too and I think
that we need get over the mindset

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.316
that sees this as something
extra or something unnecessary.

00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:12.116
Neuroscience is now telling us
that children's brains are plastic

00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:16.466
that is they're shaped by repeated
experience and if you're going

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:19.506
to help a child be prepared
for life you want to give

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:25.176
that child the repeated experiences
that are going to help his brain

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:31.386
or her brain be able
to manage their anger,

00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:36.436
to calm down when they're upset, to
tune into other people, to get along

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:42.266
and the best way to shape
the brain we're finding is

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:43.646
through social emotional learning

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:48.186
because it targets the very
circuitry that's taking shape

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:52.016
through childhood that's going to be
your foundation for life, for better

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.296
or worse on how well
you can do those things.

00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:58.416
So this is not touchy-feely,
this is very hard science now.

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:03.016
I think everyone should care
about this, not just people

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:06.066
who are parents, it's not
just I want this for my kid,

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:09.376
I want this for my
community because I want

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.456
to be safe walking down the streets.

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:17.386
I want my friends and neighbors to be
safe and one of the strongest affects

00:05:17.386 --> 00:05:19.526
of this is it heads
off criminal careers,

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:24.296
it helps kids who otherwise might
go down the wrong alley be able

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:28.536
to manage their impulse, manage
their anger, tune in to other people

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:33.336
and get along better and I think it
just makes the world a better place

00:05:33.336 --> 00:05:35.456
for all of us.
