good is math what is the relationship

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
good is math what is the relationship
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.190

between math and physics

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
between math and physics
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.220

well sometimes math leads sometimes

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230
well sometimes math leads sometimes
 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.620

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.000
the Apes if an apple Falls does the moon
also fall Isaac Newton said yes the moon

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
also fall Isaac Newton said yes the moon
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.830

so does an apple he had a unified theory

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
so does an apple he had a unified theory
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.100
so does an apple he had a unified theory
of the heavens but he didn't have the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190
physics came new mathematics super
 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.199
physics came new mathematics super

differential geometry all of a sudden we

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280
differential geometry all of a sudden we
 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.850
differential geometry all of a sudden we
had supersymmetric theories coming out

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860
had supersymmetric theories coming out
 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.020

that then revolutionized mathematics and

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030
that then revolutionized mathematics and
 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.440
that then revolutionized mathematics and
so the goal of physics we believe is to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450
so the goal of physics we believe is to
 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.510
so the goal of physics we believe is to
find an equation perhaps no more than

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520
find an equation perhaps no more than
 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.790
find an equation perhaps no more than
one inch long which will allow us to

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800
one inch long which will allow us to
 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.490
one inch long which will allow us to
unify all the forces of nature and allow

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500
unify all the forces of nature and allow
 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.879
unify all the forces of nature and allow
us to read the mind of God and what is

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889
us to read the mind of God and what is
 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.520
us to read the mind of God and what is
the key to that one inch equation

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530
the key to that one inch equation
 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.379

supersymmetry a symmetry that comes out

of physics not mathematics and has

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.659

shocked the world of mathematics but you

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669
shocked the world of mathematics but you
 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.420
shocked the world of mathematics but you
see all this is pure mathematics and so

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430
see all this is pure mathematics and so
 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.850
see all this is pure mathematics and so
the final resolution could be that God

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860
the final resolution could be that God
 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.080
the final resolution could be that God
is a mathematician and when you read the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090
is a mathematician and when you read the
 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.110
is a mathematician and when you read the
mind of God we actually have a candidate

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120
mind of God we actually have a candidate
 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.440
mind of God we actually have a candidate
for the mind of God the mind of God we

for the mind of God the mind of God we
believe is cosmic music the music of
