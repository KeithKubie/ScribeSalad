00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; Narrator: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So my name
is Stephen Winick and I'm here

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.260
at the Library of Congress,
where I'm the writer and editor

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.860
for the American Folklife Center.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.910
And I'm here with the three members

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.210
of the group NOKA,
and with Mikel Markez.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.290
And we're going to
talk about Basque music

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.550
and culture, and about their group.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.980
So I'm going to address some
general questions in English,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.160
and any of you can answer.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.280
And I also have some questions
in French that I'll ask later

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.740
for Mikel specifically --

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.040
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Okay.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: About the
Basque country and life there.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.180
But for now, you are
three Basque-Americans,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.190
and perform Basque
language songs and music.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.070
So let's talk a little
about the Basque culture,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.970
and if you could just start out
by telling us what, you know,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.640
Americans need to know about
Basque culture to understand

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.530
who are the Basques, and what's
their language and culture like?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.430
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Well, the
Basque country is a translation

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310
from the English of Euskal
Herria, which were the first two

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.370
of the seven provinces, where the
language, Basque has been spoken.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.870
So there are -- right now it's
divided into seven provinces.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.640
Four which are in Spain and
three of which are in France.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.450
But there's a language there
that is spoken that is unrelated

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.330
to any other language in the
world, so it's an isolate --

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.240
so it's not related to Spanish
or French, or anything else.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.900 position:56%
So in America what they should know,
is it's a great secret language.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.240
So everyone should learn
it -- not everybody --

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.540
enough people should
learn it so they can talk

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.140
about other people while
they're in America.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.010
And so we are -- the three of us
are daughters, or granddaughters

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.090
of immigrants who came
from the Basque country.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.280
From -- my family's from the
southern side, so the northwest

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.440
of France, and Nafarroa
[Beherea] is the province,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.740
about five miles from
the French border.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.950
So my parents came from
there to work in the states.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.710
And Cathy and Andrea can speak
to their own family histories.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.150
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: My
parents were born in California;

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.970
it's my grandfathers
that immigrated to --

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.350
one to Chino and one
to northern California.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.650
They married Basque-American women,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.750
so my grandmothers were
also born in California.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.300
They came from the French
side of the Basque country.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.720
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Yeah,
my parents also were born

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.020
in the French side of
the Basque country.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.870
My mom's from Alsace, and my
father's from St. Estevan.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.870
And my father immigrated as
a shepherd in the mid-50s,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.060
and then he got into
the dairy business.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.570
And went back to marry my mom after
seven years, and that's my history.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.260
Well you know, I think if Americans
know about Basque Americans at all,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.020
they tend to associate
them, I think, with Idaho

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.330
and possibly with Nevada.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.770
I'm not sure that a
lot of Americans know

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.390
that there's Basque
folks in California.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.480
So are the Basques in
the West generally aware

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.230
of one another's communities
as well as the other states?

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Yes, we have --

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.930 position:56%
in California the biggest Basque
clubs are in Chino where we're from.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.470
There's one in Bakersfield
and San Francisco.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.000
And those are ones that each
have their own clubhouse.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.890 position:56%
So yes, we do know each other very
well; we go to each other's picnics.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.820
There's -- well the picnics for
the children, the kids get together

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.950
and learn dances together
and songs together, but yes,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.250
we know each other very well.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.850
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: And
it's also connected

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.150
through the North American
Basque Organization.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.760
And there are like triannual
meetings, and communication.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.610
We have a website, so --

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.790
So what kind of Basque cultural
outlets are there in California?

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.360
You mentioned the clubs,
are there other sort of ways

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.870 position:56%
in which Basques get together and --

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.170
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Sure --

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
perform their culture?

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.770
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
So in addition to --

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.070
we call them Basque picnics.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.370
So they're big -- they
are pretty big festivals.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.950
So the Basque community will
have Basque picnics in --

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.290
every year at the same time.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.590
So the Basque picnics

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.240
and the different communities
will go to each other's picnics.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.680
So we tend to go to the
ones in Bakersfield;

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.290
they'll come to our picnics.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.500 position:56%
And then depending on the community,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.910
but we have an actual clubhouse
-- a Chino Basque club.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.410
So we actually have
monthly gatherings,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.710
and we'll have lunches or dinners.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.650 position:56%
And we'll have -- we've brought
people over from the Basque Country,

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.880
like Mikel's been there
before with other singers.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.180 position:56%
And we've brought over Kepa Junkera.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.320
[Inaudible] has been there; we've
had dance groups perform there.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.790
But even when we don't
have entertainment

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.250
from the Basque Country,
we'll get together

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.110
and have a meal that's
prepared by Basque-Americans

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.400
or Basque immigrants, and just
to spend some time together.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.740
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: There are
also some Basque restaurants.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.040
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah,
Basque restaurants, sure.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.340
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: In
Chino we only have one.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.130
Now Bakersfield has I
don't know, maybe four

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.430
or five Basque restaurants.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.650
San Francisco has one as well.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.820 position:56%
And back in the day, I mean in Chino
it was where all the shepherds came.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.100
They were boarders there, so the
owners -- the woman, Monique,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.800
she would cook for all of the
shepherds; that's where they lived.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.640
Andréa Bidart: And it's organized
into communities, and you --

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.040
each community has usually
its own dance group.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.340
So we have like three
Basque dance groups.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.170
To the littlest ones, and
then the older ones and on up.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.460
And then we have the
sport too, pilota.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.090
Like in Chino we have the young
ones learning how to do pilota.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.880
And there's a lot of
card game going on.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.220
Mouche is the standard card game.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.550
I know my mother plays
at least twice a week.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.490
And then each club
has its competition,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.190
and then there's the
national competition.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.060
And it goes international
competition, so --

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wow.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.660
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: So yeah.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.960
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
It's pretty organized.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.260
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: It
is pretty organized.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, wow.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.860
So in terms of song, I mean
you guys ended up as --

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.830
with song as sort of your
primary expression of your --

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.130
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Right.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Basque identity.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.610
So is that an important part of
Basque life in California as well?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.910
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Sure.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.980
I mean I think that one of the
main things the Basque movement has

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.700
brought I think was
the love of song.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.440
And there's an old -- I think
it's a French saying that

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.100
"The Basques are the
people who sing".

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.420
I've heard that before.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.200
And Basques usually do know how
to sing, and it's a tradition

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.500
in the Basque-American communities.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.130
This is true both in the
California world where we're used

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.040
to seeing, you know, Basque people.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.650
But even in Idaho or other
places, where after dinner --

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.440
after any meal really,
there's those long tables

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.880
and people will sit
around and sing songs.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.670 position:56%
So All of us grew up I think
hearing Basque song around the table

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.390
at Basque restaurants or
picnics or in our homes --

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.690
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Our
fathers sing together.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.990
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah,
all of our fathers sing.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.290
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Yeah.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.590
Yeah, so --

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.890
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: But
also song in church.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.190
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.490
Mm-hm.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Basques are
usually Catholic, and so we all grew

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.090
up singing the church songs.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.990
And then song comes into --
there's a Basque camp for children,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.850
and they learn all
the different things.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.260
And Noka as a group has gone
to Udaleku and taught songs

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.620
that would teach the
language to the children.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.220
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Through song.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.820
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: And in those
masses, when people pass away,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.120
they call on NOKA to
do those Basque songs.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.720
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: You know, two
of us can do it, because Cathy's

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.020
in Pennsylvania, or any form
of us we can kind of help out.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.320
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: But
we've sung at many --

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.620
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
In that fashion too.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.920
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Many funerals.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.220
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Right.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.820
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Weddings too [laughs].

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.120
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Yes, every now and again.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.420
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Some baptisms.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So --
sure, so are there a lot

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.020
of traditional Basque
songs in oral tradition

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.320
in California would you say?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.620
Or -- ?

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.920
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: I
would say most of them are.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.220
I mean I think that we're
one of the few groups --

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.520
we might be the only group
in California, actually,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.980 position:56%
that is writing our own music -- our
own songs, and trying to find songs

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.280
that are less traditional.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.970
So the songs -- we love
those songs, or if we have --

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.100
our CD with Mikel is our third
CD, but the first two we did --

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.400
the first one was really --

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.700
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
All traditional songs.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.000
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Here are
songs we heard up, you know --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.300
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Yeah.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.600
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: -- singing
and learning, and so they're --

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.340
and so those songs are
really the -- kind of the --

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.400
and I think it's pretty typical
of immigrant communities,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.580
but you know, missing the homeland.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.350
And seeing their mother and
seeing their sweetheart,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.190
and wanting a sweetheart, and
those kind of heartbreaking songs.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.490
And we love those.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.790
So a lot of ballads.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.680
So I would say the norm is to --

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.980
you know, people have books

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.050
where they memorize them
to sing those songs.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.200
And we're trying to do a little bit
-- we do that too, but we're trying

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.960
to kind of bring into more
public view the kind of songs

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.480
that people don't generally sing.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
And when you say that,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.080
what kind of songs would that be?

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Well, I
would say that there are a few songs

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.150
that I personally grew up
hearing that were where the women

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.450
or girls were protagonists.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.820
I mean they're sort
of the object of --

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.660 position:56%
like maybe a man want to marry them,
or they miss them, or the girls --

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.190
that someone's telling them what to
do, but they don't have much say.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.970
And -- but we've really, in the
archives, have found a lot of songs

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.910
that are -- like in today's
concert -- that are --

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.590
and very often bad things
are happening to them.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.110
But women's stories;
a woman struggling.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.560
Or a woman who's a saint.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.170
Or a woman who has to go
someplace to, you know, find work

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.780
and then gets in trouble.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.980
Or two sisters fighting.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.460
And we don't have, you know,
the bickering over a boy.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.950
So we're trying to really find --

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.570
uncover and write songs that
about sort of putting women more

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.230
in the forefront and not just in
the secondary or supporting roles,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.610
and sort of what men
want them to be.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.510
But kind of having
their own opinions

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.810
about what they want to do or be.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.410
Great, that's really, you know,

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.330
I think a really interesting
approach to song --

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.630
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Mm-hm.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Especially from a group

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.230
that got its start doing
traditional songs --

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.530
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Right.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Because of that --

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.130
you know, the sort of gender roles.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And then we
also see our fathers, I mean they --

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.730
Cathy, her mother sings about --

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.030
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Right.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: We learned it
from our fathers and grandfathers --

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.930
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: And
my grandfather would sing

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.230
around the table all
the time, so for --

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.530
I think it was a very positive
thing is what it was to be Basque;

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.830
to sing songs around the table.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.130
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.430
And so explain the connection
of that focus on women's stories

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.280
with the -- the name, NOKA.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.320
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Well,
if you insist [laughs].

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.260
So NOKA is the name of our group,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.430
and we named ourselves
after a pronoun.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.140
Because in Basque there is no
he or she or "la" or "elle".

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.910
The only place where there's gender
marking is in the familiar form.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.060
And there's one form of how
we're speaking to Mikel,

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.360
called "Toka" [phonetic].

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.080
Or if I'm speaking to Cathy
or Andrea, it's called "Noka".

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.540
So it's to one female
addressee or a girl or a woman.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.660
And it really marks a relationship
of a familiarity or solidarity.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.290
But as you've seen in
the concert what ends

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.260
up happening is it's used
not for sort of positive

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.050
or friendship purposes, but
for telling a girl what to do,

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.910
or to address to women who are
not necessarily looked well upon.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.040
So we thought that was
really interesting,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.740
and then that it's dying.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.920
So it's equivalent to the male
form, Toka, but it's not used

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.620
in nearly sort of the context.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.950
And the Toka form; the male form,
has these positive association

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.890
with this rugged, you know
[foreign language spoken],

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.190
the eye candy, right?

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.200
Like they're really sexy
and masculine, and you know.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.110
Or they're poets or
they're athletes,

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.120
or they're in the public
domain doing great things.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.750
And the Noka form is
not used that way.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.870
So we thought, well we should
sing those songs to kind

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.240
of show the richness of the form.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.730
And then also we've been writing
songs and using them in ways

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.730
that are more just familiar,
and more pedestrian puroposes

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.030
to show what it should be.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.330
And it used to be used
for everything.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.730 position:56%
Because it was the only way to speak

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.430
to a single addressee;
a singular addressee.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.220
So we've been trying to expand the
range of uses that we sing in song.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.820
I notice you've mentioned a couple

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.780
of times finding songs
in the archive --

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.080
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yes.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Or bringing
songs out of the archive.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.680
So where do you locate the archive?

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.980
Where -- ?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.280
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: They're in
my house [background laughter] --

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.580
so now they're in my house.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.880
So I -- I'm a sociologist of
language, and I did research

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.510
for my dissertation on efforts
to revitalize the language

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.660
in San Sabastian, Gipuzkoa.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.080
And when I was doing that
research, I noticed that this is

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.210
when I first learned about
the Noka/Toka difference.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.580
And people didn't have
a different --

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.720
didn't have a good answer to when I
would ask -- well why don't people,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.900
because to me like, the "tu"
form in Spanish is like --

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah [laughs].

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.500
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Everybody uses it.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.800
So I didn't understand
why it wasn't used

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.100
in the same way as the male form.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.400
And no one had an answer.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.970
"Oh no, that's just the way it
is; it's always been that way."

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.390
And I'm, "Okay."

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.300 position:56%
So I started looking in the archives
to see, well how has it been used?

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.670
And there's sort of
three main archival --

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.420
there's three main genres I guess.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.770
There's a lot of song.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.270
There's a lot of folklore, and
then there's Biblical materials.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.870
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: So
I've looked at all of that.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.290
And interestingly enough, a
lot of the best materials are

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.880
in the Bodleian Library in Oxford
-- which I love that place so much.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.280
So a lot of it's there.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.280
Some of them are in archives
in the Basque country.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.030
And then some of them are also
in the Center for Basque Studies

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.870
at University of Nevada, Reno.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.500
So I've spent a lot of time
in the archives very happily,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.000
and I've copied the
songs or I buy the books.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.550
And so most of what we
need for singers is all

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.860
in my house now [laughs].

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.590
So I have copies somewhere
in my house.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's great.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.000
So we love to hear about
people using the archives here

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.300
at the Library of Congress,
as you well know --

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yes, we do
-- and I must say, I also spend time

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.060
in the Alan Lomax collection,
looking at the Basque songs,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.360
and he knows -- of him too.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.790
So I actually have
looked at those --

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.540
the Basque sources in the
Library of Congress as well.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.140
That's great --

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.440
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
-- and just those --

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.040
that's a collection that's in
the division where I work --

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.340
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Yeah, we love it.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.640
Yeah, it's great.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: The
American Folklore Center --

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.240
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.540
Yeah.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Where Alan
Lomax went to the Basque country --

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.140
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.440
Yeah.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And collected
a lot of songs and music.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.040
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.340
Yeah.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.940
Well thanks for accessing that
kind of gem, because we love it.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.240
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Oh, I loved it.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.540
Yeah. And he also spent some time
in Baztan, which is where my --

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.840
the valley where my family's from.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.140
So he spent time at Elizondo.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.440
And one of his informants
was Mariano Izeta.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.740
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Right.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.040
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And he was
a jeweler on the side [laughs].

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.340
He was this -- you know, I
mean he wrote a dictionary

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.640
and he was sort of a folklorist.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.940
And so some of the songs that are
on that collection from the 50s,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.240 position:56%
he's like - he's like 35 and he died

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.540
when he was I don't
know, 85 or something.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.840
So it was - I knew
him as an older man.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.440
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: So it was
like, hey, this is Mariano Izeta,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.740
singing on this collection!

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.040
It's really great.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wonderful.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.640
Well we always love to hear
stories like that, so thanks.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.940
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Another thing

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.540
that I noticed during the concert
was that you set some Basque lyrics

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.210
to contemporary songwriter's
music --

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.510
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Mm-hm.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.810
Mm-hm.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Including
Johnny Cash and John Prime.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.410
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Mm-hm.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So how
did you come to do that?

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.010
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: I guess
that was mostly my idea

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.310
and they were willing to --

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.610
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: It
was mostly her idea [laughs].

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.910
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Go along with it.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.060
I mean as Begona said earlier, we
started off with traditional tunes,

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.650
and then we took other Basque tunes
and then either put them in Noka,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.410
or took them out of the Archives.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.310
And then most recently
we've been thinking more

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.950
about being Basque-American.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.890 position:56%
And so taking the words in Noka and
then setting them to American tunes.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.800
I think particularly be of
interest to the Basque --

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.480 position:56%
you know, in the Basque region who,
I think, really like American music.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: It's different.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.080
Nobody's doing it [laughs].

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.380
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: But that's not
what they're doing over there,

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.800
so it's a way to Basque-American.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.400
And when you write your own songs,

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.830
do you write the words
and the music primarily?

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.750
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: I don't
know anything about music [laughs],

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.370
I don't read music or anything.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.670
So I go with the words.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.270
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: So
when I write the lyrics --

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.570
so the first song, the
one about the coffee milk?

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.720
I mean that was a tune
that I loved for so long.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.240
And it was before I even knew
Cathy's uncle had written it.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.790
And I remember I was on a plane and
the tune kept coming back to me.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.360
And I -- if I don't know the meter,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.450
my favorite meter seems
to be 8, 10 -- 8,6.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.200
So I just started out -- the
words just started coming

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.500
and I sort of went with it.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.080
So for me to write the lyrics, I
almost always have a tune in mind,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.510
and then sometimes we use that
tune or we don't; we change it up.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.220
And then there was
only a couple times

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.650
when I've just written the
words without any music at all.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.790
And then in a couple cases, Cathy
found a tune that kind of went

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.090
with it and she arranged the words.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.740
But that's sort of been
my process; I don't know.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.540
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: And
then with Mikel Markez --

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.840
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.140
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Our
collaboration with him,

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.600
that's when he was writing
the tune and Begona's words --

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I see.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.200
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart:
And that would be,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.500
for instance, [Basque
language spoken]

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.800
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Because he can write a song

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.790
in like 15 minutes [laughs].

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.090
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart:
Yeah, we spent that --

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.390
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah,

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.530
one of them was 20 minutes I
think I sent him the words,

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.500
and then he had a tune
in 20 minutes.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.870
It was a little -- a little bit
gross [background laughter].

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.880
Because I don't think he has
any musical training either,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.240 position:56%
so he just sort of comes up with it.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.810
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: But that was
two summers ago that he came --

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.110
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.410
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Right.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.710
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: And spent
time with us, and that --

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.560
and we recorded, and we're
just working together.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.650
And he'd come out with -- we'd show
him the words, and he would come

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.470
out with a tune or vice-versa.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.770
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: [Basque
language spoken] is mostly ours --

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.070
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: That's true.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.370
That's true --

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.670
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Wouldn't you say?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.970
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: That's true.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.270
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: The words
and a little bit -- a twist of --

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.480
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: Yeah, a twist
on the traditional, but -- and --

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.870
or sometimes we just
change the rhythm

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.900
up to make it-- like
the Santa Agata.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.200
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Mm-hm.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.870
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: That melody
existed, but we just gave it a,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.760
you know, "Mack the
Knife" kind of feel to it.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.360
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: And really
changed the whole feeling

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.660
of that song.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.260
And well, explain that song.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.560
Explain the sort of
idea of that song.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.320
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Well, I
mean I think Cathy can speak more

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.610
to the musical side of it,
but I -- it's another --

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.780
song I had at my house
[laughs] in a book, and I --

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.620
I had heard, and I don't
know that much about it,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:16:00.670
and maybe you can ask him
later-- in French, maybe he knows,

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.550
but it's just she's a
Sicilian saint, and she --

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:09.620
a Roman governor wanted her to be
his concubine, and she refused.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.360
And he wanted her -- and I think
he put her in a brothel, to like,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.760
"Okay" -- and she still refused.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.130
And then she -- he put
her in a prison and she --

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.700
and then said, "Give up your
Christian faith" and she refused.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.270 position:56%
So then he actually had her martyred
as if she were a prostitute.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.870
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: So the
martyrdom is really brutal.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.530
And so I don't know why she is a
patron saint of some small towns

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.200
in the Basque country,
I don't know why.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.500
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Yeah,
Mikel will probably know that.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.800
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: but there --

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.100
Biscay and I think
it's mostly Biscay.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.400
And I know that because in
Boise, a lot of the -- most --

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.700
that community mostly went
to -- it's from Biscay.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.000
So they do this -- sort of on
her feast day, they do this --

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.300
they sing a version of her
story that's very sanitized --

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.900
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
In those communities.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.200
But it was new to us.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.500
And so in -- there's many
versions of that song.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.800
And the -- and most of
them don't tell the story,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.100
they just say, "She
was really awesome.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.400
She was really faithful.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.700
Go Agatha."

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.000
And -- but this song is like --
this is what happened to her.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.300
This is what happened to her,
and we thought, you know,

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.600
we've had different responses
to that song, but you're going

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.900
to remember the story [laughs].

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.500
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Even if you hate it.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.800
You're going to -- yeah.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.100
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: But interesting
to me too, children sing that song.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.400
It's sort of like a
trick-or-treat kind of a thing.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.700
They go in the streets, right?

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.000
And they bang their canes.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.300
And they're asking for candy.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.600
And it's very --

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.900
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: He's going to
know about Saint Agatha; ask him.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Saint Agatha?

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.500
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: You
know, straight and solid.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.800
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Yeah.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.100
He'll know.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.400
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
We don't know why it was.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.700
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: And so
because it was in Noka,

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.000
we tried to think hard how
can we reinterpret this song,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.300
and that's when the whole kind
of jazzy feeling came from it.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mikel,
parlez un peu de Sainte Agata?

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.900
[Mikel, speak a little
about St. Agatha]

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.200
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Oui.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.500
[Yes.]

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.800
&gt;&gt;Mikel Markez: C'est un tradition,
Sainte Agathe, comme elles ont dit,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.100
surtout a Bizkaia, c'est plus,
mais dans tout le pays Basque.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.400
Et la tradition c'est d'aller
le nuit avant Sainte Agathe,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.620
le jour de Sainte Agathe, et aller
dans les maisons qui sont dans le

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.060
village et dans les montagnes
aussi, avec des bois...

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.360
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Yeah, wood -- wood sticks.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.660
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
A cane -- canes.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:48.870
&gt;&gt;Mikel Markez: Et tout le monde va
a une maison et chante les verses

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.140
que nous avons chantés aujourd'hui.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:18:00.090
Et c'est pour demander des
oeufs ou un petit peu de pain,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.350
ou un peu de lait.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.650
Ou quelque chose.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.510
Et ils chantent:

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:28.040
[Singing in Basque Language]

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.600
&gt;&gt;Mikel Markez: Et c'est un
rythme archaïque, avec les....

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.990
Et tout le monde est là.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.530
Il y a des enfants, des
vieux, et tout le monde va.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.830
C'est un tradition
millénaire, je pense.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.130
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Merci, [laughs] all right.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.430
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And we --

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.730
that's not the version
that we sing [laughs].

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, but
still, you know very interesting.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.330
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: We don't
say give us candy [laughs].

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.630
That's good.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:42.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So I guess we
didn't talk about how you're --

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.230
how the three of you started
singing together as a group,

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.530
like as a performance group.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.830
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: We started in
1997 really, singing in English.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.130
We recorded a song,
"The Rose" in English.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.730
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: And
after that we decided, well,

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.030
that turned out pretty well,
why don't we sing in Basque?

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.860
We had sung together in a group
called [Basque language spoken],

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.030
a group of women in Chino before.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.660 position:56%
But that's really what made us, just
the three of us, separate and --

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.380
we were first the American
Basque Chicks for a little --

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.680
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Just for a little bit.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.980
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: ABC,
and then Noka came about.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Excellent.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: So it's really
almost 20 years ago that we started.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.730
And did you seek a connection with
the kind of the Basque music scene?

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.620
Because I know there's a lot of
music over in the Basque country.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.920
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Mm-hm.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So did you start
travelling there to see any of that?

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.510
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Well we've all --

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: See any of that?

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.680
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: We've always
sort of travelled there, I mean --

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.980
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: But as a
group that took us some time.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.280
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Really not yearly, but --

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.580
yeah, it took us some
time to do that.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.260
Our first CDs we really did on our
own, without really collaborating

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.600
with any musicians from over there.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.200
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: I would
say, the first two CDs.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.500
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah, and I
think that that first CD was songs

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.450 position:56%
that we knew, and then -- so we knew
the songs, and then we -- I think --

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.940
was that the one your
family was involved in?

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.240
The musicians--

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.540
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart:
Yeah, mostly yeah.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.840 position:56%
Because we didn't know anyone, so --

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.140
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
But it was sort of kind --

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.440
we didn't really change
much up on that one.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.740
We just sort of, "This is
kind of how we know them."

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.040
And then we sang them that way.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.420
And then the second
CD was more, "Okay,

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.560
we're going to sing only songs
in Noka", and those were --

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.100
and some of those were
a little bit different.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.600
But it's the first -- this CD
with Mikel is the first time

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.590
that we have a collaboration
from the very beginning

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.510
with a Basque-American,
and Basque musician.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.500
And we thought kind of deliberately
together about both the theme

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.950
of the song, and then you
know, what kind of came easily,

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.330
musically in the arrangement.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.430
And we kind of went with
those that kind of came

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.110
to all of us that we liked.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.710
And how did you start
collaborating with Mikel?

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.320
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Well actually,
well he came to Chino, and I --

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.330
you know, four years ago
[foreign language spoken]?

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.630
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Four years, yeah.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:21.930
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
And I didn't see him

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.230
over there; Begona had met him.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.530
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.830
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: And
then I met him separately

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.060
in the Basque Country three years
ago, and we started talking.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.870
And then he had recorded
his last CD that he asked me

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.840
to be a collaborator
on, so I did that.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.230 position:56%
And I just saw it was really easy to
work with him, so then I said, "Hey,

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.770
we should do something with Noka."

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.070
So that's really how it started.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.820
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: So I've been
working with him on his projects.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.120
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.420
And another aspect
in the performance

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.510
that you gave us today was the
projection screen with some

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.850
of the lyrics and some
explanations of some of the songs.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.920
How did it come to your minds
to do that -- to add that?

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.220
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.460
Well we actually initially start
off doing this kind of a format.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.310
Because we primarily -- we
started off primarily performing

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.620
to American audiences;
sometimes Basque-American,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.920
but sometimes university audiences.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.280
And so no one understands
the language.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.210
And so from the beginning,
we sort of --

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.680
we've had the lyrics and
then the translation.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.040
And then we try to keep the
images interesting [laughs].

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.860
And so then -- so this is -- what
we did today is actually what we --

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.220
until recently we would do
pretty much all the time,

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.230
and sort of more lecture
performances.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:27.040
And often when we do that, I
have actually many more slides

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.840
about the grammar which I didn't
show today, to kind of talk

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.140
about [background laughter] --

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.440
because people usually
don't know anything --

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.740
they don't know where
the Basque country is.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.040
They don't know where we --
I mean sometimes they do,

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.340
but in university settings.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.900
So we'll have, you know,
here's our Basque Country.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.200
Here's our map.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.630
And here's, you know, the
language and all that.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.190
And so from the very beginning,
it's sort of been not only to sing,

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.940
but also to educate the public
about the Basque country;

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.240
about the Basque language.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.540
And in particular about Noka.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.080
Because even native speakers
over there often won't know --

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.100
they won't even know
what it is really.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.170
So I think we've been more
deliberate about trying to --

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.650
when we learn something that
is a surprise, to be sure

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.710
and talk about that in the talk.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.310
And so this year is
kind of special --

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.610
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Mm-hm.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Because the
Basque country's being featured

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.210
at the Smithsonian
Folklife Festival.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.170
So what's that experience
been like for you [laughs]?

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.650
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart:
It's been wonderful.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.590
And one thing I was
hoping that would come

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.620
out of it would be
collaborating with other cultures.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.390
And we've had that
opportunity because we're part

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.540
of the Basque program,
but we're also part

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.770 position:56%
of the Sounds of California program.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.480
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: So we've
already had a wonderful experience

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.780
with the Japanese group --

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.080
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Japanese,
yeah, from Los Angeles.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.610
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: And
we had a panel with them.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.020
And we decided collectively
to teach them a Basque song.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.840
And then they taught
us a Japanese song.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.060
And we were able to perform
those together, and for me,

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.650
those kinds of things
are a highlight.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.250
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.460 position:56%
And we have a -- I think two days or
three days we have another session

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.050
at the -- Sounds of California
in the studio with a --

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.580
I think they call themselves
the Armenian Public Radio.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Okay.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.180
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: So it's
like [laughs], okay, so we --

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.480
and you know, what's
interesting to us is

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.970
that often they're
really close to us,

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.350
and we don't know about each other.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.650
So it's sort of fun to make --

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:55.950
it's been fun making those
kinds of connections.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.550
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: And just how
many people in such a short amount

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.400
of time are learning about
Basque in a positive way.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.310
Because you know, sometimes
like, "Oh Basque" you know,

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.720
with the political
problems and its --

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.290
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: This is
really what Basques are about too,

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.170
and just sharing that with
everybody has been great.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Actually that's
an interesting question too,

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.960
because a lot of Americans
who only know one thing

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.520
about Basque people might know

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.820
about the separatist movement
in Spain and in France.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:28.200
So how does that affect
the sort of scene,

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.710
or the way Basque-Americans
approach, and --

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.440
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: I don't know,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.970
for me I feel like we're not
really part of that at all.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.360
I mean I've never really felt

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.470
that that's affected what
we do, or how we say things.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.770
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And I think

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.070
that that's -- I would
agree with that.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.050
I think that's primarily because
the communities that we're from,

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.070
they were on the -- mostly all from
the French side, on [inaudible].

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.080
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And they came
because they came from big families

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.380
and the oldest child
got the house --

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah [laughs].

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.980
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And the
rest had to fend for themselves.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.580
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: So
they didn't come to the west.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.930
They didn't come really --
they came for economic reasons,

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.170
like other immigrants; they didn't
come for political reasons, so --

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.410
and what has happened in
Nevada and California,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.450
and in -- I'm forgetting a state.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Idaho?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.050
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
No, Idaho's not --

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.890
but for Nevada and California,
it's been mostly immigrants

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.090
from the northern side,
from the French side --

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.690
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And
really close to the French border

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.860
on Spanish like my family.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.370
And they -- their Lingua
Franca became Basque [laughs].

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.230
Because they either came
to be French and Basque --

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.530
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:26.830
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Or Spanish
and Basque, but not English,

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.130
and not the other language.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.030
And so what's been interesting
is in a lot of places, they --

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.330 position:56%
in some cases I think some of the --

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.240
even the immigrants spoke
more Basque once they got here

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.540
than they had at home.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.800 position:56%
Because when they were at home there
weren't schools in their language,

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.400
or they had -- they were more used
to speaking French or Spanish.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.480 position:56%
But when they got here, the language
they had in common was Basque.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.780
Which is very interesting.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That
is very interesting, yeah.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.380
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.680
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
I've known people

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.980
to actually learn Basque in Chino.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.280
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.580
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: And from the
Spanish side they weren't able

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.880
to speak Basque --

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.480
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
During the time of Franco.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.780
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.080
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: And
they came to California

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.380
and they learned it,
so it's [laughs].

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That's great [laughs].

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.980
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
There are cases like that.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.580
So how is the language culture of
Basque doing, both in California

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.880
and back in the home country?

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.180
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Well, I mean it's --

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.820
there have been efforts
on -- mostly on --

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.450
in three of the four
provinces on the Spanish side,

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.750
and Mikel can speak to that --

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.350
Sure.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.650
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Since 1982 I think, where --

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.950
after Franco died [laughs] --

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.550
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
And Democracy came back.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.850
So had to wait a long
time for that to happen.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.120 position:56%
So even under Franco's regime, there
were clandestine Basque schools.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.630
And then once he died in 1975
-- after a very long time --

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.650
and Democracy returned, there --

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.540 position:56%
some communities were allowed to
use their language in the schools --

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.300
in public -- for free,
for public schools.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.180
So that's helped a lot in
parts of the Basque country,

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.740 position:56%
because you know, for the first time
-- for first time in a long time,

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.710
people could speak it publicly
and there was support for that.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.150
So if you wanted to send your
child to a Basque school for free,

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.820
you could do that from
the age three on.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.610
So there's a lot more people who
can speak Basque in those regions

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.880
than previously, so I think --
I've heard anywhere between --

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.860
like the total number
of between 750,000

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.160
to a million people worldwide.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.760
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: So
that sounds pretty good.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.060
And it's better than it was,
but the problem is, you know,

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.310
we're not out of the woods
yet, because most people

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.420
who speak Basque speak
something else most of the time.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.020
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
They speak Spanish or --

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.320
mostly Spanish or French.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.620
It's not taught so much
in the homes anymore.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.920
The people are learning
it at school.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.220
And we know how that is to
learn a language at school,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.520
you're like, eh, what is this for?

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.120
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: And so
there's still a lot of issues

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.710
with the language in terms
of -- I mean it's still --

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.920
it's better institutionally than it
was, but it's still not as strong

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.280 position:56%
as Spanish and French in terms of
where it is located institutionally.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.700
So -- so there's that.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.510
And in the -- in Basque-America,
I mean I think we're typical

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:36.770
of other immigrant communities
where, you know, maybe I would say,

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.520
perhaps of Cathy and
our generation --

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.910
the daughters and sons
of immigrants,

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.450
maybe 1 in 3 learned Basque?

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.050
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
You know, which is --

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.350 position:56%
you know, so I'm one of those three.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:48.950
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: But that was
just because who my parents were.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.250
But by the second generation, it's
-- very, very few people know it.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.550
Because by that point
-- so if it's people

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.390
of my generation, English
is still better.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.100
And then, you know, even if
both speak Basque and English,

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.400
English is their language together.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.700
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hm.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.000
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Just
like in the -- so that's --

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.080 position:56%
their normal language is English,
and then their language of education

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.380
and profession is English.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.230 position:56%
And it's -- there aren't schools, so
it's possible, but it's difficult.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.940
I think people have a lot of
affection for the language,

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.020
and they like to sing along to
words that they may not even know.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.850
But there's not been institutional
support that you would have

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.580
in some other languages I think.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So I guess
you guys have a mission [laughs].

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.670
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: We do.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:20.970
&gt;&gt; Andréa Bidart: We do.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Got work to do.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's great.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.870
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: We do -- and
a lot of what we've been working

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.490
on too is just -- just I think we
have to give ourselves a break.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.820
You know, the best way to be a
Basque speaker in California is

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.120
to be born to my parents [laughs].

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.420
Because it has nothing to do

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.680 position:56%
with me [laughs] it was a completely
normal thing for them to do.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.520
So I think often people get blamed
for not passing on a language --

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.120
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Even though
there were good reasons for it.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.690
They were told not to, or it was
illegal or dangerous, or both.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.630
And I think -- and then sometimes
later on people are like,

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.930
"Oh why didn't you
teach me this language?"

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.230
"Well, because at the time,

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.530
there were good reasons
why we didn't teach you.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.740
We thought you were doing --
we were doing the right thing."

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.710
So -- and I think that sometimes
people will give people a hard time

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.570
for not having made
-- and often women --

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.930
like the mother, they're like,
"Well you should've done this mom."

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.330
[Background laughter] and it's not
-- you know, it's not very nice.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, leave aside
the shame and blame, and just --

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.560
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Exactly.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.860
"Oh yeah, so I should have
anticipated 30 years ago -- "

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
just -- just learn it.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.460
Yeah [laughs].

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.760
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
That you would've wanted

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.060
to speak this language, thanks.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.360
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Well, my bad [laughs].

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.660
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Yeah, sorry [laughs].

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.960
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans:
Yeah, maybe next time.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, I think
song and music is a great way

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.560
into any language culture.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.860
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria: Yeah.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.160
Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So I think you
guys are doing the right thing.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.760
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Well hopefully.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.060
We like it anyway.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.360
Yeah.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well I'm going
to ask Mikel a few questions,

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.960
and because of the language issue,
I'm going to ask those in French,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.750
and I'll provide a translation
of course for our video.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.050
So --

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Parlons un
peu des traditions populaires des

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.200
Basques dans le pays
Basque lui-même.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:47.080 position:56%
Est-ce-qu'il y a beaucoup de gens
qui jouent la musique traditionelle?

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:55.220
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Oui, il y a.
Nous avons eu beaucoup de gens

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.990
comme...Alan Lomax, no?

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.710
Qui a pris des vieux chansons.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.050
Et nous étions aux années 60,

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.910
un groupe très intéressant...parce
que, dans la partie Espagnole,

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:15.880
il y avait un dictatuer,
comme vous a dit Begoña,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.760
et la langage était interdit.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.960
Et dans les 60, il est un peu de...

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.260
[Basque language spoken]

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.560
&gt;&gt; Begoña Echeverria:
Yeah research --

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.860
&gt;&gt; Cathy Petrissans: Research.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.160
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Yes.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.460
&gt;&gt; Mikel Markez: Il y avait
un groupe qui s'appelle

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.860
"Ez dok amairu."

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:38.030
Ils sont des chanteurs, qui ont
fait des nouvelles chansons,

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.750
qui ont fait des expérimentations,

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:46.410
mais qui ont pris des vielles
chansons traditionelles,

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:56.060
et des romans vieux, et qui les
ont chantées et ont popularisé

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.360
ces chansons.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.420
Et tout le monde qui nous sommes
venus apres, tous les chanteurs,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:08.420
tous les gens culturels, nous avons
apris que c'est très intéressant

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.160
ce que des autres ont fait avant,

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.380
pour faire nous qui a
de raiz, avec la terre.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:23.770
C'est pour ça je pense que nous
avons eu un bon école avec ce

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.490
groupe qui est notre premier
réference culturel grand après,

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.530
un peu de le dictateur.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:37.360
Et je pense que c'est pour ça que
la culture traditionelle a beaucoup

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.260
de force au Pays Basque.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:47.000
Mais il y a une chose que je veux
dire de les chansons vielles et la

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.670
culture populaire ici
dans les États-Unis.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:55.660
C'est vrai que nous
avons fait un travail,

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.350
et que des autres ont
fait un travail,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.350
pour les chansons traditionelles.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:12.090
Mais c'est vrai aussi que, comme la
culture au pays Basque est vivant,

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:18.700
il y a des nouveaux chansons,
il y a des nouveaux verses,

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:25.560
il y a des nouveaux...des
nouveaux influences du monde.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:33.970
Et les choses vieux,
quelque fois, ils sont...

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.270
[mot Basque]

moi, des paroles et des musiques.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.500
D'autre fois, je fais des musiques
pour des paroles qui ont fait

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.800
d'autres poètes ou
d'autres écrivains.

is a song that is archived here,

that is sung by -- and is a group --
an all-male group in the French side

in the 40s, that we sang in
our first CD, the three of us.

And it was only after we
recorded it, that we realized

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.400
that there's a lot
of Noka in the song.

And this song that he wrote,
it's -- uses a lot of Noka.

And it's called, "The
Party for Women",
