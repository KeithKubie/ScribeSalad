I think he was a really good Bruce Wayne
captured the fact that Batman does not

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220
captured the fact that Batman does not
 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.670
captured the fact that Batman does not
know how to be Bruce Wayne as the people

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680
know how to be Bruce Wayne as the people

seized him that's his mask he is Batman

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229
seized him that's his mask he is Batman
 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:26.439
seized him that's his mask he is Batman
and Bruce Wayne is his alter ego yeah

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:26.449
and Bruce Wayne is his alter ego yeah
 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:27.939
and Bruce Wayne is his alter ego yeah
and I think that he really captured that

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949
and I think that he really captured that
 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.469
and I think that he really captured that
because he was a little awkward in it he

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479
because he was a little awkward in it he
 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:32.589
because he was a little awkward in it he
just never felt natural in like being

just never felt natural in like being
 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.149
just never felt natural in like being
Bruce Wayne and then when he puts on the

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:34.159
Bruce Wayne and then when he puts on the
 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.620
Bruce Wayne and then when he puts on the
Batman suit obviously he's naturally so

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630
Batman suit obviously he's naturally so
 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.909
Batman suit obviously he's naturally so
he wants to be and all that stuff

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919
he wants to be and all that stuff
 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:38.589
he wants to be and all that stuff
and so I think he really captured Bruce

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599
and so I think he really captured Bruce
 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.689
