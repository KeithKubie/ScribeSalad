00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.430
So I'll tell you ahead of
time, this problem is no joke.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.381
But if we do it step by step,
it's actually not too bad.

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.630
But it's not an easy problem,
so don't get discouraged

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.570
if you kind of don't
even know where

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.580
to start on this
one right over here.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.910
So let p of x equal
24x to the 24th plus

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.940
the sum from j equals 1 to
23 of 24 minus j times x

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.280
to the 24th minus j plus
x to the 24th plus j.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.670
Let z1, z2, all the way
to zr be the distinct 0's

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.090
of p of x-- fair enough.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.910
Let z sub k squared
equal a sub k plus b

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.250
sub ki for k equals 1 through r.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.960
So there's z sub k
or-- I guess, they're

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.640
saying a sub k plus
b sub ki is going

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.790
to be the square of
each of these roots.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.774
So let's see, for k
is equal 1 through r

00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:49.690
where i is equal to
square root of negative 1.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.520
We know that.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.950
And a sub k and b sub
k are real numbers.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.500
Let the sum from k equal 1 to
r of the absolute value of b

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.450
sub k equal this
number over here

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.560
where m, n, and p
are integers and p

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.510
is not divisible by the
square of any prime.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.884
So they're saying
that we've just

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:07.880
simplified the radicals
as much as possible.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.270
Find m plus n plus p.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.220
So this sum right
here, this is the sum

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.350
of the absolute value
of the imaginary parts

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.330
of the square of the roots.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.340
Right? b sub k is the imaginary
part of the square of root k,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.700
I guess you could call it.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.500
And so what we're going to
do is take the absolute value

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
of the imaginary part of
the square of the roots

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.596
and sum them up.

00:01:31.596 --> 00:01:33.970
So before we even think about
how to do that, let's just,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.400
I don't know, let's
just try to visualize

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.550
this polynomial a little better.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.925
In fact, I have
a feeling this is

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:40.170
going to take us
multiple videos to do.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.520
So we have p of x
is equal to-- well,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.060
the first term here is just 24.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.970
Well, it's not the
first term, it's

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.330
the first term as
the way it's written.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.704
The first term
could be anything.

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:50.870
24x to the 24th.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.040
And now, let's write
out this over here.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.730
So if we set j equal
to 1, what do we get?

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:07.810
We get 23 times x to
the 23 plus x to the 25.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.570
This is 24 plus j.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.654
And then when j is
equal to 2-- I'll

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:15.070
just go down in a
big column here.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.240
When j is equal to 2, we
have plus 22, x to the 22

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.912
plus x to the 26th.

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:23.120
And then we could keep going.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.260
Plus-- well, you get
the general idea.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.656
This term over here,
the coefficients

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:29.530
are going to go down.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.290
So is this exponent, but
this exponent over here

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.110
is going to go up.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.960
So then we can keep
adding all the way-- let's

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.810
go to j equal 22.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.200
So when j is equal to
22, 24 minus 22 is 2.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.810
It's going to be 2, x
squared-- 22 plus 24

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.440
is 46-- so plus x to the 46th.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.430
Did I do that right?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.820
22, 46.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.952
And then, this last term over
here, when j is equal to 23,

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:00.410
because that's
where we stop, we're

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.860
going to get 1 times
x plus x to the 47th.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.080
So that's our polynomial.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.538
What I want to do
is I'm just going

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:11.740
to rewrite this in
kind of the way we're

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.377
used to seeing polynomials, and
that's start with the highest

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:16.210
degree term and then
you go down from there.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.730
So we can write p of x as
being equal to-- what's

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.470
the highest degree term here?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.440
Well, we have an x to the 47th
over here, right over here--

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.096
x to the 47th.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:33.470
And then the coefficient here
is 1, if you distribute it.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.990
So it's going to be x to the
47th plus this term over here,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.800
2x to the 46th.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.730
I'm just distributing
this multiplying factor,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.220
or this, I guess,
its coefficient--

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.800
it's going to be 2x squared
plus 2x to the 46th.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.550
And then we're just going
to keep going all the way up

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.870
to 22x to the 26th.

00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:01.100
So you see what's happening?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.190
The coefficient is
increasing by 1 each time,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.410
and the exponent
is decreasing by 1.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.290
Plus 23x to the 25th.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.300
And then the next degree, we
don't have a x to the 24th

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.480
here, but we have the x
to the 24th right there.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.519
So it seems almost by
design for the problem

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.990
that they stuck it there.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.170
So plus 24x to the 24th.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.920
And now we can do all
of these terms here.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:36.680
So we have plus 23x to the
23rd, plus 22x to the 22nd,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.050
and then we go all the way
down to plus 2x squared plus x.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.430
So this is just another way
that, at least in my brain,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.820
simplifies this
polynomial a good bit.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.260
We now have a good sense
of what's happening here.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.090
It's really all of the powers
of x up to the 47th power.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.590
And then the
coefficients start at 1

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.470
and they keep
increasing up to 24,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.661
then they start
decreasing again.

00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:03.910
Now, we're interested in the
roots of this polynomial.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.490
And there's one root
that's pretty easy to find.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.080
We can just factor
an x out of this.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.260
Every term here
is divisible by x.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:20.180
So we can rewrite p of x is
equal to x times x to the 46th

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.240
plus 2x to the 45th-- I'm
just dividing all of these

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.590
by x or factoring out an
x-- plus all the way to 22x

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.710
to the 25th plus 23x
to the 24-- and then we

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.304
have the one in magenta--
plus 24x to the 23rd--

00:05:41.304 --> 00:05:42.970
and then we have all
of these characters

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.880
down here-- so then
we have, plus 23x

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:55.500
to the 22nd plus 22x to the
21 all the way to 2x plus 1.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.960
Now x equals 0 is
clearly a root--

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.316
or if you set p of x equals
0, x equals 0 is a root.

00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:01.940
It's actually not
going to matter much,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.280
because it has no
imaginary part.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.650
So if you take 0-- one of the
roots here is 0, you square 0,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.420
it's not going to have
an imaginary part.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.390
So the absolute value
of its imaginary part

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.070
is not going to contribute
to this sum over here,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.340
but maybe it simplifies this.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.320
So we really care about the
sum of the roots other than 0.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.730
So we care about sum of the
roots of everything else, all

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.670
the stuff in parentheses.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.850
And this part, I
guess the next step,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.399
it might not be obvious to
you, but once you see it--

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:30.690
once you see the pattern, I
guess if you ever see again

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.060
in your life, maybe in some
of these AMI type problems

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.050
or competition problems-- you
should be able to recognize it,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.680
because it's an easy
pattern recognize.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.180
It's just not
something you normally

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.840
see in your everyday curriculum.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.630
And so what I want to do
to see the pattern here

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.750
is think about what happens when
we square different polynomial.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.057
So if we square where all
of the coefficients are 1.

00:06:51.057 --> 00:06:52.640
They don't all have
to be 1, but it'll

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.391
help us see the pattern there.

00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:56.390
The pattern will obviously
be slightly different

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.130
if the coefficients
are different.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:04.230
Now, if I just take x
plus 1-- x plus 1 squared

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.270
is x squared plus 2x plus 1.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.200
We've seen that multiple times.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.492
Now what is x squared
plus x plus 1 squared?

00:07:15.492 --> 00:07:16.950
So all I'm doing
is I'm just taking

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.680
all of the powers of
x and summing them up.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.459
Well, it's going to be-- well,
we've done enough practice

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:24.375
for this, and if you're
watching this problem,

00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:25.470
you know how to do this.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.500
It's going to be x
squared times x squared.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.080
So it's going to be x to the
fourth plus x squared times x,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.290
which is going to be x to the
third, plus x squared times 1,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.420
which is going to be x squared,
plus x times x squared,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.630
which is going to
be x to the third,

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.240
plus x times x, which is
going to be x squared,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.310
plus x times 1, which
is going to be x.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.196
And then finally, it's
going to be 1 times

00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:53.570
all of this stuff,
which is going

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:58.864
to be plus x squared
plus x plus 1.

00:07:58.864 --> 00:08:00.280
And so if you take
the sum, you're

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.290
going to get x to
the fourth plus 2x

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:10.700
to the third plus 3x
squared plus 2x plus 1.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.000
And so you might already
see a pattern emerging.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.020
What happened over here when
you just took x plus 1 squared?

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.130
You started with a 1,
you went up to a 2,

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.440
and then you went back to a 1.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.690
So not clear that
you have a pattern,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.273
but it seems to have this-- the
coefficients increase and then

00:08:24.273 --> 00:08:25.000
decrease.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.990
What happens when you
took this thing squared?

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.040
You started with a 1,
then the coefficients

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.929
went 1, 2, 3, the
middle term, the 3,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:37.090
peaked out at the
middle term, and then

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.100
you start going down
in coefficient again.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.039
1, 2, 3, and then 2, 1.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.539
And you can actually
prove that this

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:43.830
is the case for any polynomial.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.117
So I could just write out--
I won't multiply it out.

00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:47.450
If you have time, you can do it.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.360
But if I were to take
x to the third plus

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.700
x squared plus x plus 1.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.220
If I were to square this,
just based on the pattern--

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.924
you could do it on
paper if you like.

00:09:00.924 --> 00:09:02.340
You hopefully know
how to multiply

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.890
this type of polynomial.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.880
There are videos on
it, if you don't.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.402
This is going to be equal
to-- the highest degree

00:09:08.402 --> 00:09:09.860
term is going to
be x to the sixth.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.760
So it's going to be 1x to the
sixth plus 2x to the fifth plus

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.190
3x to the fourth
plus-- and we have

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.660
to be careful-- the middle term.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.220
So this right here
is going to have--

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.830
you're going to have
each of these terms times

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.740
all-- So the last term is going
to be-- so you're going to have

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.740
x to fourth-- Let me not
write the coefficients.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.060
You're going to have x to the
fourth plus something times x

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.960
to the third plus something
times x squared plus something

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.465
times x plus 1.

00:09:41.465 --> 00:09:45.134
So you're going to have
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 terms.

00:09:45.134 --> 00:09:47.300
The middle term is going
to be this right over here.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.270
So that's where we peak
out our coefficients,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.950
and then they go
back down again.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.450
3, 2, oh, sorry.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:10:00.639
It should be 3, whoops, 4x, then
3, then 2, and then 1 again.

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:02.430
And you can multiply
this out for yourself,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.760
but I think you now
see the pattern.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.260
So when you look
at this thing here,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.300
where the coefficients
are just going from 1,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.620
2, all the way to 24
is where they peak out.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.810
And notice they peaked
out-- the middle term

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.720
where you're peaking
out-- in this case

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.612
is, really, the highest.

00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:20.820
So we're peaking out here
at the x to the third term,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.750
and this was a third
degree polynomial

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.140
that we were squaring.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.090
Over here, we peaked out
at the x squared term,

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.960
and this was a second degree
polynomial we were squaring.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.100
Here we peak out at the x term,
and this was a first degree

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.670
polynomial we're squaring.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.460
This is the exact same
pattern, but we peak out

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.663
at x to the 23rd.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.220
So using the same pattern--
and you can actually

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.470
prove it for the general case.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.610
It just gets messy, and I think
you get the general gist of it.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.040
This thing over here-- and
this is what I talked about,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.665
it's not the easiest
thing in the world

00:10:53.665 --> 00:10:57.090
to recognize-- p of x can
be rewritten as equal to x

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.070
times-- this thing
over here is x

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:06.020
to the 23rd-- x to the 23rd
plus x to the 22nd plus x

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:13.000
to the 21st all the way down
to plus x to the third plus

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.670
x squared plus x plus 1 squared.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.040
And we know that-- the only
way you'd really know that

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.962
is if you've seen
this pattern before.

00:11:25.962 --> 00:11:27.170
But that's the way you do it.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.460
You look at-- this is a pattern.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.320
The coefficients just
keep increasing to 24,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.610
then keep decreasing.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.230
That's going to be whatever
the coefficient of the highest

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.940
degree over here.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.950
So it's x to 23.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.698
And it's going to
be x to 23 plus all

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.198
of the powers of x less than
that all the way down to x to 0

00:11:40.198 --> 00:11:41.054
squared.

00:11:41.054 --> 00:11:42.970
And we saw the pattern
here a couple of times.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.740
I'm going to leave
you in this video.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.490
This simplifies it a
good bit, but there's

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.347
going to be a few more
kind of aha moments

00:11:49.347 --> 00:11:50.930
that we're going to
have to have to be

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.898
able to solve this problem.
