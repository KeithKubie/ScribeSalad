JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello
and welcome to

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.650
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.240
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.380
We will talk about getting a
deal on a movie ticket with

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.960
Dealflicks.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.290
So let me introduce
our guests.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.230
I have Zach and Steven
today in the studio.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.940
How are doing guys?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.250
ZACHARY CANCIO: Pretty good.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.482
How are you?

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:22.150
STEVEN NGUYEN: Good.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Doing good.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.270
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.070
I work in YouTube developer
relations.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.760
And I understand you guys are
based out in San Francisco.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.190
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yep, we're
just in the Mission area.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.730
Cool.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.520
Well thank you for coming down
here to Mountain View.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.226
ZACHARY CANCIO: Not a problem.

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:35.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So tell us
a little bit more about

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.980
what you guys do.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.360
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, Dealflicks
is a Priceline for

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.940
movie tickets.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.660
So essentially, you come to our
website dealflicks.com,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.840
find a theater near you, find
the movies that are playing

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.356
there that we have, and find
a deal up to 60% off.

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:47.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.090
So how did you guys come
up with the idea?

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.060
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, so Sean
really started this idea when

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.630
he was graduating
from Berkeley.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.970
He was going to see "The King's
Speech." And it was a

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.840
pretty awesome movie, but it
was like 10 people in this

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.650
room of 400 seats.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.560
So he's like, ahh there's
got be something to do--

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.750
it was economic background.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.810
And he's like, we should be
able to do a Priceline fro

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.430
movie tickets.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.220
And that's how Dealflicks
started.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.110
I heard that your founders
actually ended up seeping in a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.420
van at some point in the
beginning of the company.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.910
Its that true?

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.300
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, it's
actually more recently they're

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.930
still kind of sleeping
in this van.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.540
So Kevin and Evan--

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.360
our two founders, who want
do the theater sales.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.670
So they go to these conventions
around the country

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.630
meet these theaters and
basically spend time around

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.230
there trying to mop up
all the different

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.195
videos we can for you.

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:33.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.810
So this is what it takes
nowadays to start a company?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.030
You've got to sleep
in your car?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.690
ZACHARY CANCIO: I think so.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.600
I think it's the new garage.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.920
Yeah.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good one.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.160
All right.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.700
Well, so why don't you show
us a little demo.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.940
How does your product work?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.100
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah
sounds good.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.590
So you can go to our site
dealflicks.com.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.860
You can check out a movie
in San Francisco.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.400
We're going to look at "The
Internship." I heard this is

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.710
about a pretty cool company.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.606
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That is true.

00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:57.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.780
ZACHARY CANCIO: Ah, so yeah.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.320
We got Rotten Tomato
scores here.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.990
We can show you a little blurb
about the movie, show you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.070
different show times.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.690
And the cool thing is you can
watch a trailer right

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.320
from the home page.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.830
So here's a little "Internship"
preview.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.190
Hopefully after this
point, you really

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.210
want to see the movie.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.150
And you just click out, hit
the go button like I am.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.950
And here you go.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.860
You can see at this show
time, we have a deal

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.510
for $7.80, 25% off.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.940
I want to see it tonight, so
I'll pick the 7:30 showing,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.390
choose a couple tickets,
hit Buy Now.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.140
And that's it.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.390
I'm on the confirmation page.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.020
I could put in a little
coupon code--

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.320
YouTube live.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, wow.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.070
Is that a secret coupon code?

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.970
ZACHARY CANCIO: Just
for you guys.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.000
Just for you guys.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.050
ZACHARY CANCIO: $5 discount--
put in my credit card.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.420
And that's it-- pretty much
good to go after that.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.630
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.320
So if you're watching live
right now, we can use the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.730
coupon code.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.460
ZACHARY CANCIO: Oh, yeah.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.010
Yeah.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.720
You can use it after this too.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.380
So you guys have a
web application.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.900
I understand you also
have a mobile app.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.270
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah yeah.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.735
Steven here can demo you.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:56.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.230
Let's take a look.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.560
STEVEN NGUYEN: So with our
Android app, we implemented

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.790
the sign with Google feature.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.190
So I will go and sign in.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.350
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you're
signing in with Google+.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.265
STEVEN NGUYEN: Yeah, sign
in with Google+.

00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:07.515
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.160
So while Steven is setting it
up, so tell me a little more

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.470
about the Android app, like
what's the capabilities and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.570
what you guys implemented.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.080
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, so it's
a completely native app.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.260
We really try to streamline
the process.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.270
So you just find your
theater, pick your

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.740
movie, pick your deals.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.690
So we've integrated YouTube,
though, the YouTube native

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.590
player, so basically allow you
watch the trailer without

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.870
having to leave the app and
avoid having to come back and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.070
find where you are too.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.490
So that was really cool.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.640
The SDK was really simple
to integrate.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.440
And then pretty much
after that, it's--

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.560
I hope it's as easy
as it can be.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I see
Steven signed in successfully.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.805
So should we switch to the
app and see what it does?

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:56.310
ZACHARY CANCIO: Sounds good.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.450
STEVEN NGUYEN: Sounds good.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.900
So from here, I can go to the
same movie that Zach just

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.740
showed you guys.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.950
So I go to "The Internship," and
from here, we can look all

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.700
the information of the
movie and look at the

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.850
Rotten Tomato score.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.956
And we can watch the trailer.

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:16.150
ZACHARY CANCIO: Pretty nice.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.060
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.740
So this is using the YouTube
Android player API?

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.034
ZACHARY CANCIO: Exactly.

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:20.329
STEVEN NGUYEN: Yes.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.450
ZACHARY CANCIO: Exactly.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.500
STEVEN NGUYEN: So let
me pick a ticket.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.030
And I can check out using the
same coupon code YouTube.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.810
ZACHARY CANCIO: The
secret deal.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.296
The secret deal is
just for today.

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:35.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.554
The password is--

00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:39.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Nice.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.460
STEVEN NGUYEN: So here, after
that, I can just enter my

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.540
credit card number
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Uh huh.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.130
Great.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.310
And then you get an email?

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.390
Or how you actually--

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.710
what do you do in the theater?

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.510
ZACHARY CANCIO: So at the
theater-- you'll get an email.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.110
You can show that email
voucer to them.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.360
It has a confirmation code.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.620
And then you can also show
that on your device.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.260
So within--

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, I see.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.800
ZACHARY CANCIO: You can go
back to your purchases.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.170
I think you have a
couple purchases.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.022
STEVEN NGUYEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:06.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Not
on this account.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.740
ZACHARY CANCIO: Not
on this account.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.830
But yeah, you can just show your
purchase on your phone.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.810
And then that's it.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.430
The theater has a back-end
system where they

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.840
reconcile the deal.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.350
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.980
Cool.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.870
So tell me a little bit more
about your implementation,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.450
maybe starting with your
web application.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.880
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.200
Yeah.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.070
So we run--

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.490
we program in Python.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.770
We're using the Tornado
framework.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.650
It's just a really simple system
that I like, really

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.440
bare bones, allows me
to write the SQL

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.040
ourselves if we need to.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.060
And that's it.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.560
We created basic rest API that
all our apps talk to.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.130
And that's what you've seen on
iOS and on the Android device.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.080
And we have some hook-ins,
like Facebook--

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.490
or Google+ really is what we've
been focusing on lately.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.550
So you saw Steven signed
in with Google+

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.600
on the Android device.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.490
And that takes advantage of the
activities that Google+

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.540
has and the interactive posts
that Google+ has too.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah one
feature that I saw, maybe

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.120
switching to the mobile app,
is the ability to actually

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.800
petition a theater, if it's
not available in your

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.290
neighborhood.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.480
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.860
Yeah.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.335
So we've been working really
hard-- obviously, Kevin and

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:12.330
Evan driving this van
around the country.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.840
We're trying to get more
theaters every day.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.980
We're in about 200
locations now.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.750
But we're not everywhere.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.230
So what you can do, if your on
our app, you can click Can't

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.170
Find Your Theater poster.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.740
Sean's pretty face
will be there.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.210
And then we'll give you
a list of all the

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.710
theaters around you.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.240
And you can petition for them.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.980
Basically, what a petition
means is--

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.175
I'm going to say and Google+
that I want this theater.

00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:34.900
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And that's
an interactive post?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.580
ZACHARY CANCIO: Exactly.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.570
Yeah.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.380
And then--

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.765
so talking about the mobile
application-- so how did you

00:06:40.765 --> 00:06:43.700
guys implement that?

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.130
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, so
it's a native app.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.830
We use a lot of standard third
party widgets, like the action

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.680
bar Sherlock I think is
one of them that's

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.300
really cool to use.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.050
The Grids is another thing
that really was

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.160
helpful in our layout.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.940
Is there anything else that
you can think of, Steven?

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.410
STEVEN NGUYEN: We use some
SDK for RESTful API.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.710
And we are going to use--

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.330
I think we are looking
into Volley.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.290
So that comunicates with
your Python back-end.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.625
ZACHARY CANCIO: Exactly.

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:14.736
STEVEN NGUYEN: Yes.

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:14.960
Uh huh.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.370
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.550
And then you're using the
YouTube Android player API for

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.440
video playback.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.090
What about the video itself,
like how you guys know which

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.710
trailer to play?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.960
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, it's
a little bit of a manual

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.150
process right now.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.430
STEVEN NGUYEN: Old school.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.820
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, we're
pretty old school when it

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.730
comes to that.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.830
We're not used to grunt work.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.870
So yeah, when we
sign up with--

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.890
sorry, when we get showtimes for
a theater, we'll have to

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.510
pick the movie out.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.260
And then we'll put in that
YouTube trailer ID.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Got it.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.300
Yeah.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.200
We have to scour YouTube.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.590
Unfortunately, no data
API integrations yet.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah yeah.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.280
For those of you watching, you
can actually do that look-up

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.750
using our Data API, so you
can look for trailers.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.700
So I recommend using that.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.890
As you guys grow, it may become
increasingly more

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.260
difficult to actually
stay on top of that.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.960
ZACHARY CANCIO: Definitely.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then, we
were chatting earlier today

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.250
about some of the capabilities
that Data API might give you

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.990
the [? VGC ?]

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.210
area, like shell-casing, some
user generated content.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.630
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah,
I'm pretty

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.960
excited by that actually.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.960
So have you guys looked into
the Data API [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960
yet?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.615
ZACHARY CANCIO: Not yet.

00:08:08.615 --> 00:08:09.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.338
So that's something that maybe
you can do later today.

00:08:12.338 --> 00:08:13.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.260
And then one question that I
always ask my guests here is

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.540
did you guys run into anything
unexpected, like things that

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.040
you didn't expect and learned
while developing the

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.970
application, whether they
technical issues or business

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.210
challenges, like anything you
would be willing to share with

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.150
our audience?

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.610
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah, I think,
from start to prospective,

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.520
trying to figure out the right
product to sell was a

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.700
challenge for us in
the beginning.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.610
So two years ago, when Sean
came up with this idea.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.010
It was very much an opaque
model, similar to Hotwire,

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.790
where you could pick a movie,
and we'd tell you one of two

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.620
occasions where this movie
could be playing.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.000
But users really didn't
like that experience.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.340
And so we changed it
to this opaque

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.030
model based on showtime.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.590
And like, OK, we'll play you
this movie at this theater you

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.120
want, and it's a really good
discount, it's even better

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.180
than if we were to tell you
the exact showtime.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.930
But you'd have to be one
of these random two.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.580
And people didn't like either.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.310
So at the day, it's really down
to getting to know the

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.880
exact showtime that you want at
the exact location that you

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.520
want it at.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.910
And the deal doesn't have to
be so high but just enough

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.430
that you're going to use
Dealflicks to get that deal.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Um hm.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.475
Cool.

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:22.760
Cool.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.640
So you guys did some changes
to the business

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.910
model as you went on.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.270
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.370
Yeah.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Anything on
the API front that you guys

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.730
wish we had and we don't?

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.480
ZACHARY CANCIO: I think it's
been requested a lot-- but a

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.575
native iOS experience
[INAUDIBLE] player.

00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:39.030
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
that's true.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.760
So right now, you guys have
iOS up right now.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.600
And what are you guys use
there for playback?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.160
ZACHARY CANCIO: We just
use a UIWebView.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160
STEVEN NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And
the I-Frame embed.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.530
ZACHARY CANCIO: Yeah.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That
is something that

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.670
actually comes up a lot.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:52.650
Cool.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.410
ZACHARY CANCIO: No worries.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:53.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.220
So I'm going to see if we have
any questions from our

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.730
audience real quick here.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.290
I see there's one question
that is relevant.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.650
And I think it's addressed
to me.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.180
Is YouTube Developer
Relations hiring?

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.900
Yes, we are hiring.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.840
To learn more, go to
developers.google.com/jobs

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.280
Well, I think this is it.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.960
Thank you very much
for coming down.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.340
ZACHARY CANCIO: Thanks
for having us

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you for
sharing the super discount

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.460
coupon to our audience.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.940
ZACHARY CANCIO: YouTube live.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I'll book
a movie ticket tonight.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:26.810
ZACHARY CANCIO: Sounds great.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.060
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And for those
of you watching, thank

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.710
you for your time.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.180
And we'll see you again
next week live on

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.920
Wednesdays, 10 AM Pacific.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.170
Bye.
