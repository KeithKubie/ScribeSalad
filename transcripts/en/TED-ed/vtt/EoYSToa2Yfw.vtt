00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:11.433
For most of us, two degrees Celsius
is a tiny difference in temperature,

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:14.360
not even enough to make 
you crack a window.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.657
But scientists have warned that as
CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise,

00:00:18.657 --> 00:00:22.473
an increase in the Earth's temperature
by even this amount

00:00:22.473 --> 00:00:26.190
can lead to catastrophic effects
all over the world.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.926
How can such a small measurable 
change in one factor

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:34.572
lead to massive and unpredictable 
changes in other factors?

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:38.413
The answer lies in the concept of a 
mathematical tipping point,

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:42.346
which we can understand through the
familiar game of billiards.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:44.430
The basic rule of billiard motion is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.312
that a ball will go straight 
until it hits a wall,

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:51.130
then bounce off at an angle equal
to its incoming angle.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.040
For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that
there is no friction,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.953
so balls can keep moving indefinitely.

00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:58.994
And to simplify the situation further,

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:04.062
let's look at what happens with only 
one ball on a perfectly circular table.

00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:07.357
As the ball is struck and begins to move
according to the rules,

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:10.502
it follows a neat star-shaped pattern.

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:12.667
If we start the ball at
different locations,

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:16.418
or strike it at different angles, 
some details of the pattern change,

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:19.685
but its overall form remains the same.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.747
With a few test runs, and some basic
mathematical modeling,

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:26.321
we can even predict a ball's path
before it starts moving,

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.976
simply based on its starting conditions.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:31.374
But what would happen 
if we made a minor change

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:34.625
in the table's shape 
by pulling it apart a bit,

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:39.411
and inserting two small straight edges 
along the top and bottom?

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.057
We can see that as the ball bounces 
off the flat sides,

00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:44.580
it begins to move all over the table.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.025
The ball is still obeying the same rules
of billiard motion,

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:52.943
but the resulting movement no longer
follows any recognizable pattern.

00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:55.300
With only a small change
to the constraints

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.075
under which the system operates,

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.622
we have shifted the billiard motion

00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:01.750
from behaving in a stable
and predictable fashion,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.983
to fluctuating wildly,

00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:08.144
thus creating what mathematicians
call chaotic motion.

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:11.765
Inserting the straight edges into
the table acts as a tipping point,

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:16.098
switching the systems behavior
from one type of behavior (regular),

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:20.200
to another type of behavior (chaotic).

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.249
So what implications does this simple
example have for the much more complicated

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.919
reality of the Earth's climate?

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.530
We can think of the shape of the table as 
being analogous to the CO2 level

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.821
and Earth's average temperature:

00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.117
Constraints that impact the 
system's performance

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:38.893
in the form of the ball's motion 
or the climate's behavior.

00:02:38.893 --> 00:02:41.053
During the past 10,000 years,

00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:44.533
the fairly constant CO2 atmospheric 
concentration of

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:50.594
270 parts per million kept the climate
within a self-stabilizing pattern,

00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:53.505
fairly regular and hospitable 
to human life.

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:57.071
But with CO2 levels now at 400
parts per million,

00:02:57.071 --> 00:03:01.031
and predicted to rise to between
500 and 800 parts per million

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.140
over the coming century,
we may reach a tipping point where

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.736
even a small additional change 
in the global average temperature

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:11.448
would have the same effect as
changing the shape of the table,

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:14.275
leading to a dangerous shift in the
climate's behavior,

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:16.414
with more extreme and intense 
weather events,

00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:21.672
less predictability, and most importantly,
less hospitably to human life.

00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:25.433
The hypothetical models that 
mathematicians study in detail

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:28.165
may not always look like 
actual situations,

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:31.064
but they can provide a framework
and a way of thinking

00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:36.159
that can be applied to help understand the
more complex problems of the real world.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.993
In this case, understanding 
how slight changes

00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:42.415
in the constraints impacting a system
can have massive impacts

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:46.294
gives us a greater appreciation for
predicting the dangers

00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:49.739
that we cannot immediately percieve 
with our own senses.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.599
Because once the results do become visible,
it may already be too late.
