You know, God closes a door
and then he opens a window

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.175
and my window happened
to be a giant,

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:14.047
ethnically ambiguous punk rock
chick with big titties.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.316
Looking like if The Rock
was a Suicide Girl.

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.772
- So I've always been
a very romantic guy.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.808
And then at some point,
something took a turn in me

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.710
and I became very cynical.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.445
It's hard to pinpoint
exactly when that happened,

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:22.815
but if I had to take a wild
guess, I'd say it could be,

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:28.821
uh, July 2, 2006,
at 8:53 in the morning.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.990
That was when my six-year
relationship that was supposed

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.759
to end in marriage instead
ended when I found out

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.328
for the last two of those
six years,

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.063
she was fucking
another dude.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.431
[crowd oohs]

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.733
Yeah. It's weird figuring out

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.235
that someone you're with
is cheating on you.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.304
It's kinda like solving
a murder mystery.

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:48.107
Except you're the victim.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.076
I should have seen it coming.
All the signs were there.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.078
You know, she was distant,
she wasn't returning my phone

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.446
calls as quickly as
she used to,

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.615
her pussy tasted like dick.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.852
[laughter]

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.625
My friends were trying
to cheer me up.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.760
They'd be like, oh,
don't worry,

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.830
at least you'll get
some good material out of it.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.800
All I got was that pussy tastes
like dick joke.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.738
Not worth it.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.642
I was super depressed.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.143
I couldn't stop thinking
about it.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:26.712
I even invented my own
sex move as a way to try

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.447
and get back at her,
kinda like the Donkey Punch

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.850
or the Dirty Sanchez.

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:35.321
I invented my own move.
I called it the Vengeful Louie.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:36.822
And here's how it works.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.324
You find out a girl's cheating
on you,

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:40.059
but you act
like everything's cool, right?

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.827
Then you go in for
the make-up sex, right?

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.296
And then right before
you're about to come,

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.164
you pull out,
then you start crying,

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:47.466
she leaves, and you
never trust anyone ever again.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.469
[laughter]

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:52.705
The Vengeful Louie.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:57.343
No, being cheated on, it really
fucked me up, man.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:58.978
I was completely broken.

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.513
And I thought the only way
I'd ever get better

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.014
would be if I fell in love
again.

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.083
And I didn't think
that was possible.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:05.851
I was in that mindset still
a year later

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:07.553
doing a gig in
Portland, Oregon.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:10.189
And after the show,
I'm looking for a place to eat.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.225
I finally find
one place that's open,

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:17.330
but sitting out front blocking
the door are two gutter punks.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:20.866
All right--one person knows.

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.368
Gutter punks, of course,
they're like, you know,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:26.706
the young, rock and roll
homeless.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.009
Always got all the patches
on their clothes, and the tats,

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:32.011
and the piercings,
looking like a band that went

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:35.048
camping and then got
super lost.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.221
Always got a dog that's somehow
cleaner than all of them.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.025
And as I get close to the door,

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.960
I'm about to walk in, instead
of asking me for change,

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:50.196
they get up,
follow me into the restaurant.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.897
Turns out,
they weren't homeless;

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.734
they were the wait staff.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.235
Yeah, it can be hard to tell
in Portland,

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:57.603
where everyone's dressed like
they're in

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.906
some stage of camping.

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.813
So I go inside and I notice
that the one that's

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.448
helping me out,
she's actually kinda cute.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.117
I'm thinking, oh, I've gotta
say something cool

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.120
to impress
this fine-ass gutter server.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.789
So I'm like, you know, I'm
just travelling through town,

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.324
you know, I'm a stand-up
comedian.

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:19.925
I tour all over the place.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.260
She's like,
oh, that's really cool,

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:22.595
I love to travel too.

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:24.463
I actually used to
hop on trains.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:27.400
I went, that's so funny,
because when I first saw you

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:31.504
I thought you were homeless.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:34.473
Classic pickup line.

00:04:34.506 --> 00:04:36.108
Believe it or not, it worked.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:38.277
I got her number,
and I started talking

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.813
on the phone regularly with
the most uniquely beautiful

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:43.082
woman I've ever met in my life.

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:45.117
You've never
seen anyone like her.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.952
I mean, she was nearly six feet
tall, part black, part white,

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:48.688
part Native American,
part Hawaiian.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.956
So you see her, and you're like
oh, she must be the first

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:54.860
of a new master race
of Amazonian super women.

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:57.664
Or like the world's
largest Filipino.

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.003
Plus, she had all that
gutter punk style.

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:05.971
You know, with the tats
and the piercings.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:07.506
And she had purple hair
and it was shaved on the side

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.308
I'm just like, oh,
this is perfect, you know.

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:11.143
I could totally picture her
defending my honor

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:13.846
as we roam through a
post-apocalyptic wasteland.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.383
It was amazing.
It was as if

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:18.951
the universe was making up
for me being cheated on

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.653
by bringing me
my dream girl.

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:22.655
You know, God closes a door
and then he opens a window

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.390
and my window happened
to be a giant,

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:27.660
ethnically ambiguous punk rock
chick with big titties.

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:30.897
[applause]

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.936
Looking like if The Rock
was a Suicide Girl.

00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:53.018
So we're talking on the phone,
it's that early stage

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.687
of the relationship,
we're just getting to know each

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.589
other and it's like every
new thing I'm learning about

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.557
her is just making me more
and more into her, you know.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.261
I found out she used to do
heroin, so that's interesting.

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:04.063
She was starting to strip.
Like, cool,

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:06.999
we both work in night clubs.

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:09.202
She stabbed a skinhead--
living the dream!

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:15.274
She had a baby. She's totally
down to fuck, awesome!

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:19.278
But between the baby and the
possible manslaughter charge,

00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:23.949
I'm thinking I should
not see her anymore.

00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:26.519
So I fly out to Portland
to see her some more.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:30.055
[scattered applause]

00:06:30.088 --> 00:06:33.526
We meet up, she shows up,
she's already pretty drunk,

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.194
proceeds to get drunker.

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:36.796
We end up sleeping
together but we don't have sex,

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.397
'cause like I said
she's very drunk,

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.267
and also remember,
she's almost six feet tall.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.802
It's very awkward trying
to have sex with someone

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.970
that much bigger than you.

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:48.574
Less of a doggy style,
more of a jockey style.

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:49.575
You know?

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:52.845
[laughter]

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.417
So we wake up in the morning,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.919
she's like, hey,
can you get me a beer?

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.120
I'm like, okay.
I get her a beer

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:02.888
and she chugs the beer.

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:04.423
She's like, could you
get me another beer?

00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:06.292
I'm like, all right.
Get her another beer.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.793
She chugs the beer.
Apparently she was playing some

00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:10.563
kind of one-woman
drinking game.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:13.732
Called alcoholism.

00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:15.968
But after chugging only two
beers, she was pretty sober--

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:17.837
relatively, for her.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.271
And we're having
a great time.

00:07:19.304 --> 00:07:20.506
You know, we're just fooling
around,

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.074
making each other laugh.

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:23.108
She was super funny.
She always called me

00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:24.276
the one of two things.

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.178
She either called me toots,

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.248
like some kind of Waffle House
waitress named Trixie.

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:32.952
Or woman.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:36.288
That's a funny thing
to call a dude.

00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.123
And we're sitting there messing
around in bed,

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:40.025
and I'm
just kissing her all over,

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:41.627
and I keep kissing her,
I'm not even thinking that

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.662
I'm doing it, but I keep
kissing her here and here.

00:07:43.695 --> 00:07:45.331
And at one point she just kinda
nonchalantly just stops me,

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.132
she goes, hey,
why are you doing that?

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:48.934
And I didn't even realize
it until she said it,

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:51.170
but I was kissing her
on these scars

00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.672
she had from where
she tried to kill herself.

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:55.975
[crowd exclaims]

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.382
I was super embarrassed
at the time, you know?

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:05.317
I just revealed so much
about both of us.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.952
We were naked
but all the sudden,

00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.053
it got way more intimate
than either of us

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:09.655
wanted it to be,
you know?

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.323
I mean, there's so many weird
things I could've

00:08:11.356 --> 00:08:12.858
been doing in bed with her

00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.059
that would've been
so much easier

00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:15.728
to explain
why I was doing.

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.229
Like if I was just perched
on the edge of the bed,

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:19.298
just flicking my nut sack.

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.233
Staring at her.
She'd be like,

00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:22.635
why are you doing that?

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.802
Well, let me take you to the

00:08:23.835 --> 00:08:26.038
scrotum flicker's subreddit.

00:08:28.373 --> 00:08:31.177
There's a whole bunch of us.
We're a community.

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:34.513
But I didn't know how
to explain

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:36.081
why I was kissing
her suicide scars

00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:38.517
like some kinda living
Morrissey lyric.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.587
[cheers and applause]

00:08:45.023 --> 00:08:46.525
I guess I could've
tried to explain myself.

00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:48.827
Like, I don't know,
you got daddy issues,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.763
I'm kissing your boo boos.

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:52.097
I've got a savior complex,

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.599
you've got wounds
on your wrists.

00:08:53.632 --> 00:08:55.200
I mean, isn't it obvious?

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.236
This is just my way
of asking you

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:00.072
will you go codependent
with me?

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:05.711
She leaves, and I have this
horrible feeling in my stomach.

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:08.380
And I realize I have
fallen in love again.

00:09:08.413 --> 00:09:10.916
And I knew it was
gonna end badly,

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:12.551
but to me
that was the best part.

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:13.953
You know, shit wasn't gonna
go down like it did

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.287
with the last girl, you know?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.722
My ex had stabbed
me in the back;

00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:18.090
this girl would never do that.

00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:21.460
She'd stab me right
in the face.

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:23.228
And yeah, I knew
it was gonna hurt.

00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:24.630
But after being cheated on,

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:26.398
that's what I thought
love was like.

00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:28.567
It hurt. You know, it wasn't
all bells ringing

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.035
And birds chirping.

00:09:30.068 --> 00:09:31.470
No, that was a fantasy.

00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:32.972
That kind of love
was one of those things

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.640
that only happens
in the movies.

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:37.109
And like wacky food fights.

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:39.946
And double penetration.

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.583
No, this is how
real love felt.

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:46.285
You know what I mean?
It was scary

00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:47.753
it was painful and it was gonna

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:49.154
tear me up from the inside.

00:09:49.187 --> 00:09:51.691
Like double penetration.

00:09:58.997 --> 00:10:01.266
So we--

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:03.102
We keep having this
long-distance relationship.

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:04.903
Seeing each other
on and off again,

00:10:04.936 --> 00:10:06.305
over the course of the year.

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:07.773
I would always love talking
to her,

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:08.941
because whenever
I had a bad day,

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:10.609
she would always cheer me up.

00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:12.277
Like, I remember this one
day I was really struggling

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.515
with this new queef joke
I was working on.

00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:18.250
So I call her up, I'm like,
I really gotta talk to you.

00:10:18.283 --> 00:10:20.319
She's like, I really gotta
talk to you too.

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:22.287
I got evicted
from my apartment,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.091
they fired me from my job,
and they took away my baby.

00:10:26.124 --> 00:10:28.460
I can't even begin to imagine

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:31.964
bringing up the queef joke now.

00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:34.099
That's a lot of problems
for one person to deal with,

00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:35.467
but I'm like, this is not
a problem for me.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.835
I can solve this,
I can save you,

00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:38.604
here's what we're gonna do.

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:40.706
I'm gonna buy you a ticket
from Portland down to L.A.,

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:44.309
you can come stay with me
while we put you in a rehab,

00:10:44.342 --> 00:10:45.944
and I did it right there
and then.

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:47.646
Bought the ticket,
she flew down the next day.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:51.116
Huge mistake.

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:52.818
'Cause it wasn't true.

00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:54.319
She couldn't live with me,

00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:57.723
because I live with my parents.

00:10:57.756 --> 00:11:01.794
Yeah, kind of an unspoken
rule at my folks' place.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:06.165
Don't bring home any
alcoholic stripper hobos

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:09.468
if they're not Jewish.

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:12.538
[applause]

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.843
So now we're holed up
in a seedy motel

00:11:17.876 --> 00:11:20.312
less than a mile
from my parents' nice house.

00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:21.714
I'm constantly paranoid

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.682
my mom's gonna drive by
and see us.

00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:27.419
I'm sneaking her food from
their kitchen, "E.T." style.

00:11:27.452 --> 00:11:33.392
Or "Stranger Things" style,
if you're closer to her age.

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:36.161
And finally,
after about a week,

00:11:36.194 --> 00:11:37.763
I find a rehab that has
room for her.

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.198
We put her in,
and she starts following

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.532
the program and getting better.

00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:42.768
It just felt so great,
you know?

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:45.771
It's like, wow, it's like a
good deed that I can fuck.

00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:54.113
And time passes, I'm not really
hearing from her.

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:56.014
It sounds like she's following
the program and sobering up

00:11:56.047 --> 00:11:57.716
And I'm thinking, wow,
you know, this is amazing.

00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.251
You know, we're not together,
but this is

00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:02.087
the happy ending
I was looking for.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.555
Then I get a call from her.

00:12:03.588 --> 00:12:05.290
She ran away from the rehab

00:12:05.323 --> 00:12:07.793
with a street poet
named Trashcan.

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:14.066
Now she's living on the streets

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.368
and she's back on heroin.

00:12:16.401 --> 00:12:18.237
Yeah, that's the thing
with this girl, you know how

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.572
addicts have to hit rock bottom
before they can quit something?

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.141
She would hit a rock bottom,

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:24.576
and then drill through
that rock bottom

00:12:24.609 --> 00:12:27.913
to find a new deeper,
shittier rock bottom

00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:30.616
like some kind of life fracker.

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:37.122
So now I'm getting random calls
from her while she's homeless.

00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:39.091
At one point,
Trashcan calls me--

00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:42.294
very charming guy,
I get it.

00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:44.263
And I get one
last call from her.

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:48.433
She calls me up.
She says, Trashcan is dead.

00:12:48.466 --> 00:12:51.436
I don't know what to do.
You gotta help me.

00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:53.505
I go, shit, how'd he die?

00:12:53.538 --> 00:12:56.008
She said, he said he would
kill himself if I left him.

00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:59.145
And I did, and he did.

00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:03.949
God damn, Trashcan
is a man of his word.

00:13:03.982 --> 00:13:05.751
I mean, that's the real
romantic, right there.

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.287
How am I supposed to
compete with that?

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.788
There isn't enough
chocolate-covered pineapple

00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:13.959
in the world
for that Edible Arrangement.

00:13:16.528 --> 00:13:17.996
I'm like, look, I don't know
what you want from me,

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:19.264
I already flew you down

00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:20.833
from Portland to Los Angeles,

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:22.634
I struggled and fought to get
you into rehab,

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:24.002
I put you in the rehab,
and still you manage

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:25.671
to fuck it all up.

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:27.005
So why don't you stop
calling me, lose my number.

00:13:27.038 --> 00:13:29.308
And I hang up on her.

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:34.112
So I'm driving to pick her up.

00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:35.981
Decide I'm gonna drive her
to the Greyhound station

00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:39.017
over in Hollywood, get her
a ticket back to Portland.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.352
She can go be
a homeless junkie

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:42.655
where she knows
the bus schedule.

00:13:45.857 --> 00:13:47.993
And we get to the station,
but instead of

00:13:48.026 --> 00:13:49.795
walking
in to buy the ticket with me,

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.563
she decides she's gonna
lie down on the ground

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.365
in the middle of
the parking lot,

00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:55.334
started screaming, crying,
and throwing a fit.

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:57.169
Luckily it is
a Greyhound parking lot,

00:13:57.202 --> 00:14:02.007
so that kinda thing happens,
like, every hour, on the hour.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.909
I'm standing there trying
to reason with this clearly

00:14:03.942 --> 00:14:06.211
unreasonable person,
and as I'm talking to her,

00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:09.548
three older well-dressed white
ladies start coming at me,

00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:12.851
looking like Nick-at-Nite
moms coming from a bake sale.

00:14:12.884 --> 00:14:14.720
I was scared of
my mom catching me,

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:16.855
now I got three moms
and they're coming at us fast.

00:14:16.888 --> 00:14:19.992
And they're asking questions
in a typical mom fashion.

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.026
You know what I mean?

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:22.427
Like, concerned, but also

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.563
a dash of disapproval
on top of there.

00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.531
First I get kinda defensive,

00:14:26.564 --> 00:14:28.567
like, look, can't a man
attempt to abandon a young girl

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.506
in a Greyhound parking
lot without being judged?

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:36.008
But they did seem like
they actually wanted to help.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.209
You know, they were checking
her vitals,

00:14:37.242 --> 00:14:38.710
and making sure

00:14:38.743 --> 00:14:40.545
she stays conscious
and stuff like that.

00:14:40.578 --> 00:14:42.714
So I'm thinking, like,
oh, maybe they're nurses.

00:14:42.747 --> 00:14:44.683
And one of them pulls
me aside and goes like,

00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:46.351
this is really serious,
we've gotta get her

00:14:46.384 --> 00:14:47.753
out of here quick,
because if we don't,

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.521
the psychiatrists
are gonna come

00:14:49.554 --> 00:14:52.257
and they're
gonna pump her full of drugs.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.059
Yeah, I was just worried

00:14:54.092 --> 00:14:55.427
about getting her on the bus,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.628
I didn't know we had
to look out

00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:59.464
for psychiatrist street gangs.

00:14:59.497 --> 00:15:03.235
Whose turf is this?
The Freudian Crypts?

00:15:03.268 --> 00:15:05.671
Or the Young Jungians?

00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.545
Finally I put it together
in my head:

00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:16.415
irrational fear of psychiatry,
we're in Hollywood,

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:18.483
they're not nurses;
they're Scientologists.

00:15:18.516 --> 00:15:22.254
[crowd groans, laughs]

00:15:22.287 --> 00:15:23.956
They didn't come from
a bake sale.

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:27.626
They came from praying
to Xenu the Galactic Overlord.

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:31.563
All praises due upon him,
no disrespect.

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:35.767
[scattered applause]

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.671
Still trying to make it
in show business.

00:15:39.871 --> 00:15:41.640
Then I'm thinking, like,
I don't know.

00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:44.343
Maybe Scientology
would be a good option for her.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.744
If she ever quits heroin,
she'll need

00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:48.480
an equally
time-consuming hobby.

00:15:48.513 --> 00:15:50.983
Maybe Tom Cruise will come
through and save the day.

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:55.454
That's right.
The originator of jockey style.

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:05.464
And then at one point, even
these nice ladies are like,

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:06.932
We don't know what else we can
do for her.

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:08.367
They're like,
we're gonna call 911.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.935
I'm like,
wait, don't do that.

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:11.837
I get down on my knees
and start whispering

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.105
right in her ear, like, saying,
like, look toots,

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:14.306
stop fuckin' around,

00:16:14.339 --> 00:16:15.540
they're gonna call the police.

00:16:15.573 --> 00:16:16.608
I don't want you to go to jail.

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:17.709
Please get up right now.

00:16:17.742 --> 00:16:19.144
And as I'm talking to her,

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:20.979
her head gets heavy in my hand,

00:16:21.012 --> 00:16:23.849
I can't find a pulse, and she
doesn't seem to be breathing.

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.485
So they call 911,
an ambulance comes screaming

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:27.886
into the parking lot.

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:29.888
Somehow they manage
to revive her.

00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:31.523
As soon as she comes to, she
starts kicking and screaming,

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:33.058
freaking out even worse
than before.

00:16:33.091 --> 00:16:35.060
It takes two large EMT guys
to restrain her.

00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:37.162
And they strap her down to
the gurney, and they're pushing

00:16:37.195 --> 00:16:39.131
her to the ambulance,
and there's tears and mascara

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.199
pouring down her face,
and before they close the doors

00:16:41.232 --> 00:16:43.668
I'm like, look toots, please,
just listen to the doctors.

00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:45.203
do what they say,
you'll get better.

00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:48.874
She goes,
I'm never getting better!

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.709
And it just kinda knocks
the wind out of me,

00:16:50.742 --> 00:16:52.477
'cause I realize, you know,
like, maybe she's right.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.979
You know, maybe she's never
getting better

00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:57.682
'cause maybe nobody ever
really gets better.

00:16:57.715 --> 00:17:00.519
You know, I thought if I fixed
her, it would fix me.

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:02.220
But I couldn't do it.

00:17:02.253 --> 00:17:05.190
I wish I could, but
I wish I knew how, I wish there

00:17:05.223 --> 00:17:09.361
was some kind of instruction
manual for fixing people.

00:17:09.394 --> 00:17:11.496
And the ambulance drives off,

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.031
and one of the ladies
comes up to me

00:17:13.064 --> 00:17:15.000
with a kind look in her eyes
and she says,

00:17:15.033 --> 00:17:17.335
have you ever read
"Dianetics"?

00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:20.572
[laughter, applause]

00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:30.215
And that was the moment
I stopped being a romantic.

00:17:30.248 --> 00:17:33.552
[cheers and applause]

00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:36.621
Thank you guys very much.
Good night.
