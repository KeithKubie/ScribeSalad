FEMALE SPEAKER: Today in
partnership with Zagat

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.650
we are privileged to
have Hugh Acheson.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.500
Hugh Acheson is the
chef and partner

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.280
of four restaurants in Georgia,
5 &amp; 10, The National, Empire

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.310
State South, and The Florence.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.730
In 2010 Hugh competed on Bravo's
"Top Chef Masters" season

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.500
three, and he returned to
the hit show as a judge

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380
starting in season nine.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.700
Hugh won the James Beard
award for Best Chef Southeast

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.990
in 2012, and most recently he
released his third cookbook,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.820
"The Broad Fork" which he'll be
showing us a couple of recipes

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.080
from today.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.410
So without further
ado, please join me

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.500
in welcoming Hugh Acheson.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.416
HUGH ACHESON: Bonjour.

00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:45.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.240
HUGH ACHESON: So, I'm Canadian.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.920
Hence is my denim on denim look
today, the Canadian tuxedo.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.370
I am wearing khakis though, so
I didn't complete the outfit.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.870
OK.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.550
We're going to make two things.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.370
Now this book is really
meant to be-- it literally

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.880
came about as an answer to
somebody down the street

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.400
when I was picking up my
CSA box in Athens, Georgia.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.720
On this beautiful historic
street we live on,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.360
walk down in a quintessentially
American moment,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.540
you know, with my two daughters,
our hair flowing in the winds

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.540
and we pick up our
CSA box, because it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.881
supposed to be doing.

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.380
We're supposed to be cooking
from scratch, and its goodness.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.220
And there was this one
annoying professorial guy,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.530
because it's a college town
and they lurk on corners.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.240
And he was like, what the
hell do I do with kohlrabi.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.620
And he'd ask me questions
like this every week

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.890
and I was, like, dude, lay off.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.050
It's just because I'm the mantle
of chefdom in Athens, Georgia.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.000
They come to me and
ask me these questions

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.940
and it was ongoing and nonstop.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.890
But it got me thinking
that nobody actually

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.760
knows what to do with kohlrobi.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.160
And nobody knows what to do
with a lot of vegetables.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.407
Or as Americans, in our
kitchens, we cook like this.

00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:00.990
We cook the things we know, the
things that our parents taught

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.160
us, the things maybe our
grandparents taught us,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.580
the things from our community,
the things from maybe

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.490
our heritage past, and those are
recipes we know and understand.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.999
And we often don't
break them down,

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.790
even though we're
surrounded by great food,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.998
and you guys eat out all
the time and eat great food.

00:02:15.998 --> 00:02:18.210
Rarely do you go out and
actually try and cook

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.967
something new.

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.300
So it's meant to sort of pull
the blinders off, and just

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.112
cook four to five recipes
for one single ingredient.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.570
So it goes through pretty much
the whole list of everything

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.400
I would have gotten in that
CSA box in a full year.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.760
Some of the things you will not
experience, even in California.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.480
Some of them you will
definitely experience.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.480
If we were in Wisconsin
it would be different.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.590
But here we are.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.650
So first we're going to
do a really simple salad

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.780
with purslane, which
is either-- sometimes

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.610
it's farmed and
sometimes is foraged.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.410
But it looks like this,
and it's a succulent.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.850
And it's kind of got a
nice bitter sourness to it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.460
as a green.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.800
And then there's cantaloupe,
and there's prosciutto.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.830
You could use really
good prosciutto de parma,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.515
or you could use whatever fine
deli meats you could find.

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:12.890
In the salad we're going to
make a vinaigrette with that,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.220
but starting off, we're
going to take a sweet onion.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.650
And I've peeled
it, but you can see

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.560
that the core part of where
it was attached to the root,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.157
and then immersed into the
ground and the greens--

00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:27.740
the ground level would be right
here and the greens coming up.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.750
This is where the
actual root stem was.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.530
And that's going to keep it
kind of attached as we cut down.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.180
So I peeled it and
then I'm just going

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.400
to cut down with a
pretty sharp knife,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.850
and kind of keep them
together and that'll just

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.350
aid in the cookery of it.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.810
So we're going to add a little
bit of butter to the pan.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.030
This pans on medium
heat, because,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.220
and I'm going to jack it up
just to sort of medium, medium.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.460
Right now it's four, I'm
going to take it to five.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.010
Sun does not go up to 11,
which is the "Spinal Tap"

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.930
reference for all of
you over 40 in the room.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.470
Then we're going to take these,
and just put them in here

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.740
and it's a sensory thing,
it's a flavor thing,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.930
but it's the best
smell that you'll ever

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.420
have in a kitchen, which is
onions cooking in butter.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.590
So we're going to continue that,
just with a couple more slices.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.650
Again this is-- you want to
work carefully with a knife,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.417
but I know this sounds
contrary to logic,

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:32.250
but you want your knives
to be really sharp,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.710
because the wound
will be a lot cleaner.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.810
HUGH ACHESON: So we're going
to process through some melon

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.549
as that cooks.

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.840
So what we're going to do,
is we're going to take this,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.170
we're going to caramelize pretty
deeply, and for lack of time

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.314
I'm going to raise this
up seven out of ten.

00:04:51.314 --> 00:04:52.980
Caramelize them pretty
deeply so they've

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.450
got a fair bit of color.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.270
I'll add seasoning in the
form of a little bit of salt.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.240
So salt is not a spice,
salt is a flavor extractor.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.870
It pulls out liquid
from your palate,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.130
it pulls out flavor
out of food, and you're

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.710
looking for that synergy
and maximization of the two.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.990
And if you use too
much, it's gross.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.550
So we're going to
take half of these

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.970
and puree them in a blender.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.440
This is a Vitamix.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.570
It can puree, you
look online and you

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.140
guys can laugh as they
puree apple products on it.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.260
Then the other half
were going to reserve

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.280
the beauty of the salad
and it's integrity.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.029
So we'll have beautiful
caramelized onions

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.390
dotting through that.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.140
But the other half is
going to go in here.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.050
It's going to get pureed with
some vinegar and some mustard,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.730
and then mounted
with some olive oil

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.980
to create an
emulsified vinaigrette.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.630
And meanwhile as that goes, let
me just pick this off to side,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.780
and start on recipe
number two as we go.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.850
I've got an oven under
here, and the oven,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.650
said oven is at 400 right now.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.510
I'm going to put this
on seven out of 10.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.600
And we're going to get
some tomatoes roasting.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.100
These tomatoes-- so you
want to work in seasons,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.320
but if you want to
work with tomatoes

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.690
and you're not in the season of
summer, which is tomato season,

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.100
I would buy Roma tomatoes.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.680
Because they're
inherently-- seem

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.950
to be the most stable and
consistent tomato out there.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.562
They're not large
and mealy and weird.

00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:22.770
And they actually can
concentrate their flavor really

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.760
well by doing what we're about
to do, which is roasting them.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.190
So you're going to get rid
of a lot of the superfluous

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.440
liquid in them, in favor of
keeping the sugars behind.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.940
So I'm just going
to cut off the top

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.990
and cut them down
lengthwise, and then we're

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.110
going to get them in
a pan and get them

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.690
slathered with just a
little bit of olive oil,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.280
and some salt and pepper,
fresh thyme, and garlic.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.270
This is thyme, right?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.500
You bought the shaky thing
of thyme six years ago,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.290
you should throw it away.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.970
Herbs are leafy green things,
spices are barks and seeds.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.820
They differ a lot, but both are
essential oils-- are contained

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.910
in them that give us
the flavor, but if they

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.302
sit around and dry out, they
don't have as much flavor.

00:07:06.302 --> 00:07:08.260
There are definitely some
uses for dried herbs,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.810
don't get me wrong,
but not many.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.890
And spices go stale
as well, so you

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.160
got excited about taco
night eight years ago,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.580
the cumin is probably--
it's time to move on.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.660
So buy spices in small amounts,
and get rid of them or motor

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.490
through them often.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.710
This is a clove
of peeled garlic,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.120
if you buy pre-minced
garlic, you are dead to me.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.449
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:32.240
HUGH ACHESON: Good.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.440
Moving on.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.190
We're going to discard this,
that's the good garbage.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.640
That's the bad garbage.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.369
I'm going to put just a little
bit of olive oil in the pan,

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:44.910
and then we're going
to put these in.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.330
Just skin side u-- or the
cut side up, skin side down,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.970
and then we're
going to season just

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:56.440
with a little bit of
salt. I use kosher salt.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.057
What kind of kosher salt
is this, diamond crystal?

00:07:59.057 --> 00:07:59.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yep.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.210
HUGH ACHESON: So,
diamond crystal

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.610
is the one we all use
in restaurants, it just

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:03.560
feels right.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.630
It's dorky, but if you use
another type-- and salt differs

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.980
a lot, if you take
Morton's kosher salt,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.570
and weigh the amount that
it takes to be a gram,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.880
is far different
from diamond crystal.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.629
So it just helps to get
a solid reference point.

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:21.420
So the fresh thyme is
going to go in there,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.520
and then I'm going to slather
them with a lot of olive oil.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.478
The thyme's really just
going to flavor it out,

00:08:25.478 --> 00:08:27.990
so I want to beat it up as
I'm sticking it in there.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.145
I'm looking over at these,
and they're not burning,

00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:33.145
they're doing what they're
supposed to be doing.

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.260
And anyhow, in the modern
school of cheffery,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.470
burning stuff is cool.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.780
So it's like,
everything's charred now.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.030
It's like, wow, who
got really lazy?

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.450
I'm going to put a lot of
olive oil over the top of them.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.260
That's just going to
give it a lot of flavor.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.999
And I'm going to bring that up--
going to bring the pan up hot.

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.540
Normally you could just take it
a pan that's room temperature

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.860
and get them in the oven.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.740
I'm just aiding
this because it's

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.690
a longer process than the
30 hours of quality time

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.410
we have together.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.780
Into the oven we go.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.640
And let's go back--
what are you doing?

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.630
HUGH ACHESON: OK.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.970
Nobody saw that Hugh,
everything's fine.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.160
I'm going to check on these.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.910
They're doing what
they're supposed to do.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.800
Now did you notice the one
of things I'm not doing

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.840
is-- cooking is a matter of
paying attention to the stove,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.910
but you do not have to be
doing this all the time.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.930
I don't know why, my wife
is always like-- I'm, like,

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.060
what you're doing?

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.884
So just let it go.

00:09:38.884 --> 00:09:40.550
It's caramelizing,
it's doing its thing,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.400
just let it mellow
out and enjoy the time

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.880
you're having with your onions.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.861
I just turned it down to five.

00:09:47.861 --> 00:09:49.860
If you don't have a numeric
system on your stove

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.282
you are not going to
learn anything today.

00:09:52.282 --> 00:09:53.740
So on top of all
this, you're going

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.901
to have to buy a new stove.

00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.275
This is going to be a really
expensive free demonstration

00:09:57.275 --> 00:09:58.510
and a $10 book.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.980
HUGH ACHESON: This is a melon.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.840
It is a cantaloupe.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.740
It's season is just beginning,
if we were in south Georgia,

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.000
north Florida we would
see them right now.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.860
I'm just going to cut down.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.624
And any fruit, if you're
making orange supremes,

00:10:17.624 --> 00:10:19.040
it's the same
thing, you're trying

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.760
to create a flat
surface by cutting off

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.794
the top and the bottom.

00:10:21.794 --> 00:10:23.210
And then you're
going around on it

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.770
pretending like
you're cutting off

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.030
the outer layer of the globe.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.990
Civilization is
doing that by itself,

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:38.310
but we're going to do this
well-- So all the way down,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.350
and I'm going to circle
around, sometimes

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.530
you miss a little nubbin on
the bottom, but I nailed it.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.110
HUGH ACHESON: Down--
I'm not, yeah I am.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:57.770
Then I'm going to scoop out the
center seeds, just carefully

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.810
and that's about it.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.670
So let's talk about
convenience items in stores

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.880
and what you're doing wrong.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.782
If you go and buy
cubed cantaloupe

00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:12.740
you're paying somebody
to do a lot of the work,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.140
you understand that, right?

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.640
And I'm not saying
your time is not

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.790
more important than
cubing cantaloupe,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.760
but if you buy crumbled
feta, what is wrong with you?

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.455
Have you ever tried
to crumble feta?

00:11:24.455 --> 00:11:27.360
It is not very challenging.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.910
Like it just literally
crumbles within your fingers.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.210
Yet, it is a commodity product.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.090
That is amazing to me.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.809
I'm going to cut
some slices of this.

00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:38.350
You guys are like,
this guy is weird.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.322
AUDIENCE: First question.

00:11:42.322 --> 00:11:43.530
HUGH ACHESON: First question.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.384
AUDIENCE: How do you
identify a ripe cantaloupe?

00:11:46.384 --> 00:11:48.300
HUGH ACHESON: Smell it,
aromatically it should

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.260
it smell ripe.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.210
It shouldn't be soft at all, but
it should have firmness to it,

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.890
but not be rock solid.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.860
If you hear sloshing inside,
it means that it's probably

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.350
weirdly ripe inside.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.950
So trust your gut, or you
find, like Curtis Stone

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.980
in a grocery store.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.090
Do you remember
that show he used

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.530
to do, where he used to accost
women in the grocery store,

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.507
and take them home and
cool at their apartment.

00:12:12.507 --> 00:12:13.590
It was really weird store.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.700
HUGH ACHESON: Totally
illegal in most states,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.470
but he's tall and Australian
and beautiful, so--

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.420
I flip these over,
they look like that.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.375
Can you see that?

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160
HUGH ACHESON: Mike, too?

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.910
How are you doing?

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.335
That's Mike two.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.840
I'm just going to slice this
down into pieces that we're

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.180
going to use in our salad.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.176
So just nice little
thin slivers.

00:12:52.176 --> 00:12:53.920
And we're going to
fold them around

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.180
and we'll go through
making the salad.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.127
Come on in.

00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:03.210
Yeah, what's up with that?

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.130
Oh, is it because
the metals on there?

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, it doesn't
like that the spatula is--

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.564
HUGH ACHESON: So this
is an induction burner,

00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:13.392
which in chefdom, they're
really frustrating devices.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:14.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: Back at eight?

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.930
HUGH ACHESON: No, you're good.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.710
Let's go to four.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.330
HUGH ACHESON: Thank you.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.290
So the purslane is one
of my major elements

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.750
in this, it could be arugula,
it could be, if any of you

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.470
you are into
foraging, it could be

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.100
a bunch of different
cresses right now,

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.730
that are in the marketplace.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:41.164
You can-- Where did you
guys buy this purslane?

00:13:41.164 --> 00:13:43.048
FEMALE SPEAKER: Through
one of our vendors--

00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:43.519
HUGH ACHESON: Nice.

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.685
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:47.012 --> 00:13:47.720
HUGH ACHESON: OK.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.345
So that's pretty much done.

00:13:53.345 --> 00:13:54.719
We're just going
to turn that off

00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:57.360
and just going to let that
mellow out just a little bit.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.270
So I'm just picking through,
going to pick the leaves off.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.800
Literally-- and back to the herb
thing, in California or where

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.430
I'm from in Georgia,
if you can't grow mint,

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.710
you can't grow anything.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.490
So move into a condo,
and call it a day.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.570
Because mint is a weed.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.870
And so you should probably just
grow it, and then you can--

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.790
I'm going to send my
kids to college on mint.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.420
I'm going to make them sell it.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.330
HUGH ACHESON: So this is-- we're
just going through and picking

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.920
some of the bigger
stocks off these

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.700
and getting the nice
pieces, and avoiding

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.410
the ones that aren't so nice.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.960
But purslane is really cool.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.280
You could use frisee in
this if you wanted to.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.930
I'm big into bitter
greens right now, frisee,

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.295
and radicchio's, and triveso's,
and all those Italian ones.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.941
So we're motoring through that.

00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:56.940
We're going to make our
vinaigrette in a second,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.426
and then we're going to jump
back to cooking with fennel,

00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:02.550
because nobody knows what
to do with fennel either.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.810
So I'll talk through
fennel overall.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.970
So this recipe is appearing
in the cantaloupe section,

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.470
but it could just as well
appear in the purslane section.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.990
There actually really
isn't a purslane section,

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.240
but purslane does appear
in the book a lot.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.184
Because I've got
one waiter who's

00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:21.600
been with me very,
very long time,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.214
who grows a lot
of purslane, Paul.

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:24.880
AUDIENCE: Paul--

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.600
HUGH ACHESON: So we're
going to take these

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.410
and we're going to use half of
them in the beautiful salad,

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.060
and half of them are
going to get pureed.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.820
So this is the
mortem moment that we

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.665
cull the population
for the beautiful ones,

00:15:40.665 --> 00:15:43.650
and they stay out, and the
other one gets blended up.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.200
It's very strange totalitarian
regime of cooking.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.800
That's going in there.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.250
And then some
vinegar is going in.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.620
So if you make a vinaigrette.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.494
What's a vinaigrette?

00:15:57.494 --> 00:15:59.440
Vinaigrette is a
ratio, it's 3:1.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.230
Three to one what?

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:06.580
Well, three to one oils,
and often olive oil,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.650
but it could be safflower
oil, or sunflower oil,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.150
or a salad oil, depending
on what type of flavors

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.680
you want to bring to it.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.872
And then the one, is
the vinegar or acid.

00:16:14.872 --> 00:16:16.830
So that could be a
combination of citrus juices

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.060
or any vinegars.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.170
And the balance is the
most basic vinaigrette

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.410
you'll ever make.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.117
As you add other
things like the onions,

00:16:23.117 --> 00:16:24.700
you're not really
changing that ratio,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.300
you're just adding more
flavor components to it.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.800
So with simple
ratios like that, you

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.157
can make life much
more convenient

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.740
because you've now just avoided
an entire aisle in the grocery

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.170
store.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.340
So that's the way
cooking from scratch

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.690
should work and make
you think about things.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:46.260
I have two kids,
Beatrice is 13 now,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.660
but when she went off to
kindergarten when she was five,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.660
I remember hearing this
kerfuffle in the kitchen

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.250
at 6 o'clock in the morning.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:57.134
And she was making a
vinaigrette in a Mason jar.

00:16:57.134 --> 00:16:58.800
Because that's how
we make them at home,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.008
is just put everything into
a mason jar and shake it.

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:02.510
And she had made
this salad to go,

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.210
and she's standing on her
stool, making all this stuff

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.543
and it's 6 o'clock in the
morning, she's climbing around

00:17:07.543 --> 00:17:08.560
and made a mess.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.450
But for you, she made her
own stuff to go to school,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.930
now she's like uh-nun,
because she's 13

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.500
and that's what they do.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.450
I'm going to add a little
bit of salt to this,

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.482
and then we're going
to start pureeing.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.860
Basically, in the
emulsification process

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.020
you want to add this in
relatively thin, or slowly.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.520
If you add it in
really slow, you're

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.960
going to make a
onion mayonnaise,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.432
so don't go too slowly.

00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:46.390
And if you need to balance
the thickness of it,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.240
you can stop and
add more vinegar.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.020
You can also thin with water.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.475
[BLENDER MOTOR]

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.340
HUGH ACHESON: And don't
be afraid to taste things

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.260
as you're going along.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.504
This looks compostable?

00:18:24.504 --> 00:18:26.090
Nice.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.900
You guys, as a uniform
team, you're like yes.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.750
Go green.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.760
So that is pretty much
done, the end result

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.900
is looking like this.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.020
We just made a really
simple vinaigrette

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.760
in a matter of moments and it's
really not that hard to do.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.950
Because it's got that
roasted allium flavor, which

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.660
is the onion, it's really
got a ton of flavor to it,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.760
so it's pretty versatile.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.210
It'll keep in the fridge,
for five, six seven days.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.668
There's not really
much perishable,

00:18:52.668 --> 00:18:55.310
other than the butter and the
onion that was cooked in there,

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.030
so the other things-- I
mean obviously the oil

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.946
is perishable, but it
takes a much longer time

00:18:58.946 --> 00:19:01.170
for that to go to a bad point.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.030
So when we say it'll say good,
it'll stay good in the fridge

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.690
obviously.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.454
So let's take all the
other elements to it

00:19:07.454 --> 00:19:09.620
and lay them aside, and
we'll build our salad later.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.510
And let's go through
right now and we'll just

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.490
start the other elements
for the fennel salad.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:25.830
So the fennel salad is
a salad with fennel.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.360
So that's a whole
bulb of fennel.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.901
And then it's
got-- hold on and I

00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:32.650
need to put my garlic
in with my tomatoes.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.540
You're like man,
amateur, this guy.

00:19:40.264 --> 00:19:42.722
We're just going to throw this
in with the-- it'll probably

00:19:42.722 --> 00:19:44.270
be a good time.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.792
How are you?

00:19:45.792 --> 00:19:48.580
You're doing pretty good.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.910
Here we go.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.250
And it's got anchovies it in.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.450
Usually they would be
Spanish white anchovies.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.580
These are Italian salted
anchovies, which are flat guys,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.710
so we're just going to
rinse them quite well, quite

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.294
aggressively in cold water.

00:20:02.294 --> 00:20:03.960
And then pat them dry
and then fold them

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.470
into a salad at the end.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.630
In this, we're going to shave
the fennel by cutting off

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.380
the main bulb part.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.260
We're going to cut in
half and lightly core it.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.030
So I'm going to-- and
then we're going--

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.130
I saved some of the frond.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.321
Don't throw these away
because either they're

00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:22.820
going to go into
your chicken stock,

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.028
or you're going to dutifully
mince them and make them

00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:27.070
into a pickled chow chow.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.480
But y'all are busy, so maybe
just the stock, or hell.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.400
The compost pile.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.770
I don't know, whatever you want
to do, you're in your kitchen,

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.600
I'm not following you
home, like Curtis Stone

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.590
in that creepy show.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.370
So I'm clipping
the end off where

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:48.250
its root was attached to
it, and it was in the soil.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:53.030
And then if we see here,
this is the core part

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.700
that is a little
firmer, so I'm just

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.420
going to make a little v cut on
that, and cut off some of that.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.490
Leaving still enough of it--
it's just like the onion,

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.390
to hold it together.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:12.240
Then we're going
to take a Benriner,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.240
a lot of you guys work with
your fingers and typing,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.560
so you don't-- You could use
a knife for this if you want,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.080
but this is a
Japanese mandoline,

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.940
and they're really
ballistically sharp.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.650
They probably account for
more cuts in the kitchen

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.762
than pretty much anything.

00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:36.220
And what we're
doing is, we're just

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.580
going to slice it pretty thinly.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:47.410
I'm actually going to go just
a little bit thinner than that.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.090
But it does come with a
guard that will protect you,

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.200
but it will take
like three hours

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.920
to make what you want to
make, so I don't use it.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.870
But also, like when we
come to a certain point

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.840
to keep the integrity
of our fingers--

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.590
and God, when these
things, when they cut,

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.060
they just so cleanly
and beautifully cut,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.300
and you're bleeding
everywhere, it's great.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.287
But it results in
this, and at the speed

00:22:13.287 --> 00:22:15.370
that I did that, it would
take a long time for you

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:21.470
to do with a knife,
so it's very fast.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:26.650
So your comfort,
leisure level, I

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.939
do not want you
to cut yourselves.

00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:31.230
That's going to go to the side.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.979
I'm going to do a
little bit more on that.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.950
I hear [INAUDIBLE],
are you like,

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.360
did he sign that release form?

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.620
Can I see it?

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.990
We can get a new copy of that?

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.480
Hugh?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.790
I'm not going all the way down.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.515
Safety first.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.100
And then that's going
to get scooped up

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.070
and put in this dish.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.820
What we want to do
at this point is

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.930
kind of get it
macerating a little bit.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.460
So macerating is administering
something like an acid, or even

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.420
a sugar if it was berries
or something like that.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.610
In this case, it's going to
be just fresh lemon juice.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.100
If you buy the
plastic lemon, that

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.470
says it's real lemon with
the little copyright symbol,

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:23.250
you are also dead to me,
so this is just going over.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.310
Also to help with the
maceration in the process

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.690
is going to be just
a little bit of salt,

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.630
and then just a little
bit of olive oil.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:38.520
And I'm just going to take
really fancy culinary tweezers,

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.772
and mix them.

00:23:39.772 --> 00:23:41.230
Culinary tweezers,
these were given

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:46.386
to be by Albert Adria who
is Ferran's brother, which

00:23:46.386 --> 00:23:48.760
if you ever go to Barcelona
he has an amazing restaurant,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.190
called Tickets, and just
opened up another one.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.670
And gave them to me, he's
just bestowed them on me,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.110
I was very excited, and then
I realized that tweezers are

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.960
a lot cheaper at the pet store.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.390
They're for de-worming,
but they are literally

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.180
the exact same things, and
they cost $2 versus $25

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.430
at Sur La Table, and I'm
like, man what a racket.

00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:13.960
So that's going to set aside.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.270
I'm going to take this little
bit of frond that I've got,

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.654
which is the top leafy green.

00:24:18.654 --> 00:24:20.070
I'm just going to
tear it through,

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.910
and that's going to give
a nice little bit of color

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.900
to our end results.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.400
And again this is
two salads, but I

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.425
think the modern realm
of how we eat in America

00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:32.780
has totally changed.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.990
And it's no longer a
meat and potatoes world,

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.690
so if you had this and some
roasted tofu next to it

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.530
and some brown rice and maybe
another little salad element,

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.590
to me that's dinner.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.980
We all work a lot, we all do
a lot of stuff, we work out,

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.090
we're always running around
and you want to feel good.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.680
And a 12 ounce steak
or a massive thing

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.700
is just not feel good food,
it's once a month food now.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.830
It still exists, and I still
want it, not too often.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.500
Ate at Mourad last
night, it was good.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.220
That's that new Moroccan, I
just wish it was more Moroccan,

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.330
but I'll write them a
Yelp review, don't worry.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.915
I have like 25 Yelp accounts.

00:25:13.915 --> 00:25:16.188
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.777 --> 00:25:20.860
HUGH ACHESON: Retribution.

00:25:29.516 --> 00:25:31.640
So again, this is going
with those roasted tomatoes

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.240
that we've got in the oven,
and these anchovies which

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.960
we're just going to rinse
pretty vigorously, in the oven.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.420
How are you?

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.500
What's going on?

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.004
Nothing?

00:25:45.004 --> 00:25:51.690
[HUMMING]

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.900
So obviously anchovies
are preserved in salt,

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.050
so if you don't rinse
them, then people are like,

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.510
yeah, I don't like anchovies,
they're really salty,

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.426
and you're like, well
yeah, that's because you

00:26:02.426 --> 00:26:04.510
didn't rinse them.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.406
But you can buy bigger salt
packed anchovies from Italy,

00:26:08.406 --> 00:26:11.030
you can buy the ones like these,
which are salt packed and then

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:16.770
packed in oil, or you can
buy Spanish boquerones, which

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.990
are again curated in
salt, but then marinated

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.650
in vinegar and olive
oil, and are delicious.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:25.150
Delicious.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.870
What am I doing?

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.240
I'm going to look in the oven.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.690
Seven minutes, 55 seconds.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.344
That's a hot oven.

00:26:38.344 --> 00:26:40.260
Remember that day you
burned down Google Hugh?

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.432
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:42.432 --> 00:26:44.640
HUGH ACHESON: It's hard to
forget that one, honestly.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.130
The tomatoes look like that.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.720
The garlic went in
at a perfect time.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.900
It is browned but not burnt,
it is quintessentially done.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.390
It is exactly what
I wanted, and I hope

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.120
it's what you will like to.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.396
We're going to plate this
puppy up and get this going.

00:27:07.396 --> 00:27:14.110
I'm going to take this bowl, and
I'm going to take the fennel,

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.040
and put it in there.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.505
I'm going to put
the anch-- hold on.

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:21.005
Thinking.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.940
Plating is however you
want, you know, it's like,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.380
but that's what we do now.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.610
HUGH ACHESON: It's minimalist.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:35.660
It's small.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.260
Your 26 other courses
will be coming out soon.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.710
But this is at home so I'm
going to actually plate it

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.030
like somebody would
actually want to eat it.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.535
So we're just going to
lay some of this out.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.236
I think that food should be--
have almost like a 3D-ness

00:27:57.236 --> 00:27:58.030
to it.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:02.460
And be pretty and look
good, but not overwrought.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.530
I don't think you
need to-- you guys

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.140
know the Japanese
concept of wabi-sabi?

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.690
Sort of elegant disarray,
I kind of work with that.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.380
Meaning if somebody
doesn't like it,

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.338
you can just stand back
like a Japanese master,

00:28:16.338 --> 00:28:19.290
going whatever, you
don't understand my art.

00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:29.682
[HUMMING]

00:28:29.682 --> 00:28:31.390
I don't know why I'm
doing one of the NPR

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:36.320
songs as my humming
thing, but-- [HUMMING]

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.224
And then the anchovies
are going to go over.

00:28:38.224 --> 00:28:40.640
I'm going to get a little bit
more of that frond in there.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.180
I'm going to add just a little
bit of olive oil to this too.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.345
If you wanted to,
like if this-- there's

00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:48.720
another part of the book that's
got pickled shrimp in it,

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.845
and if you wanted to make
a batch of pickled shrimp

00:28:50.845 --> 00:28:53.810
and then tuck them into
this as a beautiful side.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.334
And this is meant
as a spread, this

00:28:55.334 --> 00:28:57.750
is again-- it's reactionary
cooking to the farmer's market

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.770
and what's there.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.320
So it you had other
things in-- I'm just

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.050
trying to take the blinders off
and expand the horizons of what

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.610
you're thinking about-- is
cooking at home with food

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:14.120
and also making you realize it's
really not as difficult as most

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.455
people make it seem.

00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:20.150
We have a vested interest
in you guys still coming

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.250
to restaurants
obviously, because it's

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.520
how I pay my mortgage.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.100
But I want you to
cook at home, I

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.000
want you to realize
that cooking is easy,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.449
but I don't know-- none
of you probably have kids,

00:29:33.449 --> 00:29:34.240
you're tech people.

00:29:37.222 --> 00:29:38.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
many of us have kids?

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.263
HUGH ACHESON: How many of
you-- do you have kids-- Nice.

00:29:41.263 --> 00:29:42.250
Nice.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.450
AUDIENCE: Grandkids.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.200
HUGH ACHESON: You know,
I mean, grandkids?

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.574
That's awesome,
what are you, 40?

00:29:46.574 --> 00:29:49.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:49.135 --> 00:29:51.010
HUGH ACHESON: I think
the important thing is,

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.270
the best time you'll ever
have in your life if you

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.360
are a parent is
cooking with your kids,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.410
because it's multi-fold.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.210
You're teaching
them life skills.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.050
Because at 20 years old,
you remember, all remember,

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.240
how hard it was.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.900
You're on your own,
you're eating crappy food,

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.400
you miss the Happy Meal, but
they won't sell to you anymore.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.570
This idea of how to feed
ourselves, and life skills,

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:15.120
and surround ourselves with
basic cooking things, this food

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.260
is not expensive to make at all.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.940
But it's good food and if I can
teach my kids, like Beatrice,

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.549
again shaking it, at five
years old making vinaigrette.

00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:28.590
If I could teach her also
how to scramble an egg,

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.050
and make a perfect omelette,
and make a simple soup,

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.590
and roasted chicken, I'm done.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.890
I gave her enough that she can
feed her and her six friends,

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.429
or her and her three families if
she starts having babies soon,

00:30:41.429 --> 00:30:43.220
she's going to be in
deep shit if she does.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.330
But this is the idea.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.350
To me, I live in a
community, it ain't my kids,

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.540
it's everybody's kids
who are around me,

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.830
and if you then take
the circles of community

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.080
and make them bigger,
it's everywhere.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.830
We've got a duty to make sure
that the next generation has

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.770
much more endowed life
skills than we do.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.810
So that's the important thing.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.370
Let's plate up this other one.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.660
This is again beautiful--
the beautiful onions,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.600
this is the prosciutto,
so I'm going

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.400
to get a little
bit of that down,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.720
and I'm going to take some of
my purslane and my vinaigrette.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.010
I'm going to just put the
dressing on at the very top,

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.460
because I don't want to wilt
this purslane down too much.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.530
And then the onions go
in, and I'm just going

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:36.254
to layer another bit of this.

00:31:36.254 --> 00:31:38.420
This is pretty-- you don't
have to have a fancy meat

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.440
slicer at home.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.890
There's batting cage
though, out back,

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.949
so there's probably a
really nice meat slicer

00:31:45.949 --> 00:31:46.990
you can borrow somewhere.

00:31:49.877 --> 00:31:51.460
Sergey was like, we
need meat slicers,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.168
we're doing a whole
room of meat slicers.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.260
Then I'm just kind
of repeating this

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.590
and then the onions
are going on.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.100
The onions are so pretty
though, and onions to me

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.780
are awesome flavor because
they're cooked sugar.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.030
Onions are the way that
everybody's like, how do I get

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.525
at my kids to eat vegetables?

00:32:10.525 --> 00:32:13.070
I'm like, feed them cooked
onions and beets when they're

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.080
two years old, they'll
never know what candy is,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.794
because it's got so much
sugar in there already.

00:32:18.794 --> 00:32:20.210
So that's getting
tucked in there.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.590
If you serve this with a
really good loaf of bread,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.050
you're just expanding the
idea of what dinner is.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.080
Hold on one second, I'm
going to dress this.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.360
Look at that, I have one
minute and 54 seconds.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.612
The vinaigrette is
really beautiful,

00:32:48.612 --> 00:32:49.570
it's got a puckeriness.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:54.860
I go on the side of--
I enjoy acid in food,

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.710
I enjoy brightness in food.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.070
I like that flavor.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:02.670
I think it's sort of bouncy to
me, and redolent and exciting.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.207
I don't like uber rich
flavors, so the vinaigrette

00:33:06.207 --> 00:33:08.540
is probably more on the acidic
side than a lot of people

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.820
are used to.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.550

just like that.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.090
It helps to have somebody
remind you about it,

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.490
before you get embarrassed
in front of a crowd.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.330
OK.

to cook for your kids?

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.600
Or what do they get really
excited about if you're

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.100

00:34:09.483 --> 00:34:11.360
HUGH ACHESON: Steak.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.429
But, you know, to me it's
like two big rib-eyes

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:15.949
for the four of
us, that probably

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:19.139
amount to four ounces
of meat per person.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.909
And I cook them on
this little tiny--

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.090
I've got this-- what's
called a-- what's it called?

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.704
A lodge, like
outdoors-man grill,

00:34:26.704 --> 00:34:28.620
but it's just like this
little tiny cast iron,

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.270
all cast iron grill,
that is awesomely cool,

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.400
and fun, and inexpensive.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.320
But then next to it is
three different salads

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.739
like this, and wheat berries,
or they're big fans of farro.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:44.840
And it's just a spread, and
oftentimes we eat family style,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.214
so I'll just line up
six platters of stuff

00:34:47.214 --> 00:34:48.880
and we'll have-- sit
around the counter,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.255
and we'll have
four empty plates,

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.330
and we'll just plate it up.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.130
As a parent I've found
that kids eat really well,

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.000
this is going to put
a lot of light bulbs

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.860
above peoples heads,
but when they're hungry.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.650
So if they have a 5:30 snack,
and you're eating at 6:30,

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.290
they're probably
not really hungry,

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:10.160
and that's when you see the
vegetable pushing game off

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.310
to the sides.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:15.170
So you got to make them
hungry, so don't feed them.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.885
Now, I mean, just don't feed
them a bunch of crap at 5:30

00:35:17.885 --> 00:35:19.260
and you're going
to have a better

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.880
chance of feeding them well.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.820
But they eat anything.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.140
If I roast them a chicken,
and Carolina gold rice,

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.490
and old school country
gravy, and then next to that

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:31.950
is escarole, and beets, and
roasted carrots, and peas,

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.400
they'll eat all of that.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.820

good, they're healthy kids.

de-worming tweezers,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.525
what is your favorite
kitchen instrument and why?

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.940
HUGH ACHESON: Probably spoons.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:52.040
I mean, I know it sounds
dorky, but we use spoons a lot.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.986
But we use them as spatulas, we
use them as everything a lot.

00:35:55.986 --> 00:35:57.610
They're versatile,
but these are bigger

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.470
than your standard spoons--
this one's also slotted.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.777
They're called
Kunz spoons, but it

00:36:03.777 --> 00:36:05.610
was designed by a guy
named Gary Kunz, who's

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:06.930
a really famous
chef in New York.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.700
He was the chef at
Lespinasse at one time.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.830
But, whatever.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.307
And I like a Vitamix blender.

00:36:13.307 --> 00:36:14.890
They're just really
powerful blenders.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.180
They're really handy for making
smoothies in the morning,

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.388
and making vinaigrettes,
they make soups, and purees,

00:36:19.388 --> 00:36:21.080
and all that sort of stuff.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.690
So, they're good.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.770
I think investing in
good pans is good.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.350
But you don't necessarily
have to spend a lot of money,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.433
if you don't want to spend
a lot of money on pans.

00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:30.520
Buy cast iron, but you
have to take care of it.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.700
And you have to watch a YouTube
tutorial, which one of you

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.730
probably has edited
somewhere along the line,

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.620
on taking care and
refinishing cast iron pans,

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.120
because it's a lot different
than what your grandmother told

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.620
you.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.320
She was generally wrong.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.630
What else?

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.670
Yes

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.420
AUDIENCE: Hey Hugh,
thanks for coming out.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.110
HUGH ACHESON: Thanks
for having me.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.690
AUDIENCE: What is the
first recipe we should all

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.300
try from "Broad Fork"?

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.340
HUGH ACHESON: Hum, you're
in spring right now.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.410
If there's still
asparagus in the market,

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.940
there's an asparagus with
piperade, poached eggs

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.796
and grits.

00:37:04.796 --> 00:37:07.295
Which you could do polenta or
whatever instead of the grits,

00:37:07.295 --> 00:37:08.970
if you can't find them out here.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.780
That's great and really simple,
and really straightforward,

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.900
that resonates with
spring, it also

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.470
resonates with--
you guys probably

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.270
don't have much time
off, but maybe you

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.130
could do that on Sunday
morning, so Yeah.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.540
I'm thinking about you.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.160
AUDIENCE: What's your go to
anchovy brand these days?

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.750
HUGH ACHESON: Go to anchovy
brand, hum, I don't know.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.610
We buy really-- large
things, we cure our own too,

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.000
so I don't know.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.010
I mean, I've had great success
with buying Spanish products

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.220
on Amazon.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:40.702 --> 00:37:42.660
HUGH ACHESON: I mean I
live in Athens, Georgia,

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.120
I don't have many options.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.160
But I get a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] canned tuna

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.240
and stuff like that,
I find it cheapest

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.120
there, so try one of those.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.370
I mean look for Delician brand.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.110
One of those ones,
would be good.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.429
AUDIENCE: Your first book
won a James Beard award.

00:37:58.429 --> 00:37:59.220
HUGH ACHESON: Yeah.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.830
AUDIENCE: And I'm
wondering about the role

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:01.830
of writing in your life.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.246
I know you said earlier that
you do quite a bit of writing

00:38:04.246 --> 00:38:08.440
and if this creative pursuit
and that one sort of mesh

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.960
together and--

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.570
HUGH ACHESON: I
think they do, yeah.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.550
I never really-- somebody was
like, you should do a cookbook,

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.959
and I was like OK.

00:38:16.959 --> 00:38:19.500
I was like, man, that will be
easy, I've got all the recipes,

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.320
and then you have nothing.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.210
You really don't.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.090
I mean I've got-- I have systems
of telling people what to do

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.420
and basic recipes
for restaurants.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.290
I don't have anything
for home cooks.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.830
So when you're writing
for a home cook,

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.869
literally I get
emails saying, you

00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:36.910
know it said crack four
eggs, and used four eggs,

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.743
but you didn't tell me
to remove the shells.

00:38:38.743 --> 00:38:40.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:40.244 --> 00:38:41.660
HUGH ACHESON: So
it's not like I'm

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.330
saying I have to be
instructing people

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:49.070
that know absolutely nothing,
but it's very wide spectrum.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:51.800
But I like writing, I'm
not very good at it.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.100
I dropped out of college.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.630
I come from a really
super academic family,

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.360
and I was the black sheep.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.915
But I like it, and
it sort of tests me

00:39:01.915 --> 00:39:04.660
and drives me to do it more.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.750
And I think the only way you get
good at writing is by writing.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.070
And you write and write
and rewrite and write,

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.390
and you just have to do it.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.920
So you tell stories,
and narrative,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.740
and anecdotes about
food in an attempt

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.360
to get people to
fully understand what

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.580
you're trying to get across.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.260
The how to on recipes is
the most difficult thing.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.247
It can be easy.

00:39:24.247 --> 00:39:26.580
But if it's easy it usually
doesn't really fully explain

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.300
what you're having somebody do.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.450
And it's really hard.

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:33.330
If every cookbook was animated,
with a little animated

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.500
button off to the side, that
would be great, but it's not.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.800
Hold on.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.302
Google is not on fire,
there's just a little--

00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:50.200
FEMALE SPEAKER:
We've got one more.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.820
AUDIENCE: I have an issue
where vegetables go bad.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.660
Like I'll buy a ton at once.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.760
What are good staple veggies or
the most versatile vegetables

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.390
to have.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:01.306
HUGH ACHESON: Carrots.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.390
People buy a lot
more than they need,

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.290
but buying really small amounts
is crazy stupid expensive

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.102
sometimes.

00:40:10.102 --> 00:40:11.810
Now there's those
groups like Blue Apron,

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.750
and all these little
prep companies that

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.819
deliver you a stupid
prepped-- and I

00:40:16.819 --> 00:40:19.235
don't want you to do that,
it's just silly and overpriced,

00:40:19.235 --> 00:40:22.973
but, if one of your spouses
owns that company, I'm sorry.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.482
I think that staples
in my fridge,

00:40:27.482 --> 00:40:29.190
that aren't going to
go bad very quickly,

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:33.160
are going to be carrots,
onions, celery, obviously, these

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.624
are main core of a lot of
French cooking, fennel.

00:40:37.624 --> 00:40:39.790
I usually always have button
mushrooms, or something

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:41.914
as simple button mushrooms,
and then the rest of it

00:40:41.914 --> 00:40:45.150
is from the market-- and from
the farmer's market on Saturday

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.110
I buy some things.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.930
How you store it is
really important.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.520
Ziploc bags with a
moist paper towel

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.210
inside is going to keep
lettuces a lot longer, arugula

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.140
a lot longer, than just
standard shoving them

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.734
in the regular part fridge.

00:40:57.734 --> 00:40:59.400
The crisper drawer
is there for a reason

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.350
though, it's kind of a
humidity controlled area.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.800
And will keep things from
drying out more than anything.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.286
So I'm trying to think
what other vegetables.

00:41:10.286 --> 00:41:11.660
I mean obviously,
root vegetables

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.110
are going to have a
long time to them.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.480
Any leafy frilly stuff
you just have to use.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.320
But that's the other thing,
if you buy something,

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.950
it's the way we
consume anything,

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.380
if you don't have a real
purpose for it, don't buy it.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.380
You need to be thinking
about what you're doing.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.129
But that's the challenge
of the CSA boxes,

00:41:30.129 --> 00:41:32.960
that you get the stuff and
you don't have a choice.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.242
So you better love lettuce.

00:41:35.242 --> 00:41:36.950
AUDIENCE: I heard
through the rumor mill,

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.470
actually I read
an online article,

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:40.849
that you're opening a coffee
bar in Ponce City Market--

00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:41.640
HUGH ACHESON: I am.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.400
AUDIENCE: which is super cool.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.192
So I was just wondering
what drove you to--

00:41:44.192 --> 00:41:46.025
HUGH ACHESON: I heard
through the rumor mill

00:41:46.025 --> 00:41:48.510
that you guys are opening up
an office there, is that true?

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.810
AUDIENCE: Maybe, maybe not.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.895
Unconfirmed.

00:41:51.895 --> 00:41:53.290
HUGH ACHESON: Unconfirmed.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.040
AUDIENCE: But I'd love
to hear about that.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.059
HUGH ACHESON: So, I guess
when I opened up Empire State

00:41:59.059 --> 00:42:01.100
South, which is a real
big restaurant in Atlanta,

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.770
I was like, man, a lot of
people are doing restaurants.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.874
This was five years ago and
mixology was becoming the thing

00:42:06.874 --> 00:42:08.540
again and whatever,
but I kept thinking,

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.540
you know a lot of
people aren't really

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.210
doing the bookends of a meal.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.670
They're not really
paying attention

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.310
to great beverage program at
the beginning of your meal,

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.101
when you sit down
before you get food,

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:19.350
and then they're definitely
not thinking about coffee,

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.516
because they don't care
about coffee, because coffee

00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:22.910
doesn't make them any money.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.820
So I was like, well,
I care about coffee,

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.010
because I love coffee.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.370
And I was like, what if we
did a really elaborate, really

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.830
good coffee program.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.430
So we put one in Empire, and
it was a really big success.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:38.230
It probably doesn't make
that much money still,

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.250
but it's been worth it and
it's gathered a lot of acclaim.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.460
I have one guy there
named Dale Donchey.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:50.780
And Dale's in this wonderful
world of third rail coffee,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.760
and third rail restaurants,
and all this DIY culture.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.580
It's just a lot of people
nerding out on single topics,

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.020
and Dale's just this
classic coffee nerd,

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.920
and he just knows
a ton about coffee.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.830
And he's a great guy.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.130
He's a really good leader.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:06.400
So he and I are
starting a restaurant,

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.904
which is a massive kiosk.

00:43:08.904 --> 00:43:10.570
I'm trying to think
what else wa-- oh, I

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:14.030
went to-- what was that
coffee shop I was at

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.480
in LA-- Sightglass.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.935
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sightglass.

00:43:16.935 --> 00:43:18.685
HUGH ACHESON: Sightglass.
--the other day.

00:43:18.685 --> 00:43:20.950
It's kind of like that set
up, but if I didn't own

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.222
everything else in the room.

00:43:23.222 --> 00:43:25.680
So it's just an island, and
it's called Spiller Park, which

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.260
is the old name of the Atlanta
Crackers Baseball Team Stadium

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.420
that was on the site of
where Ponce City Market is.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.242
So it'll be open-- it's a
multi roaster company, until we

00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:38.700
start roasting our
own beans, which

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.000
is about a year and a half.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.800
So we'll be using Four Barrel,
and there's roasters out here

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.470
we love, but there are a lot
of Canadian roasters we love.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.000
Who's a coffee nerd
in here, anybody?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.460
49th parallel, which
is great, which

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.740
is from Vancouver, Phil
and Sebastian from Calgary,

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.156
Four Barrel Heart from Portland,
couple others, George Howell.

00:44:01.156 --> 00:44:02.290
So, yeah, we're excited.

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:03.770
That'll be open in--

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.020
So Ponce City Market, is
the second largest brick

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.640
edifice in North America, and
it's the old Atlanta City Hall

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.790
East, and before that was
the Sears distribution

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:11.770
center in Atlanta.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.970
It's this amazingly massive
building, that's very complex

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:18.210
and a lot of tech
companies and other stuff

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:19.960
are moving in there,
MailChimp's in there,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.668
a bunch of other
groups, but then there's

00:44:21.668 --> 00:44:25.680
an elaborate retail level
with anthropology and crap

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.880
like that.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:29.720
