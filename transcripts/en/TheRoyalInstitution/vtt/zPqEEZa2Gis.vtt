[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.475
I wanted to show you one of my
favourite props from last

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.090
year's Christmas Lectures, which
is a Mobius strip steel

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.760
track, covered in maybe 2,000 or
3,000 of these super strong

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.833
neodymium magnets.

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:39.780
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080
So what I want to show you is
how this track is going to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.350
interact with one of these.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.800
This is a high temperature
superconductor, made of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.220
yttrium barium copper oxide.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.870
It's a sort of ceramic
material.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.840
And a superconductor is
something that, when you cool

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.650
it down, in this case with
liquid nitrogen, it loses all

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.100
its electrical resistance.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.860
So this leads to some
interesting behaviours, which

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.780
I'm going to show you.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.150
And to do that I'm going to need
to hang this thing from

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.588
the ceiling, which
I'll do now.

00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:06.492
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:06.492 --> 00:01:06.976
Oh!

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:17.150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.890
So we have one suspended,
super strong, neodymium

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.750
magnetic Mobius strip track.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.045
What we need now is some
liquid nitrogen.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.020
So we're down in one of
the labs at the RI.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.074
And this is where the liquid
nitrogen is stored.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.550
Right.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.026
Got what we need.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.800
The superconductor is now
cooling down, which will take

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800
a minute or so.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.820
It needs to be cooled down in
situ, because, one, what I'm

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.350
trying to get to is to have a
superconductor kind of locked

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.350
into this position.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.730
So I need to cool it down
in situ above the track.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.190
I'm cooling it down past it's
critical temperature, the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.600
temperature at which it will
become a superconductor, and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.170
its electrical resistance will
completely disappear, which is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.920
about minus 180 degrees.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.210
And the burger tray is there
to maintain the spacing

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.910
between the superconductor
and the track.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.930
I mentioned that we're
trying to lock it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.065
into a specific position.

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:17.215
So that is the position that
we want it to take up.

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:19.930
I'm just going to
slide this off.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.990
This is the best way I've
found of doing this.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.670
If you ever hold it so quickly
enough you can see that it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.900
actually levitating
on the track.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.140
Actually, you might be able to
see a gap underneath it there,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.680
sliding back and forth,
levitating.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.050
Oh!

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.630
OK.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.530
So unfortunately, it warms
up quite quickly.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.020
Obviously, the effect only works
as long as it is at its

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.670
superconducting temperature.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.060
So what's actually going on
there, a good way to start to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.580
understand that is to think
about how magnets interact

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.910
with ordinary conductors,
like this copper tube.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.050
So if I just drop this nut
through, it falls all the way

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.970
through very quickly,
as you'd expect.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.690
If I drop a strong magnet
through instead, it takes

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.720
quite a long time.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.650
So the reason that's happening
is as the magnet moves through

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.960
the copper, it induces electric

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.970
currents in the copper.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.990
Those electric currents,
themselves, have their own

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.980
magnetic field.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.850
And that magnetic field will
always arrange itself so as to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.110
resist the motion that's
creating it.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.180
This is the fundamental
principle of electromagnetism,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.245
the moving magnets.

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.550
And the conductors are moving
conductors near magnets,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.110
creating electric currents.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.470
Now, because this is not a
superconductor, because it has

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.320
electrical resistance, the
currents that are created as

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.040
the magnet falls through will
always tend to die away.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.550
So if the magnet were, for
instance, to be stopped by the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.880
electric currents, those
currents would immediately die

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.450
away, and the magnet would
start falling again.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.980
So what actually happens
is it just falls

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.466
slowly through the tube.

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:52.600
If, however, this were a
superconductor those currents

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.150
would not die away.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.440
As soon as you induce them by
introducing the magnets into

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.500
the tube, those currents would
remain and would keep going

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.430
and would keep going even after
the magnet has stopped.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.960
So if this were a
superconductor, the magnets

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.320
would basically be locked
in the pipe.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.590
They would be effectively
levitating in the pipe

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.820
indefinitely.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.070
So that's part of
the explanation.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.860
We are sort of halfway there.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.260
And we'll get onto
the track now.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.750
And to do that, we saw, when
I was demonstrating the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.680
superconductor on the track
down here, that the effect

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.750
only lasted a few seconds.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.750
It warmed up too quickly.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.580
It warmed above its critical
temperature and stopped

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.590
levitating.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.320
The solution we've decided on
for the Christmas Lectures

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.620
dossier was to make
it a little train

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.320
stroke, boat thing.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.140
So we've got a piece of the
superconductor embedded in

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.660
polystyrene with its own little

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.330
reservoir for liquid nitrogen.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.630
So let's cool this down.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.150
Again, it's not a burger
tray this time.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.970
It's a slightly different
dish.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.400
Gently pick it up.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.800
And I think--

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.325
So now I can send her out.

00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:55.213
Come all the way back.

00:04:55.213 --> 00:04:56.750
Come back on top.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.060
This is why we made it like a
Mobius strip, so that it can

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.922
go and come back on the opposite
side it went around.

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:20.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.890
So if I stop it there.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.630
So it's kind of locked
into position.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.800
So it's not just repelling
the magnets and hovering.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.010
I can sort of pick it up and
then stick it underneath as

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.070
well, and it will hang there.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.040
So as I mentioned with the
copper, when you induce

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.260
electric currents in conductors
with a moving

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.280
magnetic field or changing
magnetic flux, the electric

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.490
currents that you create will
always have their own magnetic

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.780
field that resists
that change, that

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.150
resists that motion.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.490
So when it's hovering on top of
here, gravity is trying to

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.360
pull it towards the track.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.210
That small motion toward sets
up the electric currents in

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.360
the superconductor, which have
a magnetic field that resist

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.560
that motion.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.420
But likewise, when it comes
around and is now on the other

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.380
side, now gravity's trying
to pull it away.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.330
So the act of trying to fall
away from the track sets up a

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.750
different sets of currents
with a different magnetic

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.470
field, which this time are
attracted to the track.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.150
So whichever way you try and
move it, whether you're trying

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.910
to move it off to the side, up
and down, towards the track,

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.130
away from the track, the
superconductor will resist

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.540
that motion, effectively locking
itself into position

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.410
relative to the track.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.480
So the only direction it can
move is the direction which

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.680
the magnetic field doesn't
change, i.e.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.020
along the track.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.120
So basically, the superconductor
can be any kind

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.470
of magnet it wants to be, or any
kind of magnet it needs to

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.900
be at that moment to keep itself
in the right position

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.150
relative to the track.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.220
So this material was a real
breakthrough and possibly the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.180
first step on the way to what
might be the holy grail of

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.110
superconductor research, which
would be a superconductor that

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.040
would operate at room
temperature or close to room

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.910
temperature.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.160
At which point, we might be able
to use them to replace

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.500
all of the conventional
conductors, like copper and

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.170
things, that we use in all our
electrical applications today.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.510
And all those materials, when
they conduct electricity they

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.700
do it inefficiently to some
extent and waste energy.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.880
If we could superconduct in
those applications, then that

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.110
would really change the world.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:29.167
