00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
If you look at every decision you've ever made, it's either fear-based,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.520
"You know if I give him up, someone else will get to love him for the rest of his life.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.920
I can't let him go. I mean, five cats isn't a lot right? Right."

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.920
-- or growth-based.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.200
"You know, if I keep him, I'll have six cats. Yeah, that's more than five,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
But I've done a ton more than five. Totally doable."

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.980
Now, fear-based decisions tend to be about what we don't want. And we've all done that right?

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.580
Stayed in relationships because we didn't want to be alone,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.500
Accepted the first job opportunity, because you were worried there wouldn't be any more.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.700
Or stuck in a toxic friendship, because you didn't want to go out there and make new friends.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.740
Oddly enough, fear-based decisions tend to come from a need to feel safe and stay in the familiar.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.860
Whereas growth-based decisions are usually a lot scarier,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.120
because they come with uncertainty and unknown change.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.700
Whether that's leaving a well-paying job to pursue a passion,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.220
ending a relationship or a friendship,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.060
or packing up all of your stuff and moving to a new place.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.020
Now, I would hope all of us kind of have the self-awareness

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440
to know what motivates our decision-making.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.140
But in case you don't, that's what this video's for.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.940
So the first thing is make a list of every big decision you've made in your life,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.220
and analyze each of those decisions and ask yourself honestly:

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.200
Was it made out of fear,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.520
Or was it made for a desire to grow?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.320
Now, even though growing decisions are scary as hell,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.860
they're not *motivated* by fear. And that is kind of the key difference.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.980
So let's say you look at your list, and some of your decisions, or maybe *all* of your decisions,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.900
are pretty much motivated by fear.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.720
And let's say for the sake of this video, that you want to change that. What exactly do you do?

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.380
Well, this requires a lot of self-reflection and introspection on your part,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.980
because now you need to be able to ask yourself honestly and seriously, in each of these instances:

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.600
What were you afraid of -- was it a fear of failure?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.220
Rejection, judgment, scarcity, change?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.760
Maybe deep down, you don't actually feel like you deserve success and happiness.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.720
[laughs] "What about all of the above?"  [clicks tongue] That's fine.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.520
There's a multitude of reasons as to why we are afraid.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.759
And it is much, much easier to make decisions from that place.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.600
But now that you know the root cause of your fear, you can start the second step.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.920
Which is asking yourself: if I made my decisions out of growth,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.500
and it all worked out exactly the way that I wanted it to,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.260
What would my life look like?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.640
Now, it's not going to happen overnight,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.340
but the more you apply this visualization and self-awareness to *why* you make your decisions

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.280
and *how* you make a decision, you can slowly, but surely start shifting your mindset.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.800
Everyone I know who's done amazing artistic work has done it with a lot of fear and anxiety.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.880
But they choose to make growth decisions anyway,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.980
because they know that it's gonna lead them to where they want to be.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.000
So yeah. The first step is self-awareness,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.180
and the second step, and the third step, and the fourth step, and the fifth, and the sixth,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.220
all the way to infinity, is to slowly but surely start changing yourself.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.740
Really easy right? Simple solutions, [hold back laughter] just do that.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.120
I'm Anna Akana, stay right here for a sponsored message.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.500
Thank you to Audible for sponsoring today's video.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.100
Audible's selection of audiobooks is unmatched anywhere.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.440
And audiobooks are *great* for helping you be a better you.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.440
I've been listening to "Mating in Captivity" by Esther Perel while I drive, do laundry, or work out.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.920
Fun fact; she also has a podcast on audible called "Where Should We Begin?",

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.759
and it's this fascinating insight into one-time couples' therapy sessions.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.820
I find her research on relationships, sex, and how to keep desire alive

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.460
in a monogamous relationship just so cool.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.810
Plus, she speaks like a million languages. She's awesome.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.980

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.680

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.500
And if by chance you start listening, and you don't really like your book,
