LAURENCE MORONEY:
So now Firebase,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.810
it's a part of Google.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.890
But I hear that you were a part
of Firebase for a long time.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.341
DAVID EAST: I've been with
Firebase for almost two years

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:16.840
now.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.280
And I was a big user
back in the early days.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.710
When I first discovered it,
I was building a lot of apps.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.470
And so having something that
just made making apps so easy,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.074
I was kind of like, my
god, they've done it.

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:27.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.323
DAVID EAST: They've built the
holy grail of development.

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:32.920
And then one day they posted
up a developer advocate job.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.550
And so sent my resume
in on a Sunday,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.370
they called me on Monday,
took a coding test on Tuesday,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.140
flew out on Wednesday,
brought my whole family,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.580
too, my wife and my
16-month-old son.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.702
Got the job that day.

00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:48.160
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So the only thing

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.982
faster than the database
is the hiring committee.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:52.940
DAVID EAST: Yeah, it was
a pretty fast process.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.231
Just letting everyone know,
I was like, oh, by the way,

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.357
I'm going to San Francisco.

00:00:56.357 --> 00:00:57.439
LAURENCE MORONEY: See you.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:58.724
DAVID EAST: Yeah, pretty much.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:00:59.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.540
So now you're a developer
advocate at Google and Firebase

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.665
is a part of Google.

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:03.430
How is that?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.596
DAVID EAST: It's been great.

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:07.470
Like it's been about 15 months
ago that we were acquired.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.100
And it's been a really
awesome experience,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.260
because Google has just sort
of thrown a lot of resources

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.840
into us.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.440
We've expanded the team so much.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.440
And we've been able to
focus on the core product

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.090
and making Firebase better.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.610
We are in the
middle of releasing

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.322
a Unity plugin that's
out there for beta,

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:24.280
for people to test out.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.000
LAURENCE MORONEY:
A Unity plugin?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.708
DAVID EAST: Yeah.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.360
Yeah, there's some
pretty cool samples.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: So that's
cool stuff there, David.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.450
I mean, how does a developer
get started with that?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.530
DAVID EAST: So the best
place to get started

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.650
is just like right on
the Firebase website,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.185
so Firebase.com.

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:38.750
And then you can sign up,
but also Firebase.com/docs.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.040
Our docs are one of the
things that we really

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.430
pride ourselves on.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.790
So by just reading
our quick start guide,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.010
you can already get a gist
of how to get started.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.330
Each platform integrates
totally with whatever

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.520
dependency manager it has.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.350
So with Android, it's great
with Gradle, with iOS,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.434
you can use CocoaPods.

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:01.100
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, one of the things

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.058
I remember about Firebase
is that you guys used

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:05.180
to do these epic hack-a-thons
where you gave out

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.250
like really cool swag.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.570
Is that something you still do?

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.820
DAVID EAST: Well, we used
to make a joke like Firebase

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.950
was actually a swag company and
we just kind of put on a front

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.980
that we did--

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's a swag
company that makes software.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.165
DAVID EAST: Yeah,
that was pretty

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:21.970
much what we used to say.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.540
So we used to make--
we still do actually.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.310
We make tons of pieces of swag.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.240
Firebase hot sauce
was pretty awesome.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.550
My favorite is headbands.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.190
So we have these sweatpants.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.880
And so I was at a
hack-a-thon once

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.730
and I saw this guy who was
like, hey, can I have a couple?

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.980
And by a couple,
he meant like 16.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.730
And then he started putting them
on and kind of like a mummified

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.930
himself and then just sat
down and started hacking.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.759
And I was like, that
dude's going to win.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Did he?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.258
DAVID EAST: I don't think so.

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:55.940
LAURENCE MORONEY: In
all seriousness, though,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.240
I'm a developer.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.780
Middleware is really hard.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.849
If I want to have some
kind of a database,

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.140
if I want to have some kind
of synchronization of data,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.050
it's a case where I can just
go out and use Firebase today,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.560
right?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.809
DAVID EAST: Yeah, no, I mean,
that's what we're doing.

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.720
Like we always
say our mission is

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.860
to help people build
extraordinary applications.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.980
And so there's so many
pieces of building something.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.780
And the back end is just so
easy to get wrong, or so easy,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.537
you can just spend so much time.

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:24.620
I remember one time I was
building an Angular app.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.830
And I was so excited.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.580
I was like, I'm going
to write directives,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.630
and I'm going to build
this cool web app.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.905
And then I spent an
entire month just

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:33.280
building out the
back end for it.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.738
And then I realized, I haven't
written a line of JavaScript

00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:36.240
yet.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.470
And so in Firebase, you
don't have that problem.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.980
You can just
immediately start doing

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.630
what the user's interested in.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.510
Because the user is only going
to see the client side stuff.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.246
Like I always say,
you're never going

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:50.130
to get an email from an app
reviewer or someone saying,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.340
like, hey, man.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.990
Your app is so good.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.270
I can tell you used
so many databases.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.100
It's really awesome.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.560
They're just going to tell you--

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.415
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm going to
review your app with that now.

00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:02.623
DAVID EAST: If you ever get
that review, let me know.

00:04:02.623 --> 00:04:04.100
I would love to see it.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.440
But most people are going to
say, the gestures were great,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.850
or it was really responsive,
I loved this feature.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.440
That's what people
really care about.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.010
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I mean, I've worked

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.280
for middleware companies.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.095
And whenever we built
apps, it was a case

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:18.220
of we designed all the
middleware brilliantly first

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.460
and then the app was like the
thing that came at the end.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.530
And I've worked in
purely mobile companies

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.800
and we were building
mobile apps and then

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.020
the middleware was the
thing that came at the end.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.080
But to be able to make
that middleware easy

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.663
with the authentication,
and of course

00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:36.325
the static hosting, which
is-- it sounds trivial

00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:38.700
and often overlooked, but it's
actually really important.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.200
DAVID EAST: Well,
the static hosting

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.350
is really awesome, because
the set up is so easy with it.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.440
There is a CLI, so you
just install it on MPM.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.670
And once you have
it installed, type

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.870
in the command Firebase
in it and that kind of

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.970
does-- it sets you up a
little file that says,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.210
this is the Firebase database
I'm going to point to.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.900
Or this is the URL I'm going
to set up and everything.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.300
And then from there, you
say, Firebase deploy.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.560
And then you have a website
out on the web, just like that.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.090
And then every single
file is a static file,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.560
so we actually cache
them in a CDN that

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.540
has pops all around the globe.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.980
So wherever your users are
viewing your site from,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.594
it's delivered to them from
whatever that local pop is.

00:05:20.594 --> 00:05:22.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: So for a
developer to get started,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.680
Firebase.com,
tutorial's on there.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.650
I know you've written
a series of tutorials

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.470
on some various sites, right?

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.220
DAVID EAST: Yeah, I
mean our documentation

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.630
is one of the
things that we just

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.880
pride ourselves on so much.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.546
It was one of the
first biggest projects

00:05:34.546 --> 00:05:37.370
I was on when we joined.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.560
We have a quick start,
so you can get started

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.410
any platform in five minutes.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.650
And then after that, we
have your 0 to 60 guide,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.930
or you can go from knowing
pretty much nothing

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.480
to being an absolute pro.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.250
And we actually take
pride in the fact

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.562
that they're written for humans
and not for technical geniuses.

00:05:55.562 --> 00:05:56.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: Non-humans.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.620
DAVID EAST: Yeah,
non-humans, exactly.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.210
Cool.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.120
Well, thank you, David.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.703
Learned a lot.

00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:02.300
I'm going to go check
out Firebase.com

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.270
and see what I can write
with Firebase in it.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.370
DAVID EAST: Thanks
for having me, LoMo.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: If there's
any Googlers you'd like to talk

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.870
to, contact us on our G+ page
and we'd love to put them

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.890
in front of the camera.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.740
Thanks again.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.600
And happy coffee.
