00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.670
Let's think about what might
happen in the United States

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.530
if the dollar is allowed to
weaken relative to the yuan.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.250
So the most obvious thing
is that Chinese imports

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.455
will become more expensive.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.300
A less obvious effect
is whether that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.950
will reduce the demand
for Chinese imports,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.660
or whether that will have any
impact on American inflation.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.450
The reason why
that's not as clear

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.230
is when you go buy your
cell phone carrying case

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.130
at your cell phone store,
and you pay $30 for it,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.970
that $30 is not the cost that
some Chinese manufacturer is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.830
getting for it.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.550
That Chinese manufacturer is
probably charging on the order

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.060
of $0.60, or maybe $0.80, or
a dollar to produce that cell

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.734
phone case.

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:54.400
The rest of the money
that you're paying

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.500
is really going to the
retailer, or to the suppliers,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.010
or it's there to essentially
pay for shipping costs

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.650
from China to the US.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.120
So this $0.60, which was how
much it cost to make this

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.930
in China, if this
now goes up to $0.80,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.850
or if this goes up to $1.00 it's
not clear that this price even

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.480
has to change, or even if it
were to change from $30 to $31

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.980
it's not clear that that
would affect demand much.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.210
Now the impact that the
weakening of the dollar

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.600
would have on
inflation is the idea

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.450
that all imports would
become more expensive.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.360
So all imports, potentially.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.860
And this depends
how other countries

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.570
react to the weakening dollar.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.550
But all imports could
become more expensive.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.790
And probably the most important
import, and once again, this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.620
depends on how these
currencies react

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.070
to some of the oil
producing currencies--

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.370
oil producers actually
peg to the dollar--

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.570
so it might not be as
dramatic as you would think.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.310
But in general, if you have
a weakening dollar, the most

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.620
important, from an
American point of view,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.000
the most important
import of all,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.880
will probably on the margin
become more expensive.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.330
And that is oil.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.200
We also potentially
will have one less buyer

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.490
going out there and motivating,
or at least directly buying,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.120
or motivating other
people to go buy US debt.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.060
So debt might become
more expensive.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.900
So debt could become more
expensive in the United States.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.500
And when I say debt
becomes expensive

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.041
that means that
interest rates go up.

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:32.000
And of course, this is
hugely dependent on what

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.100
the US Fed does.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.850
It could step in.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.920
It could continue
to print more money

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.690
and essentially
keep the debt cheap.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.139
But it doesn't look
as good optically.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.430
Now the last, and probably
the most important question,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.955
and this is to some degree once
again, not a clear cut answer,

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.760
is what happens to
US manufacturing?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.580
The argument has been
to that essentially,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.127
China has been able
to a produce cheaper

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.460
than they would have even
naturally been able to produce

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.360
by keeping their
currency devalued.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.395
That's allowed them
to essentially steal

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:04.970
an industrial base
from the United States,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.550
to deplete the industrial base.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.070
Will this come back?

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.650
Will some of this come back
from China or other countries?

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.760
And it is true, a
weaker US currency

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.760
will help the US exports.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.230
But what's less clear
is whether industries

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.900
that are labor dependent, and
require maybe huge amounts

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.470
of skill, whether those are
going to come back from Asian.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.840
I suspect, like I said
in the video on China,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.230
that those are either going
to probably stay in Asia.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.510
Or if we had to think
about where they might move

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.450
if the Chinese
currency got stronger,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.350
I would think that other parts
of Asia, maybe South Asia,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.515
or maybe Latin America.

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:44.740
If they can get
their act together.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.710
Those are maybe more
natural places to go,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.540
because they have
the cheap labor.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.682
They have lower standards
of living right now.

00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:52.390
And what they would
need to do to compete

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.800
with China in particular
is essentially

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.840
have the infrastructure,
and the systems,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.750
and the efficiency,
and the scale in place

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.930
to compete effectively.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.640
So these are probably
the people that China

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.820
has to worry about the most if
they devalue their currency,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.140
not so much the United States.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.040
Although will help US
manufacturing on the margin

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.820
to have a weaker currency.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.970
