Okay, I have loaded a timeline trace I have saved from an earlier session.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.029
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait. You can save timeline traces?

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.960
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. It's a pretty awesome feature.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.360
You can just right click on the timeline

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.820
and save any trace. Similarly, you can load

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.620
a trace from a previous session in the

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.120
same way. This is a really useful feature

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.900
whenever you're debugging a site, and want to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.090
keep it for further analysis or if you need to share it with someone. Hm. Wow.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.890
All right, I've been taking screen shots. Really wish I'd known about his early.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, traces are definitely better than screen shots. I've

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.590
put a link to the trace we're looking at here in

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.270
the instructor notes. Why don't you download it and open it

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.211
on your machine to follow along. I'll wait a few seconds.

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:44.179
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:50.310
Okay. Let's look for some CSS events in this trace. First, you can see the CSS

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.450
requests going out. Note that it happens after

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.960
the first trunk of HTML, is received. This

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.620
is where the parser finds the link tag

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.660
and initiates the CSS request. Then we wait

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.390
to get the css bites and finally a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.190
bit later we see the recalculate style event which

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.000
is were we convert the css response into the css

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.270
object model. In this particular case the css is tiny so

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.650
it only takes a few milliseconds to do the conversion,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.570
but for larger style sheets this could definitely take much longer.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.220
&gt;&gt; Okay, so before I rewrite all of my css rules. I should

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.750
probably record the timeline and check out how long this stuff is taking, right?

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.330
&gt;&gt; That's right. Measure first then optimize as needed.
