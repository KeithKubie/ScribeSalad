JUDY FAN: RGS stands for
Resident Graduate Student.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.550
We live in the dorms
with our advisees,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.600
which is often shortened "zees."


00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.880
We work together with the
RCAs, the Residential College

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.690
Advisers as well as the Peer
Academic Advisers, the PAAs,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.030
to form these coherent
advising groups.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.900
And we play the role
that's somewhere

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.150
in between upperclassmen
and faculty.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.370
NATALIA CORDOVA: We organize
activities for them.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.020
We give them food
a lot of times,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.920
but also other fun activities.


00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.380
XANDER SLASKI: So we've done
a bunch of outdoor activities.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.600
So we did whitewater rafting.


00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.950
We have done quite a few
local hikes in the area.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.490
We've done rock climbing.


00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.780
We've done bike trips and
all sorts of different things

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.690
like that.


00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.110
ALEX PIOTROWSKI:
I feel like being

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.310
an RGS adds a whole new
dimension to my life,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.570
whereas normally during the
day, I'm just doing my work,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.300
focusing on my thesis.


00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.330
It's nice to get to know people
who are doing something totally

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.770
different, be inspired
by younger students,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.390
and hopefully, be able to
give back to the community

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.610
some of my experiences that
I've had being an older student.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.940
JUDY FAN: For some who
are considering majors,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.060
there are so many possible
majors, they can choose from.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.720
Psychology or neuroscience
may be among them.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.840
Some will come to me and
ask about whether it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.110
a good idea, what classes
tney should be taking,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.940
or how they can get
involved in research.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.970
Those are all things
I'm super excited to be

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.490
able to talk about,
and share with them,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.750
and help them navigate
all those choices.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.540
BRENNAN MCDAVID: Now that I've
been here for several months,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.500
I've realized that the
greatest value that I've

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.440
derived from being
here is the ability

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.410
to see a side of
Princeton that is

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.870
otherwise unaccessible
to graduate students.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.260
I really feel like I understand
why the undergraduates come

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.440
back to reunions year in year
until they're 70 years old.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.820
Now I really
understand why they're

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.070
so passionate about the school.


00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.540
I'm becoming increasingly
passionate about Princeton.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.540
SIMON CULLEN: I think my
favorite thing about it

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.870
has been just getting to
know the students-- not

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.660
a whole lot of them, but a
pretty good group of students

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.760
that I now consider my friends.


00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.440
ADEDOYIN TERIBA:
Being an RGS has

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.340
been such a wonderful
experience that I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.100
know that I want to
be a professor because

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.530
of the experience.


00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.740
But I don't think
I would have had

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.550
the love I have for
the teaching profession

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.890
without the Resident
Graduate Student position.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.010
So it has expanded my view.


00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.320
And in a sense, I feel
like I am a born teacher.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.190
I feel like being an RGS
has contributed to honing in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.230
for me what I want to do.
