00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:01.801
- [Voiceover] The table above,

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.741
I put it to the left here

00:00:02.741 --> 00:00:04.924
so that it all fits on this screen.

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:06.503
The table above shows the results

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:08.859
of a 2007 observational study

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.542
that looked at the birthdays

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:12.562
of the players on the amateur

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.941
Canadian youth hockey championship team.

00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:17.926
Based on the results of this study,

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:19.864
which of the following conclusions

00:00:19.864 --> 00:00:21.025
are valid?

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:22.500
So, we look at the different players.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.881
So this is player number nine,

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.657
born on January 4, 1988.

00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:26.760
Player number 16,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.163
born on January 10, 1987.

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:30.963
So, we have the birthdays

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:33.795
of all of the different
players on the team

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:34.863
and we need to make,

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:37.359
let's see, what are these
conclusions talking about?

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.180
There is an association between players

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.061
being on the 2007 amateur

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.278
Canadian youth hockey championship team

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.459
and being born between January 1

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:51.162
and June 30 in their year,

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:53.798
in their year of birth.

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:55.678
Alright, so it looks like
we're going to try to find

00:00:55.678 --> 00:00:57.234
some relationships,

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:58.720
some association

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.995
between when you're born

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:03.932
and your odds of being on this team.

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:05.198
So let's see, let's see.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.995
There's no association
between players being on,

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:11.151
between players being on the 2007 amateur

00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:13.173
Canadian youth hockey championship team

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.611
and being born between January 1

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.571
and June 30 in their year of birth.

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.416
Canadian hockey players
born in 1987 are more likely

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:23.354
to become professional hockey players

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:27.917
than Canadian hockey players born in 1989.

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.018
More players on the 2007 amateur

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:32.653
Canadian youth hockey championship team

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:37.250
were born in 1987 than any other year.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.780
So, let's, let's actually,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.000
since we're talking about
associations between

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.591
when your birthday was,

00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:43.508
whether it's some kind of the first half

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:44.491
of the year

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:45.299
or what year it is.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.338
Let's actually do a little bit of a,

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:48.209
and look, everything is,

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.445
they're not saying
associations between January

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.097
and February.

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:51.088
They're just really talking about

00:01:51.088 --> 00:01:52.830
the first half of the year

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.325
or comparing from one year to another.

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:55.520
So actually, let's,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.998
let me make a plot here.

00:01:57.998 --> 00:02:02.477
So, I'll do a little bit of a,

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:05.913
I'll, let me do a little
histogram right over here.

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:06.807
So, let's see,

00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:08.653
we have people born

00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:10.115
as early as 1987,

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:13.134
going all the way to 1989.

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:15.769
So let's just talk about
the two halves of the year.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.310
So let's say that this is first half.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.086
So this is, you know,

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:23.020
kind of, let's say one,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.020
1/87 to 6/87.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.012
So this is the people
born in the first half

00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:32.486
of 1987.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:37.486
This would be 7/87 to 12/87

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:38.488
and that's the people born

00:02:38.488 --> 00:02:40.612
in the second half of 1987.

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:42.551
Then you have,

00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:47.551
you have 1/88 to 6/88,

00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:50.108
first half of 88

00:02:50.108 --> 00:02:53.104
and then you have the second half of 88.

00:02:53.104 --> 00:02:58.104
So 7/88 to 12/88

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.824
and then, I'm going off the screen here,

00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:01.625
let's just go

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.202
because we do go all they way to 89.

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:06.187
So then you have,

00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:07.684
then you have,

00:03:07.684 --> 00:03:09.565
you have 1/89.

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:13.721
So January of 1989 thru June of 89.

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.459
So the first half of 89

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.399
and then the second half,

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.325
7/89 to 12,

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:20.219
whoops,

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.017
to 12,

00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:25.478
to 12/89.

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:26.557
So, let's see how many people

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:27.718
there are in each of these.

00:03:27.718 --> 00:03:29.158
So, in this first group

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:30.226
and I'm going to color code it,

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:31.677
this first group right over here,

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.778
first half of 1987.

00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:35.380
First half of 1987,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.636
player number 16 is January 87.

00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:40.999
This is January 87.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.845
This is March 87,

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:44.064
so that counts.

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:46.037
This is before June.

00:03:46.037 --> 00:03:47.024
This is, let's see,

00:03:47.024 --> 00:03:49.636
we have one, two, three, four players.

00:03:49.636 --> 00:03:54.535
So I can maybe say one,
two, three, four players.

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:56.985
And now let's say second half of 87.

00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:57.856
So, let's see,

00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:00.560
out of the 87 folks,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.520
there's two folks in the second half.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.574
So one and two.

00:04:06.574 --> 00:04:07.178
Now let's,

00:04:07.178 --> 00:04:08.919
now let's look at 88.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.463
So, first half of 88.

00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:15.463
There, there, there, there.

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.022
Yep, those are,

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:19.460
so there's one, two,
three, four people born

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.925
in the first half of 1988.

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:23.431
Now let's see,

00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:24.974
second half of 1988,

00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:26.913
it doesn't look like we have anybody.

00:04:26.913 --> 00:04:28.933
And then we just have one more person

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:30.639
whose born in the first half of,

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.470
born in the first half of 89.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.560
So, March 89.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.031
So they're born in the first half of 89.

00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:41.180
So just looking like,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.900
looking at this,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.512
in 1987 you have disproportionately

00:04:44.512 --> 00:04:46.880
more people born in the
first half of the year

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.878
than the second half of the year,

00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:48.656
which wouldn't be true

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:49.434
of the general population.

00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:50.479
The general population,

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.477
I don't know the data for sure,

00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:53.973
but I would expect that it's
more evenly distributed.

00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:55.157
We see in 88,

00:04:55.157 --> 00:04:56.690
everyone is born in 1988

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.756
was only born in the first half.

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:00.939
And then in 89 we only
have one data point,

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.075
but they were born in the
first half of the year.

00:05:03.075 --> 00:05:04.270
So, let's look at this.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.919
Let's look at these choices.

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.496
There is an association
between players being

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:09.878
on the 2007 amateur

00:05:09.878 --> 00:05:11.967
Canadian youth hockey championship team

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:13.929
and being born between January 1

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.576
and June 30 in their year of birth.

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:17.632
Yeah, it looks like it.

00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:20.049
It looks like, you know,

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:22.090
they have disproportionately many people

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.669
born in the first half of the year.

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.074
So I like this statement.

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:26.072
We see that here.

00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:28.092
87, disproportion in the first half.

00:05:28.092 --> 00:05:29.671
88, everyone's in the first half.

00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.947
89, everyone's in the first half.

00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:33.769
There's no association between players

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:36.613
being on the 2007 amateur

00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:38.331
Canadian youth hockey championship team

00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:39.736
and being born, essentially,

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:40.630
in the first half of the year.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.686
Well, we just,

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:42.847
you can't pick both of these.

00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:45.169
Only one of these two
are going to be true.

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.572
Canadian hockey players born in 1987

00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:50.532
are more likely to become
professional hockey players

00:05:50.532 --> 00:05:53.365
than Canadian hockey players born in 1989.

00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:57.068
Well, were not talking about
professional hockey players.

00:05:57.068 --> 00:06:00.249
We're talking about the youth
hockey championship team.

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:01.712
So, I really wouldn't be in the mood

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:02.571
to make any statement

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.825
about the probability of people

00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:05.810
becoming professional hockey players.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.448
You might say, okay,

00:06:06.448 --> 00:06:07.807
if you're on the youth team,

00:06:07.807 --> 00:06:09.327
you're more likely to become professional,

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.414
but once again, the only reason why

00:06:11.414 --> 00:06:13.913
you had more people in 87 than 89

00:06:13.913 --> 00:06:15.364
is that we're looking
at the championship team

00:06:15.364 --> 00:06:17.407
for a particular year

00:06:17.407 --> 00:06:18.545
and in a particular year,

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.823
of course you're going to have more folks

00:06:19.823 --> 00:06:21.145
from, in the older years

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:22.028
than in the,

00:06:22.028 --> 00:06:23.107
than the folks who are younger,

00:06:23.107 --> 00:06:25.905
but than the championship
team in two years

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:27.743
is going to have a bunch of people from 89

00:06:27.743 --> 00:06:29.631
as these people mature.

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.073
And we definitely can't
say anything about,

00:06:31.073 --> 00:06:32.847
now that's just the
youth championship team,

00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:35.924
we're not saying anything about
professional hockey players.

00:06:35.924 --> 00:06:39.186
More players on the 2007 amateur Canadian

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:40.045
and actually, you know,

00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:40.881
we can, let's see,

00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.727
more players on the 2007 amateur

00:06:42.727 --> 00:06:45.385
Canadian youth hockey championship team

00:06:45.385 --> 00:06:46.882
were born in 1987

00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:48.705
than any other year.

00:06:48.705 --> 00:06:50.226
Well, yeah, this data is literally

00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:52.989
for the 2007 amateur

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:54.823
Canadian youth hockey championship team

00:06:54.823 --> 00:06:55.868
and we do, indeed,

00:06:55.868 --> 00:06:58.201
see that more folks were born in 1987,

00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:00.105
six folks were born in 1987,

00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:02.200
than the four in 1988

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.201
and the one in 1989.

00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:08.185
And so I think that is a fair,

00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:09.566
this right over here is a fair statement.

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:11.169
And this is just for the 2007 team

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.003
and it'll change for the 2008 team

00:07:13.003 --> 00:07:13.757
and the,

00:07:13.757 --> 00:07:15.499
and the 2009 team.

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:17.739
And so, I like one and four

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:19.097
and they have a choice

00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:21.077
that is one and four.
