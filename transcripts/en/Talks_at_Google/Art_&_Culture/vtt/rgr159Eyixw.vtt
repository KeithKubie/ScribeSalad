00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:08.119
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.860
SPEAKER 1: Welcome to the stage.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.660
We have got the director
Scott Elliott, hi.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.480
And actors, yes--

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.428
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:19.700
SPEAKER 1: Actors, yay!

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.920
Actors Annapurna Sriram,
said that correctly, yes.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620
And Matthew Broderick,
and of course,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.270
actor/playwright Wallace Shawn.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.920
So I actually want to start out
reading a quote from Zachary

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.560
Stewart from Theater Mania.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.710
"'Evening at the Talk House'
isn't really a disturbing look

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.306
at our possible near future
but our very real present."

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:47.950
I'm going to let that
sit for a second.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.740
Have you heard that?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.570
WALLACE SHAWN: I am
not allowed to say.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.750
SPEAKER 1: Well, I guess for
the benefit of the audience,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.050
can you give a little
bit, a brief synopsis

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.030
of the story of what
the show actually is?

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.110
As the playwright?

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.490
WALLACE SHAWN: OK, why me?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.440
But I'll try.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.310
Well, like everything
I've written,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.940
it's actually more
interesting than it sounds.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.560
It's very boring to describe.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.060
But there's a
group of people put

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:40.640
on a play in a made-up country,
I suppose, 10 years earlier.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.400
And somebody has the idea
to have a reunion of people

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.740
who worked on the play.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.930
And so they decide they're
going to meet in a club

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.560
where they used to
go after the show.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.700
And there's one guy
who wasn't invited,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.250
but who's there anyway.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.660
SPEAKER 1: Your character.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.560
WALLACE SHAWN: And there are
two people who work in the club.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.120
And there are five people
who are getting together.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.915
And during the 10 years, a lot
has happened in that country.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.060
Some people, some
of the five people

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.790
have gone way up in the world.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.920
And well, theater has
kind of faded out.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.740
There isn't any theater anymore.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.480
But the writer
and the main actor

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.940
have gone way up in the world,
working on a television show.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.590
And then three of the
people have gone way down

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.850
in the world.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.830
And the world has changed.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.730
And that's the setting
of the play, I would say.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.292
SPEAKER 1: So what exactly
is the Talk House then?

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.750
WALLACE SHAWN:
Well, the Talk House

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.600
is a club that has seen
much better days it's

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.648
in a sort of theatrical
neighborhood.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.290
As theater has declined,
so has the club.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.720
It's a shell of its former self.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.930
But they keep it going.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.900
SPEAKER 1: So the Talk
House, the whole theater,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.320
Matthew Broderick's
character is the playwright.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.077
It starts out the whole
thing with this monologue

00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:50.160
that seemed to go forever.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.618
I didn't know if
the whole show was

00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:54.020
going to be a
monologue, which I was

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.220
like, that was just amazing.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.445
Props to you for
remembering all of that.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:57.944
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.944 --> 00:03:59.740
MATTHEW BRODERICK: More or less.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.080
SPEAKER 1: Do you ever screw
up the lines every night?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.937
And does Wallace come and
beat you with a hammer?

00:04:05.937 --> 00:04:08.270
MATTHEW BRODERICK: No, he
doesn't beat me with a hammer.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.310
But I pretty much don't
screw up the monologue.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.779
I'll miss a few words
or a few sentences.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.170
The first couple of
times I definitely had

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.450
to stop a few times.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.420
But Wally is sitting, as
it's staged, right next to me

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.970
or very near me.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.690
You know the writer
is right there,

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.340
so you're trying
to say it properly.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.380
And I always have in my head
that if I got very mixed up

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.510
I would just turn to Wally.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.390
He knows this and that he
will tell me what's next.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.866
SPEAKER 1: Has
that ever happened?

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:47.490
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
Not so far, but I'll

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.617
make it happen by
talking about it.

00:04:50.617 --> 00:04:52.700
SPEAKER 1: It's in here,
so the energy stays here.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.660
MATTHEW BRODERICK: It's 11 pages
without anybody else talking.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.454
So it takes a while to learn.

00:04:58.454 --> 00:04:59.870
SPEAKER 1: Right,
and that's what?

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.453
That's about--

00:05:00.453 --> 00:05:03.880
MATTHEW BRODERICK: See
I wish I had this thing.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.710
Then it would be
a piece of cake.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.314
SPEAKER 1: This is
saying it as we say it.

00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:09.230
So it's one of those--

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.796
MATTHEW BRODERICK: It would
have to work in a slightly

00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:11.945
different way in order to--

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.640
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, this is
feeding me all my lines.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.720
MATTHEW BRODERICK: I can't tell
what's coming first, me or it.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.702
SPEAKER 1: Getting back to
the actual show, I guess.

00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:31.500
I mean, we could talk about
open captioning all day long.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.380
It's very cool.

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:36.800
I mean, I don't want to
give away too many spoilers,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.300
I guess.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.240
I don't want to give
away any spoilers, but--

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.180
WALLACE SHAWN: Well, I
mean, does it matter?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.760
Because in a way the play is--

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.880
SPEAKER 1: By the time it's
written, it's already happened.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.340
WALLACE SHAWN: The play--

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.580
don't know-- I mean, the play
is sold out for the last week.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.870
So it's only playing one
more week and it's sold out.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.350
So in a way it doesn't matter.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.499
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.540
MATTHEW BRODERICK: We'll
do it for you right now.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.340
WALLACE SHAWN: Yeah,
I mean, so I'll

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.083
be a little more
forthcoming, should I?

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.205
SPEAKER 1: Yes, go ahead.

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:17.580
WALLACE SHAWN: It
doesn't matter.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.312
SPEAKER 2: Or extend the run.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.770
SPEAKER 1: Or extend
the run, yeah.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.260
WALLACE SHAWN: Well,
that would be great.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.040
We can't do that.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.540
And when--

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.115
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:31.930
I mean one of the sad things
about New York theater is--

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.730
I'm not saying the play--
it's sold out possibly

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.250
for reasons that have nothing
to do with anybody liking it.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:44.105
But it is a sad fact
that a play like this--

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.700
there possibly
was a time when it

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.220
could have moved to a
somewhat bigger theater

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.160
and played for
another few months,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.710
and more people
could have seen it.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.397
And now the economics
of the New York theater

00:07:05.397 --> 00:07:06.730
make that completely impossible.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:12.730
You either have to
do this limited run--

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.370
we've done six weeks--

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.520
or be on Broadway,
where you have

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.850
to convince 1,000 people to
come every night for a year

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.460
or something in order to
make it pay for itself,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.270
including people who
wouldn't like this play.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.500
Sad story, but anyway.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.300
I mean not to be self-pitying.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.850
It's just sad.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.730
Well, it is self-pity, I guess.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.270
The play turns out to be--

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.210
the world that you see in
the play is quite grim.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:02.790
And people who read the
newspaper occasionally

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:08.760
say it reminds them of the
times that we're living in

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.480
or what Trump would
like the world to be

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.815
or something like that.

00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:25.297
It has a-- people come out
saying well, that was creepy.

00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:27.630
SPEAKER 1: So that actually
got touched on a little bit,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.907
I guess.

00:08:29.907 --> 00:08:32.240
I couldn't quite figure out
until I was reading up on it

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.900
a little bit more afterwards
if it was like a slightly

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.887
different parallel universe.

00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:39.470
Like if you believe
in the multiverse,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.780
if we're just like
one iota over.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.680
And this just got a little
more creepy in one direction.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.500
Or if it was sort of
a dystopian future,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.240
maybe even no less
than 20 years from now.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.960
Scott, as the director, it's
not exactly clear in the writing

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.100
from my perspective--

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.266
I don't know if you were
trying to make it that way,

00:09:03.266 --> 00:09:04.430
apologies if you did--

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.490
but like from your
perspective as a director,

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.110
did you take the
action, did you take

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.080
the flow of the show
in any particular,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.920
I guess one or the other of
either present but different

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.020
or future?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.760
SCOTT ELLIOT: Well,
I don't really see it

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.030
as futuristic in that way.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.070
I never saw it that way.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.800
I saw it as a--

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.410
I sort of pretended
like it was today.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.400
And when little
bits of information

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.760
came out that sort
of lets people

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.770
know that it isn't today,
I think it creates--

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.840
it makes everybody
that's watching

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.950
it feel that quite possibly
it could be tomorrow.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.620
And that's sort of the
take that I had on it.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.109
And as far as hinting
to the future,

00:09:56.109 --> 00:09:58.400
I made a decision to not hint
to the future in any way,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.960
except for those--

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.250
well, there's a set.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.010
And there's theater posters
around the top of the set.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.710
And for those people who
might know about that world,

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.730
there's several posters that--

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.190
plays that have never
actually happened.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.890
So that was the sort
of wink to the future

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.540
for people who might know that.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:24.550
But I sort of see the play as,
you know, that it feels close.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.070
It felt close to me,
considering the political--

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.050
especially considering that
when we started working on it

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.710
was right in the
middle of the election

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.350
and, I mean, I think
we were rehearsing

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.690
during the inauguration.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.030
But we decided to do the
play quite a long time ago.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.970
And Wally wrote the
play several years ago,

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.280
and the fact that
it felt so urgent

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.100
made it exciting and also
a little creepy and scary.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.515
SPEAKER 1: Was it written
for you and The New Group?

00:10:56.515 --> 00:10:58.640
SCOTT ELLIOT: Yes, he wrote
it specifically for me.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.210
No, the play was done at the
National Theater in London

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.780
first.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.680
It was always the plan to do
it at The New Group in New York

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.675
after.

00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:09.800
But he didn't-- I don't
think-- you didn't write it

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.600
for a specific theater,
he just wrote it.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.260
And then that was
just what happened.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.000
But we didn't do it in
London, a whole other group

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.840
did it in London.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.670
And we did it in New York.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.920
And fortunately, I think the
timing of the whole thing

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.020
worked out even better
for us just because

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.520
of the political environment.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.900
SPEAKER 1: Did you have to
change anything, moving it?

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.440
How was the theater
different from the one here?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.626
The one here,
you're looking down.

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:33.875
The audience is on both sides.

00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:35.360
SCOTT ELLIOT: Yeah, it's a
completely different staging

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.859
in London.

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:38.210
They did it on a regular
stage, like what you would

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.270
say is a proscenium stage.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.280
But here we sort of
made the decision

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.320
to, or I guess I
made the decision to,

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.090
sort of use the audience
as part of the experience.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.060
I know, you saw it, so you know
that at the very beginning,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.810
people come in.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.850
And all the actors are
already on the stage.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.310
And people are having
little snacks and drinks

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.140
with each other to
sort of warm everybody

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.140
up and think everybody was
in for some happy experience.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.980
And then they sit down, and
it sort of starts happy.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.140
But then, yeah, the
idea was sort of

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.690
to make everybody
feel a part of it.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.190
SPEAKER 1: We're dangling the
carrot of all this creepiness.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.390
And they have no idea
what we're talking about.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:14.690
SCOTT ELLIOT: Exactly.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.270
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: We
can talk about it.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.073
SCOTT ELLIOT: You never will.

00:12:16.073 --> 00:12:16.999
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
I mean we can--

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:17.925
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:19.222
SPEAKER 1: We'll get there.

00:12:19.222 --> 00:12:20.346
We have 40 minutes to kill.

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:22.671
So we'll get there.

00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:23.920
We talked about the beginning.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.380
I came in and it was like
gummy worms and marshmallows

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.320
and colored water.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.850
What was the decision
behind the candy

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.107
to serve people as like
hors d'oeuvres to the show?

00:12:34.107 --> 00:12:35.690
SCOTT ELLIOT: Well,
I wanted everybody

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.890
to have a little something.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.473
And I thought it
would be nice to have

00:12:38.473 --> 00:12:41.360
something sweet, a little sweet
something before the show.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.570
And most people aren't
allergic to marshmallows

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.790
and gummy worms.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.724
But no peanuts allowed.

00:12:47.724 --> 00:12:49.350
SPEAKER 1: So peanuts
and shellfish.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.690
SCOTT ELLIOT: Yeah,
but I thought just

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.231
to give everybody
a little something.

00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:55.229
And of course there
is-- well, spoilers

00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:56.270
don't matter, as you say.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.480
But somebody is
poisoned in the play

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.310
by drinking something that
somebody on the stage, you

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.410
know, poisoned somebody.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.170
And I thought it'd be fun
to have the audience have

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:14.724
a little drink before,
too, and go home and be

00:13:14.724 --> 00:13:15.890
worried that they might die.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.416
So that was sort of--

00:13:19.416 --> 00:13:22.080
that was the idea behind it.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.020
SPEAKER 1: Well, so how
did everybody then--

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.090
and obviously we know
how you got connected.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.027
And Scott, it sounds like
you and Wally are friends.

00:13:30.027 --> 00:13:31.860
SCOTT ELLIOT: We've
done many shows together

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.330
and we're, I think,
very good friends.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.490
SPEAKER 1: So Matthew and--

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.133
so AP you want to be,
yes, to be called.

00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:41.702
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: It will
be easier than Annapurna.

00:13:41.702 --> 00:13:42.530
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.840
AP and Matthew, how
did the two of you

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.020
get connected to the show?

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020
MATTHEW BRODERICK: Duh--

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.970
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Do
you want to go first?

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.011
MATTHEW BRODERICK: Well,
do you want to go first?

00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.580
You can go first.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.700
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: I
did a show with Scott

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.640
that he directed
almost two years ago.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.714
And then it moved to London.

00:14:01.714 --> 00:14:03.130
So then I worked
on the same show.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:03.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.910
SCOTT ELLIOT: You know
that Jesse and Kunal did--

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.800
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Yeah,
I did "The Spoils."

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.029
SCOTT ELLIOT: They did
a talk here as well.

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:08.737
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:08.737 --> 00:14:09.551
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: You
might have seen it.

00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:10.650
SCOTT ELLIOT: You weren't
invited to that one.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.952
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: I wasn't
invited to that one.

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:12.820
SCOTT ELLIOT: You've
moved up in the world.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:18.430
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: And Scott
called and e-mailed me

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.250
the script and asked
me to do the role

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.360
that I do in this play,
which is a complete 180

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.560
from "The Spoils."

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.660
And I said yes, because I
love Wally and I love Scott.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.570
And I--

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:39.938
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:39.938 --> 00:14:41.146
MATTHEW BRODERICK: Thank you.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.490
And now me?

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.645
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, your turn.

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:48.186
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
I'm waiting to see

00:14:48.186 --> 00:14:49.620
what I'm supposed to say.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.770
SCOTT ELLIOT: What if it
says somebody else's name

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:52.610
while you talk?

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:53.902
That's very disconcerting.

00:14:53.902 --> 00:14:54.610
I said something.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.869
And it said Matthew Broderick.

00:14:55.869 --> 00:14:57.410
I don't want you to
have credit for--

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.993
MATTHEW BRODERICK: I guess you
guys all see this a lot so it's

00:14:59.993 --> 00:15:02.390
boring to talk about that.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.797
What happened to me is I
ran into Wally at Eataly.

00:15:05.797 --> 00:15:07.572
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:08.780
MATTHEW BRODERICK: It's true.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.240
I mean we knew each other from--

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.630
we did-- I did a film
version of a play

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.480
that Wally wrote called "Marie
and Bruce" a few years ago.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.950
So we knew each other.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.940
And then we were shopping,
and he said he had a play.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.810
It's really what happened.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.620
And this was the London version.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.490
But I wasn't able to go
to London at that point.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.990
And I think,
believe, it was also

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.360
to play the part that
you're now playing.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.000
And I stressed and stressed,
but I couldn't figure out

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.860
how to go to England.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:48.170
And then fortunately, however
much later, it got done here.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.050
And then it was
a different part.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.110
And it was Scott, who I
knew also from before.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.930
And I just--

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.120
I love both of
them, and you, too.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.851
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:04.892
SPEAKER 1: There's so much
love on the stage now.

00:16:04.892 --> 00:16:07.051
MATTHEW BRODERICK: I love you.

00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:08.259
SPEAKER 1: I love all of you.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.702
That's why you're all here.

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.077
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
I love Google.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.340
Google Docs, I like.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.140
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Gmail.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.181
MATTHEW BRODERICK: Gmail.

00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:21.000
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
Yeah, I love Gmail.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.380
SPEAKER 1: We have a
little search engine, too.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.240
Maybe you've used it.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.990
MATTHEW BRODERICK: I
don't like that part.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.790
SPEAKER 1: So Wally, did
you intend on playing Dick,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.070
or did you just want to
write it and walk away?

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.000
WALLACE SHAWN: No, I planned
to write it and walk away.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.030
And I mean this is a
question for Scott, really.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:57.210
But you know, well, Matthew and
three other very good people

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:02.040
turned down my part in London.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.355
And we were-- so there
was a kind of a--

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.660
we couldn't cast
the part in London.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:17.720
So the director
asked me to do it.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.310
And I really didn't
want to be in the play.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:29.000
Because there's a kind of
dignity involved in not being--

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.790
I mean in being able to say,
oh, yes, I wrote that play.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.430
Those other people are doing it.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.540
There is a kind of--

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:50.867
I feel that if I am involved,
it's as if somehow--

00:17:50.867 --> 00:17:52.450
I don't know quite
know how to put it.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:18:01.380
It's a feeling that nobody but
my mother would come to see it

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.930
or that I have to be in it in
order to sort of push it along.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.770
Because nobody-- a group
of people who are not me

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.390
would not really want to do it.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.460
So I find it embarrassing
to be in my own play.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.420
And I had hoped on this
occasion to not be in it.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:30.160
But I think Scott felt he
must be in it because I'm

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.880
going to change him.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.640
I'm going to make him into
a better actor of the kind

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.602
that I approve of.

00:18:39.602 --> 00:18:42.062
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:43.046 --> 00:18:51.240
And this strangely
did happen in a way.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:58.840
The response, a lot of people
have said to me, in effect,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.130
you're--

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.230
that was a very
good performance.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.278
I think you actually were
all right as an actor.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:22.715
And so I think that's why
I'm in it on this occasion.

00:19:22.715 --> 00:19:24.048
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Yeah, me, too.

00:19:24.048 --> 00:19:26.490
Scott could make
me a better actor.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.830
WALLACE SHAWN: I mean it is--

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.190
because again, I said I
don't want to be in it.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:36.840
But in this case, we didn't
audition anybody else.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.720
I mean he said no,
you have to be in it.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.050
SPEAKER 1: Did you audition
the rest of the roles, too?

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.716
WALLACE SHAWN: No,
the interesting thing

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:46.580
about this play is
we had no auditions.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:52.280
And the people,
except for Annapurna,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.460
that's what I call AP,
except for Annapurna, all

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:05.210
of the people in the play are
people who really have logged

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.110
many decades or in
that strange phrase,

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.340
they devoted their
life to the theater.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.690
Because the play is about
people involved with theater,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.070
and I think Scott
wanted it to have

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.210
a certain authenticity and a
certain knowledge behind it.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.340
I mean, in a way,
the play could be

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.250
about a group of people
working at Google

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.590
who meet 10 years later.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.270
It's not really, in some way I
mean the political story is not

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.990
really related necessarily
to their being actors.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.950
But the play has a certain--

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.720
it's a better play,
probably, because I

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.470
know something about theater,
whereas I don't know anything

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:58.720
about working at Google.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.680
So it was great then to
get a group of people

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.000
together who all have been in
those particular circumstances.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.680
SPEAKER 1: So I guess,
AP, being the one

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.380
without the decades
of experience,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.880
did you approach your character
any differently than you feel--

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.010
than the other actors
did, or are you

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.270
just sitting back
and feeling the love

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.177
and absorbing from
their wiseness?

00:21:29.177 --> 00:21:30.760
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
Well, I don't really

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.000
know how everyone else
approached their character

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.580
to know if I did
it any differently.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.212
I have sort of a strange--

00:21:39.212 --> 00:21:40.870
a stranger part.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.380
Because I don't really talk--

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.865
I'm the waitress
at the Talk House.

00:21:45.865 --> 00:21:47.990
SPEAKER 1: I think you
actually served me my water.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.110
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Yeah, and I'm
one of the slave-- servants--

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.450
In the beginning, when people
walk in and I'm serving them

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.900
and most people I don't think
even think I'm in the show.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.784
So I think they think I'm
just an usher or something.

00:22:01.784 --> 00:22:03.700
And they usually ask me
where their seats are.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:09.430
And like then they'll move
on to Wally or Matthew

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.600
and talk to them about them.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:20.290
So and then my character for
the first hour of the show

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.400
is I'm just making drinks
for the people at the party.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.250
And I'm bringing out food
and then clearing food

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:27.980
off the table.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.530
I'm really just
being a waitress.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:36.160
And then it isn't until about
an hour in that I'm actually

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.900
sort of invited to join the
discussion or join the party.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.390
And can I?

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.800
Should I reveal more?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.210
OK, so then it's
sort of revealed

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.730
that my character had
been working as-- so can I

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.220
tell some of those plot points?

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.610
OK, so there's this
sort of discussion

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.760
about this kind of
like droning, but they

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.520
call it targeting in the
world that the play's set in.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.890
And there is a heated, sort
of political discussion

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.560
about how people
feel about targeting

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.910
and who does targeting.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.510
And it's people do targeting
as like a part-time job

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.340
if they need some extra money.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.100
And then-- so when
I finally come in,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.140
I'm like a failed actor.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:25.060
And it's revealed that I had
been working as a murderer

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.859
after I was sort of a failed
actor in this 10-year gap.

00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:29.650
Because I had been a
waitress at the place.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.200
And then in that 10-year
gap, I was a failed actor,

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.991
and then I worked as
a murderer and now I'm

00:23:33.991 --> 00:23:35.140
back being a waitress.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.930
SPEAKER 1: It's the
natural progression.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.580
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
Yeah, yeah, there's

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.472
definitely a lot of like oh,
this is too close to home.

00:23:43.472 --> 00:23:50.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.820
So I think that--

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:58.390
so I have sort of a different
perspective than everyone else

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:04.360
because all the other people
are older and had more success

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.930
or are sort of able
to ignore or not

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:13.480
be as affected by the
change of society, which

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.250
involves a lot more murdering
and droning and targeted

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.420
assassination.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.890
SPEAKER 1: It's a
sport now, is it?

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.890
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Yeah,
it's kind of like, yeah,

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.000
like a video game.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.416
But it's like you can get paid
by the government to do it.

00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:29.400
That's how I imagine
it sort of is.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:35.530
So I think-- so I think I have
just a different mindset about

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.660
it all and point of
view about it all,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.720
where I'm actually
emotionally affected by it,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.500
whereas no one else seems
to really be affected by it

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.150
on a conscious--

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.050
having a conscience about it.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:53.140
So I don't know if that
answered your question even,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.210
but that's--

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.196
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:24:57.196 --> 00:24:59.284
Yeah, I think so.

00:24:59.284 --> 00:25:00.700
No, it was just
interesting to me.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.870
Because I was wondering,
I guess specifically,

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.820
that a lot of actors they'll--

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.820
especially like for deeper roles
and sort of darker backgrounds,

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.150
they'll let it affect them.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.040
And they'll get a little
bit-- in real life,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.331
they'll get a little depressed.

00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:18.940
And I mean Heath Ledger is sort
of an extreme of that, right?

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.280
But being that
your character does

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.640
go to a pretty dark
place near the end,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.210
did you do anything
differently, or you

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:33.069
carry does that carry across
it all in your real life?

00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:34.360
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: I don't know.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.400
I mean, probably.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.210
I don't know.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:43.150
I mean, I definitely like think
about things that really are

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:49.510
happening and that are
perfectly real that affect me

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.980
in my real life that I sort of
equate as equivalent to what

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.670
this person is
feeling, whether it's

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.870
police brutality or
the death penalty

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.550
or whatever it might be.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.820
And so I don't know.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.970
I sort of think that
I'm already affected

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.790
by it anyways in my
day-to-day life emotionally,

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.904
so I just have a different
place to put it, I guess.

00:26:16.904 --> 00:26:18.820
SPEAKER 1: You've got
an actual outlet, right?

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.520
I want to go back a
second to your saying

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.350
that people kind
of skip over you,

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.300
thinking that you're just
part of the house staff.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.200
Do they ever go, does
the audience ever

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.270
go, Wally, do they go
up to you or Matthew,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.060
do they go up to
you, they're like,

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.880
oh, yeah, I loved
you in that movie.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.797
Was it "Lion King II?"

00:26:34.797 --> 00:26:35.963
You were the voice of Simba.

00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:36.650
Loved you.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.980
That was great, right?

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.730
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
"Lion King I" and "II."

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.597
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:41.597 --> 00:26:43.034
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
He was the king.

00:26:43.034 --> 00:26:44.514
He played the king.

00:26:44.514 --> 00:26:46.055
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
I played the king.

00:26:46.055 --> 00:26:47.708
I played adult Simba.

00:26:47.708 --> 00:26:49.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.580
SPEAKER 1: Which is true.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.040
Yeah, do they go up and they
try to-- are you in character

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.930
talking to them or
are you just yourself?

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:01.000
MATTHEW BRODERICK: We're--
well, you can't be in character,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.570
really.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.450
People do exactly what
you said all the time.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.280
And so I don't know.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.689
I mean I could say, what
are you talking about?

00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:11.980
I've never heard of that movie.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.285
It's an alternate reality.

00:27:13.285 --> 00:27:16.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.130
I would like to
do that in a way.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.950
Because it might be
good for the show,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.030
but I find it slightly
uncomfortable to talk to--

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:30.010
I mean to talk to strangers is
always a little odd, but fine.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.900
But particularly when
you're in a costume

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.645
about to start a show.

00:27:34.645 --> 00:27:36.020
You're not quite
sure-- you know,

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.580
you're trying to think about
the, in my case, monologue

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.596
that I have coming up.

00:27:42.596 --> 00:27:45.300
So it's always a little bit--

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:50.900
I don't want to get too involved
in discussing some other job

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.290
that I did, and then
pop right into this.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:59.930
So I sort of try to stay a
little bit removed from it.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.210
But we all do it differently.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.772
You just serve them.

00:28:04.772 --> 00:28:07.070
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Well,
yeah, and tell people where

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.330
their seats are, probably.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.650
SPEAKER 1: So you know where--

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:10.090
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
I've learned it.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.875
At this point, now I know
because so many people

00:28:12.875 --> 00:28:13.586
has asked.

00:28:13.586 --> 00:28:14.060
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.290
SCOTT ELLIOT: But
Wally has a cool thing.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:15.740
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
He's very good at it.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.757
He talks to people.

00:28:16.757 --> 00:28:18.340
SCOTT ELLIOT: He
goes in the audience.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.570
WALLACE SHAWN:
Well, I mean I have

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.495
done this for a few decades.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.940
Talking to the audience
before the play is something

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.960
I've done at least
since 1990 or so.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.470
So I'm kind of--

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:49.950
well, I've always liked
to talk to strangers.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:55.030
And I mean, I grew
up in New York

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.770
and just to show you how
New York has changed,

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:06.490
my parents were very, very, very
protective of me for that time.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.300
But were not
frightened by the fact

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.950
that I would go
into Central Park

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.180
and just go up to
strangers and ask them

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.000
questions and talk to them.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.956
That was considered
not dangerous.

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:23.080
SPEAKER 1: Back in the day.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.880
WALLACE SHAWN: So yes, I do.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.800
I mean I'm not any better
at it than anybody else.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.420
I mean, I'm quite
awkward and sort of

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.950
ask dumb questions
like, I don't know,

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.490
uh, uh, where are you from?

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.370
SPEAKER 1: I think we're all
like that all the time, too.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.349
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Is
that the voice you use?

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:49.890
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
An ogre is coming.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.723
SCOTT ELLIOT: You have
an interesting thing,

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.480
because your face
is all bruised,

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.440
because he has bruise makeup on.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.820
Because he's beaten up.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.812
He's on his last leg, we'll say.

00:29:59.812 --> 00:30:01.520
WALLACE SHAWN: Yeah,
I've been beaten up.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.280
SCOTT ELLIOT: And
so it's interesting,

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.571
I've seen you say to some of
the people in the audience

00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:06.570
that you might know,
this is makeup.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.930
Some people think it's real.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.640
WALLACE SHAWN: Well, it's--

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.020
yeah.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.239
I'm more surprised that more
people aren't alarmed by it.

00:30:17.239 --> 00:30:22.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.280
Yes, and if the
other person is as

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.030
good at having a
conversation, then we

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.980
have an interesting
conversation.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:44.020
And I am quite
fascinated by the fact

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:49.380
that I could write something
and somebody else--

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:54.060
I'm fascinated if they do
understand it or if they don't.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.180
Both are fascinating to me.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.380
And the mystery of being able
to communicate through a play

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.500
is fascinating to me.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:09.000
So I'm very interested
in who these people are.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.789
And also they're
always not remotely

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:19.330
the way you think
they're going to be

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.100
when you sort of see
them and you go up

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.490
and start talking to them.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.407
It's very interesting.

00:31:25.407 --> 00:31:27.573
SPEAKER 1: So I'm going to
pause there for a second.

00:31:27.573 --> 00:31:29.510
If any of you in the
audience have questions,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.730
we have two microphones.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.880
So please go and use the mic
so we get it on the recording.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.340
And I want to come back to
what you were saying, though.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:42.824
Do any of the four of you ever
get feedback after the fact?

00:31:42.824 --> 00:31:44.740
Coming up, and either
one or the other of what

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.402
you were just saying, of people
saying, that was amazing,

00:31:47.402 --> 00:31:49.360
I totally get it, I know
what you're going for.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.830
Or other people just being
like, holy crap, what

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.050
did I just watch?

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.560
Do you get either
of those at all?

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.990
What's your weirdest feedback?

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.120
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
So I'm younger.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.380
And my friends who are
all in my peer group,

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.900
you know, in their
like 20s and 30s

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.890
who come and see it, have all
across the board gotten it,

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.400
loved it.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.740
And I think when my
grandparents came,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.230
there was a little
bit more confusion.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.650
Even when my parents came,
there were more questions.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.440
But I kind of feel like-- and
I don't mean to be ageist--

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.140
but I do think
what I've observed

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.260
is that younger
people seem to grasp

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.520
the absurdity and the
message and understand it

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.020
all really clearly.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.380
And the villain,
I think, which is

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.530
this sort of older complacent
person of privilege, which

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:51.280
is a lot of what the audience
is, I think they sometimes

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.590
grapple more with what
they just watched,

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.080
if that makes any sense.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.130
WALLACE SHAWN: And
certainly the same

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:06.260
play in England,
which had a more--

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:16.350
an older, more
suburban audience,

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.720
they don't come up
to me and say things.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.660
But my friends who
are in the audience

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.920
have said that there
was a lot of well,

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.030
what was the point of that?

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:31.090
Which is what people have
said about my plays--

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.940
--really for my whole life.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:41.560
It's a very, I mean
that's very natural to me.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.790
But this audience
that's come has been

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:50.940
remarkably responsive to this.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.110
I mean that's
largely because Scott

00:33:55.110 --> 00:34:03.590
has built up an audience for his
theater over many, many years.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:04.560
And they're into it.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.276
Or they're ready to--

00:34:08.276 --> 00:34:09.900
SPEAKER 1: Take
whatever you give them?

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.300
WALLACE SHAWN: Well,
you can say what's

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.429
the point of that about
absolutely anything

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.429
if you're not making
the commitment

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:25.800
to try to crawl inside it
and see what might be there.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.969
SPEAKER 1: Scott, he said
you built up the audience.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.166
What he's referring to
is that you're also not

00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:33.540
only the director of this
show, but the artistic director

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.889
of the whole theater,
The New Group.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.300
What is the difference
between directing

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.866
and artistic directing?

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:43.199
SCOTT ELLIOT: Oh, it's fabulous.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.080
Because I don't have
to answer to anybody.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.420
It's my own thing.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.480
I can do whatever I want.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.239
But I think that, well, artistic
directing is essentially

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:51.989
producing.

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:54.090
You figure out what--

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:59.700
and I often think about
what's going on in the world

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.380
before I make the choices.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.550
Because The New Group audience,
as Wally said, is, I think,

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.440
they're a pretty
with-it audience.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.580
And I would even say that
our older audiences have been

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.140
with us for a really long time.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.760
And they're really sort of--

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.920
I call them like Peter Pans.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.050
You know, they're not
cranky old people.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.880
They're people who are
actually interested

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:26.550
and engaging in interesting
work and discussing it.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:31.380
So I think that The New
Group has become sort of-- it

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.670
continues to be new.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.860
It's sort of like the young
theater, still, in town.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.980
People often say to me-- we've
been around now 21 years,

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.414
but people often say to
me, oh, five years you've

00:35:40.414 --> 00:35:41.580
been doing this or whatever.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.038
They think that
because of the work

00:35:43.038 --> 00:35:45.120
that we do that we're
very contemporary.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.510
And that's always
sort of been my goal

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:53.940
to never go stale, because
I've watched some of my peers

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.200
struggle with that.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.210
And so our audiences
are pretty engaged.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.330
They're not coming
to fall asleep.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.190
They're coming to be engaged.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.140
They're good listeners.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.610
Which I think is so important.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.290
And I think one of the things
that hurts the world in general

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.215
is people are not
necessarily good listeners.

00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:17.790
There's a lot of--

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.290
you know?

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.681
SPEAKER 1: There's a lot
of looking down, and being

00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:21.180
on your--

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.900
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.650
SPEAKER 1: Device.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.580
SCOTT ELLIOT: Exactly.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.080
Exactly.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.630
But when you come to a New Group
show, even if it's a comedy,

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:30.454
you have to listen and engage.

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.870
SPEAKER 1: So now that it's
open, what are you working on?

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:34.430
Now that this is open
and almost closed,

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.150
what are you working on.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.410
SCOTT ELLIOT: Oh,
me, oh, goodness.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.701
Well, we have another play
running called "All the Fine

00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:42.140
Boys" with Abigail Breslin
which has just opened.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.930
And I'm prepping, I'm going
to direct the show after that,

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.000
this play called
"The Whirligig,"

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.270
by another actor-playwright,
Hamish Linklater.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.260
But he's not going to be in it.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.470
That's going to be Norbert
Leo Butz and Zosia Mamet,

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.479
and a whole other
group of people.

00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:01.520
SPEAKER 1: Maura Tierney.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.311
SCOTT ELLIOT: Yeah.

00:37:02.311 --> 00:37:05.354
And then I'm planning next year.

00:37:05.354 --> 00:37:07.020
That's sort of what
I'm doing right now.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.478
Just sort of figuring
out the shows

00:37:08.478 --> 00:37:10.160
that we're going
to do next year,

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.900
and we'll be announcing
those in a few weeks.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.860
SPEAKER 1: There've been
a lot of actor-playwright,

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.590
like that theme seems to
be recurring among-- it's

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:20.810
a group of friends.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.400
And everybody here
is now friends

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.645
and in love with each other.

00:37:25.645 --> 00:37:28.370
But do you prefer,
you personally,

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.070
do you prefer writing or acting?

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.660
Or I mean, how did
your career begin?

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.100
Because you've got credits out
the wazoo-- all of you do--

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.510
I mean, you've get credits
out the wazoo from both.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.440
WALLACE SHAWN: Well,
I started as a writer.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:54.295
And really a director,
now deceased,

00:37:54.295 --> 00:38:00.740
called Wilfred Leetch
asked me to be in a play,

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.460
even though he knew
I was a writer.

00:38:07.627 --> 00:38:11.922
And I had had no
plan really for how

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:13.130
I was going to make a living.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.770
I was just writing
avant garde plays

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:26.840
and going into debt
to friends, basically.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:36.000
And slowly realizing that that
was a poor plan for the future.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.640
And I was sort of saved
by getting that acting job

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:52.920
and finding that it seemed at
first that my acting was less

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.700
avant garde than my writing.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.090
I mean that it
was more likeable.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.650
Then in later years, it's turned
out to be basically the same.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.410
I mean that I'm an
amateur actor, apparently.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:08.970
Or at least, I'm not--

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.544
most people don't--

00:39:10.544 --> 00:39:13.264
I can't get a job is
the point I'm making.

00:39:13.264 --> 00:39:17.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.960
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.730
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, a
question over here.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.310
SPEAKER 3: So Wallace, I got
the fortune to see your play.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.435
WALLACE SHAWN: Oh, my gosh.

00:39:27.435 --> 00:39:29.191
SPEAKER 3: And it was amazing.

00:39:29.191 --> 00:39:31.191
Just I had no idea what
it was going to be like,

00:39:31.191 --> 00:39:33.255
and it was just fantastic.

00:39:33.255 --> 00:39:34.996
AP, I have a question for you.

00:39:34.996 --> 00:39:39.280
And then Matthew, I have
a stupid story for you.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.250
MATTHEW BRODERICK: Yes!

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.220
SPEAKER 3: Real quick.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.910
We were in a restaurant, I
don't know, like a year ago.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.825
And you and your lovely
family were there.

00:39:49.825 --> 00:39:51.400
And we played it
super cool, acted

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.990
like it wasn't a big deal.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.174
But like I was freaking out.

00:39:56.174 --> 00:39:57.715
And then when I went
to the bathroom.

00:39:57.715 --> 00:40:01.010
It was one of those cool like
stalls and the sink and stuff,

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.510
so everybody uses
the same bathroom,

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:05.290
a unisex I think is the term.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.750
And when I opened the door, you
were standing in front of me.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.601
And I did this.

00:40:11.601 --> 00:40:13.170
And I just walked by.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.730
And that's a stupid story
and it doesn't matter.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.690
But then when I
went to the play,

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.602
we also got tickets
to the opening show.

00:40:21.602 --> 00:40:22.560
We were at the opening.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.710
And my boyfriend made me
promise I wouldn't tell you

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.750
that story, because
it's not a story.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.506
And I didn't tell you
that story that night.

00:40:31.506 --> 00:40:32.569
And now I have.

00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:33.610
And I feel like I've won.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.032
[LAUGHTER] OK.

00:40:37.876 --> 00:40:39.694
MATTHEW BRODERICK: Good for you.

00:40:39.694 --> 00:40:41.360
AUDIENCE: And also,
you did a great job,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.800
and thank you very much.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.015
I really enjoyed your
monologue and everything.

00:40:48.015 --> 00:40:50.033
But AP, you were my
favorite the whole thing.

00:40:50.033 --> 00:40:50.908
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Aw.

00:40:50.908 --> 00:40:52.372
MATTHEW BRODERICK:
That's not nice.

00:40:52.372 --> 00:40:56.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.884
SPEAKER 3: You know
slightly favorite.

00:40:59.884 --> 00:41:03.450
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: No,
I can be the favorite.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.670
SPEAKER 3: You just captured
such a complex character

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.250
with so many emotions.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.290
And I just want to know how
did you get into the depression

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.790
that your character expresses?

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:19.810
And what does that
feel like to switch

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.810
like that, because you
seem fine and then you're

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.140
like clearly disturbed.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.936
And like what was
that swing like?

00:41:25.936 --> 00:41:28.060
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: It's
probably just what I'm like.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.260
I don't know.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.940
I don't know.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.480
I just equate it to
things that I'm really

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.050
disturbed by already.

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:44.710
And I am a pretty sensitive
person in general.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:47.190
That's something that my
boyfriend tells me a lot.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.780
That I cry about a
lot of things that

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:56.400
like you don't need to, you
know, be that affected by.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.840
I have no idea, though.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.750
Like I don't even
know why Scott,

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.350
like I don't even think I
can do the play sometimes.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.066
I'm like I don't know why I'm
doing this, and if I can do it.

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:08.690
SPEAKER 1: It's good
imposter syndrome.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.935
You'd fit in really
well at Google.

00:42:10.935 --> 00:42:14.900
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: Right, scary.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.320
I don't know.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.730
I don't know.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.880
I feel very
embarrassed right now.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.580
I don't know.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.650
I think it's pretty
important and pretty heavy

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.540
if you want to think
of it that way.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.720
And if you do, then
you can like really

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:38.850
let yourself embrace all
the fucked-up shit that

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:44.820
is our society or our world,
and I guess that's it.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.972
I don't know.

00:42:45.972 --> 00:42:47.680
SPEAKER 3: Thank you
so much, all of you.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.910
And Wallace, again.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.100
My boyfriend would
be mad to be here.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.868
He's just so excited about you.

00:42:53.868 --> 00:42:55.080
Thank you.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.766
WALLACE SHAWN: Thank you.

00:42:57.766 --> 00:42:58.474
SPEAKER 4: So hi.

00:42:58.474 --> 00:42:59.590
Thanks for coming.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.830
I feel really sad
that it seems like I

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.380
won't get to be able
to experience the show

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.030
and get to see it.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.090
It sounds like in
this world that this

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.070
is a very relevant show for New
Yorkers and Americans, and just

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.579
picturing it in the context of
the current political climate.

00:43:16.579 --> 00:43:18.120
When you guys did
the show in London,

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.550
was there actually a difference
of reaction with the audience

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.910
members?

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.910
Because you guys get a
chance to talk to people,

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.480
it sounds like, during the show.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.090
Was there kind of a difference
in reaction from the London

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.610
audience versus the kind
of how like a New York,

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.290
American audience
is interpreting it?

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:43.780
WALLACE SHAWN: Well, yes, I
mean the play, the script was--

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:54.860
well, some people have said even
that I have written other plays

00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:01.100
that they were annoyed to
see had the same anxieties

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.344
expressed in them.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:14.110
And for some reason,
I mean, I know

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:17.210
among even my own
acquaintances that there

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:22.720
are certain people who have
been pushed over a certain edge

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:31.140
by Trump, to almost
say to me, wow.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.380
The things that you've
been so stupidly,

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:43.170
boringly saying
for decades, and I

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:49.810
thought you were being
overly hysterical.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:55.830
I can't deny that you
were onto something.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:59.760
Things were not OK in
the way that I thought.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.970
I mean, people haven't put
it in exactly those words,

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.130
but pretty close.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:16.790
And weirdly, the London audience
was pre-Brexit and pre-Trump.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:23.130
So there was this ability
to sort of pretend

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.100
that it was about nothing,
and why were we watching it?

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.630
Whereas nobody, virtually
nobody, in America

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.610
is saying that.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:42.590
Certainly in New York nobody
is saying everything is fine

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:46.820
and it's all going to be
great, and why are you upset?

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.960
So that's just chance.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.660
I mean, maybe if we'd done
the play a year earlier,

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.170
that would have
been the response.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.632
I don't know.

00:45:59.632 --> 00:46:00.954
SPEAKER 4: Thank you.

00:46:00.954 --> 00:46:02.120
SPEAKER 1: Another question?

00:46:05.186 --> 00:46:07.485
SPEAKER 5: I have a
question for Wally.

00:46:07.485 --> 00:46:09.520
Well, first I want to
say thank you so much

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.730
for "My Dinner with Andre."

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.116
It's one of the most wonderful
movies that I've ever seen.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:18.850
Thank you.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:23.050
But my question was
sort of, I guess,

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:28.710
related to that, in that
you have, with that being

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:32.425
a major exception, you have
these two parallel trajectories

00:46:32.425 --> 00:46:38.170
as being like an actor in
films and like a playwright.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.090
[INAUDIBLE] writing for theater.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.170
You haven't done much
writing for film, right?

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:48.090
And I was kind of curious if
that was something you ever

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.920
intended to explore,
being involved

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.872
in the world of movies,
and whether maybe

00:46:55.872 --> 00:46:57.455
the primary reason
you haven't done so

00:46:57.455 --> 00:47:00.540
is more related to the
form of the theater

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.977
or different expectations
of the audiences?

00:47:02.977 --> 00:47:05.310
I just wondered if you could
speak to that a little bit.

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:10.140
WALLACE SHAWN: Well, this play
is does include quite a bit

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:19.310
about show business that is
based on my having hung around

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.210
in the movie and TV world.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:27.610
There's quite a bit in the play
that reflects that, really.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:39.190
I mean, the theater, and
movies, it is a very different--

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:42.190
well, I'm not in movies anymore,
because nobody would hire me.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.950
But I'm occasionally
in television.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.200
It's a different universe,
because people are

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:59.380
being paid to be on television.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:06.540
And it's saying, I don't know.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.110
People walk into the room
with a smile on their face

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.390
and a certain sense
because of that check

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:12.350
that they've received.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.650
There's a fundamental
seriousness to theater

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.690
because people are
not paid, I suppose.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.530
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: No, we're not.

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.780
SCOTT ELLIOT: But your writing
is like, "My Dinner with Andre"

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.307
could be a play.

00:48:28.307 --> 00:48:30.140
You know, because it's
so written, you know.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.870
It has like-- the
writing is so gorgeous.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:36.620
And in movies,
the image drives--

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.900
I mean the writing and
the image drive it.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.570
And I think it's so
hard to write a play.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.560
It's the hardest, I
think, to write, I think.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.550
Writing movies is--
there are programs

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.530
that can help you through that.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:55.040
But writing a play,
you have to have

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.470
the skill of being able to get
everything across in the words,

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.360
and I think it's hard.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.090
I think it's harder
than writing a novel.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.756
Or I mean, I've never
even attempted it,

00:49:05.756 --> 00:49:07.850
because I find it
so intimidating.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.327
But I have dashed off a
couple of screen things,

00:49:10.327 --> 00:49:10.910
I have to say.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.180
So it's a little bit easier.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.600
And also, movies are very
collaborative in that way.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.540
And plays are very,
very, very much

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.450
about what the
playwright is saying

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:25.160
and what the
playwright has written.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.635
In movies, they throw out the
scene if they feel like it.

00:49:28.635 --> 00:49:30.272
SPEAKER 1: And if
you do it badly,

00:49:30.272 --> 00:49:31.730
you do it again or
change the line.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.020
SCOTT ELLIOT: Exactly.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.110
You can cut around it.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:35.150
MATTHEW BRODERICK: Have
you ever written things

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:36.620
directly for the screen?

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:41.600
WALLACE SHAWN: No, no.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:50.160
I've just-- I'm too afraid
it would never be made.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.310
And that would upset me so much.

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:59.230
I've wanted to.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:00.957
I still would like to.

00:50:00.957 --> 00:50:03.140

produce, in this room.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.641
We will produce.

00:50:04.641 --> 00:50:06.494
I'm speaking for all of you.

00:50:06.494 --> 00:50:08.754
We will produce this film.

00:50:08.754 --> 00:50:09.710
There you go.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.450
You've got budget.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:13.950
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM:
We could be in it.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.450

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.285
ANNAPURNA SRIRAM: No,
no one will hire me.

00:50:17.285 --> 00:50:18.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:18.705 --> 00:50:19.830
SPEAKER 1: All right, cool.

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.030

a round of applause.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.630
