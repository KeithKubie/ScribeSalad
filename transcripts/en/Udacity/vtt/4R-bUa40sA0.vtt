00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.758
Point B over here is a relative maximum, point D is a relative minimum, and

00:00:04.758 --> 00:00:09.670
point G is a global minimum. So, just think about what the words global and

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.724
relative mean here. Relative maximum, for example, when applied to a certain

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:19.740
point on the curve implies that the y-coordinate or the output of that function

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.614
is higher than the values of the y-coordinates surrounding it. The opposite is

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:28.481
true for relative minimum. Although the graphicals all the way down to negative

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.953
infinity down here, there are other points where the graph gets to make the

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:35.693
awesome transition from having a negative slope to making a positive slope.
