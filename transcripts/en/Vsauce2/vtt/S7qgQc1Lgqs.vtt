These prototype gloves turn colors when they
detect harmful chemicals in the air.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
And a vaccine to treat the relapse of heroin
addiction has been proven effective in drug

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.509
addicted rats and they're working on starting
human trials...

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.560
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.050
A six inch skeleton found 10 years ago in
Chile has finally been proven to be human

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.070
remains and not as some had claimed - an alien.
Gary Nolan an immunologist at Stanford University

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.120
discovered the DNA was modern and high quality,
indicating that it's only a few decades old

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.260
and undoubtedly human. He concluded that the
bones were around the age of a 6-8 year old

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.780
and he hypothesizes that he or she either
died in the womb and suffered from a rapid

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.589
aging disorder or less likely lived with a
severe form of dwarfism to that age.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.530
TweetPee lets parents know when their baby
has peed. Using a device that measures moisture

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.359
and looks like a twitter bird, its been developed
for huggies diapers in Brazil. The sensor

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.080
measures the wetness and alerts parents with
a tweet or text message when their baby has

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.970
peed.&nbsp;

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.940
Terrafugia of Massachusetts is working on
making a flying car for the everyday person.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.780
The TF-X will take off vertically like a helicopter
then once in the air rotor blades drop and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.090
a rear mounted gas engine takes over. The
computer in the flying car lands it for you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.530
and there is an emergency parachute if needed.&nbsp;It
has a nonstop flight range of 500 miles and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.430
should only take 5 or so hours for the average
person to learn how to use. They expect to

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.000
start selling it around 2020 and assume the
price will be similar to any high end luxury

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.850
car.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.190
Brightest explosion ever observed! (35 billion
times brighter than visible light and 3.6

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.610
billion light years away)

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.740
Students from Royal College of Art in London
developed a set of headphones that can enhance

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.050
the user's sight and hearing. One device is
a mask that sits over the mouth and ears where

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.030
a directional microphone captures audio and
is processed to neutralize background noise.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.430
It's then passed through to the listener so
it's as if there is someone talking inside

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.340
your head. Applications are for the hearing
impaired and possibly to help children with

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.920
ADHD focus in classrooms. The second fits
over the eyes and allows the user to see special

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.560
effects. Head mounted cameras captures imagery
where it is processed and played to the wearer.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.170
Applications would be helpful for sports teams
(events) and performing arts.&nbsp;

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.810
The Bounce Imaging Explorer helps first responders
evaluate dangerous situations before having

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.080
to go in themselves. Developed by Francisco
Aguilar it has a shock absorbing shell with

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.600
6 cameras. LED's to light up dark rooms, and
a digital microphone. After synching it to

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.380
a smartphone or tablet, you throw the ball
into the dangerous area. It immediately begins

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.170
to take pictures and testing for toxins and
high temperatures. Aguilar hopes it can be

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.840
used by police, firefighters, soldiers, search
and rescue teams, and industrial inspections.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.130
New sundew species of meat eating plant found
in Japan

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.069
Xerox plans on rolling out Ignite, a service
that turns copiers, scanners, and printers

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.870
into paper grading machines. Not only will
it be able to grade papers like the commonly

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.459
used scantron system, it will have the ability
to turn right and wrong answers into web accessible

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.860
data that will let teachers know whether a
student or group of students are consistently

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.430
having trouble with certain math problems.
Making it easier for the teacher to plan lessons

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.640
and help specific students in certain areas
and tailoring homework to the academic strengths

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.480
and weaknesses.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.130
The Pallas long tongued bat eats using a really
long blood-swollen tongue. They have tiny

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.200
hairs along their tongues that engorge with
blood when they need to get nectar from a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.120
plant. The hairs act sort of like a mop grabbing
as much nectar as possible with each swipe.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.849
Previously biologists thought the hairs were
inactive and just sat there, but recent studies

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.060
have shown they are very active and the process
is the same that makes the male reproductive

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.480
organ erect in mammals.&nbsp;

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.060
Finally Vincent and Emily created by artists
Nikolas Schmid-Pfahler and Carolin Liebl are

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.860
a robotic couple made as an examination of
human relationships that react to signals

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.129
around them.&nbsp;

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:09.260
I'm gonna leave you with a legged leaping
robot and as always thanks for watching...
