00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.640
In a general sense,
the purpose of a company or

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.930
other organization is to create value.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.590
That value can be physical or
digital, intellectual or social, but

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.640
most companies or organizations
are not made with an idea of hey,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.280
I want to invest a lot of money and
waste a lot of employees'

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.649
time to make something that is
completely useless and worthless.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.330
To create value, first you need
an idea for a product or service but

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.820
having an idea isn't nearly enough.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.810
Customers don't pay for just ideas.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.670
They want to see something that does
what they need, a functioning product,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.270
a working service.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.550
An idea that you don't actually
ship is nothing but vapor water.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.480
There are often a lot of people involved
in taking a product or even just

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.800
one feature from idea to delivery and
these people have to communicate.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.470
They have to pass the product to be
from one person or team to another for

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.210
design implementation,
testing and delivery.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.850
And, in the software business,
organizations doing these things have

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.670
often fallen into a particular
pattern or anti-pattern.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.250
It's a pattern that can
really get in the way.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.160
This classic organizational structure
has strict borders between development,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.170
quality assurance,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
operations and other groups involved
in delivering a product to the user.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.800
One team finishes their part then passes
the product in it's current shape to

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.740
the next department for
the next step and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.090
no matter how efficient the process
within single departments,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.010
if there are high walls in between them
problems and inefficiencies creep in.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.360
All too often, there's not a lot of
communication between departments and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.230
the attitude might be, throw it over
the wall it's not our problem anymore,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.790
we met our deadline.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.040
And if the customer at the end
throws the product back saying,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.170
this is not what I wanted,
then a nasty cycle of blame can start.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.880
This kind of organization can
have a lot of different problems.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.720
It tends to be slow and
ineffective at delivery.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.160
It can't learn from failures because
people are blaming one another.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.050
It's hard to make changes especially
large and sweeping changes.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.350
Operational problems tend to
stack up and become worse and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.510
everybody involved is pretty unhappy.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.320
These were challenges that a lot of
organizations faced, especially as teams

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.090
and the services they ran got larger,
it got harder for them to work together.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.090
Developers and operations teams, both
technical functions in the company, but

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.169
with different interests and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.550
cultures, seemed to be
particularly badly affected.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.270
In 2009, a grassroots movement of
practitioners started that became what

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.120
is now known as DevOps.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.060
This movement is experience-based,
decentralized and open to all, but

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.620
it has gained a lot of traction
in both the open-source world and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.560
in big-enterprise companies and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.810
as the problems its solves are becoming
more and more apparent in more and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.170
more companies, so
is the adoption of DevOps growing.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.820
But what exactly is DevOps and
how does it help?
