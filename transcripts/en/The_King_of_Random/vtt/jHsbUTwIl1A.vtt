00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:11.879
Guys, in our last video we showed you how to build this Vindertech Rocket Slammer weapon from the game fortnite

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.380
Well, today we need to finish this up

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.659
We need to paint it and make it look the way it does in the game

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.850
Before we start adding paint, there's a few more steps we have to take to clean it up and really make it look nice

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.609
We've already done a little bit of cleaning using our rotary tool to take down some corners and make them look a little bit nice

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
and rounded. We need to do a little bit more of that, and then this hammer has some interesting

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.200
engraved sort-of portions that go around it. What we're gonna do to make those is take this nail, hold it in a pair of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.629
pliers, heat it up with a propane torch, and then use it to slowly melt the designs into the foam

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.159
We'll have to be careful [that] we don't melt all the way through, because repairing the foam after it's been shaped

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.920
is kind of tricky

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.800
Let's get started with a rotary tool and take down any edges that we want to have a little bit more rounded look

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.800
I think all of our engraving lines are now nicely etched into the surface of the hammer,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.560
so it's time to move on to the paint preparation

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.710
There are some gaps that I don't want in this whole hammer,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.460
so one of the steps for our paint prep is applying more of this gallery glass

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.030
I used a little bit of this before,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.010
when I was sealing up some of the cracks making the front of the head of the hammer,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.940
but now it's time to go through and find anywhere that has too much

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.020
open foam and fill that with a thin layer of this gallery glass

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.679
well, then use a heat gun on low to try and make it dry a little bit faster and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.119
after we do that,

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.569
we're actually going to hit the hole hammer with the heat gun on high

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.179
because, as I may have explained before, that helps seal up the foam and make it more ready to take paint

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.569
With the foam sealed up, we now need to hit the hole hammer top-to-bottom with a couple of layers of spray rubber

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.619
Part of the body of the hammer and a little bit of the rocket on the back seem to have a little bit of texture

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.069
So to simulate that, I'm going to take our same liquid letting

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.979
I'm just gonna use a paintbrush to apply it in one direction,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.209
and I'm hoping that my brush strokes will give it a similar texture to what it looks like it has in the game

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.549
With our texture added up here, it's time to add primer from top to bottom

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.770
The all-white version of the hammer its chiseled out of marble. You know,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.389
I'm just very strong. The whole hammer is covered in primer, and I'm ready to start applying paint,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.020
and it's a little bit of a puzzle because different parts of the hammer are different colors

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.250
The whole head here is a sort of very dark, almost-black not-quite-black that I'm gonna be painting what's called oiled bronze

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.689
These attachment flanges and the fins are the same color as the head of the hammer, as is some parts of the back

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.869
There's also a black color that will go on the bottom of the handle

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.550
There are a few little spots that are going to be a bright blue color, and those ones

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.059
I know I want to tape off because I actually want to use the white

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.579
primer as a base for the blue, because the blue is not going to show up as well if I have it dark with silver underneath

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.619
Now I'm gonna take this oil-rubbed bronze color spray-paint

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.199
and hit the head of the hammer the four fins around the sides these three supports down at the bottom and part of the back

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.049
of the rocket. While spraying that on, it's definitely going to

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.060
overlap onto parts that need to be more silver colored. What I'm just going to do is paint the parts that need to be

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.369
this color, and then I'll tape them off and I'll go over it with my silver spray paint to get all the right colors everywhere

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.699
Now we got to let this dry, mask parts of it off, and paint a whole lot of it silver

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.460
I've got my tubes that I have not yet painted or attached, and I haven't attached them yet

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.689
because I thought that having them on already would have gotten in the way of painting some of the rest of the hammer

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.489
Well let's try and turn these red, and then we can attach them to the hammer after we peel our tape off

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:28.409
I think our paint is dry

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.339
Let's start peeling all of our tape off, and hopefully

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.260
the masking tape is going to do what it's supposed to and not stick to our paint so much that it peels as well

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.120
Right now I am trying to bleed dry the ink cartridge

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.280
from a Sharpie that claims to be like a super bright neon blue, and there are brighter colors out there, but they're mostly highlighters,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.330
which aren't necessarily as permanent as I want, so I was hoping that by using a permanent marker

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.680
I would get something really stick forever. I'm not convinced that this color is actually going to be one that I really like

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.400
So I'll fill the hopper of the airbrush here, and then do a couple of tests and see what I think

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.700
The ink from the Sharpie was a pretty good color, but when I put in my airbrush it sort of started

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.600
sputtering and splattering just a little bit, and it wasn't a huge problem,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.029
but it was enough of a problem that I didn't want to keep using it

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.339
So I'm gonna toss that out and instead

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.480
I'm going to be using this alcohol ink that's used for like stamp making and stuff

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.629
I think it does a great job of just going right through an airbrush

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.409
It's very thin, and so it does a very good job of spreading nicely

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.809
It's a slightly different color with a tiny bit more green to it, but I think that will actually work out nicely

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.450
I'm leaving the middle a little bit white just to give it a little bit of that glow effect

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.349
While our paint is drying I think it's time to attach our red hoses

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.938
After peeling off the painters tape from our yellow stripes that was the last step and our hammer is now

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:47.399
fully painted and completed

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.629
There's a lot of steps to painting this as you saw, but in the end it was all worth it

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.919
I think because this thing looks totally awesome, and I am super happy with how it's turned out

00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:57.749
