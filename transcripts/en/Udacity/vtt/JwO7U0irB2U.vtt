00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Evans] So now the question is, how much harder does the addition of salt make it

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
for an attacker who wants to carry out offline dictionary attacks?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That means the attacker can pre-compute a dictionary of encrypted passwords

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then for each collected password file wants to find any passwords

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that match the values found in that dictionary.
