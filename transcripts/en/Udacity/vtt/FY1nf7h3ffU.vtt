00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The first part of the subset question asks about planar graphs and trees.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first thing to note is that not all planar graphs are trees.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For example, here's a ring, which is a planar graph and it's not a tree.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so planar graphs are not a subset of trees. On the other hand, all trees are planar graphs.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For most trees, it's fairly intuitive to see how it can be drawn in the plane.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For example, this one is already planar.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But for other trees, it might not be so obvious that we can rearrange everything

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to lay it outside in the plane, and so it'd be nice to have a proof that all trees are planar

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
instead of relying just on intuition.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
One way to prove this is to show that any tree can be drawn inside of a triangle.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And then larger trees can be constructed by combining these triangles.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
More formally, what we want to show is that any tree can be drawn in a plane inside a triangle

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
with any given node at the apex of the triangle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And so for the base case of one node, we can draw the node at the apex of the triangle

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and this is trivially in a plane.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And so, our inductive step is to assume that the claim is true for all graphs with less than n nodes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And we want to show that the claim is true for all graphs with n nodes.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So we'll start with a tree with n nodes. We use this for example.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We're going to pick any node kind of at random and we'll call it r.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
For example, one of this node be r. And then we remove r.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Because our original graph was a tree, this separates the graph into separate disjoint trees.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And now since each of these trees have less than n nodes,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we can draw each one inside of a triangle.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
First, we can take this tree of four nodes and draw it inside of the triangle.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Notice that the node that was connected to r is at the apex of the triangle.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And then we could do the same for the other two trees.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And then in our last step, we'll make a bigger triangle and we put r at the apex

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and then connect it to the apexes of the other triangles.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This verifies our claim and shows that all tree graphs are planar.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
They are definitely neither due to the definition of trees.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
A tree can have no cycles and a ring must have a cycle.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The answer is neither. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Cool.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I never got a really specific definition of a chain besides just the example which was enough but--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah, same idea kind of a chain doesn't have a cycle whereas a ring does.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And the other thing we got definitely was that the edges in the chain is the number of nodes minus 1

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the edges in the ring is equal to the nodes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Therefore, there can be no crossover between them. They're mutually exclusive.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
All chains are trees but not all trees are chains and so its the first one.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It satisfies the definition of a tree graph that it's connected but there are no cycles,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and then the other description of a tree graph that every pair of nodes in the graphs

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
has a unique path between them.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I mean a chain does that also.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This is definitely one that answer intuitively by looking at the examples.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It gives me 100% confidence in making that claim.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yeah and just kind of a quick example of--that's a tree and that is not a chain so--

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Correct. And the way I convinced myself of that is drawing an example of a hypercube

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that was not a ring and a ring that was not a hypercube.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Unless you have a ring that is anything but four nodes it's not a hypercube.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;And any hypercube that's anything but four nodes is definitely not a ring.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Great. So yeah I'll draw one for you and it's just a normal cube.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Right. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;And our second to the last problem is just grids and chains.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
All chains are grids but not all grids are chains so it's the--chains are the opposite of grids.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Any chain within nodes is a 1xn grid.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Once you get a grid that has more than one in either of the two directions, it's no longer a chain.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And no matter how long you make a chain-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yeah. So this is--

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You can add a node to the chain--a node of n to the chain, that makes it not a grid.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Kind of the first thing you said we have like a 1xn grid and it's also a chain but yeah.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Yeah. This is for example not a chain. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Correct. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Cool.
