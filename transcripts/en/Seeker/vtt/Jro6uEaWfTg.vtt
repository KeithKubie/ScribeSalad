00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.090
When you drink water, you’re drinking the
most abundant element in the universe, but

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.580
what’s really going on with Hydrogen?

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.650
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.789
You might not think about it in such scientific
terms, but you consume a lot of hydrogen,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.769
and you’re even made of hydrogen!

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.140
Which is less creepy than it sounds; you’re
not unknowingly a cyborg or anything.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.999
Hydrogen is the simplest element with just
one proton orbiting its nucleus, a simplistic

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.890
arrangement that allows it to hold the top
spot on the periodic table of the elements.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.910
It’s also the most abundant element in the
universe with helium coming in at a distant

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.910
second.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.359
When the Universe was a fraction of a second
old, immediately after the Big Bang, it was

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.530
about 92% hydrogen atoms and 8% helium atoms
by number which is roughly three-quarters

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.660
hydrogen by mass with trace amounts of other
elements.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.150
As the universe cooled, these early atoms
stabilized and cooled into gas clouds that

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.839
eventually clumped together to form protostars.

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.040
Those protostars got massive enough to develop
their own gravity, drawing other material

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.640
into them, adding mass, pressure, and heat
until hydrogen atoms are able to fuse together

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.050
to form helium.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.350
These became stars, the fusion reaction making
them bright.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.740
Heavier elements are also formed inside stars,
and when stars die and explode, they send

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.250
those heavier materials spewing throughout
the universe where they were eventually incorporated

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.250
into new stars and protoplanets that became
bodies like our Earth.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.000
So all those elements that are in stars are
in our planet as well, but not in the same

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.370
amounts.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.390
Hydrogen might be the most abundant element
in the universe but it’s pretty rare on

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.390
Earth.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.670
The name hydrogen comes from the Greek hydro
meaning "water" and genes meaning "forming,"

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.100
so its existence is linked to water as you
might expect; It’s the H in H20.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.439
But though [a][b]the cells that make up our
body have a high amount of water, hydrogen

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.280
only makes up less than 10 percent of the
material in the carbon-based human body and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.909
less than 0.15 percent of the material that
makes up the Earth!

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.840
Our planet is rich in oxygen, nitrogen — which
are the most abundant elements in our atmosphere

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.860
— and silicates, which make up the bulk
of the material in the crust.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.539
Hydrogen is largely found in compounds like
water, and what hydrogen that does reach the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.170
Earth doesn’t stick around; it escapes pretty
quickly from the atmosphere.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.030
The Earth’s gravity just can’t hold on
to it.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.960
But it’s immensely useful.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.840
Hydrogen is used in rocket fuel, welding,
the production of hydrochloric acid, and reducing

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.190
metallic ores.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.370
And as a fuel, it’s a clean fuel.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.860
Hydrogen carries energy without carbon in
it, so when it burns it produces water as

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.940
a byproduct.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.840
But there’s a chance we could get hydrogen
from elsewhere, namely off the planet, and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
use it.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.530
Companies like Planetary Resources are looking
at mining asteroids not for precious metals

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.700
but for elements like hydrogen that could
be used to make fuel, literally fueling space

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.590
exploration and potentially vehicles on Earth
as well.

So what do you guys think about hydrogen as
a clean fuel.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.560
Is it worth tapping into the literal universal
stores?
