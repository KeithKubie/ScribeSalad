00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.300
Instead of calculating precision and
recall individually and

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.320
looking at each to make a decision as
to the performance of a classifier,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.950
we can actually use at something
called the F-beta score.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.590
This is the general definition
of the F-`beta score.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.260
The beta here can have various values,
depending on how much weight

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.670
one wants to give to the precision
value over the recall value.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.130
Using a combination of precision and
recall, such as the F-beta score,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.490
can be very helpful because it gives you
one number to maximize rather than two.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.670
If you're trying to decide
between two different models and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.640
one has a higher precision but
a lower recall, which will you choose?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.200
One method would be to choose
the model with the higher area under

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.770
the ROC curve.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.330
Another method would be to choose
the model with the higher F-beta score.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.800
Now let's try to set beta equals 1.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.360
Setting beta equals 1, you can see that
the F1 score is given by this formula.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.540
This is simply the harmonic
mean of precision and recall.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.990
This kind of mean protects against
comparatively high values of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.302
one of these against the other.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:17.610
The F1 score thus weighs
the precision and recall equally.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.150
One can use different values of beta

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.850
that give different weights
to precision and recall.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.930
Much like the loss function,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.670
the choice of beta here depends on the
specific problem under consideration.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.622
We want to do a quick quiz on
your understanding of F scores.

00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:40.181
In each of the following
scenarios which choice of F1,

00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:44.680
F0.5, or
F2 be the best choice of metric?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.620
First we look at cancer detection.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.730
If someone is falsely diagnosed,
we may do some extra tests.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.383
If someone who actually has cancer
is not diagnosed, they may die.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.770
In the box give your appropriate choice.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.340
The second example is
convicting to prison.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.940
People are innocent until
proven guilty by US law.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.900
We want to avoid false convictions, but
we also want criminals to not run free.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.580
In this case,
what sort of F score will we use?
