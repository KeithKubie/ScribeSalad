In today's video,
we are going to try

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.300
and find the most extreme way
to season as much popcorn

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.240
as we possibly can.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:15.860
[Music]

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.800
Guys, awhile back,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.200
I had a roommate
who restored an old VW van,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.700
and he did a lot
of painting on it

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.300
with a gun very similar to this.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.200
It's pretty neat.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.900
It sprays out quite
a bit of paint,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.000
and distributes it nice

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.900
and smoothly better than
your average spray paint can,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.615
and I was a little bit
curious what else it

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.180
might be able to spray.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.500
And I got to say
that what I landed

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.800
on is I was curious
if it could spray butter,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.200
liquefied melted down butter.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.349
I don't know why I thought
that would be a good plan.

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:44.500
But I wanted to try it.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.158
But it's gonna be
so much butter.

00:00:46.158 --> 00:00:47.800
It's gonna be so much butter,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
and I thought what do we need
that much butter for.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.280
There's only one answer.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.000
There is.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.400
The answer is
that we need a lot of popcorn.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.487
So we're going to try that.

00:00:57.487 --> 00:00:58.158
We've got salt.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.500
How should we attach the salt?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.800
We're using the butter gun?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.400
Maybe A salt gun?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.023
This is called The Bug Assault.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.020
It's literally made
for shooting bugs.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.400
So we're going to be making
a ton of popcorn.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.700
We don't have a bowl
big enough to put this in.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.900
I don't think they make
bowls big enough for this in.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.100
But we did find something.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600
That's right.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.300
A 5-foot kiddie pool.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.800
We're going to be popping
our popcorn straight

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.700
off the counter here
down to the pool,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.685
and once it's full,
we're going to see

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.039
what we can do about spraying
out some butter,

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.404
and shooting it with salt.

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:30.700
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.347
We have got a paint sprayer.

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:34.100
We have got a bug assault rifle,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.720
and we have got
a lot of popcorn.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.130
Let's see how we can combine
these three things.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.880
So for anyone who's never seen
how a Bug Assault works,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.480
it's kind of like this.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.940
I can do this.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.100
There we go.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.540
It just sort of peppers
the surface with salt.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.779
Or in the case of a bug...

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.900
But for popcorn,
this should be perfect.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.622
This is a hot air popper.

00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:59.000
You pour popcorn in,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.458
and it blows hot air
surrounding the kernels.

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:02.800
It's not enough pressure

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.650
in the hot air to blow
the kernels out

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.700
until they pop.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550
Once it gets hot enough,
the popcorn kernels pop,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.046
and then the moving air lifts
the popped kernels

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.563
with the lower density up out,

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:13.231
and it flows normally
into a bowl,

00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.900
but we're using
pool on the floor.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:50.280
[Music]

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.060
So we started,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.234
and we went through four
of these containers.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.600
Six.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.760
&gt;&gt; There's--
&gt;&gt; Six.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.517
We went through six

00:02:57.517 --> 00:02:59.811
of these containers
in like a half hour.

00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:01.400
Each of these is two pounds.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.773
So we had 12 pounds
of uncooked popcorn,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.120
and that wasn't nearly
enough not nearly.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.780
Not nearly.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.380
So after a quick run
to the store,

00:03:08.382 --> 00:03:10.138
we have 16 more
pounds of popcorn.

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:11.294
16 pounds of popcorn.

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:12.981
&gt;&gt; I think this--
&gt;&gt; 2 new poppers.

00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:14.100
Probably excessive.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.000
One of our air
poppers burned out.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.580
So we had to get
a replacement one,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.400
and then while we're getting
a replacement, and then we also

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.500
got an additional one.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.200
So now we're up to five,
having already burned one out.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.978
So we're hoping

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:25.900
that three pounds
of butter is enough.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.966
Back to popping.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:27.380
Yeah.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.540
Pop!

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:38.000
[Music]

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.500
All right.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.040
As an update, we've...

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.900
We've now run out
of popcorn again.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.200
Fortunately, our pool
is pretty quick.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.080
&gt;&gt; This is--
&gt;&gt; 28 pounds.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.800
28 pounds unpopped of popcorn.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.940
And yeah, we have--

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.840
We've kind of filled
our kiddie pool.

00:03:51.843 --> 00:03:53.000
It's fun to see the difference.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.100
We have the yellow popcorn
that we started with,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.400
and the white popcorn that

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.700
we moved to once it ran
out of yellow popcorn.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.254
There's like this color divide.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.780
Yeah.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.900
You can clearly see
when we started using the white.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.100
Let's mix this
together a little bit.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.598
It all tastes about the same.

00:04:07.598 --> 00:04:08.398
It does.

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:10.100
All right, go for it Nate.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.200
Go.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.298
There's a warning on the pool

00:04:13.298 --> 00:04:14.700
that diving could
result in paralysis.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.792
So, this is going
to be a slow dive.

00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:18.058
Just carefully dive.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.400
I'm just gonna sort
of wade my way in.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.000
Now, what?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.660
That's going well.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.600
Hey, there we go.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.400
It spilled.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.120
I'm sorry.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.800
There we go.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.000
That's good.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.400
It's kind of warm in here too.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.700
How you doing, Nate?

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.200
Kind of popcorn -y.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.040
A bit.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.500
[Music]

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.493
What is this?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.400
It is my popcorn pool.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.100
Do you sit in it?

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.680
Do you eat it?

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.520
Sitting it, eat it.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.700
Sitting it and eat it.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.000
There's no wrong way
to use a popcorn pool.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.780
This is gonna go well.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.960
I'm just gonna...

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.900
Yep, and now just
sort of shimmy.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.220
There it is.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.000
There it is.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.800
It's kind of plain.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.600
Yeah.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.400
I need salt.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.000
Yeah.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.160
It's not gonna stick.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.980
No.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.480
I think it needs butter.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.300
Here you go.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.800
Thanks.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.200
Spill some of this on.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.700
Popcorn angels.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.000
Have you guys ever
seen that lizard

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.140
or the spider that just like...
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.060
wiggle into the sand?

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.500
It works guys.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:56.500
[Music]

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.760
Okay, here we go.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.080
We're going to start

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.700
putting butter into
our paint sprayer now.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.800
Hope this is works.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.900
I've never tried spraying butter
from a paint sprayer before.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.300
&gt;&gt; I don't know if anyone has.
&gt;&gt; I don't know if anyone ever has.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.329
I've had this thing

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.800
in like hot water to try
and heat it all up

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.080
because I don't want the butter
to start solidifying,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.100
when it starts
like spraying out,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.570
and there's going to be fairly
cool air coming out of that.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.700
So hopefully, we'll get
some good sprays of butter.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.400
Oh my gosh.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.140
That is filling
the room with butter.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.900
We're going to change
this up a little bit.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.400
We're going to try and get
this pool outside in the winter

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.300
to spray it with butter.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.500
[Music]

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.660
Okay, we good.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.480
Crushed it.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.800
Crushed it.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.380
It already smells good.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.400
Yep.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.740
[Music]

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.020
It's gonna be a nice
coating of butter.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:12.700
[Music]

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.500
While you're doing that,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.300
I think it's time
to start salting.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.617
So...

00:07:15.617 --> 00:07:16.096
Yep.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.300
Yeah, do it.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.920
Salt away.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.100
Just one piece of popcorn ping.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.540
Yep.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.700
In three days,
this will be done.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:44.600
[Music]

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.140
And stir.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.220
Here, you stir,
I'll go pop it with salt.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.420
The bug assault is fun.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.780
For a very small amount.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.300
It's not the highest volume.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.700
Okay, let's just
a give it a test.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.180
Needs a little more.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.600
Ow.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.580
Perfect.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.920
[Music]

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.100
How did--
That was--

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.140
Oh, I got lots of them
out in the pool.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:34.460
[Music]

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.300
I have to burn all
of my clothes now.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.440
Hang on.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.300
Let me see if I can...

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.400
If I can get the bottom.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.340
This is what I did
not want on my jeans.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.000
So we destroyed
the entire studio,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.700
and I thought there was
something stuck to the bottom

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.500
of my shoe.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.820
So I've been
tracking this surround.

00:08:56.823 --> 00:08:58.900
This is just packed butter.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.400
Nate.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.100
Nate, check the bottoms
of your shoes.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.100
Oh, no.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:35.420
[Music]

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.560
So that's your side now.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.420

what YouTube thinks you

00:09:51.377 --> 00:09:52.600
Hit his bomb here in the middle.

and we'll see you next one.
