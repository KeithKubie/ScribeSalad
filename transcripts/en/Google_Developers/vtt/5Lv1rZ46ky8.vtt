00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.388
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.800
My name is Daniel Hastik.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.670
I'm one of the co-founders
of Futurelytics, and CEO.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.700
Futurelytics is a
cloud-based solution.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.500
And we help companies
to build relationships

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.800
with their customers
based on their behavior

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.920
so sales and marketing teams
can approach their customers

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.890
in the proper way, at the right
time, with the right products.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.410
I guess, at the very beginning,
everyone is a little bit naive

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.650
and is getting more
and more professional.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.900
So my role at the very beginning
was more about the product-- so

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.500
how this product can
help the end user, how

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.230
we can build that,
how we can scale it,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.130
from a technical perspective.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.190
And right now, it's more
about people and the balance

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.140
within and outside
of the company.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.470
So I have to keep in
mind to whom, when,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.000
and why is it important, for
example, to share our story

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.590
and to build the infrastructure
and door openings around us

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.452
before we actually
hit that wall.

00:01:03.452 --> 00:01:05.160
For some people, it's
hard to distinguish

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.350
the value between
money and network.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.060
The most valuable part for us,
to being within the Seedcamp

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.150
family, is the network of
the portfolio companies-- so

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.980
the openness of sharing the
stories between founders,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.110
and especially, sharing
how this should not work,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.290
and the best practices and tips.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.730
And so that's our biggest--
it has the biggest

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.460
impact on the
business we have now.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.620
I guess, when you
start a company,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.220
always think about people
who have done that before.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.720
OK.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.790
Because that's the experience
which would be hard

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.110
learned by you, again and again.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.850
OK.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.500
There have been many,
many things done before.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.360
And it's going on,
and on, and over.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.486
It's just different technology
or a different market.

00:01:56.486 --> 00:02:00.480
But always look for someone
who's a little bit ahead of you

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.960
and done all the mistakes.
