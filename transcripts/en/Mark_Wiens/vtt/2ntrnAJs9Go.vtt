00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
It's Mark Wiens here. I am in Khorat, Thailand and I am at a really popular restaurant

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.500
Called Kanom Jeen Kru Yawd. It is a huge restaurant.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.240
You can see like it actually looks like it was once just a house. But it looks like they just kept expanding and expanding and expanding

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.960
that its just grown into epic proportions

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.460
So this place is huge and they are really famous for serving a dish called khanom jeen

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.910
Which are the slightly fermented fresh rice noodles and they come with curry but I've also ordered a few extra dishes

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.489
Can't wait to eat

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.190
Oh, God

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.260
So this is one of the types of khanom jeen called kanom jeen nam ya

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.060
Which is a coconut milk-based gravy should be some fish in there as well

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.200
Those are the rice noodles there, and this one here is just gaeng gai

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.489
Which is just chicken curry and that is a big lump of blood

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.809
Gelatinous jelly. One of the things that's really awesome about eating khanom jeen

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.740
is that it's always served with a, an entire gardens worth of vegetables

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.309
raw vegetables on the side and you can either put the vegetables

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.720
Directly on top of your khanom jeen or you can just eat khanom jeen and then sort of garnish your mouth

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.229
Every few bites with some of the vegetables. I think this is lemon basil. Should be lemon basil

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.750
cabbage, bean sprouts, long beans

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990
maybe pok boon or

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.320
umm or

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.900
morning glory, and then this is shaved up umm "hua plee" which is a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.099
banana flower, we not only ordered "khanom jeen"

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.680
But we also got a couple of extra protein sides this place is very well known for their "gai tod"

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.869
umm just fried chicken wings

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.219
And they are like smoldering hot right out of the oil and also I got a "pla pao" which is a roasted roasted fish

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.759
salt-crusted

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.739
I have made a recipe for this "pla pao", so if you want to click right here

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.059
umm you can check out the recipe of how you can make this "pla pao" at home

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.429
It's an awesome awesome thai way to grill a fish. I'm gonna go straight in for the "nam ya"

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.560
mmmmm....oh

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500
ohh

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.569
thats delightful. There's a real flavor in there that I

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.069
can really taste there's a certain flavor, but I'm not even sure what that is

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.609
It's like a little bit bitter

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.309
But like salty and sweet at the same time this is a common type of "khanom jeen"

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.789
But I normally have the southern Thai style. Which is a little bit different which uses more turmeric and

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.019
More thicker coconut milk, so this is a little bit different style

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.869
So I'm not sure exactly what that distinct taste is but it's awesome. I just had Ying taste it and

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.959
She told me that it is "krachai" and that yeah, that is exactly what it is. She is good

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.239
It's similar to ginger, but at the same time. It's not quite as pungent as ginger. I think

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.439
Yet it maybe has a little...it has the same kind of earthy flavor to it earthy root slightly spicy

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.469
root flavor to it. That banana flower

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.350
And a little bit of the lemon basil to top it off. Oh beautiful!  I'm going to go for that chili this bite too. oh yeah

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.830
grab one of these guys

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.480
mmmmm

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.399
That's just lightly salted and then fried fresh and crisp

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.040
That's just a good solid chicken wing I think it would be even better if I dipped it quickly in the curry sauce

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.760
Oh, yeah, that's good

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.980
put on some veg

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.039
it's more of like a sweet and salty creamy curry and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.450
Tastes a little bit like a "kiew wan". Which is the green curry Thai green curry but only it's like pink in color instead

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.229
That's good as well, but I really like that nam ya better

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.699
I'm just gonna get a piece of fish add some sauce

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.210
I'm meeting him right off,  right off the...the bone

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.800
mmmmm

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.059
I just love fish cooked this way...pla pao

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.090
Just always amazing as long as it's not overcooked which this one is not

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.140
ummm. It's just fantastic. Just a meaty

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.679
Flaky oily fish...the sauce is not the best I've had it is sour but not very spicy

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.239
But the fish is excellent. These are sai gua. Which is the lotus lotus stems, so

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
You can almost use it like a straw

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.299
a whole bunch of water just came out of that

00:05:53.249 --> 00:06:00.558
I usually have this in a curry, umm a coconut milk curry but by itself right now it actually has zero flavor

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
yeah...has zero flavor

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:12.999
It's like eating. It's kind of like celery actually has that crispness, but really basically no flavor to it

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.740
Grab some of this pla pao and I'm going to put it right into my curry

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.500
mmm

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.840
That is awesome

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.849
Great khanom jeen

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.669
And I especially loved the nam ya version with that [inaudible] as as I am sitting here

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.739
Just like busloads of people are showing up for lunch here, so this place is

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:48.829
Yeah, like I said this place is a. it's an institution in Khorat. I I guess they're famous for a reason the food is fantastic

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.740
This is a such an awesome herb. It tastes like

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.700
You're eating like dish soap, but good awesome. Fresh dish soap

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.209
that's probably not the best description I've ever made but just

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.779
kind of think of it as dish soap that's awesome.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.780
I love all this mixture of

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:24.140
I had to burp real fast. Oh, oh that was a delicious burp. Anyway, that...that flavor that earthy tone of cra chai

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.860
ohhh...you missed it

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.000
