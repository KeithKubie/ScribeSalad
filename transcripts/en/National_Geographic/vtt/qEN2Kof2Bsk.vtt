Bob Poole:
<i> Gorongosa National Park</i>

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.312
<i> sits right in the middle
 of Mozambique.</i>

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:15.648
<i> In 1964 a long war
 for independence</i>

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:17.316
<i>broke out against Portugal.</i>

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:20.620
<i> And that was followed by
 an even longer civil war</i>

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.056
<i> that lasted until 1992.</i>

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.724
<i> The armies fed off the
 wildlife in the park.</i>

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.393
<i> And by the time that
 that war was over</i>

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:29.996
<i> there was almost
no animals left in the park.</i>

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.731
<i> It was left for dead.</i>

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.669 line:0%
But then,
about ten years ago

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:41.207 line:0%
an international team,
led by this guy, Greg Carr

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.976
<i> formed a partnership
with the Mozambican government</i>

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:48.280
<i>to start a 20-year project
 to bring that park back.</i>

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:52.184
<i> When I arrived, in 2008,
 Greg flew me around</i>

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:55.521
<i>and basically what I saw was</i>

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.292
<i>one great, huge, beautiful
 African landscape.</i>

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.028
<i> I came down with my
 Land Rover from Kenya.</i>

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:05.531
<i>And vehicles were in short
 supply in the park.</i>

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.401
<i> So I ended up helping
 people out, I...</i>

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.070
I carried rangers around
and scientists and...

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.640
I spent more of my time going
around with people in the park

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.974
than I did actually filming.

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:17.811
And I loved it. It was great.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.679
<i> And I stayed.</i>

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.681
<i> And year after year kind
of went by and during that time</i>

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.651
<i>the wildlife started to rebound.</i>

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.518
<i> And I'm not kidding you</i>

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:28.054
it was amazing how
quickly it came back.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.089
Not all species,
but some species.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:32.825
It was like,
it was staggering.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.227
Everything had a baby.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.129
<i>I couldn't get enough of it.</i>

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.397
<i> And so,
 the next thing I knew</i>

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.900
<i>I was officially joining a
team of scientists and rangers</i>

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.636
<i>on this great experiment to see</i>

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.773
<i>if we could bring Gorongosa
back to its former glory.</i>

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.542
<i> And to save it from all
 of its new threats.</i>

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:53.412
Poaching, illegal logging,
illegal mining

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:56.049
even settlements inside the park

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.285
and human-wildlife
conflict, outside the park

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.288
are all big problems
that the park faces.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:05.492
<i> But in Gorongosa
 you've got Greg Carr</i>

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.094
<i> and a dedicated team of
 scientists and rangers</i>

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.163
<i> that are working
 hard to protect it.</i>

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.299
<i>And I believe it will survive.</i>

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:18.371
<i>I learned what it takes to fight
this fight for conservation.</i>

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.740
<i> It's perseverance.</i>

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.708
<i> When times got
 tough in Gorongosa</i>

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:25.611
<i>I watched Greg Carr and his
team just put their head down</i>

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.413
<i> and work even harder</i>

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.883
<i> believing that one
 day it would get better.</i>

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.050
<i> And it did.</i>
