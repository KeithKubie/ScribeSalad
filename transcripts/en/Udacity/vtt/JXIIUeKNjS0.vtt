Lauren, hey, what're you, what're you doing?

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.440
&gt;&gt; All that talk of mutations is really sobering, so

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.800
I just kind of came out here to relax and sunbathe.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you realize sunlight causes all kinds of mutations, right?

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.430
&gt;&gt; Matt, I can't get away from you. What are you talking about?

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.368
&gt;&gt; Of course, like UV light from the sun is a

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:19.040
major source of induced mutations. There's UVA, UVB rays from the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.650
sun. They directly cause mutations and can cause other molecules to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.420
indirectly cause mutations. In fact, if you've ever had a, a sunburn

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.470
before where your skin cells turn red and then

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.610
peel off. It's because you got so many mutations

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.390
that your body couldn't fix them all, and so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.120
they committed self-suicide to save you from skin cancer.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.320
&gt;&gt; It's a good thing that I wore sunscreen today, but

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.340
I really wish my skin would just protect itself on its own.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.750
&gt;&gt; Well, there's actually a mechanism

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.729
for that. It's actually skin pigmentation.

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.720
&gt;&gt; So you say if I had darker skin

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.350
tone, I wouldn't be so susceptible to skin cancer?

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.531
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Let's, let's go learn a bit more

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:52.460
about how that works. Okay.
