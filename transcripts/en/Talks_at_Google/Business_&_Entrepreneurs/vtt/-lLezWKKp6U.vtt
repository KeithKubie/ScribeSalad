00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:26.070
- Giving back gave me an
opportunity that cannot be

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.840
repaid for.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.590
It's only right that I want to
do the same thing for somebody

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.160
else.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.350
Basically, the
next generation is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.740
going through a smoother
experience, a faster growth.

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:54.304

[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.390
BABACAR SY: OK, this
is a quick recap here

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.730
of what we've done
the last 20 years.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.310
And as Bill said, it's
been quite a journey.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.590
It started 20 years ago with
a dramatic event in my family,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.880
where my sister, who was 22
years old at the time, died.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.350
And she passed
away in conditions

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.460
that were pretty tough
because her heart failed,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.860
and she was pretty upset at
what was going on in the world.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.090
And she was trying
to make a difference.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.650
So a couple of weeks later,
we discovered her writings

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.300
that she had left behind.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.570
And there was a
project there that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.790
was basically encouraging people
to invest in other people.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.970
And I took this project
and I implemented

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.650
what was my passion,
at the time,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.800
was basketball into the project
and founded Giving Back,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.250
with a motto that
was my mom's motto.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.130
Every time I was going
through the front door,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.460
she kept saying, never
forget where you come from.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.160
And that started a whole
movement, a global movement,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.650
which I went on and try to help
kids from all around the world

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.570
to get scholarships
through sports, basketball,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.920
and education, and to also have
the moral contract that they

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.944
will never forget
where they come from,

00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:04.360
and they will come back to
their communities at some point

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.050
and give back.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.070
And so that led me here
in the United States,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.320
in the beautiful
city of Newark, New

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.420
Jersey, where we set up the
first basketball camps there.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.180
And whatever we call
social business now,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.460
we were doing at
the time already.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.510
And it gave a lot of exposure
to these kids and some of them

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.950
are here right now.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.530
And it gave them a
lot of opportunities

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.680
to go through their studies
and go through a different path

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.420
than what they were
supposed to be.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.080
So these kids came
from France, but also

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.190
Senegal, Mali,
Burkina Faso, Niger,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.480
a little bit of everywhere.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.090
And we later set up
academies in Africa

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.630
of sports leadership and social
leadership at the same time.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.620
The whole story here is really
about the power of giving back.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.990
We think that giving
is a wonderful act.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.460
It is an amazing act.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.540
And we just feel that
it's not a complete act.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.610
When you give, you
fix situations,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.760
and you probably heal
and put a Band-Aid.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.890
But we think that with
the act of giving back,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.820
we can really put the
person into a position

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.130
to come back and
empower other people

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.560
and keep the chain alive.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.410
And that's really our
sustainable way for us

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.430
to build any social business.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.310
And we never
received any grants.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.620
And we were able to put
this all together because we

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.370
have our alumni that
came back to the program

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.950
and were able to help.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.670
So some of them are here.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.600
And I'm going to invite
Kudjo Sogadzi here,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.050
who was one of the
first student athletes

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.530
to come to the United States,
and had quite a journey

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.460
coming from some of the
toughest areas in France

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.120
and going all the way and
working to Wall Street.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.520
Kudjo.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.260
KUDJO SOGADZI: Thanks, Babacar.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.690
Thanks for allowing
us to be here today.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.340
It's a pleasure for us,
all of us, to be at Google

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.320
and to share our stories.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.690
And for being part of
the Giving Back group

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.270
program is a privilege, Babacar.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.330
As Babacar said, I'm from Paris.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.250
I came to the States
about 20 years ago.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.560
Actually, Babacar recruited
me to play basketball

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.020
from the streets of
Paris and to allow

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.470
me to come here to the
States and play high school

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.600
basketball.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.470
And from high school, I ended up
going to college for four years

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.320
and playing Division
1 at Fairfield.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.160
I've been very, very
fortunate because I'm

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.940
coming from a very tough
area outside of Paris.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.440
It's a small town.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.670
It was majority low income and
minority groups and families.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.310
And before I came to
the States, education

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.970
was never a big part
of what I believed in.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.960
I think you've always
been in a class

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.440
where there's an athlete
who doesn't work and doesn't

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.110
do his homework.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.690
Well, that was me.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.920
I've always been the one
to put school to the side.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.080
But coming to the States has
allowed me to disregard that

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.500
and to focus on
education and understand

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.990
the value of education.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.750
I was fortunate enough
to get a four-year degree

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.620
at a school in Connecticut.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.510
From there, I tried to play
overseas, in France, actually,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.135
professionally.

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:52.530
It didn't work out.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.450
I came back to the States,
went back to New York City,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.860
and worked at a hedge fund.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.020
And I was there for eight years.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.310
In the meantime,
I received an MBA.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.430
So I was going to school
part-time, went to school

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.500
while I was working.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.550
And now, I'm actually
studying for the LSAT

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.434
to go to law school.

00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:17.850
And what Babacar
mentioned earlier

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.680
is that it's one
thing about education,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.380
it's something that you can
carry with you all the time

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.970
and no one can
take away from you.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.000
And yes, my dream ultimately
was to come to the States

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.390
and play in the NBA.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.550
But things happened,
and I wasn't unable to.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.620
But I was able to take on
the next step of my life

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.131
and do something else through
education and through work.

00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.570
And my journey is
not over, obviously.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.670
I'm even looking to
go to law school.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.265
I'll graduate-- I'll
be 40 years old.

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:51.830
I'll be the oldest law
student in the school I go to.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.080
But I think one of the
things that Nelson Mandela

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.890
said, the quote is, "Education
is the most powerful weapon

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.590
for change."

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.070
And I think this is what we
are trying to provide here

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.730
at Giving Back is to give hope
to people that, whether it's

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.330
through sports or
through education,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.420
they can make something
out of themselves,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.955
and they can change the world.

00:08:10.955 --> 00:08:13.080
And what I want to do, and
what we're trying to do,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.910
is to change people's lives.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.800
And I want to be a role model
for them from my standpoint,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.700
so yeah.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.440
BABACAR SY: Thank you, Kudjo.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.080
Kudjo is one of the
hundreds of kids

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.350
that received a scholarship
to come to the United States

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.070
and took advantage of it.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.820
We have had a lot of
basketball success stories,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.940
but his story is one of the
biggest success stories of all

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.299
because he was able to
capitalize on the education

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.429
and be who he is right now.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:46.660
So that's also
something that we always

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.866
try to push is to understand
that the more we're

00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:51.490
going to empower
people with education,

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.400
then the more they will be
inclined to also give back,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.400
and to know how to give
back to their communities.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.740
And in that regard, I'm going
to introduce Guerschon Yabusele

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.680
from the Boston
Celtics, who also

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.860
has a pretty unbelievable
path that led him

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.860
not only to the
NBA, but also to be

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.610
our president for the
organization here,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.280
and be a social leader.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.317
Guerschon, it's yours.

00:09:20.317 --> 00:09:21.900
GUERSCHON YABUSELE:
So first of all, I

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.400
want to say thank you
for having us today.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.170
It's really important
for us and means a lot.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.080
So my name is
Guerschon Yabusele.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.010
I'm a Boston Celtics player,
the best team of the NBA,

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.480
obviously.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.930
But today, I really try to
share part of my story with you.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.066
So I grew up in France, a
little city in nearby Paris.

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:47.170
I always been playing
basketball there,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.910
and then moved to
a [INAUDIBLE] city

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.800
in France to play basketball.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.540
And me, in every
team that I play,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.936
I never been the best
player of my team.

00:09:56.936 --> 00:10:00.720
I've been underestimated
all of my career.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.730
But one day, Babacar
gave me a call,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.480
and he and the association
really believed in me

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.150
and helped me
through my process.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.020
Since this day, we always been
on the phone, always talking.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.470
And then one day, I had
the chance to go to LA

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.980
and play against the best
players in the country.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.710
And this experience for me has
been a big, big, big part of me

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.470
being here today because I
had to play against the best

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.360
player, understand how
life is, and understand

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.460
the change that I got
to play basketball,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.080
and it was really good for me.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.510
So as soon as I get
back from this trip,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.400
everything changed in my life.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.120
I just understand
the things more.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.500
I was thankful for everything.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.310
And since this
day, Babacar and me

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.820
had a great contact,
because I'm from France.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.470
And where I grew up, I
grew up in a big family.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.320
Sometimes we had less, so it
was really difficult for me.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.120
I grew up with
some of my friends.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.170
They failed.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.780
Some of them went to jail.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.360
So for me, at this
point, being thankful.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.600
It was just something
that I was dreaming,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.800
but something that I had
in my head every day.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.450
It just started being
a mission for me.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.680
And helping the people give back
to the communities means a lot.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.860
And this project for us
is really something big

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.872
with the young talented ladies.

00:11:28.872 --> 00:11:30.830
Amsatou's going to explain
us a little bit more

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.050
about her story, but the project
really means a lot for us.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.120
Like I said, the mission is in
our head, but also in our life.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.870
That's why we're going
through everything.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.655
My dream came true
in coming to the NBA.

00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:45.850
This association did a lot
for me, for me and my family.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.780
And today, I can really say
that basketball saved my life,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.040
helped me through everything.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.260
And I'm really
thankful for that.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.390
Thank you.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.550
BABACAR SY: Thank
you, Guerschon.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.100
As you see, Guerschon
and Kudjo here

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.850
represent well the
ecosystem of giving back as

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.950
far as the young
student athletes

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.740
that were empowered
through their endeavors

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:14.390
and that also were able to
overcome their own problems.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.260
And we see a lot of problems
all around the world.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.210
And we think it's always
with the powerful that

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.310
has to come back,
come to the powerless,

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.750
and find the solutions.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:31.680
But we know that in those
rough neighborhoods,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.810
there's a lot of kids that
have a lot of talents.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.410
And if they're given a chance
to bring their talent up

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.410
in whatever it is, they
can change the world

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.630
because they can grow
up with that mission

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.600
to come back to the
communities and change it.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.830
As Guerschon
mentioned, right now,

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.930
we're trying to scale the
system, this Giving Back

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.460
system.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.040
And the best way
that we found is

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.500
to put our efforts
into young women,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.950
especially young women
right now in West Africa.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.380
And I'm going to introduce
a video right now

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.065
that's going to tell you the
story of Amsatou Diop, who

00:13:08.065 --> 00:13:11.273
is right here, and who's
part of our program now.

AMSATOU DIOP (VOICEOVER):
Growing up in Italy,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.100
I understood the
word "privilege" when

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.750
spending summertime in my
beautiful native Senegal,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.600
and seeing a lot
of my girl peers

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.380
having no access to
education and no skill

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.610
that will allow them to
enjoy a dignified basic life.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.800
[? Micah ?] [? Zimbita ?] is
one of the seven million women

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.120
whose social fate is doomed
to fail before their life even

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.660
start.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.790
I had to find a way
to break this cycle.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:54.460
Privilege was all I had,
a scholastic education,

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.400
access to global
culture and thinking,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.710
and more importantly, a loving
and caring single mother

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.820
that gave me more
than I ever needed.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.890
I realized how much some of our
dysfunctional local resources

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.080
had to offer.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.540
I went on collecting
and recycling

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.560
the small wasted
piece of African craft

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.990
that our 100,000
worker [? bearers ?]

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.630
throw away everyday.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.990
And I created a
sustainable interior design

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.497
brand named Wolof.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:35.431
[AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:50.180
The Wolof solution is accessible
by any girl who is a willing

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.390
learner, as all
it takes is $0.20,

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.140
the cost of a
thread and a needle,

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.270
to come and acquire the basics
of my free-of-charge workshops,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.410
open to young girls that
have no access to education.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.040
My vision is to sell
Wolof globally and disrupt

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.150
the interior design
industry by giving

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.450
a voice to the voiceless, and
yet so elegant and powerful

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.520
women of Africa.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.750
Soon enough, Wolof will
be able to tell the world

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:28.080
a new set of inspiring tales
of the hard-working, resilient,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.520
creative, and traditional
African women.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:38.450
This community will keep growing
as the girls we empower today

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.400
will mentor the next generation
of interior designers.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.880
They will be able to enjoy
a sustainable living,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.150
break the cycle of
illiteracy, and will

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.330
become role models
of their daughters,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.930
just like my mother has
been for me all my life.

BABACAR SY: Amsatou.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.585
AMSATOU DIOP: Hi, everyone.

00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:12.340
Thank you so much for
having us here today.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.090
As you saw, I am the
proud founder of Wolof,

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:20.110
but also I am the mentor
of the Grow Academy, one

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.610
of the first mentors.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:27.400
So I have been on the program
for the past few months.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.130
And for those past
few months, there

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.670
have been two words
that have stuck with me

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.350
and have been my mantra.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.340
So those two words are
"embrace yourself."

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.220
A lot of people ask me why
I choose those two words

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.740
because they've also
been my Instagram

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.680
hashtag for every
feature that I've posted.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.610
But those two words because
for the past few months,

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.890
I have been embracing every
single fiber of myself.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.870
I've been embracing my fears,
my flaws, my weaknesses.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.380
But mostly, I've been aware
of what is surrounding me.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.400
And as a mentor for the next
generation of the Grow Academy,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.490
I want to pass all this
feeling to these girls

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.069
because I want them to be
fearless, to be powerful,

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.910
but mostly, I want them
to believe in themselves.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.630
Because we live in a society
where everything they tell us

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.930
everyday is, you can't make it.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.420
And my question is always, why?

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.010
It's because you are a woman.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.160
I want them to actually
believe that they can if they

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.270
put their mindset into it.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.830
That's why I created
the Grow Academy.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.180
And it's not like
any other academy

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:43.120
because we use tools as virtual
reality, video games, chess,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.680
coding, programming, boxing
because we want these girls

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.750
to be challenged everyday.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.540
And we want them to
believe that if you

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.540
put your mindset into
something, you can make it.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.990
You have to break all the
obstacles that are in your way

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.970
in order to do that.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.130
And as you know,
the Grow Academy

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.640
is going to use the same
ecosystem as Giving Back,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.640
meaning that the girls
that we empower today

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.300
will come back as a mentors
for the next generation.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.840
But we're not like the men here.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.230
It's not going to take
us 10 years to do that.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.590
It can take us--
we want these girls

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.090
to be able to do that
within three months.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:29.200
And having done this program
for a week before coming here,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.840
I can assure you
that these girls are

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.510
able to give back within weeks.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.610
Within a week, they
are able to teach

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.750
others what they've learned.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.400
Within a week, they appropriated
the program for themselves.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.800
And for me, that
is that incredible

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.400
because I now can
see all the work that

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.780
has been done by
Giving Back and by Grow

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.110
now, that actually
it's possible.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.560
Because some of them, we
went to the Giving Back day,

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.620
where they taught all
of these girls that

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.770
don't have access to education
how to play video games.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:09.790
And those girls, that same
day, were able to help others--

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.880
the other girls that are
there how to play video games.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.800
And they've never
been to school.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.480
They don't know what is football
or how to play with cards.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.170
So I can assure you that
this program is amazing,

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.870
and I'm really thankful
to be here today

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.450

girls, and also to speak

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.920

on women because we

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.290
know that women are the future.

we all advance.

how to solve a problem,

knock you right back down.

you get up, brush off the dirt,

00:23:39.716 --> 00:23:42.260
- Very, very simple English, OK?

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.070
Good morning.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.943
- Good morning.

00:23:43.943 --> 00:23:44.789
- Good morning.

00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:45.635
- Good morning.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.828
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:15.190
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.540
BABACAR SY: OK, so
this was the last video

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.200
here that we're going to show.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:28.640
But before we go for the
Q&amp;A, just this experience

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.250
with the Grow Academy
has been transforming

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.120
the whole organization,
really, because we

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.420
came to the realization
that in order

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.950
to be able to get powerful
social entrepreneurs,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.660
it's not just about going
onto a path, a set path,

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.520
like, hey, here's your
mission, your vision.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.780
Here is what you've got to do.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.960
But it's also about
revealing the best in us,

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.390
whether it's the
self-confidence, the ability

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.740
to transmit the messages to the
next generation, the ability

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.779
to listen, to have
collaborative work.

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:04.570
So that's what these
girls have been doing.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.780
And Amsatou has been a terrific
mentor for all those girls.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.530
And all those girls
that you see here

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.340
are going to be the mentor to
the next generation as well.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.370
And that's how we are
building this community.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.860
And we think that if
every community can

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.990
be built that way,
every social business

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.150
can be built that way,
then that's the answer

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.910
to be sustainable and
to be able to defeat

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.410
the problems of poverty.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.100
So thank you
everybody for coming.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.250
Thank you for having
us, again, Google.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.230
Thank you.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.680
SPEAKER: I just wanted to ask
a couple questions to wrap up

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.510
here.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.300
First, you mentioned
Giving Back Days.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.900
Do you want to explain
to us a little bit more

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.700
about how they work
and what your plans are

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.830
for the future for that?

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.370
BABACAR SY: So the Giving Back
Days are days of happiness

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.810
that we give to kids,
usually, or people

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.280
from vulnerable groups.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.110
And what we want
in those days is

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.750
to be able to reproduce what
we do at the Grow Academy,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.610
meaning really give
them confidence

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.950
into what they are doing
and show them the path

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.910
of giving back, in one day.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.670
And we do that in a fun way.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.550
But also, it's a
platform for all of us

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.560
to be able to go back and give.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.500
And that's one thing that is
very important in our system is

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.030
that ecosystem that we put
together, where everybody can

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.490
come in and be a part of it.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.530
And so that's the
Giving Back Days.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.690
And it's been very
successful because we've

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.670
been able to touch a
lot of young people

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.194
through that program.

00:26:33.194 --> 00:26:34.360
SPEAKER: Thank you, Babacar.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.412
Next, for those of us
in the audience that

00:26:36.412 --> 00:26:38.620
would like to get involved,
what are some of the ways

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.892
that we could help out
Giving Back and Grow Academy?

00:26:41.892 --> 00:26:42.850
BABACAR SY: Well, come.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.241
Come over to Senegal.

00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:45.740
You'll see.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.781
It's a beautiful country.

00:26:46.781 --> 00:26:47.540
It's sunny.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.920
And more importantly,
those girls

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.610
can really benefit from the
experiences of everybody.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.100
Again, we talk about mentorship.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.360
There's no professors.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.850
There's no traditional
teacher in our academy.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.770
And these are college girls.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.640
But I think they really enjoy
having expertise and experience

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.240
from all over the world.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.800
So that will be the first thing.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.500
The other thing is
that we're always

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.059
trying to research new
ways to problem solve.

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:16.600
You saw that lab
that we put together

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.100
with all those different tools.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.150
And if you have any ideas, if
you want to be part of that,

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.810
please let us know.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:27.400
And the last thing is that
those girls, they put together

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.930
all their work, they organized
their work into Google Drive--

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.600
Google Docs-- and they share it.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.260
So they have self-evaluation
within themselves,

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.920
but also, we invite anybody
that would want to be a mentor

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.430
and not being able to
come all the way there

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.390
to also be able to do it that
way so that a girl could share,

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.842
for example, her work with you.

00:27:51.842 --> 00:27:53.300
SPEAKER: Well, on
behalf of Google,

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.570
thank you very much for
coming, Babacar, Guerschon,

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.630
Amsatou, and Kudjo.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.290
We really enjoyed
hearing from you

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.280
and appreciate the
great work that you're

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.460
doing for your communities.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.570
BABACAR SY: Thank you very much.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:03.230
KUDJO SOGADZI: Thank you.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.830
AMSATOU DIOP: Thank you.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.746
BABACAR SY: Thank you.

00:28:04.746 --> 00:28:07.480
