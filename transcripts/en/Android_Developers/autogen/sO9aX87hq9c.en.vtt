what's layout all about basically you

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870
what's layout all about basically you
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.879
what's layout all about basically you
need to position with just on the screen

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.810
based on something that a UI designer
might have given you for example so you

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
might have given you for example so you
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.250
might have given you for example so you
have to lay them out in some particular

have to lay them out in some particular
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.980
have to lay them out in some particular
fashion on a screen but what happens if

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
fashion on a screen but what happens if
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630
fashion on a screen but what happens if
you have another screen that you have to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
you have another screen that you have to
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.859

things like that
 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.069
things like that
now how many screens would you actually

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
now how many screens would you actually
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410
now how many screens would you actually
have to do if you had to do every screen

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
have to do if you had to do every screen
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.700

layouts they're able to adjust sizes and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
layouts they're able to adjust sizes and
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.020
layouts they're able to adjust sizes and
position things dynamically for you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030
 
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.980
 
there are a bunch of different layouts

you can talk about you can divide them

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
you can talk about you can divide them

up into two basic categories simple

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
up into two basic categories simple
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.590
up into two basic categories simple
layouts and complex layouts the classic

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
layouts and complex layouts the classic
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.039
layouts and complex layouts the classic
simple layout is linear layout

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049
simple layout is linear layout
 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.390
simple layout is linear layout
essentially put your widgets inside of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
essentially put your widgets inside of
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.289
essentially put your widgets inside of
it and you have a row or column of

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299
it and you have a row or column of
 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.990
it and you have a row or column of
buttons or widgets now you can build

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
buttons or widgets now you can build
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.420
buttons or widgets now you can build
very complex layouts with just using

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
very complex layouts with just using
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.200
very complex layouts with just using
linear layout by doing deep nesting but

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
linear layout by doing deep nesting but
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.300
linear layout by doing deep nesting but
deep nesting it has its performance

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
deep nesting it has its performance
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.690
deep nesting it has its performance
problems

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
 
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.120
 
on the other hand if you use a complex

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
on the other hand if you use a complex
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.289
on the other hand if you use a complex
layout like relative layout or grid

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
layout like relative layout or grid
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.139
layout like relative layout or grid
layout it'll create shallow hierarchies

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149
layout it'll create shallow hierarchies
 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.180
layout it'll create shallow hierarchies
but without a good green builder to use

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
but without a good green builder to use
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.610
but without a good green builder to use
them it's actually very difficult to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
them it's actually very difficult to
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.660
them it's actually very difficult to
keep them stable we need something new

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
keep them stable we need something new
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.610
keep them stable we need something new
to help us with that stuff but that's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
to help us with that stuff but that's
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.860
to help us with that stuff but that's
why and so that's why we are up we are

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
why and so that's why we are up we are
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.350
why and so that's why we are up we are
no presenting you construct layouts so

different widgets and you know that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
different widgets and you know that
 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.259
different widgets and you know that
seems pretty similar to what constant

relative layer does but more and as it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030
relative layer does but more and as it
 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.720
relative layer does but more and as it
is more expressive you should be able to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
is more expressive you should be able to
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.180
is more expressive you should be able to
reduce nesting and as John said nesting

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
reduce nesting and as John said nesting
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.830

an unbundled library which means that
 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.699
an unbundled library which means that
not only can you use it from day one but

not only can you use it from day one but
 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.370
not only can you use it from day one but
we will also be able to regularly

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
we will also be able to regularly
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.830
we will also be able to regularly
iterate on it and push new versions and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
iterate on it and push new versions and
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.720
iterate on it and push new versions and
that new features and you'll be able to

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730
that new features and you'll be able to
 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.360
that new features and you'll be able to
get them very instantly it's also

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370
get them very instantly it's also
 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.120
get them very instantly it's also
extensible in its design which you don't

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130
extensible in its design which you don't
 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.920
extensible in its design which you don't
get too much about apart that from us

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
get too much about apart that from us
 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.390
get too much about apart that from us
that allows us to easily add new

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400
that allows us to easily add new
 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.170
that allows us to easily add new
features and finally it comes with great

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180
features and finally it comes with great
 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.120
features and finally it comes with great
UI builder as I said that was really

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130
UI builder as I said that was really
 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.870
UI builder as I said that was really
created as the other same team actually

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880
created as the other same team actually
 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.550
created as the other same team actually
the same team worked on both the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560
the same team worked on both the
 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.240
the same team worked on both the
constraint layout and the UI builder

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250
constraint layout and the UI builder
 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.860
constraint layout and the UI builder
and I really try to make a great builder

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870
and I really try to make a great builder
 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.920
and I really try to make a great builder
that is flexible and easy to use and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930
that is flexible and easy to use and
 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.470
that is flexible and easy to use and
really try to help you so when we

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480
really try to help you so when we
 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.540
really try to help you so when we
started to think about creating a new

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550
started to think about creating a new
 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.610
started to think about creating a new
layout system because we're not super

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
layout system because we're not super
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.020
layout system because we're not super
happy with the current design we we just

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030
happy with the current design we we just
 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.729
happy with the current design we we just
started with something very generic okay

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
started with something very generic okay
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.820
started with something very generic okay
we need an equation solver and on top of

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830
we need an equation solver and on top of
 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.760
we need an equation solver and on top of
that we are the questions but the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
that we are the questions but the
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.990
that we are the questions but the
problem with that is with the equation

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000
problem with that is with the equation
 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.100
problem with that is with the equation
and look at a stop there right could

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110
and look at a stop there right could
 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.570
and look at a stop there right could
have said you have a question that's

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580
have said you have a question that's
 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.790
have said you have a question that's
great just a try question put your

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800
great just a try question put your
 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.160
great just a try question put your
layout and that's it but the issue with

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170
layout and that's it but the issue with
 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.260
layout and that's it but the issue with
that is it's actually very easy we found

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270
that is it's actually very easy we found
 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.870
that is it's actually very easy we found
out to create a system that are not only

that's why we built on top of the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780
that's why we built on top of the
 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.680
that's why we built on top of the
equation system but very simple but

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690
equation system but very simple but
 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.570
equation system but very simple but
pretty expressive system of constraints

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
pretty expressive system of constraints
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.240
pretty expressive system of constraints
and that allows us to control all the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250
and that allows us to control all the
 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.920
and that allows us to control all the
the type of constraints and the type of

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930
the type of constraints and the type of

widget does not recite so what we do in
 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.689
widget does not recite so what we do in
that case is that we just Center it and

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699
that case is that we just Center it and
 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.939
that case is that we just Center it and
because it's centered and we can tweak

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949
because it's centered and we can tweak

bias you want toward one side or the
other and you can also do that directly

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320
other and you can also do that directly
 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.840
other and you can also do that directly
into the UI builder just drag the

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850
into the UI builder just drag the
 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.260
into the UI builder just drag the
element or use the inspector another

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270
element or use the inspector another
 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.510

option that you provide is well if what

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520
option that you provide is well if what
 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.610
option that you provide is well if what
if you want to resize widget and in that

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620
if you want to resize widget and in that
 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.439
if you want to resize widget and in that
case you know it's think about it like

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449
case you know it's think about it like
 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.540
case you know it's think about it like
match parent and actually we do not

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550
match parent and actually we do not
 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.129
match parent and actually we do not
support match parent but what we do

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139
support match parent but what we do
 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.990
support match parent but what we do
support it's something that's more like

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000
support it's something that's more like
 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.150
support it's something that's more like
much constraint and what that will do is

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160
much constraint and what that will do is
 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.430
much constraint and what that will do is
resize the widget so that the constraint

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440
resize the widget so that the constraint
 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.980
resize the widget so that the constraint
that you define define the size of the

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990
that you define define the size of the
 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.770
that you define define the size of the
region and also important aspect that

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780
region and also important aspect that
 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.600
region and also important aspect that
that is often you know that often comes

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610
that is often you know that often comes
 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.490
that is often you know that often comes
when you try to do complex subjects you

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500
when you try to do complex subjects you
 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.040
when you try to do complex subjects you
are in your UI is what happen when you

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050
are in your UI is what happen when you
 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.230
are in your UI is what happen when you
want the widget to become I mean the

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240
want the widget to become I mean the
 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.879
want the widget to become I mean the
first case is okay widget is invisible

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889
first case is okay widget is invisible
 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.950
first case is okay widget is invisible
you know if you do that nothing changes

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960
you know if you do that nothing changes
 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.740
you know if you do that nothing changes
that's easy just not drawn on screen but

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750
that's easy just not drawn on screen but
 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.950
that's easy just not drawn on screen but
for gun what we do is we collapse the

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960
for gun what we do is we collapse the
 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.600
for gun what we do is we collapse the
widget that you mapped as gun as a

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610
widget that you mapped as gun as a
 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.689
widget that you mapped as gun as a
single point and we discard it merchants

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:31.699
single point and we discard it merchants
 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:33.969
single point and we discard it merchants
so it completely disappear but the

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:33.979
so it completely disappear but the
 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.879
so it completely disappear but the
actual yaki of constraint still applies

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889
actual yaki of constraint still applies
 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.890
actual yaki of constraint still applies
and so that allows you to have a lot

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:38.900
and so that allows you to have a lot
 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.860
and so that allows you to have a lot
more reactive user user interface

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:41.870
more reactive user user interface
 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.029
more reactive user user interface
behavior all right some of you might you

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039
behavior all right some of you might you
 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:48.370
behavior all right some of you might you
know have you know wondered about what

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:48.380
know have you know wondered about what
 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.740
know have you know wondered about what
are the attributes and yes we did build

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:50.750
are the attributes and yes we did build
 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.770
are the attributes and yes we did build
a great UI builder and we do think that

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:53.780
a great UI builder and we do think that
 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.360
a great UI builder and we do think that
that UI builder will really help you

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:55.370
that UI builder will really help you
 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.969
that UI builder will really help you
create those UIs and really you know

00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:57.979
create those UIs and really you know
 

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:00.249
create those UIs and really you know
make your life easy but if you do want

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:00.259
make your life easy but if you do want
 

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:02.589
make your life easy but if you do want
to use you know the XML or the

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599
to use you know the XML or the
 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:04.899
to use you know the XML or the
programming or do we do the UI

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:04.909
programming or do we do the UI
 

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:06.399
programming or do we do the UI
programmatically you can still do it

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:06.409
programmatically you can still do it
 

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:08.589
programmatically you can still do it
it's a normal to do group you see the

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:08.599
it's a normal to do group you see the
 

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:10.450
it's a normal to do group you see the
backs s to everything so if you look at

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:10.460
backs s to everything so if you look at
 

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.290
backs s to everything so if you look at
those attributes

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:11.300
those attributes
 

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.390
those attributes
it sounds like wow there is a lot but

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400
it sounds like wow there is a lot but
 

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.060
it sounds like wow there is a lot but
actually not so much if if you look at

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.070
actually not so much if if you look at
 

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.159
actually not so much if if you look at
those those ones are the usual ones you

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:18.169
those those ones are the usual ones you
 

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:19.960
those those ones are the usual ones you
know just defining the wave the size the

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:19.970
know just defining the wave the size the
 

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.939
know just defining the wave the size the
text size and stuff like that nothing to

do reverse ready then you get a bunch of

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:24.020
do reverse ready then you get a bunch of
 

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.110
do reverse ready then you get a bunch of
attributes and so we can discuss then we

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120
attributes and so we can discuss then we
 

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.390
attributes and so we can discuss then we
got a bunch of attributes that actually

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400
got a bunch of attributes that actually
 

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.580
got a bunch of attributes that actually
as the prefix indicates for the tool

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:30.590

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.500
as the prefix indicates for the tool
it's just for Andres to do if you do

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:32.510
it's just for Andres to do if you do
 

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.969
it's just for Andres to do if you do
things programmatically you don't care

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:33.979
things programmatically you don't care
 

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:36.760
things programmatically you don't care
about that at all and in fact when you

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:36.770
about that at all and in fact when you
 

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.589
about that at all and in fact when you
push to a device those attributes get

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599
push to a device those attributes get
 

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:39.219
push to a device those attributes get
stripped out

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:39.229
stripped out
 

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:41.769
stripped out
so really the one we care about are

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:41.779
so really the one we care about are
 

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:44.170
so really the one we care about are
those four in the middle and really on

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:44.180
those four in the middle and really on
 

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.700
those four in the middle and really on
those four in the middle the matching

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:45.710
those four in the middle the matching
 

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.380
those four in the middle the matching
start on top you probably know them

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:47.390
start on top you probably know them
 

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.390
start on top you probably know them
already so we only have two more

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:49.400
already so we only have two more
 

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.980
already so we only have two more
tributes to just say you have a

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:50.990
tributes to just say you have a
 

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.600
tributes to just say you have a
constraint on the left and a constraint

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:52.610
constraint on the left and a constraint
 

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.490
constraint on the left and a constraint
on the top so it's actually pretty

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:54.500
on the top so it's actually pretty
 

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.920
on the top so it's actually pretty
tractable that said we really think that

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:56.930
tractable that said we really think that
 

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.870
tractable that said we really think that
the UI builder is great and in fact if

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880
the UI builder is great and in fact if
 

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.670
the UI builder is great and in fact if
you have issues with the UI builder if

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680
you have issues with the UI builder if
 

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.340
you have issues with the UI builder if
it does not work for your workflow tell

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.350
it does not work for your workflow tell

easy all right let's talk about the

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:10.220
easy all right let's talk about the
 

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.490
easy all right let's talk about the
layout editor itself so it's to editing

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:15.500
layout editor itself so it's to editing
 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.340
layout editor itself so it's to editing
right we can edit XML and see the

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:18.350
right we can edit XML and see the
 

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.790
right we can edit XML and see the
results directly live or visvasa you can

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800
results directly live or visvasa you can
 

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.100
results directly live or visvasa you can
you know it did the UI and that will

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.110
you know it did the UI and that will
 

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.990
you know it did the UI and that will
directly translate to the XML you can

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000
directly translate to the XML you can
 

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.280
directly translate to the XML you can
have both views at the same time or you

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:27.290
have both views at the same time or you
 

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.140
have both views at the same time or you
can stay in the design mode it's your

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.150
can stay in the design mode it's your
 

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.290
can stay in the design mode it's your
integrated into studio and we really try

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:32.300
integrated into studio and we really try
 

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.760
integrated into studio and we really try
to make it so that there is an immediate

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:33.770
to make it so that there is an immediate
 

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.150
to make it so that there is an immediate
feedback and so it's really easy to use

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160
feedback and so it's really easy to use
 

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.280
feedback and so it's really easy to use
things get predictable and you're not

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.290
things get predictable and you're not
 

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.960
things get predictable and you're not
surprised like you might have been in

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:40.970
surprised like you might have been in

constrained the numbers show you the

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880
constrained the numbers show you the
 

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.970
constrained the numbers show you the
margins that have been set and you can

margins that have been set and you can
 

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.650
margins that have been set and you can
actually just move your mouse over them

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:29.660
actually just move your mouse over them
 

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.710
actually just move your mouse over them
and edit the margins directly this slide

has allow you to adjust by us if if

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.110
has allow you to adjust by us if if

has allow you to adjust by us if if
you're connected on both sides so you

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:37.730
you're connected on both sides so you
 

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.840
you're connected on both sides so you
have a bias the little arrows inside

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:40.850
have a bias the little arrows inside
 

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.220
have a bias the little arrows inside
show whether your

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:42.230
show whether your
 

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.410
show whether your
app content or spread or fixed-width

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.420
app content or spread or fixed-width
 

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:52.300

okay let's go to the demo now and on the

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:52.310
okay let's go to the demo now and on the
 

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.690
okay let's go to the demo now and on the
laptop alright so you can see the that's

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:55.700
laptop alright so you can see the that's
 

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.190
laptop alright so you can see the that's
to do right and if you have played with

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200
to do right and if you have played with
 

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.140
to do right and if you have played with
it already that should be familiar and

00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.150
it already that should be familiar and
 

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.160
it already that should be familiar and
you can see here just it just shows the

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.170
you can see here just it just shows the
 

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.590
you can see here just it just shows the
constraint layout and I can switch the

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600
constraint layout and I can switch the
 

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.090
constraint layout and I can switch the
design mode you know and we have those

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.100
design mode you know and we have those
 

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.680
design mode you know and we have those
two mode we have the design mode where

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:08.690
two mode we have the design mode where
 

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.560
two mode we have the design mode where
it shows what things look like on the

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:11.570
it shows what things look like on the
 

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.660
it shows what things look like on the
device you know and you have the

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:13.670
device you know and you have the
 

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.210
device you know and you have the
blueprint mud and you can also have both

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:16.220
blueprint mud and you can also have both
 

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.590
blueprint mud and you can also have both
of them at the same time if you prefer

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600
of them at the same time if you prefer
 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.710
of them at the same time if you prefer
so why did we do the blueprint man well

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720
so why did we do the blueprint man well
 

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.900
so why did we do the blueprint man well
simply because sometimes what you show

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:22.910
simply because sometimes what you show
 

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.000
simply because sometimes what you show
in terms of layout doesn't actually

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.010
in terms of layout doesn't actually
 

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.070
in terms of layout doesn't actually
appear in the design surface like for

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.080
appear in the design surface like for
 

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.350
appear in the design surface like for
example if you look at a button the

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360
example if you look at a button the
 

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.920
example if you look at a button the
button shows smaller than what its

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:32.930
button shows smaller than what its
 

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.870
button shows smaller than what its
actual bounds are so the blueprint mud

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880
actual bounds are so the blueprint mud
 

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.030
actual bounds are so the blueprint mud
think about it as it's an x-ray of your

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040
think about it as it's an x-ray of your
 

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.890
think about it as it's an x-ray of your
current layout and only show you the

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:38.900
current layout and only show you the
 

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.800
current layout and only show you the
information that pertains to the layout

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:40.810
information that pertains to the layout
 

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.320
information that pertains to the layout
so with concert layout you can just go

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.330
so with concert layout you can just go
 

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.500
so with concert layout you can just go
and drag wherever you want and you do

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:47.510
and drag wherever you want and you do
 

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.780
and drag wherever you want and you do
have some guidelines to help you

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:49.790
have some guidelines to help you
 

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.000
have some guidelines to help you
position it amounts you know we follow

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.010
position it amounts you know we follow
 

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.830
position it amounts you know we follow
the material design guideline for

you can still move it wherever you want

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:00.950
you can still move it wherever you want
 

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.920
you can still move it wherever you want
it's really good when you are simply

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:02.930
it's really good when you are simply
 

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.360
it's really good when you are simply
playing around or trying to design your

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
playing around or trying to design your
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.120
playing around or trying to design your
UI testing to see all things really fit

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.130
UI testing to see all things really fit
 

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.810
UI testing to see all things really fit
so if you create the connection we just

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:10.820
so if you create the connection we just
 

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.940
so if you create the connection we just
animate directly and you can see that if

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:12.950
animate directly and you can see that if
 

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.710
animate directly and you can see that if
I don't create the connection we still

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720
I don't create the connection we still
 

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.440
I don't create the connection we still
show you what will happen if you release

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.450
show you what will happen if you release
 

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.720
show you what will happen if you release
and create the connection and that

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:19.730
and create the connection and that
 

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.170
and create the connection and that
actually works with the entire system so

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:23.180
actually works with the entire system so
 

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.960
actually works with the entire system so
if I drag a button and I touch this

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:25.970
if I drag a button and I touch this
 

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.860
if I drag a button and I touch this
button here you know and you know I kill

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:29.870
button here you know and you know I kill
 

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.540
button here you know and you know I kill
this connection everything moves

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:31.550
this connection everything moves
 

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.780
this connection everything moves
together so and you can see here it's

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:34.790
together so and you can see here it's
 

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.600
together so and you can see here it's
only only constrained or isn't Ellie so

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:37.610
only only constrained or isn't Ellie so
 

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.430
only only constrained or isn't Ellie so
vertically nothing changes and I can

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440
vertically nothing changes and I can
 

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.350
vertically nothing changes and I can
create a connection manually like that

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360
create a connection manually like that
 

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.630
create a connection manually like that
you can destroy all the connection by

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:43.640
you can destroy all the connection by
 

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.600
you can destroy all the connection by
clicking this and just align your things

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:46.610
clicking this and just align your things
 

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.310
clicking this and just align your things
and you know create those connection

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320
and you know create those connection
 

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.090
and you know create those connection
there are two different modes to create

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:52.100
there are two different modes to create
 

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.660
there are two different modes to create
connections one is this manual one and

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:55.670
connections one is this manual one and
 

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.929
connections one is this manual one and
it

00:12:55.929 --> 00:12:55.939
it
 

00:12:55.939 --> 00:12:58.119
it
I think it's very important because we

00:12:58.119 --> 00:12:58.129
I think it's very important because we
 

00:12:58.129 --> 00:13:00.309
I think it's very important because we
want you to be able to easily tweak the

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:00.319
want you to be able to easily tweak the
 

00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:03.519
want you to be able to easily tweak the
resulting UI but there is another one

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:03.529
resulting UI but there is another one
 

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:07.059
resulting UI but there is another one
that's a little bit more easy to use in

00:13:07.059 --> 00:13:07.069
that's a little bit more easy to use in
 

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:09.669
that's a little bit more easy to use in
some cases which is the auto alignment

00:13:09.669 --> 00:13:09.679
some cases which is the auto alignment
 

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:13.149
some cases which is the auto alignment
and if we go on auto a timeout app we go

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:13.159
and if we go on auto a timeout app we go
 

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:13.899
and if we go on auto a timeout app we go
back on that

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:13.909
back on that
 

00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:17.559
back on that
so auto alignment works with this icon

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:17.569
so auto alignment works with this icon
 

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:21.539
so auto alignment works with this icon
here this little u-shaped magnet and

00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:21.549
here this little u-shaped magnet and
 

00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:24.399
here this little u-shaped magnet and
what happens now if that is on is that

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:24.409
what happens now if that is on is that
 

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:27.219
what happens now if that is on is that
if I put my widget on a guide line it

00:13:27.219 --> 00:13:27.229
if I put my widget on a guide line it
 

00:13:27.229 --> 00:13:29.079
if I put my widget on a guide line it
will create those connection and you can

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:29.089
will create those connection and you can
 

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:31.569
will create those connection and you can
see that it is dismal animation as long

00:13:31.569 --> 00:13:31.579
see that it is dismal animation as long
 

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:33.099
see that it is dismal animation as long
as the animation is not finished I can

00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:33.109
as the animation is not finished I can
 

00:13:33.109 --> 00:13:35.379
as the animation is not finished I can
still move things around but if I let it

00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:35.389
still move things around but if I let it
 

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:37.659
still move things around but if I let it
go then the widget will actually be

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:37.669
go then the widget will actually be
 

00:13:37.669 --> 00:13:41.019
go then the widget will actually be
constrained so if I actually resize ups

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:41.029
constrained so if I actually resize ups
 

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:45.099
constrained so if I actually resize ups
there's burg if I resize that and yeah

00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:45.109
there's burg if I resize that and yeah
 

00:13:45.109 --> 00:13:47.229
there's burg if I resize that and yeah
repaint back but you can see that the

00:13:47.229 --> 00:13:47.239
repaint back but you can see that the
 

00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:52.179
repaint back but you can see that the
constraint I applied and I think we

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:52.189
constraint I applied and I think we
 

00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:55.539
constraint I applied and I think we
talked about the tools now well one more

00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:55.549
talked about the tools now well one more
 

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:59.499
talked about the tools now well one more
piece of art to alignment that you might

00:13:59.499 --> 00:13:59.509
piece of art to alignment that you might
 

00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:01.119
piece of art to alignment that you might
have forgotten one of the nice things

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:01.129
have forgotten one of the nice things
 

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:03.849
have forgotten one of the nice things
about art alignment is that when you put

00:14:03.849 --> 00:14:03.859
about art alignment is that when you put
 

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:06.549
about art alignment is that when you put
an object like this the fact that you

00:14:06.549 --> 00:14:06.559
an object like this the fact that you
 

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:09.669
an object like this the fact that you
see the guidelines allows allows you to

00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:09.679
see the guidelines allows allows you to
 

00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:12.159
see the guidelines allows allows you to
connect so as long as you can see the

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:12.169
connect so as long as you can see the
 

00:14:12.169 --> 00:14:16.479
connect so as long as you can see the
guidelines you'll be able to let it go

00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:16.489
guidelines you'll be able to let it go
 

00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:18.489
guidelines you'll be able to let it go
and it'll connect for you so it could be

00:14:18.489 --> 00:14:18.499
and it'll connect for you so it could be
 

00:14:18.499 --> 00:14:21.099
and it'll connect for you so it could be
a quick way especially for very simple

00:14:21.099 --> 00:14:21.109
a quick way especially for very simple
 

00:14:21.109 --> 00:14:25.719
a quick way especially for very simple
UI is to be built the the next thing I

00:14:25.719 --> 00:14:25.729
UI is to be built the the next thing I
 

00:14:25.729 --> 00:14:32.469
UI is to be built the the next thing I
wanted to show you is what we call our

00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:32.479
wanted to show you is what we call our
 

00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:36.249
wanted to show you is what we call our
tools so because we are so much a rich

00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:36.259
tools so because we are so much a rich
 

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:39.460
tools so because we are so much a rich
UI layout type environment we wanted to

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:39.470
UI layout type environment we wanted to
 

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.679
UI layout type environment we wanted to
add tools that were a lot like the stuff

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:41.689
add tools that were a lot like the stuff
 

00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:45.339
add tools that were a lot like the stuff
that you would see in PowerPoint or any

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:45.349
that you would see in PowerPoint or any
 

00:14:45.349 --> 00:14:48.969
that you would see in PowerPoint or any
of the Visio any other graphical tools

00:14:48.969 --> 00:14:48.979
of the Visio any other graphical tools
 

00:14:48.979 --> 00:14:51.789
of the Visio any other graphical tools
so at the top you'll see a collection of

00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:51.799
so at the top you'll see a collection of
 

00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:55.479
so at the top you'll see a collection of
of widgets and they work in in sort of

00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:55.489
of widgets and they work in in sort of
 

00:14:55.489 --> 00:15:00.490
of widgets and they work in in sort of
standard ways where me and

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:00.500
standard ways where me and
 

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.830
standard ways where me and
the where where they align left right

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:05.840
the where where they align left right
 

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.130
the where where they align left right
middle that kind of thing there's a

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:09.140
middle that kind of thing there's a
 

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.760
middle that kind of thing there's a
special mood if you have the the magnet

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:12.770
special mood if you have the the magnet
 

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.940
special mood if you have the the magnet
turned on when you when you issue those

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:15.950
turned on when you when you issue those
 

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.160
turned on when you when you issue those
it'll actually create constraints for

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:18.170
it'll actually create constraints for
 

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.820
it'll actually create constraints for
you so if you care about having the

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:21.830
you so if you care about having the
 

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.890
you so if you care about having the
constraints very specifically left

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:23.900
constraints very specifically left
 

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.320
constraints very specifically left
aligned you can use this to tell sort of

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.330
aligned you can use this to tell sort of
 

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.220
aligned you can use this to tell sort of
tell you how would that happen and in

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:30.230
tell you how would that happen and in
 

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.620
tell you how would that happen and in
fact it's it's kind of for we we want

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:32.630
fact it's it's kind of for we we want
 

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.180
fact it's it's kind of for we we want
the tool to be used we want it to be

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:34.190
the tool to be used we want it to be
 

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.310
the tool to be used we want it to be
using a very flexible way some people

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320
using a very flexible way some people
 

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.560
using a very flexible way some people
might just ask the goal and just create

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:38.570
might just ask the goal and just create
 

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.480
might just ask the goal and just create
the constraints or some people might

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:40.490
the constraints or some people might
 

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.150
the constraints or some people might
just prefer to lay out do we jet look oh

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160
just prefer to lay out do we jet look oh
 

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.920
just prefer to lay out do we jet look oh
yeah down in a nice place and then build

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:44.930
yeah down in a nice place and then build
 

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.820
yeah down in a nice place and then build
the constraints it's really up to you so

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:48.830
the constraints it's really up to you so
 

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.790
the constraints it's really up to you so
it helps work in a lot of situations

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800
it helps work in a lot of situations
 

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.030
it helps work in a lot of situations
like this way you just aligning figs

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040
like this way you just aligning figs
 

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.240
like this way you just aligning figs
putting things together like this

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.250
putting things together like this
 

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.130
putting things together like this
setting up again you can see fairly

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:00.140
setting up again you can see fairly
 

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.070
setting up again you can see fairly
quickly I can come up with a reasonable

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:03.080
quickly I can come up with a reasonable
 

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:09.490
quickly I can come up with a reasonable
amount of alignment and packing of

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:09.500
amount of alignment and packing of
 

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.320
amount of alignment and packing of
things and ways that we would like to

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:11.330
things and ways that we would like to
 

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:16.860
things and ways that we would like to
use it okay for the next piece I want to

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:16.870
use it okay for the next piece I want to
 

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.470
use it okay for the next piece I want to
let's go to the next one for the next

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480
let's go to the next one for the next
 

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.770
let's go to the next one for the next
piece I wanted to talk to you about

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:22.780
piece I wanted to talk to you about
 

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:28.750
piece I wanted to talk to you about
inference now inferences it's a fairly

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:28.760
inference now inferences it's a fairly
 

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.520
inference now inferences it's a fairly
complicated system once ago okay you're

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.530
complicated system once ago okay you're
 

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.520
complicated system once ago okay you're
scaring me there what we're doing it's

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:36.530
scaring me there what we're doing it's
 

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.940
scaring me there what we're doing it's
just one button the the little lightbulb

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:39.950
just one button the the little lightbulb
 

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.690
just one button the the little lightbulb
button don't press it yet what we do

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:43.700
button don't press it yet what we do
 

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.810
button don't press it yet what we do
when you press that button we calculate

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:46.820
when you press that button we calculate
 

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.210
when you press that button we calculate
the probability of all possible

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:49.220
the probability of all possible
 

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.900
the probability of all possible
connections and then we walk through a

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:52.910
connections and then we walk through a
 

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.720
connections and then we walk through a
series of heuristic lis deveined

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:54.730
series of heuristic lis deveined
 

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.230
series of heuristic lis deveined
algorithms which will make connections

00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240
algorithms which will make connections
 

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.980
algorithms which will make connections
for you by the end of it all things will

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:02.990
for you by the end of it all things will
 

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.850
for you by the end of it all things will
be properly constrained there are a

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:06.860
be properly constrained there are a
 

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.000
be properly constrained there are a
couple of things it's a bit magical but

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.010
couple of things it's a bit magical but
 

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.990
couple of things it's a bit magical but
they're a couple of things to remember

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000
they're a couple of things to remember
 

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.800
they're a couple of things to remember
about it three things to remember

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:13.810
about it three things to remember
 

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.290
about it three things to remember
you it will never really move a widget

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:17.300
you it will never really move a widget
 

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.900
you it will never really move a widget
on you it'll apply constraints wherever

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:19.910
on you it'll apply constraints wherever
 

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.520
on you it'll apply constraints wherever
you've left your app your widgets

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:21.530
you've left your app your widgets
 

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.880
you've left your app your widgets

push a widget off off the screen or

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:27.080
push a widget off off the screen or
 

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:34.510
push a widget off off the screen or
something like that it's it will now it

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520
something like that it's it will now it
 

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.420
something like that it's it will now it
will do some small changes whenever

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:37.430
will do some small changes whenever
 

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.690
will do some small changes whenever
there is an a trying to do an alignment

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:40.700
there is an a trying to do an alignment
 

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.460
there is an a trying to do an alignment
of things but that's ok by the end of

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:45.470
of things but that's ok by the end of
 

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.200
of things but that's ok by the end of
the past all of these things are

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:47.210
the past all of these things are
 

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.800
the past all of these things are
guaranteed to be constrained if you have

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:50.810
guaranteed to be constrained if you have
 

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.610
guaranteed to be constrained if you have
a constraint beforehand it will honor

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:54.620
a constraint beforehand it will honor
 

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.200
a constraint beforehand it will honor
those constraints so it will never

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.210
those constraints so it will never
 

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.810
those constraints so it will never
destroy an existing constraint that

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:58.820
destroy an existing constraint that
 

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.670
destroy an existing constraint that
you've created so you can create

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:00.680
you've created so you can create
 

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.890
you've created so you can create
constraints and then let it finish it

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:02.900
constraints and then let it finish it
 

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.920
constraints and then let it finish it
finish the job for you and in fact in

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:05.930
finish the job for you and in fact in
 

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.750
finish the job for you and in fact in
the demos you saw a lot of them were

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760
the demos you saw a lot of them were
 

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.750
the demos you saw a lot of them were
some manually created constraints

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760
some manually created constraints
 

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.430
some manually created constraints
sometimes it will do auto constraint go

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440
sometimes it will do auto constraint go
 

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.290
sometimes it will do auto constraint go
ahead Nicholas press the button let's

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:17.300
ahead Nicholas press the button let's
 

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.780
ahead Nicholas press the button let's
see what happens so there's it it made a

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:22.790
see what happens so there's it it made a
 

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.660
see what happens so there's it it made a
bunch of constraints it's aligned

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:25.670
bunch of constraints it's aligned
 

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.320
bunch of constraints it's aligned
everything now resize the widget resizes

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:29.330
everything now resize the widget resizes
 

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.940
everything now resize the widget resizes
the screen so that was done just by

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:33.950
the screen so that was done just by
 

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.040
the screen so that was done just by
drawing out the widgets in the right

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.050
drawing out the widgets in the right
 

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.340
drawing out the widgets in the right
space and it can align them if you

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:39.350
space and it can align them if you
 

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.290
space and it can align them if you
didn't like a particular constraint it

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:41.300
didn't like a particular constraint it
 

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.480
didn't like a particular constraint it
made you could change it yourself or you

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:43.490
made you could change it yourself or you
 

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.150
made you could change it yourself or you
can add a new constraint add one yeah so

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.160
can add a new constraint add one yeah so
 

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.520
can add a new constraint add one yeah so
for example I can still go and just

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:48.530
for example I can still go and just
 

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.320
for example I can still go and just
destroy those connections and say

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:50.330
destroy those connections and say
 

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.630
destroy those connections and say
actually I really wanted that one to be

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640
actually I really wanted that one to be
 

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.570
actually I really wanted that one to be
connected on the top and actually here

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:55.580
connected on the top and actually here
 

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.770
connected on the top and actually here
you can see that we have a couple of

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:56.780
you can see that we have a couple of
 

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.900
you can see that we have a couple of
mods to create those connection so by

00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:58.910
mods to create those connection so by
 

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.300
mods to create those connection so by
default it creates with the imagine you

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:01.310
default it creates with the imagine you
 

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.620
default it creates with the imagine you
indicate in the toolbar on top but if I

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:05.630
indicate in the toolbar on top but if I
 

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.080
indicate in the toolbar on top but if I
press ctrl it actually will create an R

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.090
press ctrl it actually will create an R
 

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.300
press ctrl it actually will create an R
Gean with the current distance and

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:10.310
Gean with the current distance and
 

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.280
Gean with the current distance and
sometimes that's kind of nice because if

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:12.290
sometimes that's kind of nice because if
 

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.110
sometimes that's kind of nice because if
you just want to create them out the

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120
you just want to create them out the
 

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.520
you just want to create them out the
constraint that you actually happy with

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:15.530
constraint that you actually happy with
 

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.470
constraint that you actually happy with
the current way the widget opposition

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480
the current way the widget opposition
 

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.530
the current way the widget opposition
that's a time-saver

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:19.540
that's a time-saver
 

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.020
that's a time-saver
so another thing you can do is if you've

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:23.030
so another thing you can do is if you've
 

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.700
so another thing you can do is if you've
already laid out and you added a bunch

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:24.710
already laid out and you added a bunch
 

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.200
already laid out and you added a bunch
of constraints and stuff but you needed

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.210
of constraints and stuff but you needed
 

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.220
of constraints and stuff but you needed
one more piece of you

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:27.230
one more piece of you
 

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.890
one more piece of you
I on the system I add some new piece of

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:29.900
I on the system I add some new piece of
 

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.430
I on the system I add some new piece of
UI in there nah

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440
UI in there nah
 

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.230
UI in there nah
yeah that's okay now you can just press

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240
yeah that's okay now you can just press
 

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.720
yeah that's okay now you can just press
the button again yeah and as you saw

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:40.730
the button again yeah and as you saw
 

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.980
the button again yeah and as you saw
when I dragged it because the

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:41.990
when I dragged it because the
 

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.480
when I dragged it because the
auto-connect was on ER

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:43.490
auto-connect was on ER
 

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.669
auto-connect was on ER
it automatically tried to create those

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679
it automatically tried to create those
 

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:48.610
it automatically tried to create those
connections but you can also do it with

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:48.620
connections but you can also do it with
 

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.770
connections but you can also do it with
auto infer and you see it added that all

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:50.780
auto infer and you see it added that all
 

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.030
auto infer and you see it added that all
the constraints need to fill in that

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:52.040
the constraints need to fill in that
 

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.270
the constraints need to fill in that
other widget and you can see that the

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280
other widget and you can see that the
 

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.740
other widget and you can see that the
constraint that it created was not

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:56.750
constraint that it created was not
 

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.360
constraint that it created was not
exactly the same as giotto connection

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:58.370
exactly the same as giotto connection
 

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.600
exactly the same as giotto connection
one and that's actually because auto

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:01.610
one and that's actually because auto
 

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.780
one and that's actually because auto
connect only look at the elements that

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:04.790
connect only look at the elements that
 

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.840
connect only look at the elements that
are close to you so that's why it shows

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:07.850
are close to you so that's why it shows
 

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.010
are close to you so that's why it shows
you those guidelines and those

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:09.020
you those guidelines and those
 

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.930
you those guidelines and those
guidelines if you drop the widget at

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940
guidelines if you drop the widget at
 

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.120
guidelines if you drop the widget at
this moment will create the constraints

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.130
this moment will create the constraints
 

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.930
this moment will create the constraints
where the guidelines originate from the

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:15.940
where the guidelines originate from the
 

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.610
where the guidelines originate from the
auto insurance on the other hand look at

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:18.620
auto insurance on the other hand look at
 

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.789
auto insurance on the other hand look at
the big picture yeah so it might pick

00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799
the big picture yeah so it might pick
 

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:24.310
the big picture yeah so it might pick
things from based on alignments the

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320
things from based on alignments the
 

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.010
things from based on alignments the
probabilities are fairly complicated and

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.020
probabilities are fairly complicated and
 

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.980
probabilities are fairly complicated and
then in the future we try to do like

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:29.990
then in the future we try to do like
 

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.299
then in the future we try to do like
more advanced algorithms the in there

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:33.309
more advanced algorithms the in there
 

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:36.310
more advanced algorithms the in there
okay but you know and I want to repeat

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320
okay but you know and I want to repeat
 

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.200
okay but you know and I want to repeat
what John said earlier and it's very

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.210
what John said earlier and it's very
 

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.600
what John said earlier and it's very
important the auto interference is not

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:40.610
important the auto interference is not
 

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.370
important the auto interference is not
going to move things around it will

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.380
going to move things around it will
 

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.130
going to move things around it will
actually very hard try to keep the

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.140
actually very hard try to keep the
 

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.680
actually very hard try to keep the
widget where you put them so that means

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:47.690
widget where you put them so that means
 

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.000
widget where you put them so that means
that if you are not happy with the

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.010
that if you are not happy with the
 

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.039
that if you are not happy with the
result you can still go back and edit it

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:51.049
result you can still go back and edit it
 

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:54.310
result you can still go back and edit it
and you know it also tries to make the

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320
and you know it also tries to make the
 

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.049
and you know it also tries to make the
connection that makes sense that might

00:20:56.049 --> 00:20:56.059
connection that makes sense that might
 

00:20:56.059 --> 00:20:58.090
connection that makes sense that might
not be the connection you had in mind

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.100
not be the connection you had in mind
 

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.710
not be the connection you had in mind
but that's the connection that makes

00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720
but that's the connection that makes
 

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.130
but that's the connection that makes
sense

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.140
sense
 

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.260
sense
when you look at the entire system we it

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.270
when you look at the entire system we it
 

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.060
when you look at the entire system we it
doesn't go crazy that's what I'm trying

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.070
doesn't go crazy that's what I'm trying
 

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.799
doesn't go crazy that's what I'm trying
to say and that's why also it's

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:05.809
to say and that's why also it's
 

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:08.560
to say and that's why also it's
important to have those manual

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:08.570
important to have those manual
 

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.450
important to have those manual
capabilities to edit the constraints

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:10.460
capabilities to edit the constraints
 

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.820
capabilities to edit the constraints
because we want we see it mother you

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:12.830
because we want we see it mother you
 

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.500
because we want we see it mother you
know kind of a symbiotic relation

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:14.510
know kind of a symbiotic relation
 

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.270
know kind of a symbiotic relation
between you and the tool you know the

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:16.280
between you and the tool you know the
 

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.490
between you and the tool you know the
tool will help you might get you there

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:18.500
tool will help you might get you there
 

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.460
tool will help you might get you there
at 90% of the way save you a ton of time

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:21.470
at 90% of the way save you a ton of time
 

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.990
at 90% of the way save you a ton of time
and you can just focus on what's left

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000
and you can just focus on what's left
 

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.909
and you can just focus on what's left
and even if it doesn't work out you can

00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919
and even if it doesn't work out you can
 

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:32.320
and even if it doesn't work out you can
always undo yeah so all right so let's

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:32.330
always undo yeah so all right so let's
 

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.159
always undo yeah so all right so let's
let's simply build some things you know

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:36.169
let's simply build some things you know
 

00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:37.980
let's simply build some things you know
come on like a

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:37.990
come on like a
 

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.810
come on like a
so if I want to create a role like that

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:39.820
so if I want to create a role like that
 

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.600
so if I want to create a role like that
I can start with I can use the tools as

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:42.610
I can start with I can use the tools as
 

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.340
I can start with I can use the tools as
well you know I can if I just want to

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:44.350
well you know I can if I just want to
 

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.700
well you know I can if I just want to
Center I can just do that and you know

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:47.710
Center I can just do that and you know
 

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.450
Center I can just do that and you know
if I if I look at the recycle view now

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460
if I if I look at the recycle view now
 

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.620
if I if I look at the recycle view now
in the you know it appears here but of

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:55.630
in the you know it appears here but of
 

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.690
in the you know it appears here but of
course it's taking you know all the

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:57.700
course it's taking you know all the
 

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.120
course it's taking you know all the
space so if I'm at now the constraint

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.130
space so if I'm at now the constraint
 

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.680
space so if I'm at now the constraint
play out to be wrap content you know you

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:04.690
play out to be wrap content you know you
 

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.860
play out to be wrap content you know you
can see up there is a refresh right and

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:07.870
can see up there is a refresh right and
 

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.440
can see up there is a refresh right and
you can see how it's it's just integrate

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:10.450
you can see how it's it's just integrate
 

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.360
you can see how it's it's just integrate
like that into recycled view and you can

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:12.370
like that into recycled view and you can
 

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.850
like that into recycled view and you can
just continue and add more stuff you

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:14.860
just continue and add more stuff you
 

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.399
just continue and add more stuff you
know and that's it you know you got you

00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:17.409
know and that's it you know you got you
 

00:22:17.409 --> 00:22:19.980
know and that's it you know you got you
can easily build your rows so it doesn't

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:19.990
can easily build your rows so it doesn't
 

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.409
can easily build your rows so it doesn't
automatically have to work with the

00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:22.419
automatically have to work with the
 

00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:24.210
automatically have to work with the
entire UI you know you can use it of

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:24.220
entire UI you know you can use it of
 

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.799
entire UI you know you can use it of
course for your menu I but you can use

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:25.809
course for your menu I but you can use
 

00:22:25.809 --> 00:22:28.440
course for your menu I but you can use
it for something as simple as a row like

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:28.450
it for something as simple as a row like
 

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.610
it for something as simple as a row like
that it is just a normal do group and

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620
that it is just a normal do group and
 

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:39.330
that it is just a normal do group and
you can see the result and let me just

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.340
you can see the result and let me just
 

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.700
you can see the result and let me just
create just show you quickly when you

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:41.710
create just show you quickly when you
 

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.919
create just show you quickly when you
create a new layout file so you can

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:43.929
create a new layout file so you can
 

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:46.529
create a new layout file so you can
Institute your preview to point to let's

00:22:46.529 --> 00:22:46.539
Institute your preview to point to let's
 

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:47.850
Institute your preview to point to let's
see demo

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:47.860
see demo
 

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.490
see demo
you just go here and type constraint

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:50.500
you just go here and type constraint
 

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.039
you just go here and type constraint
layout and what that will do it will

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:53.049
layout and what that will do it will
 

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:55.169
layout and what that will do it will
create the file it actually will

00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:55.179
create the file it actually will
 

00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:57.120
create the file it actually will
automatically add if that was not the

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.130
automatically add if that was not the
 

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.820
automatically add if that was not the
case on the dependency to the support

00:22:59.820 --> 00:22:59.830
case on the dependency to the support
 

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.519
case on the dependency to the support
library that that contains constraint

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:02.529
library that that contains constraint
 

00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:06.600
library that that contains constraint
layout and you can then build something

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:06.610
layout and you can then build something
 

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.669
layout and you can then build something
and you can still use the design mode if

00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679
and you can still use the design mode if
 

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:10.080
and you can still use the design mode if
you if you actually prefer the design

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.090
you if you actually prefer the design
 

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.539
you if you actually prefer the design
mode you know that still works fine we

00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:12.549
mode you know that still works fine we
 

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:14.340
mode you know that still works fine we
just in that case show the different

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:14.350
just in that case show the different
 

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.560
just in that case show the different
constraint as an overlay on top of the

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:16.570
constraint as an overlay on top of the
 

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:20.909
constraint as an overlay on top of the
system or you can just you know switch

00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919
system or you can just you know switch
 

00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:22.740
system or you can just you know switch
to blueprint I tend to prefer blue pin

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:22.750
to blueprint I tend to prefer blue pin
 

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.510
to blueprint I tend to prefer blue pin
because it just makes things easier for

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520
because it just makes things easier for
 

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.039
because it just makes things easier for
me when I'm working on layout but the

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:26.049
me when I'm working on layout but the
 

00:23:26.049 --> 00:23:28.139
me when I'm working on layout but the
design mount is really useful to show

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:28.149
design mount is really useful to show
 

00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:30.570
design mount is really useful to show
you how things look you know so if you

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:30.580
you how things look you know so if you
 

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.740
you how things look you know so if you
want to just build like a typical dialog

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:34.750
want to just build like a typical dialog
 

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.169
want to just build like a typical dialog
like that you know you could have

00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179
like that you know you could have
 

00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:41.159
like that you know you could have
something up just like that and let's

00:23:41.159 --> 00:23:41.169
something up just like that and let's
 

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:45.269
something up just like that and let's
say a couple of let's actually use email

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279
say a couple of let's actually use email
 

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.320
say a couple of let's actually use email
you know

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.330
you know
 

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:52.770
you know
and just plain text here up and then you

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:52.780
and just plain text here up and then you
 

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.110
and just plain text here up and then you
can see that up the connection was here

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120
can see that up the connection was here
 

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.820
can see that up the connection was here
up like that and that's it and we were

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:02.830
up like that and that's it and we were
 

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.440
up like that and that's it and we were
doing anything else I've got my dialogue

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.450
doing anything else I've got my dialogue
 

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.710
doing anything else I've got my dialogue
and you can see it's resize up if the

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720
and you can see it's resize up if the
 

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.680
and you can see it's resize up if the
rate want to repaint now it doesn't want

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:10.690
rate want to repaint now it doesn't want
 

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.250
rate want to repaint now it doesn't want
to repaint up sorry

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260
to repaint up sorry
 

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.310
to repaint up sorry
it might want to in there so and you can

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320
it might want to in there so and you can
 

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.320
it might want to in there so and you can
still go back kill all the constraints

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.330
still go back kill all the constraints
 

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.090
still go back kill all the constraints
do the inference and you can see that

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:21.100
do the inference and you can see that
 

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.470
do the inference and you can see that
the inference does a pretty good job as

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480
the inference does a pretty good job as
 

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.500
the inference does a pretty good job as
well and you can not hear that we

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:25.510
well and you can not hear that we
 

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.850
well and you can not hear that we
constraint on the baseline for instance

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860
constraint on the baseline for instance
 

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.440
constraint on the baseline for instance
and I think that's about it for the demo

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:31.450
and I think that's about it for the demo
 

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:40.740
and I think that's about it for the demo
so we can go back to the slides alright

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:40.750
so we can go back to the slides alright
 

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.200
so we can go back to the slides alright
so just to summarize a little bit what

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.210
so just to summarize a little bit what
 

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.780
so just to summarize a little bit what
we showed you so there is a new

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:45.790
we showed you so there is a new
 

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.280
we showed you so there is a new
constraint there is a new layout called

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:47.290
constraint there is a new layout called
 

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.140
constraint there is a new layout called
constant layout it's a small unbundled

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:49.150
constant layout it's a small unbundled
 

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.720
constant layout it's a small unbundled
library it's about hundred kilobytes

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:50.730
library it's about hundred kilobytes
 

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.550
library it's about hundred kilobytes
because it's unbundle we we think we'll

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:53.560
because it's unbundle we we think we'll
 

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.290
because it's unbundle we we think we'll
be able to move fast and that new

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:55.300
be able to move fast and that new
 

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.960
be able to move fast and that new
features it's really built on top of a

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:57.970
features it's really built on top of a
 

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.530
features it's really built on top of a
flexible base and what what's good for

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:01.540
flexible base and what what's good for
 

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.830
flexible base and what what's good for
us is that we can control all fast we

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:04.840
us is that we can control all fast we
 

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.750
us is that we can control all fast we
can we can move on the development and

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760
can we can move on the development and
 

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.610
can we can move on the development and
to make sure that the performances will

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:08.620
to make sure that the performances will
 

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.880
to make sure that the performances will
sustain it's compatible with mostly

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:11.890
sustain it's compatible with mostly
 

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.770
sustain it's compatible with mostly
hurting out there and it's in active

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:13.780
hurting out there and it's in active
 

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.840
hurting out there and it's in active
development I want to you know invest at

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:15.850
development I want to you know invest at
 

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.660
development I want to you know invest at
this point we just redid it this week

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:18.670
this point we just redid it this week
 

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.760
this point we just redid it this week
it's coming you know just as an alpha

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:20.770
it's coming you know just as an alpha
 

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.040
it's coming you know just as an alpha
preview we definitely encourage you to

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.050
preview we definitely encourage you to
 

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.790
preview we definitely encourage you to
check it out check the UI builder and

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:25.800
check it out check the UI builder and
 

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.470
check it out check the UI builder and
you know there's certainly some bugs

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480
you know there's certainly some bugs
 

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.250
you know there's certainly some bugs
will fix them but the reason we actually

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:32.260
will fix them but the reason we actually
 

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.680
will fix them but the reason we actually
announced it at i/o was because we think

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:34.690
announced it at i/o was because we think
 

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.230
announced it at i/o was because we think
it's it's you know really enough to

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240
it's it's you know really enough to
 

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.700
it's it's you know really enough to
gather some feedback and actually

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:38.710
gather some feedback and actually
 

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.680
gather some feedback and actually
something we are keen on we want to hear

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:40.690
something we are keen on we want to hear
 

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.750
something we are keen on we want to hear
from you our job is to make your life

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760
from you our job is to make your life
 

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.910
from you our job is to make your life
easier and undo UI builder as you saw

easier and undo UI builder as you saw
 

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.830
easier and undo UI builder as you saw
the UI builder is you know kind of life

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840
the UI builder is you know kind of life
 

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.350
the UI builder is you know kind of life

to give you like some guidance and you
 

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.740
to give you like some guidance and you
know you can use the inference to create

00:25:59.740 --> 00:25:59.750
know you can use the inference to create
 

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.590
know you can use the inference to create
connections to reset view time when you

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600

still have the manual Edition you can

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:03.920
still have the manual Edition you can
 

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.540
still have the manual Edition you can
still go back and just you know idiot

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:07.550
still go back and just you know idiot
 

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.690

things and same as the constraint layout

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:10.700
things and same as the constraint layout
 

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.760
things and same as the constraint layout
itself it's in active development it's

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:12.770
itself it's in active development it's
 

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.890
itself it's in active development it's
the same thing that works on both which

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:14.900
the same thing that works on both which
 

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.480
the same thing that works on both which
is why they are really well integrated

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:16.490
is why they are really well integrated
 

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.750
is why they are really well integrated
together so you know all that I said for

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760
together so you know all that I said for
 

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.010
together so you know all that I said for
the constant layout also applies

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:21.020
the constant layout also applies
 

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.110
the constant layout also applies
definitely for the UI builder and by the

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120
definitely for the UI builder and by the
 

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.350
definitely for the UI builder and by the
way on Android studio 2.2 preview there

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360
way on Android studio 2.2 preview there
 

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.240
way on Android studio 2.2 preview there
is this new UI builder for constraint

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.250
is this new UI builder for constraint
 

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.280
is this new UI builder for constraint
layouts but there's also a new UI

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:30.290
layouts but there's also a new UI
 

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.430
layouts but there's also a new UI
builder for the ozone layer that you

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440
builder for the ozone layer that you
 

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.800
builder for the ozone layer that you
already use in your applications and if

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:35.810
already use in your applications and if
 

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.960
already use in your applications and if
you use the the UI builder that was

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:37.970
you use the the UI builder that was
 

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.940
you use the the UI builder that was
there in previous version of studio that

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:39.950
there in previous version of studio that
 

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.800
there in previous version of studio that
new UI builder is definitely a step up

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:41.810
new UI builder is definitely a step up
 

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:46.120
new UI builder is definitely a step up
and again for for it as well it will you

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:46.130
and again for for it as well it will you
 

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:49.960
and again for for it as well it will you
know get better or over time all right

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:49.970
know get better or over time all right
 

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.110
know get better or over time all right
let me talk briefly about what we have

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120
let me talk briefly about what we have
 

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.340
let me talk briefly about what we have
in mind for the next versions so if you

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.350
in mind for the next versions so if you
 

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.830
in mind for the next versions so if you
remember the slide from earlier about

00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840
remember the slide from earlier about
 

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.540
remember the slide from earlier about
the solver and the equation and the

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:01.550
the solver and the equation and the
 

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:05.770
the solver and the equation and the
constraints clearly we are going to

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:05.780
constraints clearly we are going to
 

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.180
constraints clearly we are going to
focus on probably in the short end as

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:07.190
focus on probably in the short end as
 

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.350
focus on probably in the short end as
mostly what should be working on

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360
mostly what should be working on
 

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.210
mostly what should be working on
improving the performance we have a ton

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:10.220
improving the performance we have a ton
 

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.400
improving the performance we have a ton
of optimization that we haven't obvious

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:12.410
of optimization that we haven't obvious
 

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.370
of optimization that we haven't obvious
ones that we haven't yet done so we

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:15.380
ones that we haven't yet done so we
 

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.400
ones that we haven't yet done so we
really want to focus on that for the

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:18.410
really want to focus on that for the
 

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.050
really want to focus on that for the
equation themselves that we generate

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:20.060
equation themselves that we generate
 

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.340
equation themselves that we generate
from the constraint we have some

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:21.350
from the constraint we have some
 

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.360
from the constraint we have some
interesting ideas on how to

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:22.370
interesting ideas on how to
 

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.820
interesting ideas on how to
automatically take them and simplify

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:24.830
automatically take them and simplify
 

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.870
automatically take them and simplify
them and optimize them but a follow

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880
them and optimize them but a follow
 

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.870
them and optimize them but a follow
constraint there is there is couple of

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880
constraint there is there is couple of
 

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.730
constraint there is there is couple of
things that we can do and actually we

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:33.740
things that we can do and actually we
 

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.560
things that we can do and actually we
could have demoed it but but in addition

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:38.570
could have demoed it but but in addition
 

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.840
could have demoed it but but in addition
to those basic constraints that we

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:40.850
to those basic constraints that we
 

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.470
to those basic constraints that we
demonstrated we have the concept of

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480
demonstrated we have the concept of
 

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.230
demonstrated we have the concept of
helpers and one of the helper that we

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240
helpers and one of the helper that we
 

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.270
helpers and one of the helper that we
have in the preview actually is the

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:49.280
have in the preview actually is the
 

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.400
have in the preview actually is the
guideline object so you can create a

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:51.410
guideline object so you can create a
 

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.260
guideline object so you can create a
guideline you know think of Photoshop

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:53.270
guideline you know think of Photoshop
 

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.150
guideline you know think of Photoshop
guideline something like that something

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:55.160
guideline something like that something
 

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.530
guideline something like that something
that your designer probably walk with

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:56.540
that your designer probably walk with
 

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.840
that your designer probably walk with
and you can just set a guideline make it

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:58.850
and you can just set a guideline make it
 

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.420
and you can just set a guideline make it
relative to one side or the other or

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:00.430
relative to one side or the other or
 

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.250
relative to one side or the other or
percentage of the dimension of the the

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:03.260
percentage of the dimension of the the
 

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.730
percentage of the dimension of the the
container and simply constraint your

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:06.740
container and simply constraint your
 

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.780
container and simply constraint your
widget to that guideline

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:07.790
widget to that guideline
 

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.880
widget to that guideline
the interesting thing though is that

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:09.890
the interesting thing though is that
 

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:14.110
the interesting thing though is that
this guideline is not a new layout this

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.120
this guideline is not a new layout this
 

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.940
this guideline is not a new layout this
is just an object that we use to

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:15.950
is just an object that we use to
 

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.280
is just an object that we use to
generate the right equations and we have

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:18.290
generate the right equations and we have
 

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.710
generate the right equations and we have
a ton of ideas of all the type of

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720
a ton of ideas of all the type of
 

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.840
a ton of ideas of all the type of
virtual object like that that will help

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:22.850
virtual object like that that will help
 

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.520
virtual object like that that will help
you create more advanced layouts

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:26.530
you create more advanced layouts
 

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.410
you create more advanced layouts
another thing we that did not make the

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:29.420
another thing we that did not make the
 

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.630
another thing we that did not make the
cut for i/o but that we we know is

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640
cut for i/o but that we we know is
 

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.520
cut for i/o but that we we know is
important is that all we've talked so

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:33.530
important is that all we've talked so
 

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.920
important is that all we've talked so
find that with that we demo'd lets you

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:35.930

want this group of stuff to be
vertically positioned and we have a

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:00.770
vertically positioned and we have a
 

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.700

concept of virtual containers and

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:02.710
concept of virtual containers and

normal tags so you'll see them but when
 

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.770

on the floor and simply use them to
 

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.250
on the floor and simply use them to
generate the right equations so you

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:21.260
generate the right equations so you
 

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.600
generate the right equations so you
still have the power of using groups
