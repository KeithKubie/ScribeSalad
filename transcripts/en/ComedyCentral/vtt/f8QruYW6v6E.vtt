00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.002
(electronic beeping)

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:09.693
- [Computer] Danger, asteroid
microchip malfunction.

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:10.526
- Oh no.

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:15.033
What have I done wrong?

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.856
I can't believe this.

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:21.023
I've worked so hard to get
this computer project going.

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:25.084
It's unbelievable.

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:30.544
Something out of a bad
dream has come my way.

00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:35.127
And I wake up but yet

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:40.074
it wasn't a bad dream, it was reality.

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:46.497
- [Computer] Now we're all going to die.

00:00:49.678 --> 00:00:51.928
- Isn't there any way back?

00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:55.554
To get these computers going?

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:00.746
(intense music)
