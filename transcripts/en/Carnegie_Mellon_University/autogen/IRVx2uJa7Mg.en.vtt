better place there are two reasons I
think that we have the world's greatest

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960
think that we have the world's greatest
 

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.640
think that we have the world's greatest
university system the first is because

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:50.650
university system the first is because
 

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:51.870
university system the first is because
we have the world's greatest democracy

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880
we have the world's greatest democracy
 

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.780
we have the world's greatest democracy
and I firmly believe that the two go

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:54.790
and I firmly believe that the two go
 

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.300
and I firmly believe that the two go
hand in hand that is to say that great

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.310
hand in hand that is to say that great
 

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.610
hand in hand that is to say that great
academic freedom is built upon great

00:25:59.610 --> 00:25:59.620
academic freedom is built upon great
 

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.400
academic freedom is built upon great
political freedom of that I think there

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:02.410
political freedom of that I think there
 

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.140
political freedom of that I think there
can be no doubt but further I think our

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.150
can be no doubt but further I think our
 

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.100
can be no doubt but further I think our
democracy was built on the idea that

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.110
democracy was built on the idea that
 

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.880
democracy was built on the idea that
challenging the status quo is not merely

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:11.890
challenging the status quo is not merely
 

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.460
challenging the status quo is not merely
a good thing to do it's a great thing to

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:14.470
a good thing to do it's a great thing to
 

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.980
a good thing to do it's a great thing to
do and I believe that what makes our

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:16.990
do and I believe that what makes our
 

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.900
do and I believe that what makes our
universities great is that our students

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:18.910
universities great is that our students
 

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.420
universities great is that our students
are not merely taught but indeed are

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:21.430
are not merely taught but indeed are
 

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.290
are not merely taught but indeed are
expected to challenge their professors

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:25.300
expected to challenge their professors
 

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.480
expected to challenge their professors
and as a result we educate men and women

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:27.490

so that brings me to the panel and we've
selected panelists based upon

00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319
selected panelists based upon
 

00:37:46.319 --> 00:37:48.559
selected panelists based upon
versity based upon their work in

00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:48.569
versity based upon their work in
 

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:52.009
versity based upon their work in
different different fields to try and

00:37:52.009 --> 00:37:52.019
different different fields to try and
 

00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:54.049
different different fields to try and
stir some discussion about innovation

00:37:54.049 --> 00:37:54.059
stir some discussion about innovation
 

00:37:54.059 --> 00:37:56.930
stir some discussion about innovation
and bring it into the nation's capital

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940
and bring it into the nation's capital
 

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.719
and bring it into the nation's capital
so we don't often associate with

00:37:59.719 --> 00:37:59.729
so we don't often associate with
 

00:37:59.729 --> 00:38:02.029
so we don't often associate with
innovation with the nation's capital but

00:38:02.029 --> 00:38:02.039
innovation with the nation's capital but
 

00:38:02.039 --> 00:38:05.029
innovation with the nation's capital but
it's really interesting it's really

00:38:05.029 --> 00:38:05.039
it's really interesting it's really
 

00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:06.680
it's really interesting it's really
interesting because I'll tell you is

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:06.690
interesting because I'll tell you is
 

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.620
interesting because I'll tell you is
that somebody who said I've turned my

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:09.630
that somebody who said I've turned my
 

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.549
that somebody who said I've turned my
career toward energy and environment

00:38:12.549 --> 00:38:12.559
career toward energy and environment
 

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:16.160
career toward energy and environment
that I see now the marrying of policy

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.170
that I see now the marrying of policy
 

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:20.089
that I see now the marrying of policy
and economics so there's very little

00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099
and economics so there's very little
 

00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:22.359
and economics so there's very little
today that we can do with new energy

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:22.369
today that we can do with new energy
 

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:25.309
today that we can do with new energy
renewable energy where we don't have to

00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319
renewable energy where we don't have to
 

00:38:25.319 --> 00:38:27.079
renewable energy where we don't have to
worry about the policy that will be

00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:27.089
worry about the policy that will be
 

00:38:27.089 --> 00:38:31.630
worry about the policy that will be
developed or now even the government

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640
developed or now even the government
 

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.809
developed or now even the government
funding or policy that creates funding

00:38:35.809 --> 00:38:35.819
funding or policy that creates funding
 

00:38:35.819 --> 00:38:38.689
funding or policy that creates funding
to make it happen and so it can't be

00:38:38.689 --> 00:38:38.699
to make it happen and so it can't be
 

00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:40.579
to make it happen and so it can't be
separated so as we think about

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:40.589
separated so as we think about
 

00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:42.499
separated so as we think about
innovation especially in energy but I

00:38:42.499 --> 00:38:42.509
innovation especially in energy but I
 

00:38:42.509 --> 00:38:43.849
innovation especially in energy but I
think in other fields as well like

00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859
think in other fields as well like
 

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:47.569
think in other fields as well like
medicine it has to involve the nation's

00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579
medicine it has to involve the nation's
 

00:38:47.579 --> 00:38:49.160
medicine it has to involve the nation's
capital and so I think it's an

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:49.170
capital and so I think it's an
 

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.439
capital and so I think it's an
appropriate topic for here so let me

00:38:51.439 --> 00:38:51.449
appropriate topic for here so let me
 

00:38:51.449 --> 00:38:54.589
appropriate topic for here so let me
introduce the panelists
