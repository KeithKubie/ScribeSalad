LIV WU: Hi everybody,
I am delighted to

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.600
welcome Tyler Florence.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.140
It's lovely to have you here,
so inspiring to share food

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.980
with you at lunchtime and
hear you talk about it.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.432
TYLER FLORENCE: Thank you very
much, Liv, I'm so happy to be

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:20.280
here, guys, how you doing?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.130
LIV WU: I love how sensory the
book is, the photographs,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.810
they're just--

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.400
no clutter, just food.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.470
TYLER FLORENCE: That is the idea
behind "Fresh," which is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.670
just clean, simple delicious
recipes, that are kind of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.740
innovative in a sense, and
when you take a look at

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.790
recipes that are so vibrant,
especially because we all live

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.180
in California, so you
guys will get it.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.520
Clearly, that there's so much
incredible flavor to be had

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.390
and nutrition behind
that, so it's not

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.790
about a bowl of salad.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.700
It's about creating a spectrum
of nutrients and taking those

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600
ingredients and then
doing really crazy

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.920
fun things with them.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.650
And that's what I like about
food and that's what I like

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.550
about cooking.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.890
And that's what I wrote
about in this book.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.500
LIV WU: And in fact, people
think there's the divide.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.560
There's healthy food and then
there's gorgeous food.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.740
But in fact what you're talking
about, nutrient

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.980
density, is flavor, right?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.340
That's what winemakers
talk about.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.460
TYLER FLORENCE: I'm actually
a winemaker as well.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.280
I've been making wine with
Michael Mondavi in Napa, and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.540
what we harvested this year
is our fifth season.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.530
And it's really kind of paying
attention to nature.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.290
It was a fabulous harvest,
by the way.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.950
2011 was kind of a disaster,
just because it was so cold

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.900
and foggy up in wine country,
but this year it was sort of

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.770
the classic storybook kind of
cartoonish California summer.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.380
Just long, like lovely warm
days, kind of cool foggy

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.110
nights, and produced just a
bumper crop of sauv blanc,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.160
pinot, of zin, of cab.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.870
Not just quantity but also
quality, so it was a really

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.870
amazing season.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.300
And when we blend the wine, and
we won 13 medals in three

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.140
seasons out.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.230
And I think our scores are
speaking volumes of our

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.030
passion for the product so
we don't have to scream

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.050
so loud about it.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.170
And I really, really love
what we're doing.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.300
And when you get a chance to
kind of concentrate flavors,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.550
and take it from a very, very
natural focus, so it's about

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.490
taking the idea of a carrot.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.310
If you guys get a chance to eat
in the cafeteria earlier,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.885
like the idea of albacore tuna
with confit carrots and a

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.260
carrot puree on top of that,
so you're taking the same

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.360
ingredient and kind of using it
in a couple different ways.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.860
So you're having lunch, but
you're also eating 1,000

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.870
milligrams of vitamin C.
I think that's kind of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.870
interesting.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.850
Because that's what it
should be, that's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.970
what food should be.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.100
So it's not about the idea of
gluttony, it's about taking

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.440
smart ingredients and just
doing something very

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.390
compelling with it.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.090
So when you walk out of that,
you don't have the meat

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.420
sweats, you actually
feel invigorated.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.280
You shouldn't get the meat
sweats eating lunch.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.340
I know you guys work 80 hours a
week like I do, so I'm sure

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.280
sometimes you've
got to make do.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.960
The book is about taking one
step closer to hopefully

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.570
everybody that reads the book,
that we can have a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.660
conversation together about
health and nutrition and what

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.510
you put your body on
a daily basis.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.310
And hopefully you can take that
information and have a

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.360
conversation with somebody
else about it.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.630
LIV WU: And you started telling
me earlier, this path

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.630
is taking you to having
your own farm that

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.540
supplies you with--

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.890
TYLER FLORENCE: Yeah, well to
me, in our restaurant, have

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.620
you guys been to
our restaurant?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.010
In San Francisco,
Wayfare Tavern?

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.760
Have you guys been up there?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.380
It's good, you like it?

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.580
It's good, right?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.730
I think we're getting better,
thank you, thank you.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.690
Well it was OK, service
was a little slow.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.080
My fried chicken wasn't as
hot as it was last time.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.680
But we're actually thinking
about, kind of getting,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.840
making, closing the gaps between
what we serve and

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.220
where we get it.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.850
I have three restaurants in the
Bay Area, and we spend a

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.779
ton of money on produce.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.950
And a lot of things you don't
necessarily get a ton of value

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.480
of that money just because
there's only a few pipelines

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.590
to kind of get those particular
products.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.660
So if it's micro greens that
are bused in from Ohio, and

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.480
it's $15 a clamshell, and you
get 50% usage out of that,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.010
just because it's been on
the road for 48 hours

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.720
and picked 72 hours.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.310
And then, you take that and
add it up over the year.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.030
It's the money that we're, we
could be getting value out of,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.880
vs. money we're spending.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.870
So we're actually looking at
some property, I think

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.870
tomorrow and definitely next
week when I get back.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.090
But we're actually looking at
either buying a farm or

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.746
leasing a farm, and actually
growing our own produce for

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:01.530
our own restaurants.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.480
Because we spend the
money anyway.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.280
So instead of having the same
cool little micro green that

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.310
you see on every single
restaurant in town, because

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.000
people kind of get on--

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.090
when the catalogs come out, from
like, little micro green

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.770
companies, everybody jumps on
like hearts on fire sorrel.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.800
You kind of see it
over the place.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.740
And we want to start-- we want
to be able to plan our own

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.050
thing and really think
it through.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.880
So, clearly you can't make a
phone call, you've got to plan

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.900
the seasons out.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.300
But we're really excited
about that.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.200
And just to have that story,
just a little closer.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.280
Between, by the time you get it
on your plate, and where it

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.200
came from, it's a very
small circle

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.660
LIV WU: It really aligns
with our values on

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.160
the food team here.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.710
And going back to nutrition,
when it travels less there's

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.320
more nutrition retained.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.710
TYLER FLORENCE: Absolutely.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.020
And also, you kind of keep
your money in a tighter

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.240
circle, too.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.740
I'd much rather invest in a
family that take care of our

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.020
restaurants and what we serve,
than necessarily just write a

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.330
check to a company.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.470
Not that we don't get value from
the company, but I just

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.060
think, again, just trying
to get one step

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.280
closer to the truth.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.080
And that's what we always want
to do, which is get one step

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.360
closer to purity and clarity
and focus and flavor.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.370
And that to me is just
growing it yourself.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.280
LIV WU: And same philosophy
to seafood, right?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.210
You were saying earlier, love
the anchovies, the sardines,

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.300
they need to get sexy, right?

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.490
As much as ahi tuna.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.920
TYLER FLORENCE: Absolutely.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.200
So if you get a chance to read,
flip through "Fresh,"

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.370
there's very interesting
stories.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.610
And one story that I wrote,
it's quick little stories,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.660
it's about eating on what they
call the trophic scale.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.520
And the trophic scale is
basically the food system.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.030
So the kings of trophic
scale are predators.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.540
So it's tuna, and shark,
and things like that.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.960
And things at the bottom of the
trophic scale are things

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.730
like sardines, and anchovies,
and then you get into plankton

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.550
and phytoplankton,
things like that.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.140
But if you can eat things from
a little more diversified, so

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.310
it's not so much things at the
top of the trophic scale,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.530
because they have to consume--

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.160
they consume the entire
ecosystem on the way up.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.740
So it's a little fish that gets
eaten by the bigger fish,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.630
and a bigger fish, and a bigger
fish, and then you

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.970
catch that biggest fish.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.790
From a calorie standpoint, that
thing consumes 10 times

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.700
the calories that it'll ever
give you from a nutrient

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.390
standpoint.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.520
So that is not sustainable.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.380
That is 180 degrees from
sustainability.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.740
So what we have to eat are
things that have a shorter

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.556
life span, that reproduce
quicker, like octopus for a

00:07:45.556 --> 00:07:47.770
second, you guys like octopus?

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.150
So if you see octopus, octopus
is certainly something that

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.310
you're probably not going to
find in a grocery store.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.680
But if you get it in a
restaurant, especially if it's

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.190
local, there's amazing octopus
up and down the Pacific coast.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:05.170
The octopus only live about a
year, and they reproduce in

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.980
six months.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:13.080
And they consume such a minute
amount of the environment, and

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.020
the way they're fished, with
basically a bucket and a

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.160
string, there's zero
impact on anything.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.700
And they're loaded
with omega 3s.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.270
And there's like virtually
zero mercury.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.310
So my point is, if you can eat,
make a decision, and make

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.630
anchovies sexy, and make
sardines sexy.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.700
Almost like a Mediterranean
culture.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.039
Every time I go to Greece, or go
to Spain, that's all we eat

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.429
are like small oily fish.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.020
And I love it, it's
so delicious.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.720
You're actually doing the
environment a gigantic favor

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.440
because that product gets
caught, and then about 90% of

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.410
it either gets turned into fish
food that feeds farmed

00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:00.100
fish, or it gets turned into
bait to catch other fish.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.360
There are enough calories to
feed the planet, hands down.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.980
We're just not using it
in an efficient way.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.190
There's plenty of food, but
we're just not using it.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.220
We're throwing most of it out.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.930
LIV WU: That saying, eating
salmon is like eating tiger.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.230
It's that high on
the food chain.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.480
TYLER FLORENCE: Absolutely.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.130
The salmon, to me, is another
thing which I think is really

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.920
kind of fascinating, because
everybody sees the demise of

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.160
the California salmon as
something that's sort of a

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.170
recent phenomenon.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.610
But there's been a steady
decline since like the 1860s.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.810
As populations moved west and
started building whale towns,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.010
up and down the Pacific
Northwest, and then started

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.340
building dams, we've
been killing

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.190
salmon for a long time.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.950
It was a vital resource that
now is starting to affect a

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.300
much, much deeper part of the
ecosystem and that's what's

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.650
called biomass.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:04.340
So when salmon do their last,
most valuable thing on the

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.495
planet, that's reproduce, their
bodies just die, because

00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:07.700
it's the last thing they do.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:14.230
And as the carcasses start to
fold into the soil, that is

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:20.980
the reason that Sequoia trees
are where they are, if you

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.500
really think about it.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.090
Because they'll swim up through
the inter-coastal

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.200
waterways and up in through
the estuaries.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.470
And when they die, they
feed the trees.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.500
So the mighty redwoods of the
Pacific Northwest, and

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.550
starting in about California
up to Oregon, that is there

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.110
because the salmon population
was there.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.990
And if you start to take
that away, what's the

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.030
other side of it?

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.300
Because there's not that
much fuel for them

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.460
necessarily to eat.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.810
It's a very interesting
thing, and

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.100
everything inside the book--

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.890
I tell people this all the time,
it's very Google-able.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.830
You can look up every single
thing in the book and

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.770
it's all the truth.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.700
So it's not just about recipes,
it's food, but it's

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.940
also food for thought.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.170
And there's a lot of different
things that you can do, every

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.340
single day with your wallet
and your dollar.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.280
Because you're a lot more
powerful than you think you

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.190
are, even with social media,
because you can just turn

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.940
people on to very, very
interesting things just by

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.570
suggesting them.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.570
And when you do the right thing,
it's like dropping a

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.350
rock in the water, and
you watch the rings

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.250
sort of circle out.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.340
That is where we all stand right
now, because we're all

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.620
very, very powerful.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.120
And as social media becomes
accessible to everybody, and

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.810
one person that has a smart
blog, and a lot of followers

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.830
on Twitter, or whatever, they
are just as influential as

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.410
newspapers, as major
news sources.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.400
So we're all very powerful
people, and I think it's so

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.680
fascinating.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.510
LIV WU: So your journey through
being a young cook,

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.740
and television shows, and
books, and then this

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.670
connectedness to nature and the
chain of life, is that a

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.040
path that you think, you and I
have taken, but do most young

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.460
cooks take, who are
in the profession?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.200
TYLER FLORENCE: It's an exciting
time to be a chef.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.590
And it's an exciting time to
be a young chef, because I

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.860
think there's a lot of very
accessible, attainable

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.920
information.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.025
And there was a beef, I don't
know if you guys follow this

00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:26.490
stuff or not, but David
Chang is a big

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.040
chef in New York City.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.530
He took a very, very publicized
swipe at chefs in

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.060
California and San Francisco.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.680
He said the most difficult thing
a chef in San Francisco

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.930
has to do is go shopping.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.040
You know what I'm talking
about, right?

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.560
I think the most difficult thing
that any chef can do is

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.390
go shopping.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.460
Because if you just blindly make
a phone call and say, I

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.710
need carrots, I need tomatoes,
and it just shows up, versus

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:58.180
actually taking time to
carefully plan out your menu.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.790
To try to source the best thing
from the best guy is

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.270
incredibly important.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.840
LIV WU: And we add to the
taste when it comes in.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.530
TYLER FLORENCE: Because the
taste, it's all the difference

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.570
in the world.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.780
So the holy grail of California
cooking is all

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.960
about the produce here.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.520
I lived in York City for 14
years, and when I moved out to

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.620
California in 2006, it was one
of those things to me, it was

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.160
probably the most important
moment in my culinary career

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.240
is when I started to dive into
the California food scene and

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.525
how amazing thing taste.

00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:36.080
It's the difference between a
Georgia peach and a California

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.830
dry farm peach.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.990
You can't compare the two.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.720
So a Georgia peach, and there's
no disrespect to

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.660
Georgia peach farmers, because
I grew up in the south, so I

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.280
grew up on a lot of--

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.110
I was raised on Georgia
peaches.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.420
Because of the ample rainfall
that happens in the American

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.470
Southeast throughout the summer,
these peaches are just

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.970
really, really dense and heavy
and they're filled with water.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.010
And water is just sort
of a flabby flavor.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.950
Where California peaches,
because the way the weather

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.280
cycles throughout the season--

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.200
like right now, we're about to
sort of get our rain for the

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.980
year, and the grounds just get

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.070
completely soaked and saturated.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.845
And then throughout the summer,
it doesn't rain for

00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:22.090
120 days, 180 days.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.580
And so through that growth
cycle, the trees themselves--

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.380
and it's the oldest irrigation
plan on earth, and

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.760
Mediterranean olives have been
grown this way, and grape

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.970
vines have been grown
this way.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.230
So as the plants really have
to stress and find the

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.180
moisture, and deepen their roots
system, they're going to

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.880
pull minerality out of the
ground as well as water.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.060
And so they get these really big
beautiful wide leaves, so

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.550
they're getting energy through
the sun, through

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.610
photosynthesis.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.190
And they're getting their
nutrients, and they get the

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.860
minerality through the proper
channels, not just rainfall.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.640
So you'll get this big, dense,
juicy peach, but instead of

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.960
just like you bite into it and
it explodes with water, which

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.630
is a really juicy
peach, it's fun.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.710
But it can't touch the flavor
of a California apricot or a

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.250
California peach.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.050
LIV WU: You are so sounding
like a wine grower.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.090
TYLER FLORENCE: You just
can't touch it.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.170
You bite into, like a California
peach and it's ripe

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:20.990
in season--

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:25.590
I mean, it's like, a Frog Hollow
peach, is just to me

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.440
like one of the--

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.460
I so look forward to the season,
and the first one, I

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.920
start to well up a little bit.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.650
Because it's just, that is the
definition of a peach.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.180
And it's so fantastic.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.730
So to me, to answer your
question, to be a young chef

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.920
right now, with so much
information at your

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.080
fingertips, and also how chefs
trade information back and

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.070
forth at lightning speed through
Instagram and through

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.730
Twitter, is really transforming
and hitting the

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.030
gas on how we share information
and how fast

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.160
trends can swipe across
the country.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.340
So the old model of sharing
ideas from a culinary

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.790
standpoint, I would have to get
on a plane, and fly to a

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.290
city, and eat in this guy's
restaurant, and take pictures

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.860
and take notes to kind
of get the idea of

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.960
what it's all about.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.420
And now, I see what these people
post as specials every

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.660
single night.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.395
So to me, like I follow--
if you guys follow me on

00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:32.330
Instagram and then kind of dig
through who I follow, I follow

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.590
some pretty interesting
people.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.110
And probably some chefs you
haven't heard of yet.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:41.240
But it's so inspiring to
watch creativity just

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.880
unfold at real time.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.430
It's a very interesting time
to be a chef, because the

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.120
curve, it used to
be a big curve.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.300
You had to like fill up your
passport, and travel, and

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.130
taste, and I always recommend
that, because you can't

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.060
replace that.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.990
You can't replace
the authentic.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.750
But you can certainly get a
very, very clear idea of what

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.609
the authentic looks like, just
by sharing images and video

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:07.280
through social media.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.540
LIV WU: Wonderful.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.670
Really passionate stuff,
thank you.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.230
TYLER FLORENCE: I love what
I do, I really do.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.619
LIV WU: I'm going to change
directions a little bit.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.490
You were in the studio 16 years
ago with your first

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:26.200
show, "Cooking", with
real life people.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.079
Have we changed?

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.300
Are we cooking less?

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.370
I'm afraid to ask.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:34.280
Or are we maybe be cooking more
because of social media

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.370
because of the Food Network.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.620
TYLER FLORENCE: I think,
so I started in 1996.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.780
I was a guest chef on a show
called "In Food Today" and it

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.180
was hosted by David
Rosengarten.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.300
I don't know if you guys
know who this guy is.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.840
He had a show called
"Good Taste"?

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.080
He was kind of a nerdy guy.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.510
I don't know if David's going
to see this or not.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.480
I think he'd tell himself he's
kind of a nerdy guy.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.490
But anyway, he wore a
tie, he was very--

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:03.860
you know what I'm
talking about?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.870
David Rosengarten?

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:05.960
He hosted the show.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.550
So I was 25 years old and
I was executive chef at

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.030
restaurant called Cibo, C-I-B-O,
in New York City,

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.960
sort of on the cusps of Tudor
City, on 41st and 2nd.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.810
It was Italian, but it was
definitely sort of new

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.060
American Italian.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.830
And one of the producers from
Food Network stumbled into the

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.050
restaurant, and I was out
walking around saying hi to

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.420
people, and handing me
their card, and said

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.080
listen, call me.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.300
We'd love to have you on
this new cooking show.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.350
It was only in like New York,
and Chicago and Los Angeles.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.190
It wasn't really coast
to coast yet.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.670
And I hosted one show, and I
mumbled and stuttered my way

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.150
through four and
a half minutes.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.300
And I didn't know one person
could sweat that much in four

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.980
minutes, but apparently
it's possible.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.270
And I thought I'd bombed it,
but the executive producer

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.720
walked down and said, that
was fantastic, can you

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.750
come back next week?

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.640
So between '96 and '99, I
hosted probably 50 or 60

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.930
different guest appearances.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.630
And I was almost on television
every day anyway.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.290
And then in 1999, probably when
a lot of you were just

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:11.750
starting college, I hosted
a show called "Food 911".

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.260
It's true.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.170
So I host a show called "Food
911," and it was a show where

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.310
I traveled around the country
and I helped people out with

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.530
their everyday food
emergencies.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.505
So you call 9-1-1, the cops show
up, and you call "Food

00:19:25.505 --> 00:19:29.040
911" and I show up.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.040
We shot that show for about
five years, and I think we

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.280
shot 150 episodes a year.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.780
I mean, it was a super
aggressive schedule.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.920
But what I got a chance to do
was really sort of down gear

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.590
and down shift how I
related to people.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.730
Because a lot of chefs are
kind of like cops.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.250
They kind of speak this code,
and they kind of live this

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.000
life that only other cops can
understand, so you speak cop

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.280
talk, and chefs kind of speak
chef talk to each other.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.620
So I had to sort of like shift
gears, and rethink how I

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.645
approached cooking and how I
approached the conversation of

00:20:08.645 --> 00:20:10.130
cooking of just really
civilian.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.380
Just real, real life people
who never went to culinary

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.270
school, don't know what the five
mother sauces are, don't

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.950
care what the five mother sauces
are, they're never

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.680
going to make a chicken
stock from scratch.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.240
So I had to sort of, kind
of like regroup.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.280
So it wasn't so much about
my idea of what their

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.140
food was all about.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.440
But really just trying
to fix their thing.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.810
Don't hit it over their head.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.090
Just kind of give them
what they want.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.200
Like literally, like my tuna
noodle casserole is terrible.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.450
And I'd walk into it, I'm like,
you're kind of right.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.580
But let's fix your tuna noodle
casserole, because

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.500
that's all she wants.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.110
So we just kind of went through
the steps, OK here's

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.480
how you can correct this, here's
how you can under cook

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.300
this but cook it correctly
at the last minute.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.610
And we would take her recipe
and fix it, with her

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.090
ingredients, in her kitchen,
and her stuff.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.110
And it was awesome.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.160
It was awesome, because and then
occasionally we did fun

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.920
stuff like creme brulee, and
we shot so many episodes.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.855
And it was the first chef on the
Food Network to not wear a

00:21:08.855 --> 00:21:12.200
chef coat, and it was
the first to show to

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.870
go out of the studio.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:19.980
And to me it was so compelling
because the Network was very

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.960
chef driven, very New York
City chef driven.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.110
And now the conversation is
completely wide open, and if

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.570
you watch the Food Network now,
there's somebody on the

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.360
network that speaks
your language.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.630
And not every chef is for
everybody, and not every host

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.650
is for everybody, but you're
going to find somebody who's

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.930
compelling on the network,
and I think that's really

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.350
spectacular.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:46.750
And recently, two, three years
ago, Food Network went through

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.350
what I call cell division, where
they split off between

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.830
Food Network and now the
Cooking Channel.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.540
And it's very similar to what
happened with MTV when they

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.870
realized, wow, we could actually
make a lot more money

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.090
by just playing "The Real World"
over and over and over

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:04.280
again, and these music videos
of what we used to do, we're

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.540
going to put those
over on MTV2.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.540
And so Food Network is now--

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.250
again, you're always kind of
giving people what they want,

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.770
and people really like to watch
culinary competitions.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.640
So that's where, so once you
get past around 12 o'clock,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.260
you're going to see culinary
competitions.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.790
There's going to be two people
in a room, cooking something,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.300
best man wins, all day long.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.830
All day long.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.280
Cupcakes, barbecue,
you name it.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.320
And it's a lot of fun.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.190
So I only host a show called
"The Great Food Truck Race,"

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:39.450
which I think is a lot of fun,
because it's a rock and roll

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.060
business show.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.170
"Fortune Magazine" wrote an
article on their online

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:50.970
version, and it was entitled
the 10 things a startup can

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.790
learn from "The Great Food Truck
Race." It's all solid

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.420
business practices.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.290
It's all solid points.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.490
And that's what I really like
about the show, because we get

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.750
a chance to hang out with young
hungry entrepreneurs who

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.360
really want to get into the
restaurant business.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.710
And I have sort of traditional
models in restaurants.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.190
I raised $4 million, I went
through two years of red tape,

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.930
of bureaucracy to get
the restaurant open.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.480
And with that, the statistics
for failure are enormous.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.410
9 out of 10 restaurants will
fail in the first year.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.820
And that is a huge risk, but
that one restaurant is going

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.740
to be really, really great.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.640
So the bar has been dropped to
a more approachable stance

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.100
with "The Great--," with food
trucks, because a guy with an

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.380
idea, I want to do creme brulee,
I want to do tacos, I

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.850
want to do crepes, I want to do
grilled cheese sandwiches,

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.430
I want to do burgers, I want to
do Korean tacos, I want to

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.320
do ribs, I want to
do chicken wings.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.350
There's like, such a diverse
menu, which is so interesting

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.030
and every city in America is
starting to really develop a

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.260
food truck culture.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.670
I think, I had this idea this
season, this is why I really

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.100
love the show and I think it's
very important, because it's

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:06.350
now the new answer to
American fast food.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.170
It's the new answer to
American fast food.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.330
It's $6, where would you
rather spend it?

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.250
I mean, would you rather give it
to the clown, or would you

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:17.190
rather give it to some local,
hard working entrepreneur who

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.530
just got the stuff at
the farmer's market.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.270
You know it's organic, you're
going to look him in the eye

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.680
every day, and he's going to
make you a fantastic meal.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.670
When these trucks kind of get
together at night, and the

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.310
thing called Off The Grid in
San Francisco, which is

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.700
awesome, it creates its
own festival, it

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.670
makes its own gravy.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.130
And so that to me is really,
really compelling, to get back

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.630
to your answer.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.560
I think we're cooking a lot
more than we used to cook.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.870
I think we're on the dawn of
enlightenment, that we truly

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.050
understand that we
are what we eat.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:55.600
We're all machines, we're all
animals, and we need high

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.970
quality fuel to operate
at a high level.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.730
Your brain has no clue
what a calorie is.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.230
Your brain could care less
what a calorie is.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:12.470
Your body is satiated by
nutrients, not caloric intake.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.110
Your brain could care less.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.980
The higher quality of food you
put in your body, the less of

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.330
it you're going to eat.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.630
Because your brain is going,
cool, I'm good.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.830
The meter is full.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.950
The poorer quality food you're
going to eat, the more that

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:32.510
you have to eat before your
brain says you're full.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.780
You have to eat a lot of it,
before you brain says cool,

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.810
I've had enough.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.340
So we have been starving
ourselves, not from gluttony

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.710
and eating, but from
nutrients.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.180
We are starved from nutrients.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:52.120
We're eating such poor quality
food, mass produced food,

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.590
loaded with high fructose
corn syrup, that

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.470
your body cannot process.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.150
Your stomach can't process it.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.650
It gets processed in your liver
as if it were alcohol.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.760
So you see adults with beer
bellies, and you see kids with

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.280
soda bellies.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.560
So you have to ask yourself
a question.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.750
The old PR slap is that organics
are expensive, but

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.990
I'm asking you what's
more expensive?

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:19.510
Healthy fresh produce, or
obesity and diabetes?

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.400
Because that's exactly what the
other side of the spectrum

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:21.730
looks like.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.790
We're fat, we're sick, and we
got to do something about it.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.590
So I think we're at the dawn
of enlightenment, finally

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.640
understanding that you
are what you eat.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.850
You put high quality
food in your body--

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.680
I was talking to a woman the
other night, I'm, you know,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.650
two week book tour across
the country.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:40.300
And this woman said to me she
switched, she stopped eating

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.540
processed food completely, and
started eating 100% organics.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.740
I get teared up thinking
about it.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.350
She lost 40 pounds, 40
pounds in a year.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.960
And her doctor took her off high
blood pressure medication

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.400
for the first time
in 20 years.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.530
You can heal yourself
through food.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.130
You eat really good quality
food, and you're going to lose

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.870
weight, you're you going to
sleep better, you're going to

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.190
process, you're going
to live longer.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:11.250
So we are cooking more, we're
cooking better food.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.710
No one cares about you
more than you.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.700
These fast food, these companies
could care less

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.840
about your health.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.960
If you get cancer, that's
your problem.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.480
But they are happy to
sell you stuff, they

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480
just want your money.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.390
The same thing with like big
oil, they don't care if they

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.310
melt the planet down.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.230
They don't care.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.310
They just want you to fill
your gas tank up, for

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.280
hopefully another 10 years.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.500
That's what they want.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.790
So it's up to you, and you in
protecting your health and

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.640
your family.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.330
And it's got to be
100% organics, or

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.175
you can't trust it.

00:27:39.175 --> 00:27:40.510
You just can't trust it.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.630
It's got to be good high
quality food, because

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.460
you're worth it.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.030
You're worth it to yourself.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.120
And what I like about the books,
it's not so much about

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.980
delivering just like
fancy chef recipes.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.020
When I dream of food, this
is what looks like, it's

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.950
explosive, it's vibrant.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.400
But once you dive into it,
it's about nutrition.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.500
It is about putting quality
nutrition in your body, it's

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.900
not about putting food
in your face.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.580
LIV WU: Beautifully
said, thank you.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.830
That's wonderful.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.530
TYLER FLORENCE: I'm real
excited about this.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.340
I'm really passionate
about it.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.270
Because to me like--

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.290
I fly, I travel, like you
guys travel, I'm sure.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.280
And you fly through Chicago, you
fly through Atlanta, you

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.980
fly through Dallas, and like my
god, like we are evolving

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.540
as people but it's not-- we're
not evolving for the better.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.840
We're heavy.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.860
And you know what I'm talking
about, and it's really--

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.160
I feel so bad for
these people.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.560
Because they drink,
they drink soda.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.830
And they drink Coke, and they
drink these things that, you

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.370
know if you drink one Coke a
day, one Coke a day, you put

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.370
on 15 pounds in a year.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.935
And also, high fructose corn
syrup blocks a hormone in your

00:28:53.935 --> 00:28:59.210
body called Leptin, and it
blocks the signal where your

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.960
brain tells you that
you're full.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.380
I mean, this is how food
is manipulated.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.810
I want you drink more of it, I'm
going to put salt in it,

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.100
I'm going to create a chemical
that's going to shut your

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.030
brain off from telling you've
had enough, and I'm going to

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.530
make it salty, and I'm going to
make you drink a lot of it.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.580
Awesome.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.210
It's going to cost me $0.10 for
every 16 ounces to make,

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.460
I'm going to sell it
to you for $6.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.190
LIV WU: And a can of Coke is
about two cases of broccoli,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:31.110
and you eat 1/10 of that case
and you're completely full.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.030
TYLER FLORENCE: You're
completely full.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.130
And this is my point.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.510
It's about making decision
that you are going to put

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.440
fresh food first in your life.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.680
It's about making that clear,
honest, decision that healthy

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.700
is the way to go.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.030
I want you to think about that,
and I want to have a

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.920
conversation with somebody
else in your life.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.460
Because we all know somebody
that probably needs to have

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.970
that conversation with.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.350
And then do something
about it.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.600
It's like when people--

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.490
we've all been convinced that
we don't know how to feed

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.090
ourselves anymore.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.770
We've all been convinced.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:11.600
But I think this generation,
like us, I

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.010
think we know better.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:21.940
I think it's our turn to stop
the turnstile of just bad

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.420
information, and poor eating
habits, and just empty

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.310
calories and blindly eating
things that aren't organic,

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.380
and you don't know where
they come from.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.030
And we just insist
on transparency.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.916
That's the new thing about
social media, it's the new

00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:40.510
thing about so much information
being accessible,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.710
it's about transparency.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.310
Like I said, everything in
this book is Google-able.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.000
You can search up yourself
and you can find the same

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.660
information.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.570
LIV WU: So I'm sure people have
a lot of questions, but

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.350
I'll turn it over to let you ask
your one question to the

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.860
engineers and your request to
the engineers in the audience.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:59.470
TYLER FLORENCE: So we
were just talking

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.800
about Google+ earlier.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.070
How many team members are
working on Google+ in here?

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.640
One?

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.320
So this is going to the
guy in the back.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.300
This is really kind
of interesting.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.150
Because I just signed on with
Google+, so I'm trying to

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.150
figure out how to
make that work.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.620
Because now I manage my Twitter
feed, my Facebook

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.340
feed, my Tumblr feed,
my Instagram feed,

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.840
and now my G+ feed.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.550
I manage like five social media
sites off my phone.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.950
And it's kind of clumsy.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:35.170
So to me, I think instead of
trying to get into that bloody

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.560
pool of sharks to compete with
that social thing, you should

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.780
create a platform that exists at
10,000 feet, so people can

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.010
manage everything
else below them.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.970
So that to me is probably the
smartest position that you

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.850
guys can take, instead of just
trying to think through, OK

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.440
how can I get another group of
people that want to go after

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.950
fans and likers and that
kind of stuff.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.680
Because I mean, it just,
after a while, it's

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.455
like, I don't really--

00:31:56.455 --> 00:31:58.070
you kind of put things
in priority.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.910
My Twitter account, I have
a half a million people

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:00.890
following me on Twitter.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.520
That is a little more important
than my Facebook,

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.600
because I've been tapped
at 5,000, and I

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.725
don't really know them.

00:32:05.725 --> 00:32:06.810
You know what I mean?

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.390
So I look at their pictures of
their kids and stuff, and on

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.390
vacation, and I don't
know them.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.520
We're friends,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.540
I mean are we friends?

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.520
I mean really, we're friends?

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.900
I mean, I don't know.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.100
I don't know you.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.690
I answer your question a couple
times a year, but I

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.130
don't know you.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.050
So anyway, it might be a smart
position to take, to not go

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.260
here but go here.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.300
And let people-- because they
still have their connection,

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.560
they've got a big investment
in Facebook, because that's

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.000
where the grandparents see the
picture of the grandkids.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.170
And they've got a big connection
through Twitter,

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.050
because I don't really watch
live TV anymore.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.670
Do you guys watch live TV?

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.620
And isn't it amazing?

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.910
And this is a generational
thing, too because as I travel

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:52.140
around, and kind of talk to
people, my parents' generation

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.620
still love to watch
television.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.820
But my generation,
I watch my DVR.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:01.220
I love "Homeland." I love
"Boardwalk Empire." And other

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.020
than a live sporting event,
I don't really

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.950
watch live TV for anything.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.600
It's about how I extract
information out of the world,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.070
I don't turn the television
on to get news

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.130
anymore, I just scroll--

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.830
I just go through
my Twitter feed.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.220
And it's got national news, it's
got local news, it's got

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.000
traffic news, it's
got weather news.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.910
It's got people I follow, like
Drunk Hulk I think, I don't

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.050
know if you guys follow him.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.210
He's a funny guy.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.880
You should follow
him on Twitter.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.800
He's angry, and he's
had a lot to drink.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.890
And he talks in all caps.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:34.650
Drunk Hulk.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.000
Check him out.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.410
But how we extract information
I think is really great.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.810
So people have a lot
of investment--

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.960
I've been on Twitter since 2008,
and it's taken me a long

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.570
time to kind of get a half
million people together.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.890
So I would never dump that with
a preference to something

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.340
else because I appreciate those

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.930
relationships that I have.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.720
I have different relationships
with people on Instagram than

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.240
I have on Twitter.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.580
So it's almost like a different
circle, and that's

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.730
always been Google's philosophy,
about having

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.680
different circles of people
and how they cross over.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.710
But it's not so much about
that, as it is creating a

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.830
platform that exists
above it all.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.360
So you can go in to one place
and kind of manage everybody

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.420
simultaneously.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.550
That's the missing thing.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.610
So it's all about the
consolidation.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.060
So as Twitter and Facebook
consolidated the internet--

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.199
because before that,
it was just a big

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.860
gigantic phone book.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:23.219
So now that consolidation's been
fragmented, now another

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:25.310
consolidation of those
fragmented consolidations

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.230
needs to happen.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.560
So I think that's a very
interesting position to take.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.420
LIV WU: OK, heard.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.210
There's a mic over here, if you
have questions for Tyler.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.489
AUDIENCE: You're a person of a
lot of power, with the skills

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.830
that you have, the platform
that you have, and the

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.659
connections that you have.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.610
And you also talk about wanting
to create something

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:47.420
sustainable, and being able to
kind of restore this world to

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.610
the way it used to be.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.480
Or, to good.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.820
How are you using that power--

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.810
like you talk about making
anchovies and sardines sexy--

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.290
how are you doing that?

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:58.420
TYLER FLORENCE: You know what?

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.440
To me, like what I'm doing,
you and I having a

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.560
conversation right now.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.440
So that's what I'm doing
something about.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.570
I wrote a book called "Tyler
Florence Fresh," and I think

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.650
there's so much great
information.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.970
You ask me what I'm doing
about it, like

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:10.550
I'm writing a book.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.630
It's not so much about the book
because honestly, like as

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.500
far as what I do to make money,
I don't make any money

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.020
writing books.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.170
But I do think it's a really
powerful way for us to have a

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.310
conversation.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.840
LIV WU: There's a chapter
on anchovies.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.130
A whole chapter.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.430
TYLER FLORENCE: That's
what I'm saying.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.300
I can read from the book
if you would like.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.400
AUDIENCE: And then one
last question.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.530
Where does the chicken from
Wayfare Tavern come from?

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.040
TYLER FLORENCE: Where does--

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.000
the chicken?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.715
It comes from Mary's Farm.

00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:36.410
It's organic, air dried,
air chilled

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.750
chicken, from Petaluma.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:39.480
It's fabulous stuff.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.550
We actually buy so much
chicken that we

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.350
dictate their feed.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.140
And it's really, really
delicious stuff.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.550
DEREK: Hey Tyler, my
name is Derek.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.680
TYLER FLORENCE: Everybody
say hi to Derek.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.210
DEREK: I've always been a fan
of "Tyler's Ultimate." So I

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.070
still have the spaghetti and
meatballs recipe in my head.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.890
Beef, veal and pork.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.490
TYLER FLORENCE: Thank
you so much, man.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.250
I appreciate it.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.530
DEREK: So one quick question
and then just one

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.140
really quick question.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.010
You've obviously been very
successful, you've done a lot

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.760
of TV shows, done a lot
of restaurants,

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.730
done your own stores.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:15.530
Just for a takeaway for us, as
more engineers or people

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.940
working at Google, what's one
kind of trait or quality that

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.460
you've really discovered going
through all this, that's

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.940
really key to kind of being
successful as a leader, being

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:29.580
successful as a colleague, a
coworker and as a peer to the

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.910
people you work with
every day?

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.360
I'm just curious what's
the kind of one thing

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.400
that sticks with you?

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.140
TYLER FLORENCE: I think you've
got to be honest.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.880
I think you got to be honest.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.300
You got to say the right thing,
I think you ought to

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.670
listen to people, and
I think you got to

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.920
tell people the truth.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.250
I think you got to be honest.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.180
I think that is to me--

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.450
like when we make our wine, I
want to make a very honest,

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.380
pure product.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.290
When people come in our
restaurants, I want to have a

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.270
very authentic experience.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:59.060
When I write my book, I want
to tell you like from my

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.000
perspective, what I think
is just the best.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.180
Easiest, quickest, cleanest,
clearest, most delicious thing

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:04.950
you can make.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:08.610
And I think you've got to be
able to talk to people and

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.340
answer them, give them
very honest answers.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.600
I think that's the most
important thing ever is

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.260
honesty and transparency.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.340
DEREK: Awesome.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.010
And a quick question, I know you
probably get asked this a

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.060
lot, but I've heard it
asked to other chefs.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.050
Last meal you could ever have,
you're going to be off this

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.490
planet tomorrow, you
have one option.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.180
What is it?

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.275
TYLER FLORENCE: So it's all
about the pendulum swing, you

00:37:32.275 --> 00:37:32.660
understand this, right?

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.920
So if you like chocolate,
you have to like

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.560
your running shoes.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.920
You have to.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.180
And to me, like I think the last
thing I taste, I really

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.220
want it to be the first
thing I ever tasted.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.510
And to me, like the rootsy,
authentic American cooking

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.480
from the American South, the
heritage cooking is probably

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.435
the last thing I
want to taste.

00:37:49.435 --> 00:37:51.660
So somewhere between like,
fried chicken and collard

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.380
greens and barbecue and grits.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.700
Maybe one plate of that.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.110
I think I would be
very, very happy.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:57.790
DEREK: Thank you.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:58.710
TYLER FLORENCE: Of course.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.540
PHIL: Hi Tyler.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.390
Thanks for coming
to talk to us.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.800
TYLER FLORENCE: Of course.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.640
What's your name?

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.590
PHIL: Phil.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.300
TYLER FLORENCE: Everybody
say hi to Phil.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.600
PHIL: So you seem pretty
positive about food trucks,

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.910
and food truck culture, and
that's something I agree with.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.550
So do you think, like we have
enough food trucks?

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.290
You mentioned that
they're a viable

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.380
alternative to fast food?

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.260
TYLER FLORENCE: Have we had
enough food trucks?

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.560
PHIL: Do we have enough serving
San Francisco and

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.150
serving metro areas?

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.790
TYLER FLORENCE: I don't know, I
don't know where the ceiling

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.190
is for that as a
business model.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:32.710
But it's very compelling.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.050
So "The Great Food Truck Race,"
we didn't invent food

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:40.700
trucks, but we've gassed the
industry so much, that we

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:45.510
created two separate
fires, if you will.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:50.580
We've created a show that
shows how doable it is.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.520
Not saying it's easy, but how
doable it is, from an

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.470
operations standpoint, that
you can own a food truck.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.980
So the old business model of
putting in $4 million and

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.700
going through two years
construction and that kind of

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.570
stuff, and the failure rate
is very, very high.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:10.660
But a food truck, you can
lease a truck, have it

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:15.330
skinned, get a business
license, get a health

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.200
inspection, go to Costco and buy
some food, or go to like a

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.560
local farmer's market and buy
some food, and you can be in

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.810
business next week and
for like $10,000.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.760
So that's about lowering the
bar, and making it more

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.180
accessible to everybody.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.650
The other fire that we created
is really about creating a fan

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.420
base for the genre.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.750
So when we shot Season One of
"The Great Food Truck Race,"

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.700
nobody knew what the
show was all about.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.230
So we would drive through these
like little towns in

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.770
Tennessee and they were
like, food trucks

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.120
what's a food truck?

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.390
But now we're on to Season
Three and we're in

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:51.840
pre-production for Season
Four right now.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:57.370
Like 3, 4, 5, 6,000 people will
bombard a town because

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.170
they know we're going to be
there, and they hunt the

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.160
trucks down as if it were
a treasure hunt.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.730
Now, so many different
municipalities, big and small,

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:09.980
are starting to understand the
social value of trucks

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.530
themselves, and when they gang
them together and get a band,

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.010
and call it something,
it's a really cheap

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.840
festival to put on.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.970
And everybody wins, because like
the small operators get

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.770
to make some money, and they
like being together, creating

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.020
a whole culture of it.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.680
And as a chef, it's a very
respectable, even cool thing,

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.660
edgy, urban thing to go do,
to have a food truck.

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.160
Especially something that's
very popular.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.760
PHIL: So this is something
that I was actually

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.550
going to ask you.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:40.330
Are you aware of young chefs
bootstrapping their careers

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.510
out of food trucks?

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.370
So this is happening,
this is--

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:45.590
TYLER FLORENCE: Absolutely.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.810
People are sort of, instead of
creating a brick and mortar

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.920
business, they're creating
a food truck business and

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.700
backing that into a brick
and mortar business.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.670
So you're actually kind of
testing the business model on

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.260
a very micro level where
nobody can get hurt.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.360
I mean if you lose $10,000 of
your aunt's money, I mean, she

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.680
may hate you at Christmas
but she's not

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.180
going hate you forever.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.200
You lose an investor's $4
million in a restaurant, you

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:06.790
got a problem.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.040
Our lawyers are going to talk.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:21.040
It's about creating a new wave
of restaurants, these urban,

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.010
wonderful experiences.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.510
That you can go up to a truck
and order something that a

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.550
trained professional chef
is back there making.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.840
So they're choosing this
business model over--

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.424
so it's four wheels
over four walls.

00:41:34.424 --> 00:41:35.180
PHIL: Thanks.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.650
TYLER FLORENCE: Thanks, Phil.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.710
RACHEL: Hi Tyler, I'm Rachel.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.960
TYLER FLORENCE: Everybody
say hi to Rachel.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.430
Hi Rachel.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.820
RACHEL: I have to tell you that
my husband and I dated

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.610
for about five years, and he
proposed to me the same week I

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.480
first made your roast chicken,
so I think there's a--

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.890
so thank you for that, thank
you for pushing him along.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.840
TYLER FLORENCE: It's an
absolute deal closer.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.530
RACHEL: Best thing ever.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.240
So what I'm curious about is,
I've seen cookbooks from like

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.460
the 1940s and '50s, and there's
just some horrific

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.400
things going on in there
with, like Jell-o

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.240
and stuff like that.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.150
TYLER FLORENCE: What's
wrong with Jell-o?

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.760
I think some of those books are
actually really gorgeous.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.680
RACHEL: They're neat to
have, as like sort of

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.650
an heirloom of sorts.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.930
But I'm wondering about trends
you see now that aren't going

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.060
to be sustainable.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.900
I mean, I think fresh food's
one thing, I think--

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.960
TYLER FLORENCE: Trends that
aren't going to be

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.560
sustainable.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.550
I think that's the definition
of a trend.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.350
RACHEL: But what's going on
right now that everyone's

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:28.020
like, this is going to happen
forever, that is not going to

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:28.510
happen forever?

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.720
TYLER FLORENCE: So we live in
a post molecular world.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.740
So molecular gastronomy that
sort of just caught the world

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:40.730
on fire and the late '90s blew
up in the 2000s, and then

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:43.770
right now I think everyone has
kind of tasted and been there

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:44.530
and done it.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:45.770
Figured out the recipes
and knows how to

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.650
knock it off and whatever.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:51.530
I think some of that stuff is
kind of interesting, but the

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:58.010
new trend which I think is
sustainable, is this idea of

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.050
the sourcing list.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.300
So it's not so much about
making a phone call and

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.900
getting tuna flown in from
Hawaii, but making a

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.360
connection with a guy on the
west coast of the United

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.020
States who's going to go and
catch the fish and drop it off

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:11.900
at your back door.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.750
Closing the gap as
much as possible.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.790
If you follow me on Instagram
and kind of follow the chefs I

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:19.380
follow, I mean how they source
stuff and where they get stuff

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.280
from is just awesome.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.150
It's just awesome.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.880
So to me, like having that
tighter connection, and

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.020
keeping your money in a
pretty tight circle--

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.720
there are mushroom geeks
in every major part

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.160
the of United States.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.380
So if you can connect with a
mushroom geek, someone who's

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.630
going to go forage some
chanterelles for you, forage

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.540
porcinis, or forage morels
in spring and even maybe

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.810
cultivate some interesting
Japanese style mushrooms.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:49.440
Like that, to me is really,
really fascinating.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.540
And that's where chefs now are
really trying their stripes.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.020
Because anybody can make a
nice scallop, but show me

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.940
something I've never
seen before.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.190
Show me an ingredient--

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.830
it's not so much about the piece
of parsley, but it's

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.910
actually having somebody harvest
parsley at a very

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.010
young age where it's sort of in
its infancy, so you can see

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.550
how beautiful it is.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.040
This stuff is amazing.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.220
Actually we got this farmer who
is going to start growing

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.090
fava beans for us
in the spring.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.610
And then we've actually told
him to not clip it.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:26.280
I want the bean as it starts to
break through the shoot, I

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.330
want the shoot, the bean,
and the root.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.990
And I want to wash that
off and I want to

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.520
put that on a plate.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.630
That to me is really exciting,
because you see how gorgeous

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.810
and simple nature really,
really is.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:40.460
And that's sustainable, I think
a lot of chefs are doing

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.140
that today.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.956
So when David Chang said the
hardest thing San Francisco

00:44:42.956 --> 00:44:44.080
chefs have to do is shop?

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.830
You're right it is.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.420
It's very difficult.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.920
MONIZA: Hi Tyler, I'm Moniza.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.670
TYLER FLORENCE: Hi Moniza,
how are you?

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.630
Everybody say hi.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.970
MONIZA: Hi everyone.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.630
I'm a huge fan, I follow you
on Instagram and Twitter.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.460
So I saw that you place
lot of emphasis on

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.460
organic and clean food.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.000
In San Francisco, since most of
us live in the Bay Area, if

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.770
there was one restaurant that
you could recommend to

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.660
everybody in this room that--

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:08.750
apart from your own--

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.140
that really places an emphasis
on organic and clean food,

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.880
what would you recommend?

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.880
TYLER FLORENCE: I like Greens,
in Fort Mason, have you guys

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.490
been there?

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:17.050
It's been there forever.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.860
And the food is always
so interesting.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.860
It's a vegetarian, vegan

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.450
restaurant, and it's so delicious.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.010
It's in Fort Mason.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:28.720
So if you guys are up in San
Francisco, that would be my go

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.410
to answer for what
you're saying.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:31.320
I love Greens.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.040
RACHEL: Me too.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.200
I love vegetables.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.270
Also one more quick question.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:37.290
So you and Bobby Flay are
definitely my favorite Food

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.640
Network personalities.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:43.490
Is he as nice as he seems like
on the Food Network?

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.180
TYLER FLORENCE: Can you guys
turn the camera off?

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.430
I'm kidding.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.160
Bobby is a very, very
dear friend of mine.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.150
And Stephanie March, his lovely
wife, is a very dear

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:58.960
friend of mine, and Sophie,
their daughter is a very good

00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.680
family friend.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.460
We vacationed in France
together.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.960
When I first started on Food
Network in 1996, Bobby Flay

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.780
held my hand and introduced me
to agents, and introduced me

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.310
to lawyers, and said this is
what you got do, here's the

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:13.100
first step.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.690
And no one else gave
me that sort of

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:15.430
attention other than him.

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:16.760
He's a very very good
friend of mine.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.640
I wouldn't be where I am
today without him.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.360
He wrote a foreword for my first
cookbook and made that

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.130
successful.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:22.290
And he is an awesome guy.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.250
Nobody works harder
than Bobby Flay.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.700
MONIZA: Tell him I said hi,
next time you see him.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.100
I love him.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.220
TYLER FLORENCE: I'll
be happy to do it.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.650
ALISSA: Hi Tyler, thank
you for coming

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:31.400
to speak to us today.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.560
TYLER FLORENCE: Of course,
what's your name?

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.550
ALISSA: My name's Alissa.

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:34.490
TYLER FLORENCE: Alissa?

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.660
Everybody say hi to Alissa.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.882
ALISSA: Hi.

00:46:36.882 --> 00:46:39.530
So I was actually going to ask
the same question of what your

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.730
two to three favorite
restaurants

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.860
were in the Bay Area.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.190
But since she just asked it,
I'll ask another question.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.720
You speak very highly about
organic food and I think it's

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.370
become kind of a craze, it's
become well accepted.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.730
But I've heard a lot of
different things about eating

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.430
organic food.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.640
Some people are like, oh you
should only eat organic meat,

00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.660
don't worry about
anything else.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.910
Or you just kind of blanket
organic food, from everything,

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:06.410
from meat to thin skinned
vegetables.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:07.760
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.330
TYLER FLORENCE: So you have
to eat as close to

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:12.580
the source as possible.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:18.050
It's really shocking if you
understand what the FDA and

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:22.970
the USDA and the Department of
Agriculture-- like how little

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:26.670
they actually pay attention to
what's in the food supply.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:32.820
So companies that create GMO
seeds, they don't have to

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.360
prove that it's not healthy.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:40.240
And it's one big massive
science experiment that

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.730
started with high fructose corn
syrup in the early '70s

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:47.980
when it was introduced, and you
see where we are today.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.845
High fructose corn syrup is
probably the most poisonous

00:47:49.845 --> 00:47:52.430
thing you ever put
in your body.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:57.670
And then the idea of a
genetically modified seeds, so

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.100
it's not so much about trying
to make that more disease

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.400
resistant, it's about control.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.830
And when that kind of thing
happens you lose species

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:08.830
diversification.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.525
You lose seeds.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:22.610
And if they develop a seed and
implant it, that has an insect

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:26.020
repellent sort of designed in
its DNA, what do you think

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.710
that's going to do your body?

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.890
What do you think that's
going to do?

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:35.020
So they don't have to prove,
because it's considered safe,

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.000
from the FDA--

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.850
they don't have to prove
that it's not safe.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:41.270
As a matter of fact they don't
even have to be inspected.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:45.620
But if you have an organic farm,
you have to go through

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.740
so much red tape to prove that
your product is organic.

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.000
That's by design.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.650
They want to make it very,
very difficult for you.

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.440
So consumer choice
is up to you.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.836
So if you insist on that kind
of thing, and I would insist

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:00.700
on it for your own health.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.360
Because you don't know what's
going in the product.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.210
And again, these companies
that create these things,

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.790
they're not interested or
concerned about your health.

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:09.170
They're just not.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:11.500
They're really interested in
what's in your wallet.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.720
And if you get cancer,
it's your problem.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.820
But we are a very,
very hardy lot.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.920
We've been around since
the dawn of time.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.350
We've been eating food for a
long time, and these health

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:27.420
concerns are only 30,
40 years old.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.930
I'm not saying that genetics
doesn't have something to do

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:37.440
with it, but as sick and as
obese as we are as a nation,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.800
it's all diet related.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.600
So my question to you is, if
it's not organic, can you

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.980
trust what it is?

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:51.050
Now there's a lot of farmers
at the farmer's market that

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.650
produce organic goods but that
are in the process of becoming

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:58.150
certified organic, and
that's just as good.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.550
There's a lot of things you
really got to think about.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:04.920
So economic recovery starts in
your very own community.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.290
So you got to keep
your money tight.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:12.200
You can't take your money, spend
it, and have that source

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.150
to be funneled outside
of your community.

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:18.190
You have to keep your money
in a very tight circle.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.930
So if you buy your goods from a
guy who just grew it not too

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:24.890
far from here, you're helping
the economy grow.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.480
You really, really are.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.370
And so that to me is what
I would recommend.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.090
We can talk all day about the
health qualities of not just

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:40.050
eating organic beef, but
drinking grass fed milk,

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.920
organic milk as well.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.340
There's the French paradox,
which is really interesting,

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.810
about how people in France eat
a very high fat diet but they

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:52.650
have such a low cholesterol
rate, and such a low rate of

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.340
heart disease.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:57.370
They eat way more fat than we
do, but what they eat is purer

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:58.720
than what we eat.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.090
And they eat a lot of pro-biotic
rich foods, like

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:09.010
whole milk cheese, that has all
the molecules and really

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.730
kind of good healthy bacteria,
that kind of keep your

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.340
digestion system
nice and clean.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.670
So you got to eat pure,
clean food.

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:17.710
It's not hard.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:18.280
This is what I'm saying.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.650
We've all sort of, like--

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.820
what's the big direction?

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.760
What's the new diet?

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.600
Is it Atkins?

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.390
Paleo?

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.270
Paleo is actually really kind
of interesting, I think.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:29.390
But you just got to eat good,
wholesome, healthy food.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.230
It's simple.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.020
Just eat clean, fresh
healthy food.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.160
MONIZA: Thank you.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.720
I have one recipe request.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.820
If I could find it anywhere.

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.030
Do you have the recipe
for the popovers you

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.920
make at Wayfare Tavern?

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.243
Not healthy at all,
but so delicious.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.570
TYLER FLORENCE: To me,
like, it's actually--

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:55.050
because it's a big puff of air,
I haven't like weighed

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.815
out from a calorie standpoint,
what's the difference between

00:51:57.815 --> 00:52:01.516
our popovers versus
whatever, I don't

00:52:01.516 --> 00:52:03.500
know, focaccia or something.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.610
But it's basically just a
big crusty ball of air.

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.780
Yeah it's like, the webby
crusty stuff is actually

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:10.480
really beautiful.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.800
LIV WU: And the air doesn't
have any calories.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.860
TYLER FLORENCE: There's
no calories in air.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:18.670
Something really funny, I went
with my wife and a very good

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.690
couple friend of ours to El
Bulli, in Rosas, Spain, last

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:22.940
year before they closed.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.650
It was a very expensive
dinner.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:29.420
It was like $4,000 a couple.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.320
Very expensive dinner, but one
of those things you have to go

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.690
do, because now it's closed and
I could say I did it, and

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:36.850
that kind of thing.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:39.580
Regret, is more, I think
is more expensive.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:44.050
But everything was just jacked
up with air, from a method

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.100
standpoint.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.950
So everything was just spongy
and light, and air, and like

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.080
effervescent.

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.280
I'm like, wow, this guy's food
cost must be awesome.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.600
Because you think it's like,
instead of like putting it on

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.570
the plate, he'll puree it, whip
it with air, and put a

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.960
spoon of that on the plate.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.560
I mean that's how you
that's how you get

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.225
good food costs, man.

00:53:01.225 --> 00:53:02.060
Light as a feather.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.470
Anyway, so the answer
to your question.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:06.790
So the book I wrote before this
is called "Family Meal,"

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.865
and the recipe for our popovers
are in that book.

00:53:09.865 --> 00:53:10.170
ALISSA: Awesome.

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:12.060
I'm going to run
out and get it.

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.300
ANNIE: My name's Annie,
by the way.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.760
TYLER FLORENCE: Hi Annie,
how are you?

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.740
ANNIE: So I try to cook a lot at
home, and I know you put an

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:21.410
emphasis on organic,
healthy clean food.

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:22.850
And I was wondering
if you have any

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:24.780
advice on where to shop?

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.050
You know, I try to go to the
farmer's market on the

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:28.530
weekends, but that's not always

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.170
available during the weekdays.

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:35.010
So is Whole Foods the
best place to shop?

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.970
TYLER FLORENCE: I thinks Whole
Foods is fabulous.

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:38.280
I was just an Austin--

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:44.250
so I bumped into one of the
media relations people with

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:49.910
Whole Foods in Austin, and
I love their philosophy.

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:52.560
Like not only do I buy food
there but I buy all my vitamin

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.330
supplements and stuff
like that.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.430
So a big portion of my
refrigerator is just filled

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:58.980
with vitamins, and Super Green
Food and things like that.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.720
So I can like really carefully
monitor my nutrition intake.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:08.276
And every piece of food in this
book was purchased at a

00:54:08.276 --> 00:54:09.526
Whole Foods.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.600
Every bit of it.

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.400
I bought everything at Whole
Foods, like 7 o'clock in the

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:19.430
morning, went home, prepped
for about two hours, three

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.220
hours and then we started
shooting for

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.140
the rest of the day.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.200
So I like them a lot.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.540
I mean I don't work for them
or anything but I dig what

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:28.530
they talk about.

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:31.090
ANNIE: You also mention buying
within your area, buying

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.110
local, but that's not
always possible.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:35.610
So Whole Foods would
be a good option?

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:38.030
TYLER FLORENCE: I do think
it's possible.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:41.100
So let's talk about
a ceremony.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.650
So there's usually a farmer's
market, there's got to be a

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:44.400
farmer's market, right?

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.150
There's got to be.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:49.860
So on the weekend-- you have to
kind of get into a mode of

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.720
like, having a ceremony.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.490
Like a thing that you do all the
time, that you really like

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.150
a lot, that you kind
of feel like that's

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:56.810
your church, or whatever.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:55:01.320
That's your thing that you go do
just to have an hour or two

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.380
that's a great head cleaner.

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.790
And I think strolling
around the

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:06.510
farmer's market is fantastic.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:07.650
It's great.

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:09.546
ANNIE: But you need to like
plan out your meal for the

00:55:09.546 --> 00:55:10.000
week, and then go shop
that one day.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.160
TYLER FLORENCE: You don't.

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:12.970
You don't.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.080
This is what I'm saying.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.860
So this is where we have been
conditioned, to feel like we

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.250
have to put so much work into
planning and writing down,

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.980
taking notes, and planning
and planning.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.730
And that's just exhausting.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.910
You should just go and
just be inspired.

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:29.797
Just go and go, oh my god, the
broccoli looks fantastic, I'm

00:55:29.797 --> 00:55:31.430
going to roast that.

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:35.460
So one of the best, easiest ways
to cook vegetables, and

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.612
you need a sheet pan, a bottle
of olive oil, little bit of

00:55:38.612 --> 00:55:41.220
salt and pepper in your oven,
and it works for everything,

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.870
is just simply roasting.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.930
So butternut squash, broccoli,
carrots, green beans,

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:48.000
zucchini, cauliflower eggplant,
you name it.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.060
If you cut it into consistent
sizes, and you put it onto a

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.800
sheet pan, a little bit of olive
oil, salt, pepper, in

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.760
the oven, 350 degrees for
10 or 15 minutes and it

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.260
transforms the starches
and sugars.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.380
And my kids love it.

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:03.370
They'll eat anything,
if it's roasted.

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.530
They love roasted carrots, they
love roasted Brussels

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:08.230
sprouts, and so boiled
is kind of tragic.

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:11.080
So anyway it works with like
big leafy greens too.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.050
I mean you can and
roast, like kale.

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:16.700
Make kale chips, that's
delicious as a snack.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.890
So you don't have to-- don't
plan so much, because people

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.150
like, it makes people panicky,
when they gotta, I gotta plan,

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:23.110
what am I going to plan?

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:26.360
You should plan a
dinner party.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.630
You should plan the holidays.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.910
But if you're just cooking
Monday through Friday?

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:32.080
Just go to the store.

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.390
Just see what's going on, and
you're going to come back with

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.890
more inspiration than you
walked in with, from a

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:38.010
planning standpoint.

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:40.690
Just go check it out.

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:42.020
LIV WU: You have
been inspiring.

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:42.770
Thank you so much.

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.850
TYLER FLORENCE: Liv, thank you
very much, Google, thank you

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:47.290
very much, thank you, I'm so--

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:48.410
thank you.
