00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.880
These albatross are the modern family of the
animal kingdom.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.720
This bird is female and so is this one.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.990
They’re raising a nest full of babies together.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.959
And yes, they’re lesbians.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.029
Why do these females make a long-term commitment
to homosexuality?

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:24.039
Keep in mind that sexuality in the wild is
fluid - animals are not simply homo or hetero.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.869
Not only do the vast majority of animal species
engage in a little same-sex foreplay and copulation,

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.100
there are many that exhibit something called
homosexual preference.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.239
This refers to the selection of a same-sex
partner over an opposite-sex partner despite

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.710
the fact that opposite-sex partners are readily
available.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.820
Along with birds, same-sex preference is also
common in mammals and even primates.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.010
When these lesbian love birds require a sperm
donation, it’s never particularly difficult

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.350
for either of them to find a male who’s
interested in copulating, amirite ladies?.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.070
Copulation in these albatross and in most
birds is not accomplished via the traditional

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.670
penis/vagina route.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.550
There’s one general opening down there for
both waste and sexual products… called a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.550
cloaca.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.160
During sex, male and female albatrosses rub
their swollen cloacas together.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.590
Sperm from the male bird’s testes swims
through the female’s cloacal opening and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.950
to her ovaries.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.200
And that’s that.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.700
No cuddles for this casual couple because
the female is already flying home to her bae

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.720
and their unconventional family.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.270
It seems that the lesbian albatross simply
prefer each others’ company.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.790
Raising their offspring with the influence
of two mommies allows for the nest to be twice

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.770
as productive since both moms can lay eggs,
and they don’t argue over the bulk of their

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.830
domestic tasks.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.270
Yeah! they just accomplish them without complaining.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.720
While some albatrosses make partner switches
every season or few seasons, some albatross

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.970
females, like this couple, stay together for
decades.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.590
A true testament that love is love.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.090
