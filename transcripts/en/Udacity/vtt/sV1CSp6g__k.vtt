Thanks Raido.

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:05.223
But let's start thinking 
about Sunshine, meaning our app.

00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:07.744
I'm not convinced I'm ever going 
to tire of the obvious puns

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:09.605
our app name allows.

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:12.888
Remember, as we progress through 
this course and build this app together,

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.688
you should be thinking about the app 
you want to create.

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:18.223
There are too many weather apps 
already after all.

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:20.306
By the end of the course, 
you'll be ready to tackle

00:00:20.306 --> 00:00:21.691
the final project,

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.810
using all your new Android know how 
to build your own app.
