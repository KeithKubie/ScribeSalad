00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.260
Greetings, developers.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Wesley Chun from Google.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.050
Today we're going to cover
the hot topic of where

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.660
to put your files in the cloud.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.580
I'm really excited to
introduce and describe

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.850
the various storage options that
are available in Google's Cloud

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.730
so you can determine which may
be right for you, enabling you

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.770
to build that next viral
or even non-viral app.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.590
The first pair of
cloud storage options

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.320
we'll cover in this episode
are Google Cloud Storage

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.175
and Google Drive.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:27.550
If you're a
developer, you may be

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.480
wondering what is the difference
between Google Drive and Google

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.580
Cloud Storage.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.400
I go to many tech
conferences every year,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.960
and this is a question
that comes up regularly.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.220
Aren't they both
storage in the cloud?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.990
Well, the answer is
why yes, they are.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.020
Both utilize the same
underlying storage mechanism

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.860
provided by Google's
infrastructure.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.210
But the service offerings
differ both for users as well as

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.330
developers.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.820
Let's dig a little
deeper into each.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.460
Google Drive isn't part of
the Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.380
But instead, it's
a service tightly

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.940
integrated with the
Google Apps ecosystem.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.220
It's for creating and
editing documents, sharing,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.970
collaborating, and syncing
your docs and personal files

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.790
to multiple devices.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.240
Most users interact with
Drive from the web interface

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.160
or mobile app.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.390
So yes, there is a
consumer aspect to Drive,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.160
but it's for developers too.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.500
Google Drive provides a
RESTful web API for developers,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700
both client and server
side, as well as

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.140
SDKs for Android and iOS.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.980
These features allow you to
build web or mobile apps that

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.710
give your users access to
their Drive files and folders.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.020
What kind of apps can you write?

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.930
Spell checking documents,
creating new docs

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.170
based on the contents
of a Google sheet.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.094
In fact, in the Google
Drive API documentation,

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:48.760
you'll find open
source starter projects

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.570
that edit text files in
Drive folders or unzip

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.290
files into a Drive folder.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.590
Click the link to get
access to those samples.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.740
You can also access
the Google Drive API

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.850
from Google Apps
Script, which is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.190
JavaScript outside the browser.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
It's server side like Node,
but runs on Google servers

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.070
and gives users
programmatic access

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.780
to data in Google apps
and other Google services,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.310
including Google Drive.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.554
Take a look at the
short code snippet here.

00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:18.220
It's just simple JavaScript that
loops through your Google Drive

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.120
files and logs the file
names to the console.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.020
If you're familiar with add-ons
for Google Docs and sheets,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.420
they're powered by App Script.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.180
How many of you have
ever edited a Google Doc

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.410
simultaneous with other users?

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.500
I sure have, and
we do it every day.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.310
Well guess what.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.820
You can create your own apps
that let multiple people sign

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.390
on and collaborate together
using the Google Drive Realtime

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.230
API.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.860
How cool is that?

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.204
Got an app you'd love to see?

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:46.620
There's no need
to wait for Google

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.360
to write it when you
can do it yourself.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.080
We empower you to
scratch that itch.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.980
Now that you know
what Google Drive is,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.030
what about Google Cloud Storage?

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.780
What do they have in common?

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.840
Well, in both cases,
you've got data

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.410
that's persistent, fast,
scalable, and highly available.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.570
Both provide access control
for individuals or groups.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.950
However, large scale data such
as backups, archives, big data,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.290
and the processing
of that data is

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.700
where Google Cloud
Storage is a better fit.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.420
Cloud storage is part of
the Google Cloud Platform

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.820
where services are provided
on behalf of a project

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.350
or application,
rather than a user.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.810
Also for some of you,
it's critical to specify

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.810
where your data
should be hosted.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.580
And cloud storage supports that.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.097
At this time, you can select
either the US or the EU.

00:03:38.097 --> 00:03:40.430
There are many ways by which
you can access Google Cloud

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.660
Storage.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.520
Through its website interface,
the command line tool

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.200
which is part of the
Google Cloud SDK,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.320
by using the App Engine client
library for your App Engine

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.040
apps, from Compute
Engine instances using

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.890
built in service
accounts that access

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.280
cloud storage data
within the same project,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.650
and the cloud
storage RESTful API.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.950
One of the benefits
from cloud storage

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.530
is that you get
access or your data

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.340
gets access to other services
in the Google Cloud Platform.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.310
Cloud storage data
can be ingested

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.279
into tools which lets you query,
normalize, transform or ETL,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.860
perform analysis on,
or otherwise process

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.040
all of your data.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.310
These tools include
Google App Engine apps,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.590
your code running on
Google Compute Engine

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.330
virtual machines, Google
BigQuery, which gives you

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.040
the ability to analyze
multiple terabytes of data

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.860
in mere seconds,
Google Cloud SQL,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.380
our fully managed highly
available relational database

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.140
in Google's Cloud,
and Google prediction,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.520
our cloud based machine
learning service.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.420
As you can see, Google Cloud
Storage isn't just for storage.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.510
It's also an entry point.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.270
OK.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.070
One last option for file
storage in the cloud.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.750
Persistent disks.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.890
Think of them as
versatile hard drives

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.860
in the cloud available for your
fleet of Google Compute Engine

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.670
virtual machines.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.810
While instances boot
from persistent disks,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.710
their content
lives independently

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.450
of VM creation and destruction.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.960
Instances can mount
multiple disks.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.130
You can mount persistent
disks on multiple instances,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.340
read only, or read write
if mounted only on one VM.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.460
And you have the
ability to take a point

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.780
in time snapshot of
a persistent disk,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.090
then restore it to any Compute
Engine region in the world.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.670
You can do any of these from
Compute Engines web interface,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.555
command line tool, or
it's RESTful web API.

00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:42.180
Now that you know about
the different ways

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.020
to store files in the
cloud, which you choose

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.080
depends on the type
of app or solution

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.790
you're building for your users.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.520
If it's working with
documents or personal files,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.080
with the added benefits
of collaboration

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.000
and syncing or otherwise
interacting in a Google Apps

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.430
domain, Google Drive is
probably the best fit.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.600
If working with a
massive amount of data

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.190
with the need to have fine
grained control over who

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.180
can access it, or if you're
doing large scale analysis

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.030
or computation with that data,
possibly using other Google

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.650
Cloud Platform services, I'd
go with Google Cloud Storage.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.780
With cloud storage, you
can easily pop your data

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.170
to App Engine,
BigQuery or Cloud SQL.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.050
If that data processing takes
place on Google Compute Engine

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.630
instances, you can
easily transfer that data

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.720
to Compute Engines
persistent disk just once

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.180
and be able to access it
from multiple instances.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.400
All right.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.350
Now that you have
all your options

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.600
for file storage in
the cloud, go out there

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.210
and build that awesome app.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.960

check out our other DevBytes,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.100
including those which are
data and storage related.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.310
Thanks for tuning in.
