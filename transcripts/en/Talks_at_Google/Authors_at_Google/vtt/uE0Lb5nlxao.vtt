00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:04.329
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:06.660
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.874
And I'm not going to bore
you to death, I hope.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.290
And I hope some
of you are eating,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740
because I can smell delicious
smells coming up here.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.710
So when I decided to do "New
York in a Dozen Dishes,"

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.392
the whole idea was to
characterize the city

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:21.100
as it is right now,
to give a little kind

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.990
of thumbnail portrait
based on 12 dishes.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.870
Actually, I cheated, and
there's 13, one of which

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.190
is the black and white cookie.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.722
Has anyone had a black
and white cookie ever?

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:34.180
Well, there's a weird story
behind black and white cookies.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.054
So when you can find
it, if you buy the book,

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.970
or if you just go
into the bookstore

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.570
and-- what's a bookstore?

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920
If you can go into the bookstore
and then read the last chapter,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.000
you'll find out
that it's related

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.960
to Henry Hudson and his
ship called The Half Moon.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.300
Anyway, so when I decided
to pick out the dishes

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.000
that I was going to
have for the 12 dishes,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.370
the first thing
I did was decided

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.680
that it couldn't just all be
dishes that were really famous

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.487
and everybody knew.

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:03.570
I could write about pizza.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.986
I could write about
fried chicken.

00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:06.550
I could write about hamburgers.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.580
And I did write
about two of those.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.667
But I didn't want it to be
all dishes that everybody

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:13.750
knew about it and had
written like a zillion times

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.400
about already.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.180
I didn't want to be just
like a synopsis of what

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.400
had gone before.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.340
So I picked out some dishes that
were kind of not as well known.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.090
Dishes that people
seemed to be enjoying,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.500
but were much harder to find.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.275
As a matter of fact, you might
even call them fringe dishes.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.340
Anybody recognize this?

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.760
You can get this in several
New York restaurants

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.555
that I know about.

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:40.430
AUDIENCE: Guinea pig.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.721
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Ever see-- oh!

00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:42.707
Guinea pig.

00:01:42.707 --> 00:01:43.290
Who said that?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.320
Was that you, Kelly?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.210
She probably already knew.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.111
And who knows what a Guinea pig
is, besides the furry pets shop

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:51.610
friend?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.250
Yes.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.277
It's a furry rodent.

00:01:59.277 --> 00:02:00.860
And with the rodent,
you got it right.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.750
I mean, it's a close cousin of
the thing that scampers away

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.570
from the garbage cans
when you go look out

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.486
behind the restaurant.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.600
And as a matter of
fact, when you see it,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.990
the thing that it's
missing here is the fur.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.220
When you see it in the
pet shop, it's gigantic.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.100
When you see it on a bed of--
does anyone know what that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.190
is there that it's sitting on?

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.900
It's corn.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.060
It's hominy corn.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.040
It's like what they make
hominy grits out of.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.760
It's called mote in the
South American parlance.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.620
And look at those
cute little teeth.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.209
Isn't that cool?

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.750
So anyway, I decided
that I was going

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.400
to write about cuy, which
is what they call it,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.590
because cuy was
beginning to appear

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.460
in places like Sunset Park
with Ecuadorian immigrants.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.335
Now in Ecuador and in
the chapter about cuy,

00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:59.550
I eventually go to Ecuador to
check out the underpinnings.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.530
In Ecuador, every
housewife keeps cuy.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.120
And she keeps them
in her garden.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.250
And the cuy is there
mainly so that the dad

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.510
can get an aphrodisiac,
which is why the head is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.440
the most important part.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.620
At any rate-- oh, I
just love these slides.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.547
At any rate, the women that live
in the alta plano in Ecuador,

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:29.630
they keep these cuy, they
keep them in the garden,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.080
and they add a little row
of bricks around the garden.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.870
Does anyone know what
the bricks are for?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.890
Well, it's to keep
the cuy from escaping.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.690
Because the cuy,
they want to escape.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.670
They're just like
condemned prisoners.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.230
But they can't climb
over a single brick.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.860
They are incredibly
uncoordinated

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.040
and incredibly unathletic.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.940
Like me, and a lot of people.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.630
If there was a
wall of bricks, I'm

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.600
not quite sure I could
climb over it either.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.620
And here's someone
enjoying the cuy.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.950
I took a couple of
friends with me.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.930
Oh, this is nice.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.820
There's a clock now.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.490
You will pick out the person
in the audience probably

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.630
who's eating the cuy there
and kind of holding it up.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.740
So anyway, cuy are rodents,
and they're not strictly legal

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.440
here in the United States.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.420
So supposedly I
had to figure out

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.030
whether the cuy were coming
in suitcases with immigrants,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.550
or whether people were actually
ranching the cuy somewhere

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.000
up in Westchester, like
sitting on little Shetland

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.184
ponies and kind of
like herding the cuy.

00:04:39.184 --> 00:04:39.850
Can you imagine?

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.020
There must be a whole
set of songs and stuff

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.250
that you sing while
you're herding cuy.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.500
I'm not sure.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.220
And why not just get
a rat and eat it?

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.040
It's not really that different.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.030
And anyway, cuy is one
of those fringe dishes

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.170
which is popular among people
from Brazil, from Peru.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.370
And for the longest time,
you couldn't find it.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.480
And now it's beginning
to appear again.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.230
But you know, cuy is
one of those dishes

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.670
that doesn't travel well.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.940
Unless you're standing at two
miles up with the sun directly

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.960
overhead and the wind
from down below kind of,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.260
and feeling kind of sick
from altitude sickness,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.560
the cuy is just
not quite the same.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.110
So another thing that has been
appearing-- as you can see,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.070
that's for two cuy.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.242
So it's rather expensive.

00:05:29.242 --> 00:05:31.700
Well, yeah, the cuy they're
not-- well, they could be rats,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.366
but they're not.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.560
And they're expensive.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.611
So this is another
thing that discourages

00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:38.860
Ecuadorian immigrants from
eating them in restaurants,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.850
and why they're
still kind of rare.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.720
But if you were to look
for them these days,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.520
I would say go to
Bushwick and walk along

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.920
Wyckoff, and kind of look
in the windows of some

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.100
of the Ecuadorian bodegas.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.940
And you'll see that you
can get the cuys much more

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.980
cheaply if you buy them
frozen and cook them at home.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.850
And guess what?

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.360
The fur is already gone.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.220
That's the hardest thing.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.220
What do they taste like?

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.730
They taste kind of like
a little bit like pig.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.130
The skin is the best part.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.360
The skin is incredibly thin and
crunchy, like a suckling pig.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.500
So hence, perhaps, Guinea pig.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.630
Has anyone here been
to Franklin Barbecue?

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.190
Oh my god.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.689
You have?

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:20.446
How long did you
have to wait in line?

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:21.340
AUDIENCE: Hours.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.256
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:25.720
Franklin Barbecue is now the
best barbecue in the United

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.930
States, perhaps in the world.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.465
What city is it in?

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:30.225
AUDIENCE: Austin.

00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:31.140
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
Austin, Texas, which

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.260
is kind of the center
of great barbecue.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.240
But for decades,
they didn't really

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.310
have much good barbecue
in the city limits.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.379
But now all of
these new barbecue

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:41.670
revivalists like Aaron Franklin
have started making it.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.520
I'm going to go through
these slides quickly,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.228
because they're just
here for atmosphere.

00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:50.590
But any engineers here?

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.890
There must be plenty
of engineers here.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.980
This is a secret shot that
I surreptitiously took

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.600
of the super secret smoke room.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.850
This is the way
Aaron Franklin smokes

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.880
his ribs and his brisket.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.700
And he does it with-- if
you look in the front,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.900
that black square is
the thing that has

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.060
the fire box in front of it.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.000
And this is a 19th
century German engineering

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.090
miracle that was used in
places like Kreuz Market.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.380
When I first saw
it, it blew my mind.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.920
Because they would have
a little fire in front,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.900
and smoke blowing
through the fire.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.910
And through a series
of underground sluices

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.670
to these brick pits
with hinged lids.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.150
So in other words,
they found a way

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:47.140
to have less smoke and less
wood go through more smokers.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.960
And this is exactly
the same thing

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.980
that Aaron has ripped
off in his own smoke room

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.710
where he has-- does
anyone recognize

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.160
what he's used as the smokers?

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.610
Something like septic tanks.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.830
But giant propane tanks
is the way that he did it.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.600
And it's really quite brilliant.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.630
And using just one fire at the
end of every series of tanks,

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.730
he has a capacity far
in excess of the amount

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.520
he would need just to generate
food for the restaurant.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.000
This is a typical
Franklin spread here.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.510
Some of his homemade
sausage, some

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.085
of his brisket, smoked
turkey, pulled pork,

00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:33.710
and there was something
else in there--

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.179
and ribs up in the
upper right hand corner,

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.610
with the usual no account sides.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.140
In Texas, you don't go to
barbecue for the sides.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.320
You go there for the meat.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.000
And the meat there
is just mind blowing.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.180
It took me a little
while to figure out

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.430
what he was doing that made his
barbecue the best in the world,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.990
other than just using this
19th century German technology

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.160
and smoking it a
fuckload of time.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.071
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.071 --> 00:09:00.570
See?

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.400
You say fuck, and
everybody laughs.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.680
Does anyone know what his
super secret trick is?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.880
Anyone bought his
cookbook and have

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.726
an idea what his secret
is, his dirty secret?

00:09:13.726 --> 00:09:16.100
Some of the people that went
with me to Franklin Barbecue

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.400
when we went just a few weeks
ago know what the secret is.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:19.901
Yes?

00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:21.941
AUDIENCE: Picks through
the high quality animals.

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:23.230
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.190
He decided for the
first time ever

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.080
to use actual prime meat,
to use the kind of meat

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.260
that you get when you go
to a fancy steakhouse, that

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.100
is characterized by being so
marbled with fat that it just--

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.790
because the fat is
what barbecue is about.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.000
So let's see.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.110
And we took a drive in
the Texas hill country

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.810
afterwards, completely
blissed out with the meat.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.630
And these are Texas
peaches, which

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.290
you can get around
Fredericksburg only

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.500
for a couple of
weeks every year.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.411
Just fantastic peaches.

00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:54.660
And what am I doing next here?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.540
Anyone recognize where this is?

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.220
One of the chapters
of the book is

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.210
about how great barbecue came
to New York for the first time.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.370
And this is a line
in front of one

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.080
of our most famous barbecues.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.212
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Which one?

00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:11.176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:12.160
ROBERT SIETSEMA: No.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.910
Good guess.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.190
You're in the
right neighborhood.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.399
Briskettown, also known
as Delaney Barbecue.

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:17.940
That's right.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.070
And here just like they
have lines at Franklin's, we

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.360
have lines here to get--
or used to have lines here.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.220
Now we have so many
barbecues that no one really

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.620
has to wait in line anymore.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.310
Well, there are still
lines, actually.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.120
Yes, it's Delaney Barbecue,
also known as Briskettown.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.630
Delaney is a kind of
an interesting guy.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.195
He can't really get the identity
of his restaurant straight.

00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:40.070
He calls it something
different all the time.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.760
So there's two of the
names right there.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.675
Is it Briskettown?

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:46.566
Is it Delaney Barbecue?

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:47.190
And let me see.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.071
Here is his brisket,
which I kind of like over

00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:52.320
photoshopped it, so you can't
really see it that well.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.490
Here's the ribs.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.256
Does anyone here like barbecue?

00:10:58.256 --> 00:10:59.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:59.462 --> 00:11:00.170
Good, good, good.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.570
I was worried that
everyone was a vegetarian.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.460
They were going, oh,
that is disgusting.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.116
That is worse than
the Guinea pig.

00:11:05.116 --> 00:11:05.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:06.670
Yes.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.350
These are the ribs of pigs.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.450
And this is one of the
weirdest fetishes of barbecue.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.210
What is that stack
of stuff in the back?

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.322
White bread from
the supermarket.

00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:20.030
Who has ever eaten a
piece of white bread

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.034
from the super market in years?

00:11:22.034 --> 00:11:23.700
To begin with, nobody
eats bread at all.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.870
But that's one of
the accoutrement, one

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.920
of the fetishes
of great barbecue,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.470
is that you're always
have to eat it with bread.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.400
Or at least my daughter claims
that that's my invention,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.230
but it's not true.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.340
Everyone who's over
50 eats barbecue

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.080
by wrapping it in a
piece of white bread

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.210
and just tucking a pickle and
some jalapeno peppers in there.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.720
Let me try to go-- this is
another barbecue spread.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.580
Does anyone know,
just by the way

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.830
it looks, where it comes from?

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.590
I'm testing your
barbecue knowledge

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.444
of the great city of New York.

00:11:56.444 --> 00:11:57.860
This is one of the
greatest places

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.180
to eat barbecue
in the world now.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.350
Not quite as good as Texas, but
you don't have to drive as far.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.140
I'll keep going.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.230
Tell me when you
figure out what it is.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.870
Oh.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.785
And this, if you're
a barbecue nut,

00:12:10.785 --> 00:12:13.550
you know that this is one of
the weirdest barbecue offerings.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.790
Its prime rib done barbecue
style, but left rare.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.750
So in other words, it's not
really smoked that long.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.180
But it still tastes
really smokey.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.950
And this-- anybody
know what this is?

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.460
Beef rib.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:27.960
Yes.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.540
Beef rib-- a friend of
mine, Daniel Vaughn, who's

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.710
the barbecue editor
of Texas Monthly,

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.650
he dug back into
barbecue history

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.460
and discovered that
brisket was not

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.780
like the most important
barbecue item until the 1950s,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.860
that before that basically
the barbecuers would just

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.490
barbecue whatever they had
on hand that nobody wanted.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.150
And beef rib is rapidly becoming
the most popular barbecued item

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.480
in a lot of Texas and in a
lot of New York barbecues.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.390
This is a beef rib.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.580
As you can see, it gets
really, really intense looking.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.870
Very, very fatty.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.470
Absolutely delicious.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.064
Don't you dare put any
barbecue sauce on it.

00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:11.980
There's two kinds of
people that eat barbecue.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.820
There's people that eat
barbecue for the barbecue,

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.160
and there's people that
eat it for the sauce.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.490
So if you eat it for
the sauce, don't even

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.637
bother getting barbecue.

00:13:20.637 --> 00:13:22.970
Just throw something in the
oven and pour barbecue sauce

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:23.670
all over.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.068
I hope I'm not stepping
on anyone's toes there.

00:13:26.068 --> 00:13:27.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.196
Well, that last few pictures
was from our own Hill Country.

00:13:31.196 --> 00:13:32.570
And there are two
Hill Countries.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.350
One of them is in
Downtown Brooklyn.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.100
And both of them are
absolutely fantastic.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.290
The difference is that the
one in Downtown Brooklyn

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.691
serves my favorite, which is
hot links, which is something

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.440
that I ate when I was
going to high school

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.590
in Dallas, Texas,
one of the worst

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.454
cities in the
history of the world.

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:52.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.910
They killed Kennedy, after all.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.730
This right here is
Hometown Barbecue,

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.680
which is in Red Hook Brooklyn.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.826
A really wonderful
barbecue on its own.

00:14:03.826 --> 00:14:06.110
There's their brisket
sandwich turned

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.420
into New York barbecue
with that onion role, which

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.130
is a staple of Jewish delis.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.670
So we have a lot of
fusion going on here.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.490
They even try to
barbecue pastrami.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.800
Here's showing that
they do have lines, too,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.905
here, just like they do
at Franklin's in Texas,

00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:24.340
at Hometown.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.070
My advice is to get there
at five minutes before noon

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.700
when it opens on Sunday.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.690
Here is some of Bill
Durney's turkey.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.410
Now, I normally
think that turkey

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.950
is the worst thing to barbecue.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.550
It's just like so
boring and so dry,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.730
but barbecue guys
have found a way--

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.300
I don't know whether
they're shoving balls

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.180
of fat down the turkeys
neck or something,

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.520
but they found a way
to make turkey fatty.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.340
And that's the
rib, his rib there.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.630
You can see it's blackened
beyond recognition.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.720
Mighty Quinn's at the
Brookdale location.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.035
Another great barbecue place.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.120
And here we are back
into the seafood.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.050
Another chapter is about clams.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.280
So here's some
delicious raw clams.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.020
Does anyone here like raw clams?

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.940
Yeah, raw clams are kind
of an acquired taste.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.230
Because raw clams are
kind of like a little bit

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.160
skanky and a little bit bitter.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.520
And they're rubbery, like
chewing on rubber bands.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.170
And yet, it's something
that is native New York

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.760
seafood since the first
Canarsie Indians put up

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.290
their shacks on
legs by Jamaica Bay

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.940
and started eating
shellfish raw.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.990
And here's a typical
plate of raw clams.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.200
This one happens to be
in Highland, New Jersey.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.140
It's not quite in New
York, but near Sandy Hook.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.310
And here's Bears, which is
a famous seafood institution

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.870
there.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.360
This is clam chowder.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.384
What kind of clam
chowder is this?

00:15:55.384 --> 00:15:57.300
The Manhattan Clam
Chowder, which is bullshit.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:57.799
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:57.799 --> 00:15:59.520
I mean, the Manhattan
clam chowder

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.910
never came from Manhattan.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.060
Manhattan, being
the dominant island,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.090
demanded it be called
Manhattan clam chowder,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.350
but it should be called
Brooklyn clam chowder.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.250
Because who do
you think, looking

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.430
at thee sauce surrounding
the clams and the potatoes,

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.870
what group do you think
came up with this?

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.720
Italians.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.900
Or as they said in
Minnesota, Italians.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.680
Yes.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.180
The Swedes they came up with--
No, it was the Italians.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.050
This is a very Italian,
extremely Sicilian,

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.860
seafood soup.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.270
And it is just delicious.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.390
However, I myself prefer
the white clam chowder.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:40.940
This is the deck at Bears on
a kind of a nice cloudy day.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.820
And this is some
white clam chowder,

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.100
which never photographs
well for some reason.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.710
Oh my god.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.330
These people.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.290
I love the way the colors
are translated here.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.306
Anyone recognize where this is?

00:16:52.306 --> 00:16:53.680
AUDIENCE: Grand
Central Westboro?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.340
ROBERT SIETSEMA: That's right,
which is one of the best places

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.310
if you go and you sit at
that snaking lunch counter,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.170
it's really very inexpensive.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.369
One of the things that I try to
do is find the cheapest eats,

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.230
and that's one of
the cheapest places

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.480
to get a bowl of clam chowder.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.440
It's still just a few dollars.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.410
it's up in Grand Central
Station, or Grand Central

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.150
Terminal as they now call it.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.190
By the way, the ceiling--
another engineering point

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.159
here-- the ceiling is one
of the most famous ceilings

00:17:24.159 --> 00:17:24.700
in the world.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.444
It was invented by--
anyone know who invented

00:17:27.444 --> 00:17:28.485
it, that kind of ceiling?

00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:29.359
AUDIENCE: Guastavino.

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:30.560
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Guastavino.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.800
And this is one of the most
famous of his creations.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.560
And how he got those tiles to
stick up there, I don't know.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.870
But some of you probably do.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.430
You can see up there,
the list of oysters

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.090
that they have raw
is just astonishing.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.731
And the provenance of
every oyster is well known.

00:17:50.731 --> 00:17:53.230
And if you ask, they'll tell
you exactly where it came from,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.470
and when it came from
there, and how fresh it is.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.900
And they're incredibly fresh.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.420
And here's a guy
working some weird ass

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.242
contraption that kind of blows
steam up through this soup.

00:18:05.242 --> 00:18:06.950
Does anyone know what
the soup is called?

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.290
It's not a bisque.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.110
It's not a bisque.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.230
It's the pan oyster roast,
which is completely ridiculous.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.850
Why would you call
it an oyster roast?

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:20.850
They're not roasting it.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.890
They're boiling
it, for God's sake.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.750
And here is the
raw oyster service

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.170
with the colors
strangely transformed.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:38.650
And if you ever miss the
lobster pounds of Maine,

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.450
the place to go
is Nick's Lobster,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.930
which is a way at the end
of Flatbush Avenue, almost

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.360
in Jamaica Bay.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.491
Anyone been there?

00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:47.990
Yes.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.021
It is absolutely astonishing.

00:18:51.021 --> 00:18:53.020
This is what it looks
like, which doesn't really

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.830
look like New York.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.180
Houses on stilts.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.870
We're looking at
part of Marine Park

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.280
there, which of course
flooded completely

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.340
during Hurricane Sandy.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.960
But this is one
of only two places

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.500
I know in the city that
has houses on stilts.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.890
Kind of very picturesque.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.770
And here you can pick your own
lobster at Nick's, the same way

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.940
you can do in Maine.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.310
And here's the
happy outdoor space.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.670
If you take the Flatbush
bus for about five hours,

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.796
you'll end up here.

00:19:20.796 --> 00:19:22.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.600
And here is their delicious
clam chowder turned

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.210
a strange shade of green.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:33.750
Normally it's white and
pasty, filled with clams.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.224
And of course, here is the
money shot of the lobster,

00:19:38.224 --> 00:19:40.640
with a little bit of corn
there, the kind of typical shore

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.030
dinner.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.200
And here, stuffed clams.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.630
One of my favorite things.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.980
Once again, an
Italian use of clams.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.610
We have a lot to thank
the Sicilians for.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.440
Here's a bowl.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.500
Anybody know what this is?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.000
Gooey.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.791
This is Ecuadorian.

00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:58.120
I don't know why I put
this slide in here.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.001
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:00.500
Gooey duck?

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.460
Great.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.160
Actually, it's gooey foot.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.730
This is cow-foot soup from
an Ecuadorian restaurant.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.750
But gooey duck was
an excellent guess.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.217
And here is a woman
selling tamales

00:20:11.217 --> 00:20:12.300
by the side of the street.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.800
I don't know why I
put this in here.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.330
But it just shows New York
is one of the greatest places

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.390
to eat in the world.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.470
No.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.970
I'll say it.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.690
The greatest place
to eat in the world.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.890
And you don't have to
spend an arm and a leg.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.640
As a matter of fact,
a stunt I'm going

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.000
to be doing for "Eater New
York," the week after next,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.550
we're having cheap eats week.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.910
And they're going to make
all the employees eat

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.690
all their meals out for
less than $10 a day.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.190
And I can do it
through women like this

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.920
who are selling these humongous
tamales is for $1 apiece.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.430
You can have them
filled with peppers,

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.530
or with mole and
chicken, or with pork

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:53.556
and fiery hot green sauce.

00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:55.290
So I think that's it.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.484
So thank you so much for
listening to my rant.

00:20:58.484 --> 00:20:59.679
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:02.345
I think Michael is going to come
up here and ask some questions.

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:02.880
Oh.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.805
There you are.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.680
MICHAEL: Maybe for people
who don't know you,

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.072
you could explain
the devil mask.

00:21:08.072 --> 00:21:11.790
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Can anyone tell
me why I'm wearing this mask?

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.260
I lost a bet, yes.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.420
Well actually, I found over
the years that wearing the mask

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.860
makes me much more persuasive.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.334
You might not listen
to some mousy critic,

00:21:20.334 --> 00:21:22.000
but you're going to
listen to the devil.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.230
So anyway, I'm
wearing it because I'm

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.910
an anonymous critic.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.430
And since this is
being videotaped,

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.620
I don't want anyone who's a
chef or works in a restaurant

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.240
to be able to look at the
video and see what I look like,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.620
and then put a picture of me up
in the-- as if they even would.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.720
But I believe in anonymity,
because to me, the critic

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.100
should always be on the
side of the consumer.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.480
In other words, most
critics spend their time

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.830
kissing chef ass and
getting free food and stuff.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:58.330
But my whole idea, since I'm
funded by the great Vox empire,

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.490
I can afford to eat
whatever I want,

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.420
and I can afford to do
it anonymously and then

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.880
report back to my
readers exactly

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.311
what the experience would be
like for them, not just for me.

00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:09.810
Anyway.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.644
I'm going to sit down.

00:22:11.644 --> 00:22:13.310
MICHAEL: One thing I
was curious about--

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.730
so it's so much easier now
to find people like the Arepa

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.152
Lady, or interesting food
just through message boards,

00:22:19.152 --> 00:22:20.860
from Chow Hound, and
there's so much now.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.870
Before the internet, how did you
find some of this really cool,

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.025
unusual stuff?

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:28.420
ROBERT SIETSEMA: It was
actually more fun before.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.620
Now it's just work.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.750
You have to comb The Chow Hound
and Yelp and stuff like that.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.600
And it used to be that I had
all these different ways to do.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.770
The most effective way is just
to pick a spot on the subway

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.360
map where you've
never been before,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.400
wait a few hours to
get really, really

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.000
hungry so you'll eat anything,
and then jump on the subway

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.780
and go to that
stop, and just start

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.870
walking in concentric circles.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.500
And typically you'll find
like four, or five, or six

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.100
different restaurants.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.960
And there's all sorts of
ways to evaluate them.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.090
You really want to go
in there and kind of

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.030
like-- the first
thing you do is smell.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.820
If the restaurant smells bad,
get the hell out of there

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.370
as fast as possible.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.060
Then look at the
faces of the people,

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.815
if there are any
people in there.

00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:13.940
And if there are people in
there, and you see them,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.750
are they eating and
enjoying their food?

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.330
Or are they kind of
just nibbling and about

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.630
to push the food away?

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:22.590
Then look at the menu.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.370
See if there's something
that you want to eat.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.170
See if there's something that
you've never eaten before.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.670
See if there's something that's
interesting or confuses you.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.800
One of the great
things about this age

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.870
is you can whip out your phone
and you can Google up anything

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.810
that you see on a menu and
you can find out what it is.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.000
It used to be that you would see
things on menus that you would

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.600
go, what the hell is that?

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.100
And if you didn't
speak the language

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.599
of the people inside
the restaurant,

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:50.660
you would just have to
order it and meet your fate.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.190
But now you can look up and say,
oh my god, that's Guinea pig.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.140
Or oh man, I really
want to try that.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.470
So other ways that
I would find things

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.580
is that whenever you go into
a bodega from another culture,

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.890
you find these shopping
newspapers where everything is

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.460
written in Farsi or something.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.230
But you'll find that the ads for
restaurants always the address

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.699
is written in English.

00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:16.990
So if you have a Persian
newspaper, and you're reading,

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.700
and you see four or
five display ads,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.500
they will tell you where
those restaurants are.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.247
And other ways-- you
get tips all the time.

00:24:25.247 --> 00:24:27.080
And you should all send
me tips, by the way.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.533
It's robert@eater.com.

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:31.510
I love to have tips--
when you see places that

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.324
have just opened, especially.

00:24:33.324 --> 00:24:35.740
Like up on 26th Street, there's
a new Georgian restaurant.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.850
And I'm not talking Georgia
USA, but Georgia SSR.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.790
So anyway, does that
answer your question?

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.930
MICHAEL: Yeah.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.370
When did you-- you write a lot
in the book about eating brains

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.160
and Guinea pig--
when did you realize

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.870
you had a taste
for unusual things,

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.712
or that you were
interested in that well?

00:24:55.712 --> 00:24:57.670
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Well,
I grew up in the Midwest

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.910
and in Texas, and at the
time when I was a kid,

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.080
we didn't really have much
interesting in the way of food.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.030
We ate meatloaf.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.560
We ate instant mashed potatoes.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.610
We ate frozen peas.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:10.600
We had stuff like that.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.820
And really I think I
ate out in restaurants

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.790
maybe five times before
I went away to college

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.080
forever at the age of 16.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.820
And once I had
food in New York, I

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.860
tasted something a
little bit exotic.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.840
It just blew my mind.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.590
It was like, how can
something be so good?

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.180
How can something be spicy?

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.667
How can people put so
much garlic in something?

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:34.500
And it's like, whoa!

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.860
I love this stuff.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.090
And I've never stopped.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.900
So I eat out as often
as I can, and I've never

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.480
lost the feeling that
there's something really

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.360
special about this
city food-wise,

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.640
and that there's so much
exciting around this.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.730
I calculate there are 50,000
restaurants in the city.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.510
So how many can you
eat at in a lifetime?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.510
Maybe a thousand?

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:56.267
Two thousand?

00:25:56.267 --> 00:25:58.600
MICHAEL: Is there something
you just wouldn't eat again,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.110
that just wasn't worth it?

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.640
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
There are definitely

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.350
things that I've eaten
that I wouldn't eat again.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.020
But the thing that I
consistently don't like to eat

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.060
but eat anyway is brains.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.930
The thing about brains is
that brain's look like brains.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.930
It's almost like you're
a cannibal or something.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.410
They're all gray and wrinkled,
and they're pretty much

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.120
all cholesterol.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.110
It's all fat, and
there's nothing in there

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.080
to vary the train.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.340
It's all grey custard.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.527
Anyone here like brains?

00:26:32.527 --> 00:26:34.110
I know people that
really like brains,

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.182
but usually they have a kind
of psychotic edge to them.

00:26:37.182 --> 00:26:38.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.040
I don't like them.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.780
I've had them.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.989
You also wrote-- I think
I've read you writing about I

00:26:46.989 --> 00:26:48.280
think it's maybe Nigerian food.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.367
And there's these--
is it lands slugs?

00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:51.450
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Oh, yeah.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.640
MICHAEL: Or land snails?

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.930
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Those
are another good example.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.110
MICHAEL: Those
sound sort of vile.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.060
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.764
Well, there's a lot
of cultures where

00:26:58.764 --> 00:27:00.930
they don't have a lot of
toothbrushes and toothpaste

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:01.990
and stuff.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.970
Like if you go to
West Africa, everyone

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.421
is chewing on these chew sticks.

00:27:05.421 --> 00:27:07.420
And the reason that they
chew on the chew sticks

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.010
is that that keeps your
keep relatively healthy.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.710
It kind of acts
like a toothbrush.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.280
By the same token,
one of the things

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.220
when I bring friends
to African restaurants,

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.390
they take one bite of the
meat and they immediately

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.320
turn up their noses.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.010
And they say, oh,
this food is no good.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.780
Why do you think they
say the food is no good?

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.181
What is it about the
meat that annoys them?

00:27:32.337 --> 00:27:33.170
Anyone have a guess?

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.400
Pardon?

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.000
Well, completely cooked
is only part of it.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.720
But it is part of it.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.230
Not only is it completely
cooked, but it's tough as hell.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:51.160
Africans love a good chew.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.060
They want to chew their meat.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.720
They want something
in their mouth.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.130
They eat our meat and
they say, man, you guys

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.800
are eating marshmallows.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.440
We're sitting there, oh, I
want a filet mignon that's

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.800
really tender.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.550
I've started kind of taking
the African view of things.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.550
I like tender meat.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.730
It's fine.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.600
But chewing is like one of
life's greatest pleasures,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.760
let's face it.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.560
You can chew anytime you want if
you have something to chew on.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.990
So Africans prefer
when they make like--

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.570
and another thing is that
they don't, because they have

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:25.870
so little of it back home,
they don't prefer one

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.892
sort of protein over another.

00:28:27.892 --> 00:28:29.100
They're not saying, oh, yeah.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.410
I want some squid.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.820
And I want-- what
they do when they

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.510
make what they call a soup,
which is a stew that they eat

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.360
with a mash or with
rice, they will

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.030
throw in beef, and chicken,
and fish, and shellfish.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.210
They just load it
down with protein.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.840
And the meat will invariably
be extremely chewy.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.440
This question is
going on forever.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.620
But the whole thing about snails
is that they like to chew.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.560
You cannot chew a snail enough.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.700
These snails are the
size of dinner plates

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.680
and they live in trees.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.820
And there's a place in
Brooklyn, in east Flatbush,

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.590
that has these snails.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.060
And they are so rubbery that
you need a serrated knife

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:16.640
to cut them.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.110
And then when you
chew them, you're

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.855
going to end up spitting it
out because you never chew it

00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:25.080
enough to actually get it down.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.330
So it's the African equivalent
of a chew stick when

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.250
you get one of these snails.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.330
You could chew it forever.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.617
MICHAEL: You have a
great chapter on pizza.

00:29:35.617 --> 00:29:37.700
And I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.741
about-- because I've heard
this rumor for years--

00:29:39.741 --> 00:29:42.399
about the connection between
the mafia and pizza cheese.

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:43.440
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Oh, yes.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.470
I would love to talk about that.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.520
MICHAEL: Because it's like
a rumor I've heard about,

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.870
and then you sort of go
into it a little bit,

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.745
and I'm wondering if
you could explain a bit.

00:29:49.745 --> 00:29:51.630
ROBERT SIETSEMA: It's
one of the only pieces

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.330
of actual investigative
reporting that I've ever done.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:30:00.230
But if you walk by
John's of Bleaker Street,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.170
which is one of the four
oldest pizza parlors and one

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.020
of the places where
pizza was invented

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.640
as we know it worldwide.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.660
Not Italy, New York.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.450
What does it say on the awning?

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.610
Does anyone know?

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.660
It says no slices.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.830
And that's a weird thing
to put on your awning,

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:21.470
because most pizza
parlors serve slices.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.940
So the reason it says no
slices as far as I can tell

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:30.530
is because they didn't want
the mafia to firebomb it.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.940
The fact of the matter
is, in the '30s and '40s,

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.820
Al Capone owned a
series of dairy farms

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.830
in Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin,
south of Fond Du Lac,

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.540
and these made this
mozzarella cheese

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.290
that you may associate with
neighborhood pizza parlors.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.570
It's not really
mozzarella as we now it.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.630
We've all become familiar with
the kind of wonderful squishy

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.170
homemade mozzarella.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:59.350
The pizza, the mozzarella that's
on neighborhood pizza parlors,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.720
is kind of more like
provolone or something.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.470
But anyway, this pizza cheese,
which would keep a long time,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.890
was being manufactured in
Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin,

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.694
on dairy farms owned by the mob.

00:31:10.694 --> 00:31:13.110
And they went around to all
the neighborhood pizza parlors

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.310
and said, you better
use this mozzarella

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.080
or we're going to blow you up.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.250
And so all of those
neighborhood pizza parlors

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.230
use the same kind of cheese.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.760
This is changing
now, by the way.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.090
You can get what's known
as a grandma slice, where

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.250
they use real mozzarella.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.870
But in general for decades,
local pizza parlors

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.860
used this kind of
horrible cheese.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.970
In the context of
the pizza, it was OK.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.340
But not as good as mozzarella.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.480
And supposedly the old,
old, old fashioned pizza

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.560
parlors where the
mobsters hung out

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.510
themselves could use the real
cheese as long as they promised

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.030
not to be to serve
slices, which was

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.120
the characteristic of the local
neighborhood pizza parlors.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.030
So that's the story.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.630
And I believe that those farms
are still operating and still

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:07.050
producing cheese that
the mob sanctions.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.240
And I won't tell you what
the name of the pizza cheese

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.010
company is, but you will see,
like especially in Brooklyn

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.490
neighborhood pizza
parlors, a little sign

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.080
that says we use
this kind of cheese.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.390
And if you look up the
name of that cheese,

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.787
you will find that the corporate
offices are 10 miles south

00:32:24.787 --> 00:32:25.870
of Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.140
But since this is being taped
and I don't want to be killed,

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.890
I'm not going to mention
the name of the--

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:33.098
but I'll tell you secretly
afterwards, if you come up

00:32:33.098 --> 00:32:33.607
and ask me.

00:32:33.607 --> 00:32:34.106
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:34.106 --> 00:32:36.800
MICHAEL: What do you think about
the rise of the dollar slice

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.795
joint, which is sort of
new-- past maybe 5, 10 years?

00:32:39.795 --> 00:32:41.160
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.710
I'm supposed to not
like the dollar slices,

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:44.890
but I really love them.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:50.070
I mean, it's pizza reduced to
its most essential elements.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.944
The cheese is no worse
than the mob cheese.

00:32:52.944 --> 00:32:54.360
Maybe there's a
little less of it.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.730
But so what?

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.800
What I love is that New
York is so adaptable.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.280
As the real estate prices go
sky high and old restaurants

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.300
that we love are forced
to move out and shut down,

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.510
the fact that you can
still get a cheap meal

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.360
in New York, that they
found ways to do it,

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.820
is just so wonderful.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.270
And the dollar slice is
one of the things that

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.980
keeps food cheap in New York.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.780
And I have my favorite.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.950
Go to Percy's on Bleaker Street.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.420
They have the best dollar slice.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.680
But even that, Two Guys or
Two Brothers or whatever

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.506
is pretty damn good.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:31.470
MICHAEL: Is there a neighborhood
that you think is just really

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.450
exciting right now in terms of
interesting ethnic foods that

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:36.760
seems to be booming, or is
there a new immigrant group

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.260
that's producing
foods that you feel

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.080
like feels fresh and new, that
you haven't had a lot of--

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.210
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Oh, for sure.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.876
I just wrote a piece
in "Eater New York"

00:33:42.876 --> 00:33:46.620
about the Venezuelans and
their crazy sandwiches.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.300
How do Venezuelans
make a sandwich?

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.500
Anybody know?

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.870
MICHAEL: It's huge, right?

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:51.786
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:33:51.786 --> 00:33:53.840
It's big, and they
use fried plantain,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:58.662
so it's like having two
plates on either side

00:33:58.662 --> 00:33:59.370
of your sandwich.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.420
So you have to crunch on it.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.770
The reason being
that they really

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.620
didn't have flour in Venezuela
for the longest time.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.037
They had plantains.

00:34:09.037 --> 00:34:10.120
They had things like that.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.870
They had both sweet
plantains and they had--

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.699
and they make sandwiches
out of those called Yo Yos.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:21.121
And the sandwiches that they
make out of the hard plantains

00:34:21.121 --> 00:34:22.620
are actually a
little harder to eat.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.340
But they're really great.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.770
The Mexicans who started
coming here in the early '90s

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.590
are just fantastic.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.362
We're getting a chance to eat
real southern Mexican food,

00:34:32.362 --> 00:34:34.070
which is so different
than what they have

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.100
in California and in Texas.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.749
And I would say, what's
the best neighborhood

00:34:40.749 --> 00:34:42.040
if you wanted to go get a taco?

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.790
Where would you go?

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.409
There are several
right answers here.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:47.283
MICHAEL: Sunset Park?

00:34:47.283 --> 00:34:48.880
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
Sunset Park is good.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.520
I prefer Bushwick.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.179
The stuff that's going
on in Bushwick taco-wise

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.210
is just phenomenal.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.740
You could get all of these
un-reconstructed tacos

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.410
are just absolutely fantastic.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.450
Anyone have a favorite
taqueria in Bushwick?

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.460
My favorite is right on Myrtle.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.080
It's called Taqueria Izucar.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.250
And it's just fantastic.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.320
Their specialty is suadero,
which is a brisket.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.010
But they also have
phenomenal ear tacos,

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:24.540
where they've stewed the
pig ears for probably days.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.669
And it's just
absolutely fantastic.

00:35:26.669 --> 00:35:28.710
MICHAEL: I would love to
open it up to questions.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.330
There's a couple
microphones there

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.530
if people-- or you can
just stand up and talk.

00:35:35.362 --> 00:35:37.472
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Oh, nice.

00:35:37.472 --> 00:35:39.530
AUDIENCE: People are
very excited about tacos.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.280
But as a vegetarian, I've never
found any that are interesting.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.010
Do you have any recommendations?

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.430
ROBERT SIETSEMA: I would
go-- I forget the name of it.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.470
There's a taco factory--
someone will know.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.040
There's a tortilla
factory in Bushwick--

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.770
no, Nick's Tamales in
Queens, is in Corona.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.980
Which one?

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.760
Los Hermanos.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.510
Thank you so much.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.010
Yes.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.320
Los Hermanos is
this-- there used

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.240
to be seven tortilla
factories in Bushwick,

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.310
when you could afford to have
a tortilla factory in Bushwick.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:13.374
And the one, the Los
Hermanos, or The Women, they

00:36:13.374 --> 00:36:15.540
decided that they were going
to go hipster and start

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.990
serving tacos.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.760
And they have one
of the best-- you

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.470
know, it's not bad to be a
vegetarian and eat tacos,

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.029
because there's so many good
tacos that are vegetarian.

00:36:26.029 --> 00:36:27.820
And they have a couple
of vegetarian models

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.330
that are absolutely fantastic.

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.460
And it's very easy to find.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.970
It's a few steps from the
Jefferson stop in Bushwick.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.327
Good question.

00:36:35.327 --> 00:36:36.160
MICHAEL: Over there.

00:36:39.037 --> 00:36:39.620
Little closer.

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:47.020
Just speak up.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.600
AUDIENCE: Speak out loud?

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.200
There we go.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.350
Great.

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:52.520
This is a super annoying
question for a food critic,

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.380
but if you had to eat
one meal every day

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.620
for the rest of your
life, what would it be?

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.670
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Oh, man.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.990
That is a good one.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.460
Because it changes every day.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.080
I ate last night in
a restaurant called

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.120
Pharaoh in Bushwick that just
has the most amazing pastas.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.750
They have this
vegetarian pasta that

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:19.200
is gnudi-- does anyone
know what gnudi are?

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.890
Gnudi are little Italian
dumplings made with ricotta.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:25.480
And it had these green
chick peas with it.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.960
And if I had something to pick
right now to eat every day,

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.502
it would be that.

00:37:30.502 --> 00:37:31.265
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:32.973
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Thanks
for the question.

00:37:32.973 --> 00:37:35.332
MICHAEL: Over there

00:37:35.332 --> 00:37:36.130
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:39.100
So I saw that you've
recently done--

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.640
I think it was your
piece on "Eater"

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.115
about cuisine in New
England, most Connecticut--

00:37:44.115 --> 00:37:45.490
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
Oh, Connecticut.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:45.990
Yeah.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.780
That was fun.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.920
AUDIENCE: And my wife and
I are taking a trip up

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.440
to Maine in a few days and
we're going to be driving there,

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.106
and I'm curious.

00:37:54.106 --> 00:37:55.740
If you had one spot
in Connecticut,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.040
or that part of the
world that you'd

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.184
stop for seafood or something
like that, what would it be.

00:38:01.184 --> 00:38:02.850
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
That's a good question.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:06.350
If you look at
the piece, there's

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:12.420
one place that had hamburgers
as well as clam chowder.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.780
And I'll recall the name
afterwards and tell you

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.611
what it is.

00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:18.110
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.340
And that place is
absolutely fantastic.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.390
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.470
Thanks.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.490
Pizza New Haven is good

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.356
MICHAEL: We can
go over here now.

00:38:26.356 --> 00:38:26.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.620
Is there a particular
cuisine or ethnic food

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.540
that you feel like
is under represented

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.270
or misrepresented in New York?

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.130
And if so, what do
you think it is?

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.160
I would just be curious.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.960
I'm probably not as
adventurous as you.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.110
And if so, is there a reason
you think that is the case?

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.470
ROBERT SIETSEMA: We
have a lot of cuisines

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.680
that we're missing
completely here.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.110
There's historical
reasons for that,

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.980
but I would say Laotian and
Cambodian are two cuisines that

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.580
are very interesting that are
completely under represented

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.080
here.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.470
We have one upscale
Laotian restaurant

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.870
that really doesn't cover
the territory very well.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.390
You kind of have to go Nice,
France, or someplace like that.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:03.730
Or to Laos, of course.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.370
But that and Cambodian I
would say are examples of two

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.650
that we don't have.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.570
We're missing certain cuisines.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:14.070
Pardon?

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.820
Those are totally fake.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.000
They invented those.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.960
They're basically
Vietnamese bon me.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.450
Maybe they serve
them in Cambodia,

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.260
but that does not
cover the range.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.950
The best place actually
to get Cambodian cuisine

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:31.220
is in a Vietnamese restaurant.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.830
And the reason is that most
of the Vietnamese people who

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:39.850
lived in the Mekong Delta
southwest of Ho Chi Minh City

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:44.230
are actually from Cambodia, or
have connections with Cambodia.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.520
So many of the
Vietnamese restaurants

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.926
have at least a hint
of Cambodian cuisine.

00:39:48.926 --> 00:39:49.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks you.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.959
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Sure.

00:39:50.959 --> 00:39:51.750
MICHAEL: Over here.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.840
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.050
There's a place in
Barcelona in Spain

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.950
where it's essentially
just one guy.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:57.950
He runs the whole thing.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:58.450
He cooks.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.300
He serves people.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.820
He decides what's on the menu.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.610
There is no menu.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.830
Whatever he's cooking.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.540
Super simple food,
but it's amazing,

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:08.110
and it has a lot of personality.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:11.810
I'm guessing New York, because
it has different legal issues,

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.570
and so on, is not the best
place for places like that.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.320
But do you know single
person run places

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.715
that have their own flavor?

00:40:19.715 --> 00:40:23.652
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Who's
that crazy guy on Steinway

00:40:23.652 --> 00:40:24.984
that-- yeah, the Egyptian guy.

00:40:24.984 --> 00:40:26.900
AUDIENCE: I forget the
name of his restaurant.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.315
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:40:27.315 --> 00:40:27.860
I do, too.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.940
But there are places like that.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:31.850
Not too many of them.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.110
You're right.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.050
But it's more like--
the guy in Barcelona,

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.970
does he not have any
customers or something?

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:39.350
AUDIENCE: No.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.308
He has people that come
there every single day,

00:40:41.308 --> 00:40:43.040
and he's been in that
place for 42 years.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.750
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
Because it's very hard

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.430
to run a restaurant
for one person.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.920
I've been in restaurants
where one person was

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.400
running around being the
waiter, the greeter, the cook,

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.810
the busboy.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.920
And it just doesn't
work very well.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.170
I would say Mitchell's
Soul Food just

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.010
has one cook and a
very small staff,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.910
if you want to go to Vanderbilt.
That is absolutely fantastic.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:09.430
But I can't offhand think
of-- what was that guy's name?

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:10.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that Egyptian?

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.120
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.610
There's an Egyptian guys
that does everything himself.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.550
And there's only five
seats in the place.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.260
And you go and sit
down, and he makes

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.800
you whatever the hell he wants.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.660
Kabob Cafe.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.347
Thank you.

00:41:22.347 --> 00:41:23.430
But what's the guy's name?

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:24.250
I can't remember.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.875
AUDIENCE: He does
the decorations, too.

00:41:25.875 --> 00:41:27.375
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
He does everything.

00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:28.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.020
And his brother had a
place down the street

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.100
that eventually closed down.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.600
But yeah.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.940
And Kabob Cafe is still there.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.160
So I recommend-- it's
on Steinway in Astoria.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.430
Very, very easy to get to.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:42.675
You should try that.

00:41:42.675 --> 00:41:43.525
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:41:43.525 --> 00:41:44.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:47.264
Brunch seems such an essential
part of the New York lifestyle.

00:41:47.264 --> 00:41:49.180
Do you have any favorite
brunch cuisines, or--

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.180
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Oh god.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.500
I hate brunch.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.950
But if it's a good question.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.470
There is a thing
that's "Eater New York"

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.720
called Four For the Weekend.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.830
And I always list a brunch
spot there where I've been.

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.569
I secretly go to
brunch sometimes.

00:42:07.569 --> 00:42:09.610
But there's a whole bunch
of suggestions in there

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.079
if you look in "Eater" and
then push the little magnifying

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:14.870
glass and write brunch
in there, and you'll

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.760
get just a zillion
decent recommendations.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.070
The reason I hate brunch is
that brunch is like a license

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:23.011
to commit alcoholism.

00:42:23.011 --> 00:42:23.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:27.450
It's like most people
that-- and not you.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.690
But most people that
are excited about brunch

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.290
are excited for the
mimosas and the alcohol

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.450
that they get to drink
after the other alcohol they

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.960
drank the night before.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.910
And also, brunch
restaurants, they often

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:44.920
serve a menu where they've
priced up the most boring kind

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.180
of plebeian things.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.660
And so I hate-- but thank
you for giving me the chance

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:50.764
to rant about brunch.

00:42:50.764 --> 00:42:51.263
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:51.263 --> 00:42:51.950
AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:53.075
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Thank you.

00:42:56.729 --> 00:42:57.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.210
My question is two fold.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:03.840
The first one is how did
you become a food critic?

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.300
What brought you
into this field?

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:13.500
And secondly, do you have advice
for aspiring amateur foodies?

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.090
Because the scene
is so saturated now,

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.832
it's hard to be differentiated.

00:43:16.832 --> 00:43:17.790
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Great.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:19.680
I love this question.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.890
For the first half
about how I did it,

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.070
it was like a complete accident.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:25.730
This is hard for
anybody to believe.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:29.430
We live in a bubble
called the Age of Foodism.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.490
And in the Age of Foodism,
everyone is obsessed with food.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.791
And they just like, they're
every meal is important.

00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:35.790
They don't go to movies.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.050
They don't go to plays anymore.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.549
They don't go to
dance performances.

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:41.990
They plan, they plot,
where they're going to go.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.970
What is the next place?

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:46.160
It could be either a fancy
place that's been hyped up,

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.010
or it could be a secret
place that friends

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.100
have told them about.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.230
Anyway, when I started
doing this in the '80s,

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.780
nobody wanted to
be a food critic.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.800
It was like, why
would you do that?

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.500
Are you crazy?

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.330
You just eat what you want
to eat, and who even cares?

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.470
So when the Village
Voice came to me

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.430
and said, do you want
to be the food critic,

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.760
I said, I guess so.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.320
I was working as a secretary
in a real estate company.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:10.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.870
So I said yeah, that sounds
better than being a secretary.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:17.030
So I said yes, and then
I started doing it,

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.410
and I just I had
an avidity for it.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.490
I'd been a washed
out graduate student.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.370
So the idea of doing research
was part of my makeup.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.910
So being a food
critic at that time

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:33.730
involved mainly doing research
and being a social director who

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.090
could trick people into coming
to restaurants with you.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.080
This sounds almost
unbelievable now.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.290
But now that everyone
is a food writer--

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.220
And for the second
half of your question,

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.120
I would say the
most important thing

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:51.300
about becoming a food writer as
a profession is to just begin

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.140
doing it now like
you're a professional

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.990
and don't look back.

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:58.490
The most important thing about
being a food writer, these days

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.285
at least, in the age
when blogs are ascendant,

00:45:02.285 --> 00:45:03.805
is to be able to write a lot.

00:45:03.805 --> 00:45:05.680
Be accustomed to writing
un-self-consciously.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.620
Practice writing all the time.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.820
Start your own blog.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.680
Start your own Instagram.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.700
And just write all the time.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.660
Think of topics to write about.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.280
For the blog, however,
pick a narrow topic

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.820
that hasn't been covered yet.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.550
Whether you write about
Jello in restaurants,

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.665
whether you write about
unusual ethnicities

00:45:27.665 --> 00:45:29.760
that you've never seen
before, whether you

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.487
write about a certain
neighborhood--

00:45:31.487 --> 00:45:32.320
pick a neighborhood.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.760
East Flatbush.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.656
Ocean Hill.

00:45:35.656 --> 00:45:37.530
Pick a neighborhood
that's not being covered,

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.570
and just write
obsessively about it.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.970
If you pick Ocean Hill,
it would be really good.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.280
Because you could go
out there and the food

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.780
is still really
cheap, so you're not

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.113
going to have to spend a lot
of money to write about it.

00:45:48.113 --> 00:45:51.120
But pick some delimited thing
and just write obsessively

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.010
about it.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:56.050
And start sending URLs
around to editors.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.830
Anyone will hire you
to write for free.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.207
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.740
But the trick is
to get paid for it.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.070
And don't quit your day
job, especially your day job

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:12.140
here, until you start publishing
and cash starts flowing in.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.659
Thanks for the question.

00:46:14.659 --> 00:46:16.200
AUDIENCE: I know I
could look this up

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.680
on a search engine
or something, but is

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.570
your brother the food critic
at "The Washington Post,"

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.545
or related to you?

00:46:22.545 --> 00:46:25.030
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
This is Tom Sietsema,

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.570
and I my call him my evil twin.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.140
My mother, who's obsessed
with-- I almost said genetics--

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.840
but it's genealogy.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.760
She was obsessed with
genealogy, and she determined

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.760
that Tom Sietsema is
my fifth cousin, which

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.130
means I'm probably more
closely related to you.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.700
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask
if you could-- this maybe less

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.840
relevant now-- but the sort of
big differences between food

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.930
trends in DC versus here.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:58.160
DC also, when you include
northern Virginia,

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.840
pretty multiethnic as well.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.750
But I'm sure there's some fairly
sizable gaps between the trends

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:03.250
here.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.490
ROBERT SIETSEMA: There
are giant differences.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:09.180
To me, DC is not quite
as livable a city.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.409
And I hate driving by
those government buildings

00:47:11.409 --> 00:47:11.950
all the time.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.640
It kind of like scares me.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.430
But the food there is
absolutely fantastic.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.110
It's amazing.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:19.450
They have things that
we don't have here.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:22.070
They have us completely beaten
when it comes to African food,

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.610
and one of the
reasons is that they

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.860
have all of these
embassies there where

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.660
they have a staff that wants
to eat the kind of specialties

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.930
from their home country.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:35.840
So nearly every nationality
in West Africa at least

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.704
is represented by restaurant.

00:47:37.704 --> 00:47:39.120
We have a lot of
restaurants here,

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.010
but they tend to come
from certain countries.

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:46.390
Not all of them, but I love
going down to DC and eating.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.610
And I love Ben's Chili Bowl.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:48.151
Who wouldn't?

00:47:48.151 --> 00:47:50.760
I wish we had it here.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.260
Thank you.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.246
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:52.246 --> 00:47:54.509
AUDIENCE: I'm from the
suburbs in the Midwest,

00:47:54.509 --> 00:47:56.550
and it was a big deal when
we got our first sushi

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:57.810
restaurant in 2005.

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:58.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:58.665 --> 00:48:00.373
ROBERT SIETSEMA: What
kind of restaurant?

00:48:00.373 --> 00:48:01.640
AUDIENCE: A sushi restaurant.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.848
ROBERT SIETSEMA: And how
far were you from the ocean?

00:48:03.848 --> 00:48:05.590
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm
from Illinois, so we

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.200
were close to Lake Michigan.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.840
Could you talk a
little about what

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.450
it takes for foods that start
off more specialized to go

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:14.120
mainstream?

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.535
And what kind of foods you
think now are up and coming?

00:48:17.535 --> 00:48:19.160
ROBERT SIETSEMA:
That's great question.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:23.050
And it used to be that you would
be kind of afraid to eat sushi

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.280
if you were more than
50 miles from the shore.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.860
But it's Japanese
food is something

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.680
that has become
tremendously popularized.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.410
It probably started with
the Japanese miracle, which

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.660
was pretty much in
the '70s and '80s,

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.760
whereby Japan
finally shrugged off

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:47.840
their inferiority economically
and became a powerhouse.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.260
They've since dropped
from that position.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.820
But the fact that they were
Japanese business people

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.430
running all over the country and
representing Japanese companies

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.550
meant that they wanted
to have food from home.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.780
And at that time around
Grand Central Station,

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.950
we had restaurants
that served fugu,

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.220
for God's sake, and
eels, and okonomiyaki,

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:14.240
and things that specialized
in very particular forms

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.782
of Japanese food.

00:49:15.782 --> 00:49:17.240
A lot of them have
since gone away.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.450
But what it takes is having a
knowledgeable population there

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.140
that can cook the food.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:26.125
I presume that you're
talking about Chicago or--

00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:27.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'm from Chicago.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.416
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:49:28.416 --> 00:49:31.140
Yeah, there were Japanese
people in Chicago that started

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.222
making the food, presumably.

00:49:33.222 --> 00:49:35.430
And then other people learned
how to make it as well.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:39.800
But the necessary condition was
to have immigrants from that

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800
country that were there.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.490
And that is usually the
case with ethnic food.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:47.030
Like I remember when
Mexican food hit Milwaukee.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.930
It was just unbelievable.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.390
This un-reconstructed
Mexican food

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.680
from a certain state
in Mexico was suddenly

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.970
available along National
Avenue in Milwaukee.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:59.340
And that's happened
all over the country.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.090
There's been a
revolution whereby

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.780
immigrants going
inland-- maybe they

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.530
lived originally in New
York or Los Angeles--

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:08.300
and then they started
moving inland.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.360
Particularly true
of African food.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.510
Like Nigerian food appeared
in Chicago maybe 20 years ago,

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.430
and was just mind boggling.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:20.010
There have to be immigrants
to bring the food,

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:24.430
or a mass media that transmits
the ideas of the food.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.780
And now, of course, we
have the-- how is it

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.800
that salsa took
over from ketchup

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.700
as the national condiment?

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.030
That's a story in itself.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.070
But it required
Mexicans to be here

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.140
and to bring their salsa to us.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.070
And great chains like
Taco Bell to start

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.937
promoting that condiment.

00:50:41.937 --> 00:50:42.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.600
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Sure.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.225
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:46.225 --> 00:50:49.470
So my questions about
burgers-- the obsession

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:54.090
with burgers in terms of crazier
ingredients and sort of gourmet

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.860
spoke burgers that lots of
restaurants in this city

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.240
and across the country
seems to be unending.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.890
I wanted to get your
take on that trend,

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:08.196
and your thoughts on sort of how
we got here, where it's going.

00:51:08.196 --> 00:51:11.640
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Burgers is
an interesting phenomenon,

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.970
because burgers had been with us
since the 1820s when they first

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:18.640
started appearing on the
lower west side of Manhattan

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.890
to feed German sailors--
without the bun.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:23.680
And of course, the
bun first appeared

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.890
any number of
places-- New Haven,

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.720
Connecticut, is one of
the places of claims

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.640
to have invented the
hamburger, which had bread.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.530
But eventually
hamburgers had buns.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.280
It's often been known
as comfort food.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.140
But one of the
things that made them

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.720
so popular in the
current era is what

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:45.160
I call the glamorization
of plebeian foodstuffs.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.390
And what that means is
that restaurateurs who

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.320
would formerly serve
you a steak found,

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.510
that by the glamorization
of hamburgers,

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.510
they could give you a hamburger
and you would be just as happy.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.110
At one time, a
hamburger was something

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:02.200
that you nibbled at lunch, or
ate at your desk or whatever.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.160
And now suddenly the
attention we pay hamburgers

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.300
means that instead of
charging $5 apiece for them,

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.680
they can charge $20.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.360
This is not a bad thing.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.860
But that same thing has
happened with pizza, whereby

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.320
giant, cheap pizzas shrunk
down to little Neapolitan

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.450
pizzas that were suddenly $18.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:25.470
It's one of the ways that cash
strapped restaurateurs who

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:28.550
occupy this ridiculously
expensive real estate, how

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:31.320
they're able to make
ends meet by fooling us

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.320
into thinking that we should
pay a lot more for things

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.240
we were accustomed--

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.130
AUDIENCE: So you think
it's economics driven?

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.755
ROBERT SIETSEMA: It's
economics driven,

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:42.070
but there's no doubt that this
has made every one increase

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.530
their hamburger game.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.050
And hamburgers are
1,000 times better

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:49.380
than they were 10
years ago even.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.530
I love hamburgers and I
eat them all the time,

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:55.430
but what has happened to
them is just mind boggling.

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:57.570
They're not the
same thing anymore.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:58.300
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.558
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Sure.

00:53:00.558 --> 00:53:02.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.970
I was just curious to see what
your thoughts are on dessert,

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:09.390
and then any good, cheap,
exotic, or different dessert

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:11.186
spots that you know of?

00:53:11.186 --> 00:53:14.177
ROBERT SIETSEMA: I was
recently in Chinatown

00:53:14.177 --> 00:53:16.260
and ate at this Hong Kong
dessert place where they

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.780
specialized in sweet soups.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.050
And it was down kind of at the
start of East Broadway, like 1

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:24.720
East Broadway.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.780
And the name was in
something-- In Dessert.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.470
That was one of the
most interesting.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:33.665
They had this thing that had
five different kinds of jelly

00:53:33.665 --> 00:53:34.660
in it.

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.990
And kind of crushed ice.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:40.550
And that was
really, really good.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.820
I don't really get
to dessert too often,

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.510
because I eat so much food.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:48.740
I would be much bigger than
I am if I ate desserts.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:49.970
But I love desserts.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.180
There's a revolution
going on in ice cream.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:57.160
If you like ice cream, you could
go to any number of new ice

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.860
cream places in Williamsburg.

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.950
Big Gay Icecream is a kind of
redefinition of soft serve,

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:04.660
for example.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.690
Morgensterns-- they've
reinvented the restaurant mix

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:09.990
in.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.105
Do you like ice cream?

00:54:11.105 --> 00:54:11.729
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:11.729 --> 00:54:12.335
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:12.335 --> 00:54:14.676
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Ice
cream is fantastic.

00:54:14.676 --> 00:54:16.820
Of course, Chinatown
Ice Cream Factory

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:19.740
was one of the first to
kind of glamorize ice cream

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.360
and offer exotic flavors,
likely li chi, and mango,

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.200
and things like that.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.610
Almond cookie ice cream.

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.987
Things like that.

00:54:27.987 --> 00:54:28.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.785
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Sorry
my answer wasn't better.

00:54:31.785 --> 00:54:32.470
MICHAEL: Cool.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.471
I think we have probably
time for one more.

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.720
AUDIENCE: I've had some great
subs in Delaware and New

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.220
Jersey.

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.152
Do you have any recommendations
for closer to home?

00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:42.277
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Have you
ever been to Furies House

00:54:42.277 --> 00:54:44.719
of Quality?

00:54:44.719 --> 00:54:46.010
They make their own mozzarella.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.390
Their in Hoboken.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:50.570
They're absolutely fantastic.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:57.180
I would go to Faicco's either
in Brooklyn, in Diker Heights,

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.760
or on Bleaker Street.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.800
It has fantastic subs.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:00.940
You're the vegetarian,
though, right?

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:01.780
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.450
ROBERT SIETSEMA: So in
that case I would go--

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.860
there's a new
submarines sub spot

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:12.990
that about a block and a half
from Court Street and Atlantic

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:14.280
to the east.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.720
I forget the name of it.

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.340
It was the guy that
owned-- Pete Szaz is now

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.520
doing a lot of vegetarian.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.710
AUDIENCE: It's like
bomb something?

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:21.626
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Yeah.

00:55:21.626 --> 00:55:23.279
Boombox?

00:55:23.279 --> 00:55:24.070
AUDIENCE: Boomwich.

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:25.153
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Boomwich.

00:55:25.153 --> 00:55:26.070
Thank you.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.760
Together, we will pull the names
of these restaurants together.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.780
Yeah, when you have
like 50,000 restaurants

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.154
buzzing around in
your head, it's

00:55:33.154 --> 00:55:34.890
like, oh, all the
names sound the same.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:38.253
Yeah, Boomwich has some
interesting vegetarian subs.

00:55:38.253 --> 00:55:39.492
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot.

00:55:39.492 --> 00:55:41.200
ROBERT SIETSEMA: Thanks
for the question.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:41.783
MICHAEL: Cool.

00:55:41.783 --> 00:55:43.360
Well, thanks
everybody for coming.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.401
Thanks for the questions.

00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:46.990
I know there are books for
sale, heavily discounted books

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.490
for sale.

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:49.630
And yeah, please give it up.

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.380
[APPLAUSE]
