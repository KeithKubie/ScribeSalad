00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:02.495
- [Voiceover] So to
review how we got at least

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:07.495
to this video, in 1865,
Mendel first shares his laws

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:08.590
of inheritance.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.883
He observes that there are
these heritable factors,

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.703
these discrete heritable factors
that would be passed down

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:19.508
from parent to offspring
according to certain rules.

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:21.781
And he came up with the
laws of inheritance,

00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:24.210
law of segregation, law
of independent assortment,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.540
law of dominance.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.390
But as we've said multiple
times, that work at the time

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.208
that it was for shared
wasn't taken that seriously.

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:33.246
In fact, a lot of people
didn't pay attention to it

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:35.231
and it wasn't until the early 1900s

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:37.376
that it was rediscovered.

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:40.771
But even when it was first
rediscovered around 1900,

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.350
people did not know
what the molecular basis

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.772
for these heritable factors
that Mendel talked about,

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:50.489
what the basis of these factors were.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.903
And in 1902, we have the
first really solid theory

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:57.539
for what the molecular basis
for those inheritable factors

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.211
actually could be.

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.826
This is when Boveri and Sutton come up

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:03.521
and they independently did their work,

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.084
but they both came to
the same theory at around

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:07.233
the same time.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.297
They came up with the chromosome theory,

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:11.804
now called the Boveri-Sutton
chromosome theory.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:15.958
Their work was based on
observing how cells divide,

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.197
especially meiosis, and in
seeing how these chromosomes

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:23.611
seem to pair up then segregate
then independently assort

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:25.542
and get passed on to their offspring.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.313
And they said hey, these
chromosomes, on a physical level,

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:31.605
on a molecular level, seem
to be behaving in ways

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:34.326
that are very similar
to the heritable factors

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.660
that Mendel talked about.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.460
So it was a very strong theory.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.177
And then we get to 1911 where that theory

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:43.288
gets some more evidence put behind it.

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:45.114
Thomas Hunt Morgan, we talked about it,

00:01:45.114 --> 00:01:50.114
he used his fruit flies to
see how that mutant trait

00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:54.031
that would pass on from
one generation to another

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.945
and the only plausible
explanation that he could

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:58.792
come up with is that
it was being passed on,

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:01.846
on the X sex chromosome.

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.024
And him and his team continued
to do more and more work

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:07.942
to establish that chromosomes
indeed seem to be the basis,

00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:11.079
the physical location for
these heritable factors

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.951
that Mendel first talked about in 1865.

00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.119
But even Morgan and his team,

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.479
when they looked at chromosomes,

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.543
a lot of times now when
we think of chromosomes

00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:23.200
we think of chromosomes
as being made up of DNA,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.506
and that is true;

00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:26.648
but chromosomes are also
made up of other things,

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:28.242
including proteins.

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:30.566
And in the early days,
when people said hey,

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:32.682
it looks like chromosomes
are really the basis

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:34.970
or the location for
these heritable factors,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.936
for these genes.

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:38.156
When people look at these
two different molecules,

00:02:38.156 --> 00:02:41.761
they said hey, it's probably
the proteins that are actually

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:46.302
responsible for encoding the
information of inheritance.

00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:50.218
Proteins, people knew, were
these complex molecules

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:53.378
that in some ways you could
say encoded information.

00:02:53.378 --> 00:02:55.209
Well, at the time, they thought that DNA

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.279
were these kind of boring
molecules that surely

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.991
this couldn't encode information.

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:03.446
And so the first
evidence, strong evidence,

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:08.446
that DNA is actually where
the genetic information

00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:12.641
is encoded doesn't happen
for several more decades.

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.377
And we start along that path
with Griffith right over here,

00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:18.571
famous for Griffith's experiment,

00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:20.164
where he does something
really interesting.

00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:22.933
And he by himself, his experiments in 1920

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:25.154
or that he publishes
in 1920 or he actually

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:27.408
he conducts and publishes in 1928,

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:30.074
they aren't responsible
in and of themselves

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:34.123
for establishing DNA to be
the molecule that's actually

00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:37.362
the basis of inheritance,
but they start an interesting

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:41.020
path of inquiry where
these gentlemen in 1944

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.024
are finally able to establish that DNA

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:48.386
is where these heritable factors

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:51.233
are actually encoded.

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:54.002
So what was Griffith's experiment?

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:57.355
Well, he was studying

00:03:57.355 --> 00:04:00.267
strains of bacteria,

00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:03.715
and he saw that the same, the two variants

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:07.555
on a certain strain or
two variants of bacteria,

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:10.167
you had the rough strain
and the smooth strain,

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:14.033
if he injected the rough
strain into a mouse,

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.337
the mouse lived.

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:18.160
If he injected the smooth
strain into a mouse,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.911
the mouse died.

00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:22.627
And it was because the
smooth strain had this

00:04:22.627 --> 00:04:25.736
protective coating on it
that made it harder to attack

00:04:25.736 --> 00:04:28.113
by the mouses immune system.

00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:30.281
So that by itself, well,
that's interesting,

00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.475
this is the virulent strain,

00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:34.983
this is the one that's actually
going to kill the mice.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:39.215
Now if he took this smooth
strain, the virulent strain

00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:43.636
and he heated up so those
bacteria were killed

00:04:43.636 --> 00:04:46.194
and then he injected those,
so this is the heat-killed

00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:49.670
smooth strain, if he injected
those into the mouse,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.406
the mouse still lived because
those bacteria were dead.

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:56.775
But then he did something
very, very, very interesting.

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.832
He took this, the
heat-killed smooth strain,

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.052
he took some of that and
he took some of the live

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.427
rough strain put together.

00:05:04.427 --> 00:05:06.284
Now common sense would
tell you is like okay,

00:05:06.284 --> 00:05:09.390
this blue stuff, that's not
going to kill the mouse,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.441
and this killed smooth strain,

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:15.505
that's not going to kill the mouse either.

00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:18.326
So if mix it up, that
shouldn't kill the mouse,

00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:21.226
but it did kill the mouse,
which was fascinating.

00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:23.159
And so he came up with this theory

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.907
of a transformation principle.

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:28.540
Even though he killed
the smooth strain here,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.021
there must've been some type of materials,

00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:34.052
some type of molecule
that still got transferred

00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:37.683
from the dead bacteria
to the live bacteria

00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:40.478
and essentially transformed
the live bacteria

00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:45.478
into the smooth strain,
allowing them to kill the mouse.

00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:48.390
And so he came up with
this idea of some kind of

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.926
transformation principle.

00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:53.800
And so you can imagine, and
look, it took some time,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.431
over 10 years, now almost two decades,

00:05:57.431 --> 00:06:00.328
Avery, McCarty and McLeod said hey,

00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:03.256
what is this transformation principle?

00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:06.208
Why don't we use Griffith's experiment

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:09.183
and let's keep, instead
of just taking you know

00:06:09.183 --> 00:06:11.981
the whole heat-killed smooth strain,

00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:14.277
let's try to break it
up into its components

00:06:14.277 --> 00:06:16.289
and let's try to isolate
the different components

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.668
and keep doing the
experiment until we have

00:06:18.668 --> 00:06:22.743
an isolated molecule or
an isolated component

00:06:22.743 --> 00:06:24.571
that seems to do the trick.

00:06:24.571 --> 00:06:27.941
So they were trying to isolate
the transformation principle.

00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:29.665
And they did just as what I described.

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:32.304
They took the heat-killed smooth strain,

00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:35.540
they would try to separate the
different constituents out.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.388
You can separate them out physically,

00:06:38.388 --> 00:06:40.881
you could use certain
washes that would wash away

00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.056
certain components.

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:45.174
You could use enzymes that would
destroy certain components.

00:06:45.174 --> 00:06:48.515
And eventually, and this
is very meticulous work,

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:51.522
so you can imagine they take the stuff,

00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:54.500
the whole dead heat-killed smooth strain

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.694
and they start to
separated it out into its

00:06:56.694 --> 00:06:58.245
various components.

00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:03.245
So that might be one
component right over there,

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:07.542
this is another, let me do
it in these different colors,

00:07:07.542 --> 00:07:11.147
this is another component
right over there,

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:14.205
this is another component
right over there.

00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:16.504
They're using different
chemical techniques to separate

00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:19.616
all of the constituents
that were in that original

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:21.664
heat-killed smooth strain.

00:07:21.664 --> 00:07:24.773
And then instead of
running this last phase

00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:27.203
of the experiment with the
entire heat killed smooth strain,

00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:30.442
they do it with the rough
strain mixed with each

00:07:30.442 --> 00:07:32.817
of these components separately.

00:07:32.817 --> 00:07:34.854
And then they kept running the experiment

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:35.937
and they would say, hey, look,

00:07:35.937 --> 00:07:38.233
when we have this
component right over here

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:42.284
and we tried to run the
experiment, the mouse still lives.

00:07:42.284 --> 00:07:43.284
The mouse still lives.

00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:46.212
So this one did not
transform the rough strain.

00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:49.869
And maybe this one also did
not transform the rough strain.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:52.925
But then eventually, they
were able to isolate something

00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:55.039
that did transform the rough strain.

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:57.784
So the mouse dies,

00:07:57.784 --> 00:08:00.159
and so it did transform the rough strain

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:01.702
into the smooth strain.

00:08:01.702 --> 00:08:04.706
And so they took this material
and they start applying

00:08:04.706 --> 00:08:08.181
all sorts of test to it.

00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:12.543
They could look at the
molecular components of it.

00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:15.284
And when they looked at
the ratios of nitrogen

00:08:15.284 --> 00:08:18.159
and phosphorus, they said
hey, this seems to have

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:21.398
ratios that are consistent with DNA,

00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:23.329
which is a molecule
they already knew about.

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:25.785
And it was not ratios that
would've been consistent

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:26.989
with proteins.

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:28.539
They ran chemical tests and said hey,

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:31.109
it doesn't look like there's
a lot of protein in this thing

00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:34.659
that we isolated, or even
RNA, which is another molecule

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.654
that they new.

00:08:35.654 --> 00:08:38.428
Enzymes that would've
degraded proteins or RNA

00:08:38.428 --> 00:08:41.930
did not degrade this stuff, but
the enzyme that degraded DNA

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.498
did degrade this stuff.

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:47.034
And so they were able to come
up with the idea that DNA

00:08:47.034 --> 00:08:49.957
was the transformation principle.

00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:52.023
And this is a really,
really, really big deal.

00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:53.878
Think about this quest that
we've been going through

00:08:53.878 --> 00:08:57.117
for the better part of a hundred years.

00:08:57.117 --> 00:08:59.475
Inheritable factors, well,
where are they located?

00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:01.341
Hey, it looks like they're
on the chromosomes.

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.143
We start having evidence that
they're on the chromosomes.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:06.510
But chromosomes are made
up of DNA and proteins,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.405
and it wasn't until the start
with Griffith's experiments

00:09:09.405 --> 00:09:11.956
and then Avery, McCarty and
McLeod come along and said hey,

00:09:11.956 --> 00:09:15.352
let's identify what was it
exactly about the heat-killed

00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:16.292
smooth strain

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:18.552
What's the component in it
that actually transformed

00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:19.749
the other strain?

00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:20.889
And it was DNA.

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:23.408
And what was fascinating
is when you mixed that DNA

00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:29.663
from the heat-killed smooth
strain with the rough strain,

00:09:29.663 --> 00:09:34.470
that DNA was able to mix in
with the DNA of the rough strain

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.231
and allows it to start producing
these smooth protein codes

00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:40.948
that allowed it to be more virulent.

00:09:40.948 --> 00:09:44.037
So the mouse's immune system
couldn't attack it as well.

00:09:44.037 --> 00:09:45.664
So it's really fascinating
on a lot of levels.

00:09:45.664 --> 00:09:47.301
You know, the whole
takeaway from this one is

00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:50.070
how did we get to DNA
being the important part

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.874
of the chromosomes, at
least in terms of encoding

00:09:52.874 --> 00:09:54.438
the actual genetic information,

00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:56.529
but it's also a cool way to think about

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.680
just almost how magical DNA is,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.508
that if you mix it in,
if you mix it in the DNA

00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:07.380
of one strain with a live
version of another strain,

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.540
you actually might be able
to transform that strain.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.136
In some ways, they were
doing very, very basic

00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:17.504
genetic engineering here.
