00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.240
All right Michael, you know the answer?

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.726
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:01.726 --> 00:00:02.915
&gt;&gt; Okay, what's the answer?

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:04.450
&gt;&gt; Do you want to know the value of the whole game?

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.430
&gt;&gt; No. I want to know the matrix.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.372
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay. So right. So, if A goes

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:11.840
left, it doesn't matter what B does. And at that

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.396
point there's a chance node, and it's 50/50 for negative

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.394
20, which I feel like ought to be, negative eight.

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:21.920
&gt;&gt; That's right. How'd you get negative eight? because half

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.470
of 2 is sorry, half of 4 is 2 and half

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.443
of -20 is -10. So -8.

00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:31.470
&gt;&gt; Right, so you just took the expectation of where you would end up.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.520
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.860
&gt;&gt; Okay. What next? And that, it doesn't matter what b does. So

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.890
then negative eight is also in the upper right corner of the matrix.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.416
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:44.970
&gt;&gt; The next easy on to do is if both go right. A goes

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.460
right and b goes right then we get the three. It's just sitting there.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.800
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.570
&gt;&gt; And the last thing requires me to do

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.250
some multiplication. So

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.290
&gt;&gt; Rrr.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.630
&gt;&gt; -5 times 0.8 Is like -4.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.982
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:02.970
&gt;&gt; 10 times 0.2 is like 2 so -2.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.410
&gt;&gt; That is correct Michael.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.910
&gt;&gt; Shoo.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.010
&gt;&gt; So now we have the matrix. Now, what did

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.940
we just notice here? Remember what I said about matrices before?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.370
&gt;&gt; It has all the information that you need.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.530
&gt;&gt; Right, so in fact none of this matters.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.290
Who cares how we got here?

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.150
&gt;&gt; wait, but, but, oh.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.160
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love erasing stuff!

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.890
&gt;&gt; So here's the thing, we cannot reconstruct that tree from this matrix.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.710
&gt;&gt; We can't reconstruct, well, actually we

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.900
could reconstruct that tree from the matrix.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.440
&gt;&gt; No, we can't.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we, of course we could.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.170
&gt;&gt; No, we can't.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.465
&gt;&gt; Yes, we can, because there's an infinite number of

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:35.504
trees we could do, and one of them is that one.

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:35.890
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.710
&gt;&gt; We just don't happen to know that its the right one.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710
&gt;&gt; I don't think that's really what people mean when

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.240
they say I could reconstruct this. Like I could reconstruct

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.150
the crime at this crime scene, it could be any of

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.910
a million things. Like no, we can't construct that specific tree.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.260
&gt;&gt; But you know what it doesn't matter,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.860
because the only thing that matters is the matrix.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.370
&gt;&gt; Ahh.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.990
&gt;&gt; And you will notice, Michael, that you did all that multiplication

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.710
and you multiplied 0.8 times 5 and after a couple of seconds of

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.760
thinking about which was probably edited out but I know how long

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.360
it took you do. You came up with the right answer. That's great.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.410
But notice that the number you came up with doesn't say anything about

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.700
expected values and what the probablities are. It doesn't even matter that it's

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.680
nondeterministic, because once you have these

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.060
numbers, these expected values, that's what you're

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.700
going to end up with. So who cares what the original tree was? Who cares

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.880
if you can reconstruct it? Who cares what the rules of the games

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.270
are? All you know is I have a choice of two strategies. We

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.670
call them left and right here, but we could have called them one

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.420
and two, or Q and Z. It doesn't matter. For the purpose of solving

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.560
the game. So what is the solution for the game by the way?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, A is trying to maximize right?

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.800
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.700
&gt;&gt; So A would never, ever, ever, ever want to go left.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.220
&gt;&gt; So A's going to go right and then B is trying to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.100
minimize. So B is going to go left and we get the -2.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.070
&gt;&gt; I believe that is correct. And it

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.120
makes sense the other way as well, right? That

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.160
B would not ever choose to go right because

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.100
then A would choose to go right as well.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.980
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.400
&gt;&gt; So you'll still end up here.
