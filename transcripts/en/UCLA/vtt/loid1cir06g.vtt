00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:07.759
Hi! My name is Simone. I’m a UCLA freshman, and I’m here to introduce you to living on campus.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:14.609
We are here on “The Hill.” That’s where undergraduates live at UCLA.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.800
Here we are at the south end of The Hill. 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
This is De Neve Plaza. 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.089
The buildings here have tree or plant names, from A for Acacia through 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.669
H for Holly. 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.519
Here’s Holly. It’s where I live. 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.460
It’s the center of the universe.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650
Please! On the north end of The Hill is Sunset Village, with places like Canyon Point

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.820
and Courtside. 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.270
I live in Courtside.  

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.000
It’s right by the tennis court. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.530
Tennis is fun, but if that’s not your game, there’s a bunch of other things to do. 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.090
Like an outdoor gym.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.140
Or basketball. 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.079
Or volleyball.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.350
Or swimming. 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.850
In between De Neve Plaza and Sunset Village there’s a mixture

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.650
of new and updated buildings. For instance,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.640
 there are the three Riebers: Rieber Hall, Rieber Vista, and Rieber Terrace. 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.870
On The Hill, you’re never very far from central campus, 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.710
where your classes, libraries and student services are. 
More than 90 percent of new students live on campus.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.890
When you live here, you get oriented to campus life sooner.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.890
The food is great, and you have a choice of four different restaurants here. 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.790
There’s a lot of variety here at Feast. My favorite is all the vegetarian options.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.830
The best is the sushi.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.970
But I love the flatbread. 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.350
You can even check your phone for the daily menu or nutritional facts. 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.350
If you want to! 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.020
This is a great place to live. Let’s go check out a room . . . 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.309
We have an award-winning dining program, and De Neve is one of the best. 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:25.309
Let me show you around. 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.579
The cafes are fun, too. 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.159
Some people hang out in their rooms, but there’s a whole student neighborhood, 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:55.159
with places to study and places to kick back. 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.389
It’s a lot of fun living on campus, 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.579
and it can help you do better academically.

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:14.579
Plus there’s over 5,000 events every year happening right here on The Hill. 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.580
If you visit campus, be sure to take a housing tour, 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.580
and see for yourself. See you here soon!
