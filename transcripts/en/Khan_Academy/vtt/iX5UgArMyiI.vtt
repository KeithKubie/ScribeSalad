00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.397
- [Voiceover] So we have a circle here

00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:03.115
and they specified some points for us.

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:05.846
This little orangeish, or,
I guess, maroonish-red point

00:00:05.846 --> 00:00:09.027
right over here is the
center of the circle,

00:00:09.027 --> 00:00:11.720
and then this blue point
is a point that happens

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.634
to sit on the circle.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.956
And so with that information,
I want you to pause the video

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:20.274
and see if you can figure out
the equation for this circle.

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:21.807
Alright, let's work through this together.

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:25.725
So let's first think about
the center of the circle.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.208
And the center of the
circle is just going to be

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:30.787
the coordinates of that point.

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:32.923
So, the x-coordinate is negative one

00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:35.105
and then the y-coordinate is one.

00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:38.333
So center is negative one comma one.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.413
And now, let's think about what the radius

00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:41.871
of the circle is.

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:43.542
Well, the radius is going
to be the distance between

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.795
the center and any point on the circle.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.720
So, for example,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.206
for example,

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:51.785
this distance.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.410
The distance of that line.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.036
Let's see I can do it thicker.

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:57.311
A thicker version of that.

00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:00.748
This line,

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:01.653
right over there.

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:04.486
Something strange about my...

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:07.110
Something strange about my pen tool.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.503
It's making that very thin.

00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:10.407
Let me do it one more time.

00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:11.777
Okay, that's better.

00:01:11.777 --> 00:01:14.122
(laughs) The distance of
that line right over there,

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:16.095
that is going to be the radius.

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.255
So how can we figure that out?

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:20.948
Well, we can set up a right triangle

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.481
and essentially use the distance formula

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.919
which comes from the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:26.939
To figure out the length of that line,

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.214
so this is the radius,

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:34.143
we could figure out a change in x.

00:01:34.143 --> 00:01:38.478
So, if we look at our
change in x right over here.

00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:41.404
Our change in x as we go from the center

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:42.774
to this point.

00:01:42.774 --> 00:01:45.189
So this is our change in x.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.345
And then we could say that
this is our change in y.

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:52.178
That right over there is our change in y.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.826
And so our change in x-squared

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:55.173
plus our change in y-squared

00:01:55.173 --> 00:01:56.589
is going to be our radius squared.

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:59.422
That comes straight out of
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:59.422 --> 00:02:02.162
This is a right triangle.

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:05.482
And so we can say that r-squared

00:02:05.482 --> 00:02:07.874
is going to be equal to

00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:11.960
our change in x-squared

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.048
plus our change in y-squared.

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:18.828
Plus our change in y-squared.

00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:20.848
Now, what is our change in x-squared?

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:22.914
Or, what is our change in x going to be?

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:27.465
Our change in x is going to be equal to,

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:28.998
well, when we go from the radius

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:30.600
to this point over here,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.919
our x goes from negative one to six.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.148
So you can view it as our ending x

00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:39.400
minus our starting x.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.570
So negative one minus negative,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.695
sorry, six minus negative one

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:46.717
is equal to seven.

00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:49.611
So, let me...

00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:51.817
So, we have

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:53.512
our change in x, this right over here,

00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:55.718
is equal to seven.

00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:57.877
If we viewed this as the start point

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:58.546
and this as the end point,

00:02:58.546 --> 00:02:59.683
it would be negative seven,

00:02:59.683 --> 00:03:00.887
but we really care
about the absolute value

00:03:00.887 --> 00:03:03.301
in the change of x, and once you square it

00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:05.159
it all becomes a positive anyway.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.784
So our change in x right over here

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:09.129
is going to be positive seven.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.451
And our change in y,

00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:14.748
well, we are starting at,

00:03:14.748 --> 00:03:17.790
we are starting at y is equal to one

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.692
and we are going to y is
equal to negative four.

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:24.779
So it would be negative four minus one

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.867
which is equal to negative five.

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:30.444
And so our change in y is negative five.

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.070
You can view this distance right over here

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.879
as the absolute value of our change in y,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.408
which of course would be
the absolute value of five.

00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:39.685
But once you square it, it doesn't matter.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:41.311
The negative sign goes away.

00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:44.492
And so, this is going to
simplify to seven squared,

00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:47.208
change in x-squared, is 49.

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:52.206
Change in y-squared,
negative five squared, is 25.

00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:55.344
So we get r-squared,

00:03:55.344 --> 00:04:00.148
we get r-squared is equal to 49 plus 25.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.359
So what's 49 plus 25?

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.610
Let's see, that's going
to be 54, or was it 74.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.137
r-squared is equal to 74.

00:04:11.137 --> 00:04:11.945
Did I do that right?

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:13.130
Yep, 74.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.009
And so now we can write the
equation for the circle.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.586
The circle is going to be
all of the points that are,

00:04:18.586 --> 00:04:20.926
well, in fact, let me right all of the,

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:22.778
so if r-squared is equal to 74,

00:04:22.778 --> 00:04:26.122
r is equal to the square-root of 74.

00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:27.840
And so the equation of
the circle is going to be

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.755
all points x comma y

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:33.047
that are this far away from the center.

00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:35.601
And so what are those points going to be?

00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:38.666
Well, the distance is going to be x minus

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:40.779
the x-coordinate of the center.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.779
x minus negative one squared.

00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:47.907
Let me do that in a blue color.

00:04:47.907 --> 00:04:50.949
Minus negative one squared.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.949
Plus y minus,

00:04:55.956 --> 00:05:00.246
y minus the y-coordinate of the center.

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:04.889
y minus one squared.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:05.957
Squared.

00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:09.765
Is equal, is going to
be equal to r-squared.

00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:12.505
Is going to be equal to the
length of the radius squared.

00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:16.151
Well, r-squared we already
know is going to be 74.

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:17.335
74.

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:18.937
And then if we want to
simplify it a little bit,

00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:21.584
you subtract a negative,
this becomes a positive.

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:25.601
So it simplifies to x plus one squared

00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:30.519
plus y minus one squared

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:33.774
is equal to 74.

00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:36.119
Is equal to 74.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:38.459
And, we are all done.
