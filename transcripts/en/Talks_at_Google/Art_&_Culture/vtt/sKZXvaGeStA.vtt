00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.988
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.220
JOHN MULANEY: We were in a taxi
cab, and I saw Chelsea Piers

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.940
and I wanted to go
to the climbing wall

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.914
to do a little
upskirt photography.

00:05:26.914 --> 00:05:28.330
But while we were
here, we thought

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.000
we'd bang out a couple
of gorgeous glam shots

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.770
for our Broadway premiere.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.670
NICK KROLL: We also
came to Chelsea Piers

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.770
because we thought that there
was an orthodox bar mitzvah,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.870
because there's nothing
better than kosher Chinese.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.470
But because we decided
that that wasn't here,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.797
we decided to do a
photoshoot for our Broadway--

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.130
JOHN MULANEY: For our Broadway--

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.109
NICK KROLL: For Broadway show.

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:54.400
JOHN MULANEY: We're coming
to Broadway, Lyceum Theatre,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.940
September 23rd.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.520
And it's a dream
come true, you know?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.990
NICK KROLL: For New York.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.670
JOHN MULANEY: For New York.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.780
NICK KROLL: For us, it's
an expected turn of events.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.580
JOHN MULANEY: Oh no,
it's a dream come true

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.590
for the audience to pay a
good deal of money to see us.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.552
It's a joy for
them, it's a dream.

00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:12.010
NICK KROLL: It's
a dream come true,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.100
and for us it's
something that has

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.240
been 50 years in the making.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.820
We want everybody to
come to this play.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.984
JOHN MULANEY: Not
just some people.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:24.900
NICK KROLL: Everybody.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.410
JOHN MULANEY: Everyone.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.670
NICK KROLL: We want
everybody to pay full price

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.052
to come to this play.

00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:31.510
JOHN MULANEY: A
lot of people think

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.456
that this is not for everyone.

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:35.830
Well if you're the type that's
on the fence about coming,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.630
why don't you go get stuffed?

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.976
Get bent.

00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:40.370
How dare you talk
to me that way.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.510
Come see my play.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.704
I'll kick your screen
door in and find you.

00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:49.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.620
SPEAKER: So I'll
intro the show here.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.230
Two of the most original
voices in comedy today,

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.750
Nick Kroll and
John Mulaney, make

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.360
their brilliant and bizarre
Broadway debuts in "Oh, Hello"

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.480
on Broadway.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.130
They take the stage
as their acclaimed

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.450
alter egos Gil Faizon and George
St. Geegland, outrageously

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.420
opinionated, 70-something,
self-proclaimed legendary

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.770
bachelors of New
York's Upper West Side.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.180
So now, please help me
welcome, of course, Nick Kroll,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.165
John Mulaney, and
director Alex Timbers.

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:24.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.330
So this show is about two old
friends in their 70s, right?

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.500
Have known each other for
close to 40 years now, right?

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.890
So how much does that
parallel real life?

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.870
I know you are not that old.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.412
I couldn't find your
birthday online.

00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:46.161
JOHN MULANEY: I have
no birth certificate.

00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:47.190
SPEAKER: I figured.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.523
JOHN MULANEY: I was a foundling.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.540
We met when, 2000?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.420
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.580
JOHN MULANEY: At the
turn of the century.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.570
And it's now 2016.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.150
And I'm not great
at math, so I don't

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.697
know how long that's been.

00:08:02.697 --> 00:08:03.780
NICK KROLL: It's 19 years.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.380
JOHN MULANEY: 19 years, yeah.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.360
We met in 2000 in
college, and we have

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.042
been best friends for 16 years.

00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:09.750
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.420
SPEAKER: In college, really?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:10.990
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.698
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:08:11.698 --> 00:08:14.410
We met, I was a senior,
we went to Georgetown,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.680
and I was the director
of the improv group.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.185
And then John auditioned.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.010
John auditioned, and I
immediately fell in love.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.690
SPEAKER: So how did
you two get together

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.820
to develop the characters
of Gil and George?

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.150
These two wonderful gentlemen
on the screens here.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.066
JOHN MULANEY: Well, it
started with an opening

00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:37.760
on Thursday nights
at this club called

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.000
Rififi on East 11th Street,
between First and Second.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.740
It is now a Buffalo Exchange.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.697
Nick was hosting a stand-up
show with Jessi Klein, correct?

00:08:47.697 --> 00:08:48.530
NICK KROLL: Correct.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.700
JOHN MULANEY: All right, then
I kicked her out or something

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.530
like that.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.970
NICK KROLL: She went to
go write for a show in LA,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.110
so I asked John if he
would host it with me.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.220
And we were trying to
figure out what we could do

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.080
or what would be a
fun way to host it.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.910
And we were at The Strand
bookstore one day, which is--

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.780
JOHN MULANEY: Do
people know The Strand?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.212
NICK KROLL: The Strand
is 18 miles of books--

00:09:11.212 --> 00:09:12.920
JOHN MULANEY: And 12
miles of loneliness.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.900
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.460
And so we were
there and watching--

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.910
there were these
two older men both

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.470
buying their copies of
Alan Alda's autobiography

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.180
"Never Have Your Dog Stuffed."

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.300
SPEAKER: Is that true?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.740
NICK KROLL: Yeah, they both
bought their own copies.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.390
And then we followed
them to a diner

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.660
where they both sat there and
read their individual copies

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.000
of the same book.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.580
And we were like, these
guys won't share a book

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.260
but they probably
share a Murphy bed.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.020
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah, they had
a real Bert and Ernie vibe.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.020
And they wore
turtleneck and blazers.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.895
They were all fabric.

00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:52.436
NICK KROLL: So it was the kind
of guys that I think both John

00:09:52.436 --> 00:09:54.380
and I have been interested
in for a long time.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.650
They're all over New York.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.390
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah, these were
like the bachelors in a Woody

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.120
Allen movie.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.370
You know, when someone's
like, I want to introduce you

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.480
to this great guy.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.530
And then it's like
a blob of corduroy.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.840
But in the reality of the
movie, this guy's a catch

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.550
and he's an architect, and
he has hair like oatmeal.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.541
And you're like, in what world?

00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.540
NICK KROLL: And so it's
like, imagine those guys

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.212
20 years later.

00:10:18.212 --> 00:10:19.003
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.940
NICK KROLL: So they're
just like, it's tote bags.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.900
JOHN MULANEY: It's
men with tote bags.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.500
NICK KROLL: It's men, and
not like cool hipster,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.560
little jean short
Brooklyn boy tote bags.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.030
We're talking like, broken
pen, stained tote bags,

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.310
and chipped PBS mugs.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.000
JOHN MULANEY: Guys with their
own individual grocery carts.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.200
Those little pulley carts that
then collapse and you hang

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.860
on the wall with a bicycle.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.960
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.760
SPEAKER: So "Oh,
Hello" the Broadway--

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.930
NICK KROLL: If you want 40
more examples, we'll give them.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:56.920
If you want.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.461
JOHN MULANEY: You
wanna know anything

00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:01.517
else about these types of guys?

00:11:01.517 --> 00:11:02.850
SPEAKER: Their hand liver spots.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.270
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah, they
think the sun is good for you.

00:11:09.595 --> 00:11:11.054
They lay out in
Washington Square--

00:11:11.054 --> 00:11:13.303
NICK KROLL: God, I just was
in Washington Square Park.

00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:15.627
I took a picture of a guy
in Washington Square Park

00:11:15.627 --> 00:11:16.210
the other day.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.160
It was sunny and I got
a picture of one guy

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.180
with a big Jewish
star right here.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.020
And he just was a color of
a beautifully rotisseried

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.534
chicken.

00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:26.950
And then there
were a couple guys,

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.120
one of them who had the full tin
foil thing with a weird mouth

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.100
guard.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.140
Because he was like, my lips
can't get burned or something

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.760
like that.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.870
He had paper lips.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.820
Like Einstein's
heroin-addicted brother.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.320
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah,
I'm Jerry Einstein.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.920
I'm not my brother, you
know, but I'm a good guy.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.180
I repair keyboards.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.670
NICK KROLL: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.050
Exactly right.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.920
SPEAKER: So "Oh,
Hello" on Broadway

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.997
is a show within
a show that can--

00:11:58.997 --> 00:12:00.580
NICK KROLL: Do you
need more examples?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.090
We can do more if you want.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.780
SPEAKER: I've got
more questions.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.780
JOHN MULANEY: All right.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.230
Well, we'll find a
way to wedge them in.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.760
SPEAKER: OK, so can you
explain the premise behind the

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.440
"Oh, Hello" on Broadway show?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.174
Because--

00:12:18.174 --> 00:12:19.476
NICK KROLL: It's a money grab.

00:12:19.476 --> 00:12:21.222
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah,
it's a cash grab.

00:12:21.222 --> 00:12:25.050
The money's in legitimate
theatre, everyone.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.840
Get out of tech now.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.560
There's about to be a
live performance boom.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.780
So I play a character
named George St. Geegland,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.900
and he is a writer, OK?

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.510
And this is a
play-- he's written

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.230
many plays with his dear
friend Gil Faizon, who

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.531
is a great actor.

00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:49.320
SPEAKER: He's also
a potato stand-up.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.160
JOHN MULANEY: He's a
stand-in for mashed potatoes.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.975
NICK KROLL: So they
have written a play--

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:56.400
JOHN MULANEY: They've written
several over the years.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.775
NICK KROLL: They're written
several plays over the years,

00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:01.247
and this play is
about them losing

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.580
their rent-controlled apartment.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.970
JOHN MULANEY: Yes.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.460
NICK KROLL: And they've
been paying $75 a month--

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.920
JOHN MULANEY: For a five-bedroom
with office and fireplace

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.380
and crown molding
on 73rd Street.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.160
NICK KROLL: Yeah, and their
rent is being raised to $2,500

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.950
a month.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.897
JOHN MULANEY: The most
money they've ever heard of.

00:13:19.897 --> 00:13:21.980
NICK KROLL: And so they're
losing their apartment.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.840
And then the play unfolds,
and then the relationship

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.680
between George and Gil-- the
men who have written the play--

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.770
starts to collapse upon itself.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.860
JOHN MULANEY: There are
cracks in this facade.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.690
NICK KROLL: If you
can believe it.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.620
But Alex might be able to
explain it better than us,

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.764
in a more theatrical way.

00:13:44.764 --> 00:13:45.930
Did we explain it all right?

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.120
ALEX TIMBERS: You did
a great job, guys.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.210
NICK KROLL: Thank you, Alex.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.960
JOHN MULANEY: Thank you so much.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.480
ALEX TIMBERS: I think
what's also useful to know

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.250
is that so much of
the show is scripted,

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.791
but also a lot of
it's improvisatory.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:56.070
So every show you see is
different from any other.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.520
SPEAKER: I was going to ask
that later on, because I've

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:58.720
seen the show--

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.070
NICK KROLL: Thanks for
fucking that up, Alex.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.760
JOHN MULANEY: You
jumped his question.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.080
Jesus Christ, we talked
about this in the car.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.580
NICK KROLL: I mean,
why couldn't you

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.000
give an example about what
kind of guys they were?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.457
That's what he's looking for.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.980
SPEAKER: I was going to
ask, how much is actually

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.760
scripted versus how much
you guys are trying to make

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.150
each other crack all night?

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.215
Because it looks like all of you
were just about-- both of you

00:14:22.215 --> 00:14:25.690
were just about to laugh
throughout the entire thing.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.950
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah,
and sometimes I

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.070
will try to do things
to make Nick laugh.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.570
And sometimes we
look at each other,

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.886
and I think we just realize
that we're on Broadway.

00:14:37.886 --> 00:14:40.880
And I really mean this, this
has happened a couple of times--

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.450
where we look at
each other and then

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.656
we realize what we're
doing, and where,

00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:46.780
and we both start laughing.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.200
NICK KROLL: Yes.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.340
And sometimes a joke
we've done 100 times-- I'd

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.640
like to say every
time I crack it's

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.980
because we're improvising
something new that I've never

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.479
heard.

00:14:55.479 --> 00:15:00.200
But sometimes it
just makes me laugh.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.170
Like, I'll be describing
the shelving unit,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.387
and I'll look over and John is
looking at the shelving unit.

00:15:08.387 --> 00:15:17.989
He's just like-- And it's
like I am not a professional,

00:15:17.989 --> 00:15:18.530
I don't know.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.880
JOHN MULANEY: No, few people
can hold up under that look.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.750
NICK KROLL: So
there's lines that

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.540
are always evolving
and changing,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.240
and we're improvising
within spots.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.840
And then we have a
guest every night

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.944
that obviously is an improvised
interview every night.

00:15:36.944 --> 00:15:38.360
And then there are
other sections.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.437
And Alex did a very good
job of creating a structure

00:15:42.437 --> 00:15:44.520
that is really a play--
and that we've worked hard

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.420
in creating a real play
that we've written--

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.340
but always leaving
pockets for us

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.560
to walk away and
come back to things,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.452
so that it feels fresh to us
and feels fresh to the audience.

00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:58.660
Because you want everyone
to feel like whatever night

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.390
they're there, that they're
seeing something specific

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.060
to that night.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.790
JOHN MULANEY: And luckily
because we really cannot

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.740
remember our lines, you are.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.670
But there are a few core
relationship things--

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.820
and for this next sentence
I'll win the Pulitzer--

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.710
that you didn't want us
to undercut, I think,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.340
in a good way.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.080
So we try to honor some
things about Gil and George

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.480
that we would not
try to laugh through,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.740
because it's a serious play.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.500
ALEX TIMBERS: Yeah, I think
there's a heart to the show

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.150
because there's this sort
of meta-narrative, which

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.030
is the friendship of
these two characters

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.740
but also Nick and
John's friendship.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.400
And I think by the end
they both really pay off.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.260
And so it surprises you
because it's a tough edge show,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.570
but it has a warm
heart at the center.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.370
SPEAKER: Talk about
the journey of the show

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.472
itself, because it
started out as-- like,

00:16:47.472 --> 00:16:48.930
there was a "Too
Much Tuna" sketch,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.388
and there was the
"Oh, Hello" show.

00:16:50.388 --> 00:16:52.610
And then you went
to do things in LA,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.360
you were doing things
in the East Village.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.941
Then it went off-Broadway,
now it's on Broadway.

00:16:56.941 --> 00:16:58.440
And then when did
Alex get involved?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.035
What's the journey?

00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:01.070
JOHN MULANEY: Okay, so
the actual Rififi show

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.970
on East 11th I was talking
about started 10 years ago.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.119
So we've been doing
them 10 years.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.801
I'd say it laid dormant--

00:17:08.801 --> 00:17:10.300
NICK KROLL: It's
older than YouTube?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.009
Is that possible?

00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:13.258
SPEAKER: Yeah, a lot of
things are older than YouTube.

00:17:13.258 --> 00:17:14.690
NICK KROLL: I know.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.827
And look, "Oh, Hello"s a
billion-dollar business now.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:26.354
JOHN MULANEY: In 10 years,
we've been able to lose money.

00:17:26.354 --> 00:17:28.179
NICK KROLL: And just
10 years later, we're

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:32.338
at a company that started after
us at some weird picnic table.

00:17:36.242 --> 00:17:37.950
JOHN MULANEY: Nick
and I have both gone--

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.366
NICK KROLL: Is this where you
guys save the money on the--

00:17:40.366 --> 00:17:41.680
[LAUGHING]

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.820
Is this what it is?

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.510
Micro-kitchens in every room?

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.012
But thanks so much
for having us.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.430
JOHN MULANEY: And we feel this
is-- and I'm not pandering.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.120
This is one of the best
search engines-- no, for real,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.660
I'm not kidding-- in
America, if not in the world.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.370
Honestly, a great search engine.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.670
NICK KROLL: It's a
great search engine.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.960
I mean, George and Gil
are Alta Vista heads,

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:20.830
but-- And we're Bing boys until
the day we die, obviously.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.900
JOHN MULANEY: Obviously.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.450
NICK KROLL: Obviously Bing boys.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.870
SPEAKER: The original question--

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.960
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.270
JOHN MULANEY: OK, so
Nick and I would often

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.710
go work on separate
things, but I'd

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.860
say this laid dormant maybe
for no more than a year

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.622
or so when Kroll
Show started up.

00:18:35.622 --> 00:18:37.830
NICK KROLL: It was probably
longer than that, though,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.350
because I moved to LA and
you started working on "SNL."

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.420
And we sort of put
the guys-- there

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.330
wasn't a real venue for them.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.050
And then when I started
doing Kroll Show,

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.980
I was like, we should
do Gil and George.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.870
And we tried a few
different formats of it.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.650
Some were like little
Woody Allen filmic pieces,

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.270
and then also a
prank show that they

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.400
made called "Too Much Tuna,"
which was like their Manhattan

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.960
public access show where
they pranked people

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.450
with too much tuna
fish-- which still

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.652
doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:13.725
JOHN MULANEY: What do you mean?

00:19:13.725 --> 00:19:14.850
How does it not make sense?

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:15.560
NICK KROLL: I mean--

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.200
SPEAKER: There's
always too much tuna.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.460
JOHN MULANEY: But it's funny
to put it in front of you.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.610
Imagine.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.340
I mean, imagine
someone put a huge tuna

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.020
sandwich in front of you and
acted like you ordered it.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.000
It's a funny thing to do.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.250
NICK KROLL: Tuna's very funny.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.070
JOHN MULANEY: It's really funny.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.400
Tuna fish salad, by the
way, is what we mean--

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.000
NICK KROLL: With mayonnaise.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.600
JOHN MULANEY: Short-hand
tuna, but please know

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.830
we're talking about tuna salad.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.180
NICK KROLL: Yeah, so
we did it on Kroll Show

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.910
and it weirdly--
like, we were always

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.940
told this works in New York,
it won't work anywhere else.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.130
And then it weirdly took off and
became one of the more popular

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.410
things on the show.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.670
And we had 15-year-old girls in
Phoenix dressing up as George

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.230
and Gil for Halloween.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.544
So it was like, oh, this
is expanding beyond--

00:20:03.544 --> 00:20:05.210
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah,
it had a Slender Man

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.680
vibe, where people everywhere--

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.770
NICK KROLL: So then we
did an in conversation

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:26.160
at the 92nd Street Y, which
you can watch on YouTube.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.560
Yeah, YouTube.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.440
And that was to promote Kroll
Show season 3 and it was super

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.820
fun, and it was like 900
people and we improvised

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.540
for an hour-and-a-half
with Willie Geist.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.081
JOHN MULANEY: And
we hadn't done them

00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:41.149
in front of a live audience
since 2007, probably.

00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:43.190
NICK KROLL: Yeah, it had
been a really long time.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.330
And it was so fun.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.590
And afterwards people were
like, well, what's next?

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.477
And it was like, oh--

00:20:47.477 --> 00:20:49.060
JOHN MULANEY: "Oh,
Hello" on Broadway.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.894
NICK KROLL: Yeah, "Oh,
Hello" on Broadway--

00:20:50.894 --> 00:20:52.560
JOHN MULANEY: As a
joke, but then like--

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.090
NICK KROLL: So then
it was like, well,

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.173
let's just go to Broadway.

00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:02.476
And people were like, you
can't just go to Broadway.

00:21:02.476 --> 00:21:03.600
SPEAKER: Hey, I'm here now.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.935
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:21:04.935 --> 00:21:06.060
JOHN MULANEY: Knock, knock.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.380
NICK KROLL: So then we
set out to write a show.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.410
JOHN MULANEY: And
we booked a theatre.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.826
NICK KROLL: We booked a theatre,
we booked the Cherry Lane

00:21:13.826 --> 00:21:16.860
Theatre for end of November,
right after Thanksgiving.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.990
And so then we started
writing a show.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.420
And then at end of August,
beginning of September,

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.494
we started-- it's
so crazy to think.

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:29.660
JOHN MULANEY: It was really
dangerous how we did it.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.980
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.050
SPEAKER: This year?

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.300
NICK KROLL: Last year.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.160
So we booked the Cherry
Lane Theatre, let's start--

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.200
it was like, November 26.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:44.730
And so like September 1,
we had a 10-page outline

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.950
that we then would take
on-stage and improvise.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.532
And built the play that way,
writing it out that way.

00:21:50.532 --> 00:21:52.490
JOHN MULANEY: It was the
most, like, vaudeville

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.990
show of anything I've ever done,
where we had a trunk of bits

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.020
from 10 years.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.760
And we would sprinkle
them wherever,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.350
and then try different
threads to the show.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.140
And we arrived on
an early incarnation

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.670
of what we have now.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.030
NICK KROLL: And Alex
was kind enough to--

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.570
I had met Alex a
few years earlier,

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.900
and have been a big
fan of his work.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.700
And on a lark we
were like, Alex,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.420
would you be interested
in being involved

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.570
in this truly stupid thing?

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.510
And he was like, yeah,
that sounds great-- which

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.950
was kind of a shock.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.520
It was really a surprise to
us that he was interested.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.020
And so we would send him tapes
of what we were doing in LA,

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.270
and he could start to get
a sense of weighing in

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.020
and weigh in where he
could and wanted to.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.060
And then we had a
crash course at UCB

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.820
for three or four nights before
we went to the Cherry Lane.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.240
And then at three--
how long was our tech?

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.062
ALEX TIMBERS: It
was like, two days.

00:22:52.062 --> 00:22:53.520
SPEAKER: How long
is tech normally?

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.603
ALEX TIMBERS: Usually you
have a rehearsal process

00:22:55.603 --> 00:22:57.720
where you decide what the
blocking is going to be,

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.480
and then there's a
set and lighting.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.410
And I think the first
time we all got together

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.360
was the beginning
of tech, and we

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.190
were like, you could enter
through that door or that door.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.110
And you guys were like, we'll
enter through that door.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.720
And then the next night you
were in front of an audience.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.428
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.370
JOHN MULANEY: You kept telling
us, "Hey, this is great.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.540
By the way, this never happens."

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.410
And we were like, OK.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.890
NICK KROLL: So at
that point, Alex

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.310
started to get very involved and
brought in his team of lighting

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.830
and sound and music
and choreography,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.690
and all these people
who all of sudden

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.540
coalesced with us
in a very brief,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.570
fast run-- which we then honed
over that Cherry Lane run

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.840
about a year ago.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.530
And then we toured the show
this winter, like January

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.620
through March in
four or five cities.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.204
And then--

00:23:48.204 --> 00:23:49.870
JOHN MULANEY: And
that was kind of nice,

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.870
because the Cherry Lane
is on Commerce Street,

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.540
it's about 200 seats.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.060
We started going to places
in like, San Diego that

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.790
were much bigger venues.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.900
And we realized,
oh, George and Gil

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.290
feel comfortable anywhere
because they feel entitled

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.490
to everything everywhere.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.950
So they're fine
playing a big house,

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.300
they're comfortable
in that type of thing.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.694
And that was a nice build
towards Broadway, where you're

00:24:15.694 --> 00:24:17.360
like-- once they get
to Broadway they're

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.890
not going to be thrown
because they truly believe

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.570
they deserve to be there.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.424
NICK KROLL: And then we came
back to New York for rehearsal,

00:24:24.424 --> 00:24:25.840
and this was like,
oh, we actually

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.350
are now rehearsing
in this building

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.500
where "The Front
Page" is rehearsing

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.340
with John Goodman,
Nathan Lane, John

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.800
Slattery, this amazing cast.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.303
And also we were next to-- I'm
going to, I can only say it

00:24:37.303 --> 00:24:37.590
in English.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.010
ALEX TIMBERS: Go for it.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.135
SPEAKER: Say it in English.

00:24:39.135 --> 00:24:45.232
NICK KROLL: The Dangerous
Liaisons with Liev Schreiber.

00:24:45.232 --> 00:24:46.690
JOHN MULANEY: We
shared a bathroom.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.810
NICK KROLL: Yeah, we shared a
bathroom with Liev Schreiber.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.631
JOHN MULANEY: He didn't
know, but we did.

00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:55.380
SPEAKER: You were
watching the whole time.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.280
NICK KROLL: Yeah, and we're
in one room being like,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.830
"We need more tuna fish," and
he's in the other room like--

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.200
But it was fun, it was like
Broadway college it felt like.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.660
We were all rehearsing together.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.510
And then we started our work.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.968
JOHN MULANEY: And
Alex, by the way,

00:25:11.968 --> 00:25:15.310
assembled some of the-- both--
most talented and nicest,

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.200
most fun people to be around.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.280
I think you probably
have deliberately

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.794
picked amazing people your
whole career, because the people

00:25:22.794 --> 00:25:23.460
you brought in--

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.400
SPEAKER: I would hope so.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.900
JOHN MULANEY: Well,
sometimes you're

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.790
stuck with a bunch of jerks.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.980
But you had and have an
amazing group of people--

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.650
SPEAKER: Listen
Alex, your credits

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.230
include "Peter and
the Starcatcher"

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.400
and "Bloody Bloody Andrew
Jackson," some serious Broadway

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.540
things-- and then as Nick
said, this stupid project

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.100
that you've taken on.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.760
What made you want to
take it, and what's it

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.010
like working with these guys?

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.480
ALEX TIMBERS: Well,
I think what I

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.600
loved about it was
immediately I was fans

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.080
of these guys for a long time.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.990
And when I saw "Tommy" when I
was growing up, I was like wow,

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.630
theatre is not an elitist thing.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.880
Theatre can be in dialogue
with the mainstream.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.100
And it felt to me like
having alt comedy on Broadway

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.560
is a really exciting
opportunity.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.060
And you see it in
the audiences that

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.282
are coming to the show-- it's
way younger, way more diverse.

00:26:12.282 --> 00:26:14.490
And I think it's this sort
of thing where if you came

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.573
to Broadway and this was
your first Broadway show,

00:26:16.573 --> 00:26:19.130
you might be like, oh, there's
a place for me in theatre.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:24.090
Or theatre's a place I might
go back to see another show.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.810
And I think what's cool about
these guys is as they've

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.440
said about the team, the people
that are working on it are nice

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.090
but it all comes from
the top with these guys.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.631
These guys play
assholes, but they're

00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:34.980
really kind and collaborative.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.120
And so that's been
the whole experience.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.900
And along the way, we've brought
in some incredible people,

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.720
like multiple Tony
Award-winning set designers.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.860
The greatest puppet
designer in North America

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.370
has built an extraordinary
puppet effect

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.465
involving tuna fish.

00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:55.550
So it's just been a lot of
artistic firepower aimed

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.124
at total stupidity.

00:26:57.124 --> 00:26:57.790
NICK KROLL: Yes.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:58.581
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.690
Ad-Rock from The Beastie Boys
was a guest on "Too Much Tuna,"

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.110
and said I think my favorite
thing about the show ever.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.730
Afterwards he said, "What
I like about this is we

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.800
all have ideas that,
they're fucking stupid.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.070
Like, you know you have
ideas and you're like, oh,

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.585
that's so funny, but that's
too fucking stupid to do."

00:27:21.585 --> 00:27:27.300
He's like, "You guys,
you did that idea."

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.990
NICK KROLL: It was like,
the highest praise ever.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.950
Like, the dude who
made "Sabotage."

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.570
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.510
And Mike Birbiglia
also said, he's like,

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.140
"This is the most
expensive joke ever done."

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.270
He's like, "It's like you're
doing a show about the M&amp;M

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:47.860
Store, making fun of the M&amp;M
Store, inside the M&amp;M Store,

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.750
and you guys also love M&amp;Ms.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.887
SPEAKER: So, "Too Much
Tuna," that segment

00:27:53.887 --> 00:27:55.970
of the show every night,
for those who don't know,

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.967
you bring up a different,
well-known person,

00:27:57.967 --> 00:27:59.300
different celebrity every night.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.390
I was there on
Seth Meyers night.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.390
JOHN MULANEY: Oh, great.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.070
SPEAKER: Which was--
which very funny.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.570
Yeah.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.899
So how do you pick who comes
up on stage, and is it--

00:28:07.899 --> 00:28:09.940
and it's-- obviously is
it improv the whole time,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.602
or is it rough script?

00:28:11.602 --> 00:28:12.310
JOHN MULANEY: No.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.380
NICK KROLL: We have a whole,
through personal relationships

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.030
and otherwise, book all
different types of people.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.030
And our goal is to have not only
people like Seth Meyers, who

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.730
are friends of ours or
people in the comedy space,

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.920
but also people who
would either be in George

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.530
and Gil's world in real
life, like Robin Byrd.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.110
Who, for people who grew
up in New York and some

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.500
of the men are
quietly chuckling,

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.030
Robin Byrd hosted a
show on Channel 35,

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.010
Channel J, like a
public access show

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.360
that she would have
strippers and porn stars on,

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.780
but has been on
TV for since 1977.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.032
And it's like if you don't
know who Robin Byrd is,

00:28:52.032 --> 00:28:53.490
Google her and
you'll see something

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.130
that is so deeply and
specifically New York.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.950
And she was amazing.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.740
And she was just
like truly a joy.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.531
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:04.890
We want people that
are well known,

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:10.080
but we're also going for people
that would most kind of jibe

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.530
with Gil and George's
world, who they would

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.190
be most excited to talk to.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.730
We had Marcia Clark on
the show in Los Angeles.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.780
We've had Ira
Glass, Dick Cavett;

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.492
people they would
have a lot to say to.

00:29:21.492 --> 00:29:22.200
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.375
Like former police--

00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:24.750
ALEX TIMBERS:
Commissioner Kelly.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.750
NICK KROLL: Yeah, Police
Commissioner, Ray Kelly

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:27.620
did the show.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.410
Who was like a beat cop
on the Upper West Side,

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:31.460
as his first gig.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.299
And probably busted George and
Gil for smoking a roach outside

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:35.840
of a Zabar's.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.091
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:29:37.091 --> 00:29:38.855
We started to explain
the characters,

00:29:38.855 --> 00:29:40.360
and he went, oh,
I know these guys.

00:29:42.996 --> 00:29:44.370
NICK KROLL: And
then we also have

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.580
like, Alan Alda was our
opening night guest.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.750
And like our guys
again, it's like for us

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.990
to have the guy who when we
used to explain the show,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.300
we would be like they are
Upper West Side older guys,

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.790
they're obsessed with Alan Alda.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.940
And it kind of locks people
in, to know what kind of guy

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.230
we were talking about.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.980
So to have Alan
Alda as our guest,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.430
was like the culmination
of a crazy amount of just--

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.130
it was just this confluence
of things, and really amazing.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.840
And then he just hung out with
us backstage, and was amazing.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.480
And he had done plays
and we had photos of him

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.380
from the Shubert, or
the Shubert Archives.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.280
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah,
the Shubert Archives

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.210
are in the top floor of the
Lyceum Theater where we are.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.740
And so we had gone
through and seen

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.550
old playbills of early stuff he
was in, like "The Apple Tree,"

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.694
and it was just amazing.

00:30:28.694 --> 00:30:30.360
We got to talk to him
about all of that.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.359
NICK KROLL: And we
improvised with him on stage.

00:30:32.359 --> 00:30:34.220
People don't realize
that he was a trained

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.690
improviser at the
Compass Players,

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.130
which sort of
predated Second City.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.980
And so we improvised on
stage, the three of us.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.300
He was like, well improvisation
is about support, and whatever

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.300
the other person is saying
that you supported and move it

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:48.800
forward.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.440
Yes-and kind of thing.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.360
So we improvised.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.820
He was like, well, let's
improvise a scene together.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.620
And so I said, hey
Alan, let's kiss George.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.210
And he, without
missing a beat, goes,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:08.440
yes let's kiss George on
the ass, and you go first.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.240
And it was like a perfect
improvisation on his part.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.120
And it was amazing.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.160
It was truly like-- it was
kind of like, if the show would

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.410
close the next day, I would
have been like, we did it.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.660
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah, we did it.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.120
A 10-year insane journey ending
in a beautiful conversation

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.650
with Alan Alda.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.590
SPEAKER: So being in
the Lyceum theater,

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.900
a lot of the jokes
in the show revolve

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.340
around that actual space.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.190
Did you write it-- did you
write the jokes once you got

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.070
in there, or did you
specifically seek out

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.830
that show?

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.970
JOHN MULANEY: Wherever we've
been, Cherry Lane or on tour,

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.220
George and Gil are very aware
of the space they're in,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.469
and we always wanted to write
to the space we were in.

00:31:45.469 --> 00:31:48.372
And we were familiar
with some productions

00:31:48.372 --> 00:31:49.580
that have been at the Lyceum.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.230
Alex, obviously,
had seen a lot more.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:58.040
So we just started thinking
about how they're-- I mean we

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.410
also had Scott Pask, I guess.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.960
It started with that, our
amazing set designer putting

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.264
together a set cobbled together
from old Broadway sets.

00:32:05.264 --> 00:32:06.430
SPEAKER: Are they actually--

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.590
JOHN MULANEY: They're
stored from a warehouse--

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.798
NICK KROLL: Some of them are.

00:32:08.798 --> 00:32:11.774
The Steel Magnolias is an
actual piece of the set, or no?

00:32:11.774 --> 00:32:13.190
ALEX TIMBERS: I
am my own wife is.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.190
NICK KROLL: I am my own wife is.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.550
So--

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.860
JOHN MULANEY: Those
are the grandma--

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:16.720
NICK KROLL: We have
a bunch of stuff.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.928
And then there's pieces of
the set that we were like,

00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:20.150
you know what.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.240
I don't know if we're going to
use Ed Koch's grave, which was

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.540
originally part of the show.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:31.400
Which if you have
a second, go Bing.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.325
Oh, it's a fucking joy.

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:41.700
JOHN MULANEY: Go
Bing or go home.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.490
NICK KROLL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:54.530
But honestly go just
yourself Ed Koch's grave.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.257
It's so weird.

00:32:55.257 --> 00:32:57.090
JOHN MULANEY: Because
it's back in the show.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.589
And people always go, why did
you write all that weird stuff

00:32:59.589 --> 00:33:00.570
on Ed Koch's grave?

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.820
NICK KROLL: And it's like, no.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.400
That is Ed Koch's grave.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.850
It's got a Daniel
Pearl quote on it.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.070
Which-- is-- I'm like I don't
know-- I'm like, it's so funny,

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.520
you know that
beheaded journalist.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.570
But it also doesn't have
his born and death years.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.594
It has the years that he
was mayor of New York.

00:33:18.594 --> 00:33:19.260
SPEAKER: Oh wow.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.870
JOHN MULANEY: It says, Ed
Koch, like 1984 to 1989.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:23.830
NICK KROLL: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.240
It's mayor of New York.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.950
So anyway, there
stuff like that,

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.911
that Alex and Scott, our set
designer were smartly-- we

00:33:31.911 --> 00:33:33.160
were like, we don't need that.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.759
And they were like, no.

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:37.300
The real goal was like, if we're
going to do a Broadway show,

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.207
it's got to feel like
it belongs on Broadway.

00:33:39.207 --> 00:33:41.040
And so that's been,
again, one of the things

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.180
that Alex has done
beautifully, is maintaining

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.100
the like low shittiness
of George and Gil,

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.880
while also presenting
something that

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.220
feels like it should be
on Broadway that feels

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.034
like it has the scale to--

00:33:55.034 --> 00:33:56.325
JOHN MULANEY: Polished garbage.

00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:56.810
ALEX TIMBERS: That's right.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.490
How do you like-- how do you
balance a low-fi quality with

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.346
a couple of cours de theatres?

00:34:01.346 --> 00:34:02.720
That really would
surprise people

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.090
that Gil and George have that
kind of theatrical know-how.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.270
NICK KROLL: Yeah, they do.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.620
JOHN MULANEY: They're not here
to play games or make friends.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.422
SPEAKER: So, John, you're
still a writer on "SNL," right?

00:34:13.422 --> 00:34:14.130
JOHN MULANEY: No.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:14.280
SPEAKER: No?

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.779
JOHN MULANEY: I
left many years ago.

00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:19.814
SPEAKER: OK, well-- all right.

00:34:19.814 --> 00:34:20.730
JOHN MULANEY: But, no.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.080
I go back-- sorry.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.219
I go back occasionally.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.050
No one ever leaves.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.800
That you're right.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.719
No one ever leaves.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:26.803
You're always called back.

00:34:26.803 --> 00:34:28.093
SPEAKER: And an alcoholic, yes.

00:34:28.093 --> 00:34:28.909
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:32.449
SPEAKER: So you actually
created, you were a writer.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.949
You created the character
of Stefon with Bill Hader.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.710
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.679
SPEAKER: So do you
prefer now being

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.542
on stage in the spotlight,
or do you like the writing

00:34:42.542 --> 00:34:43.500
room a little bit more?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.960
JOHN MULANEY: I like playing
George St. Geegland more

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.230
than anything I've ever done.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:53.739
I love doing
stand-up second-most.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:55.050
I love writing.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:57.020
I don't just like
to be out there.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.660
I like to do specific things.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.520
I like to do stand-up,
and I like to play George.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.560
And as of now, that's about it.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.600
But, no.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.310
I wasn't always like,
oh, I want to go

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.290
do a worse version of Stefon.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:18.250
But with George St. Geegland,
it was like oh no, this is me.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.824
So it's kind of-- it's not
that jarring for me to do this.

00:35:22.824 --> 00:35:24.490
Because I've been
doing it for 10 years.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:28.350
If I was suddenly in like
"The Pajama Game" tomorrow,

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.450
that would be odd.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:34.250
And that reference
brings down the house.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.940
Yeah.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.700
But this, like stand-up,
feels very natural to me.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.010
SPEAKER: Hmm.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.520
JOHN MULANEY: Not satisfied.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.522
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:35:45.522 --> 00:35:47.230
JOHN MULANEY: No, I
really like-- I mean,

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:51.370
but with "SNL" and this I
was like, live-- hard jokes

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.760
in front of a live audience,
that's the best thing.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.080
I've really enjoyed
this Broadway experience

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.190
more than anything I've
ever done professionally.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.610
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.850
JOHN MULANEY: It's so fun.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.950
It's so bizarrely-- for
these two pieces of garbage,

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.380
it's so bizarrely glamorous.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.200
And it's like what I always
thought show-business was.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.700
I wanted to be
like Ricky Ricardo.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.440
I wanted to go do
my show at night,

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.460
and then come home and
just have my day free.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.300
NICK KROLL: Have your
wife like in blackface.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.760
JOHN MULANEY: Did
she do blackface?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.894
NICK KROLL: I would assume
at some point, right?

00:36:23.894 --> 00:36:25.560
JOHN MULANEY: That's
a major accusation.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.240
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.031
JOHN MULANEY: You could
be sued by Desi Lu.

00:36:28.031 --> 00:36:29.390
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.130
SPEAKER: So this is definitely
not one of the low points

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:32.792
of your career?

00:36:32.792 --> 00:36:33.500
JOHN MULANEY: No.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.050
This is-- I just
said, it's the best.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.281
It is the best ever, and
still a low point, yes.

00:36:42.281 --> 00:36:44.030
SPEAKER: Alex, do you
want your next thing

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.140
to be more of a
classic Broadway?

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.200
I mean what are you
working on now otherwise?

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.783
ALEX TIMBERS: The
next thing I'm doing

00:36:49.783 --> 00:36:52.991
is a show with David
Byrne about Joan of Arc.

00:36:52.991 --> 00:36:54.990
So it's like a rock musical
all the way through.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.365
NICK KROLL: So
nothing like this.

00:36:56.365 --> 00:37:00.060
SPEAKER: I'm hoping one of these
guys will play Joan of Arc.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.014
JOHN MULANEY:
Auditions are tomorrow.

00:37:02.014 --> 00:37:03.779
SPEAKER: John just
said he'd help out.

00:37:03.779 --> 00:37:05.820
And then, yeah, Nick, so
what are you working on?

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.040
Are you working on anything
else at the moment?

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.360
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:15.240
I'm doing an animated show
for Netflix about growing up,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.310
me and my friend Andrew Goldberg
from childhood, who ended up

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:20.730
a writer at Family Guy.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.560
It's about he and I
as 13-year-old boys,

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.480
going through puberty, or in my
case not going through puberty.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.770
And actually John voices
the role of Andrew.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:31.630
JOHN MULANEY: Yes.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.130
NICK KROLL: It's
called "Big Mouth."

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.550
It'll be out next year.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.250
And it's really fun and dirty.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.840
It's like perverted
"Wonder Years," basically.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.620
An animated--

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.080
JOHN MULANEY: But very sweet.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.400
NICK KROLL: Yeah, it's
got a real sweet--

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.608
JOHN MULANEY: They wrote an
extremely sweet show that

00:37:46.608 --> 00:37:48.780
also has things that
make my fucking jaw drop,

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.590
they're so dirty.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.760
NICK KROLL: And it's like me
and John, and Jason Mantzoukas,

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.240
and Jesse Klein, and Jenny
Slate, and Jordan Peele,

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.140
and Maya Rudolph,
and Fred Armisen.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.650
And it's a crazy,
crazy group of people

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:04.680
who are throughout the show.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.910
And then I have a
movie called, "Loving"

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.340
that's coming out
in a couple weeks,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.830
which is just like "Oh, Hello."

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.910
It's a historical drama about
Richard and Mildred Loving, who

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.660
were an interracial couple who
got arrested for being married

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.320
in Virginia in the
1950s, and then brought

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.860
their case to the Supreme
Court, overturning

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.599
the ban on interracial
marriage nationwide.

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:31.890
SPEAKER: Just like "Oh, Hello."

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.450
NICK KROLL: It's
a laugh a minute.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.300
JOHN MULANEY: Well, and
you play Gil Faizon.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.666
NICK KROLL: I play-- yeah.

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:40.322
That was the only way I'd do it.

00:38:40.322 --> 00:38:42.030
They were like, they're
interested in you

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.740
for this movie.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.860
And I was like, what am
I going to play in that?

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.825
They're like it's the ACLU
lawyer named Bernie Cohen.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.740
Yeah.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.610
I think I could-- I
could swing that one.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.220
But it's a really-- Jeff
Nichols directed it.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.170
It's a beautiful movie.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:03.790
So I encourage all
you guys to go see it.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.020
It's unlike most
historical dramas,

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.030
it's quite understated and
beautifully told and shot.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.842
It's a really cool movie.

00:39:10.842 --> 00:39:12.614
SPEAKER: Hmm.

00:39:12.614 --> 00:39:13.530
Well, we're going to--

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.670
NICK KROLL: Another Hmm.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.790
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:20.070
And I have my own Sully
coming out in 2018.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.860
But I would avoid, it sucks.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.110
I didn't do a good job.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.699
SPEAKER: Hmm.

00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:24.490
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.120
NICK KROLL: There it is.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.790
It's a new hum.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:26.999
I like the new hum there.

00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:27.790
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.240
SPEAKER: We're going to get
into audience questions.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.220
So if you have any questions,
please line up at the mics

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.470
here.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:34.840
And while people line up--

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.340
JOHN MULANEY: Wow, look at this.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.690
SPEAKER: I'm going to
pass out two white boards.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:40.680
And because I didn't have three,
someone will get a notepad.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.050
Who wants the notepad.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.590
JOHN MULANEY: I'll take it.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.381
SPEAKER: Very good.

00:39:42.381 --> 00:39:42.930
All right.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:43.260
All right.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.710
NICK KROLL: I do like
that our first question

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.230
is coming from someone with
headphones and takeout food.

00:39:50.257 --> 00:39:51.590
AUDIENCE: It's not takeout food.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.977
I actually brought you
guys tuna salad sandwiches.

00:39:53.977 --> 00:39:55.321
JOHN MULANEY: Oh, no!

00:39:55.321 --> 00:39:56.779
AUDIENCE: To make
you feel at home.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.070
NICK KROLL: Bring it up!

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.520
Bring it up!

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.815
JOHN MULANEY: Better be enough!

00:40:03.815 --> 00:40:06.090
NICK KROLL: Oh, thank you.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.780
This is the great joke, though.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.972
This is--

00:40:08.972 --> 00:40:10.055
AUDIENCE: Not enough tuna.

00:40:10.055 --> 00:40:11.888
NICK KROLL: This is
what we call anti-humor.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.340
It's a commentary on it.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.874
I would argue that this is
genuinely not nearly enough.

00:40:21.905 --> 00:40:24.280
JOHN MULANEY: You must have
confused us with the assholes

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.420
from Too Much Bread.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.310
Your question?

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.190
AUDIENCE: I do have a question.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:41.190
My question is, what is most
alike between you as actors

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.720
and you as your characters?

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.710
NICK KROLL: Well, in the
play, there's a couple things.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:51.180
One someone described it
to us as like, "Oh, Hello,"

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.040
is like you guys doing
who you really are inside.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.896
And that is like Nick is a
baby, and John is an asshole.

00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:01.510
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:03.010
NICK KROLL: So we
are playing some--

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:04.260
JOHN MULANEY: Deep down, yeah.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.610
NICK KROLL: Some inner Id.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.250
And then I think
it's like-- I mean,

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:11.470
I personally think we
are-- I don't know.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.410
I think our dear
friendship and love for one

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.390
another comes through in the
relationship of George and Gil.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:21.450
I think that these two guys
are-- that they're really dear,

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.902
dear lifelong friends.

00:41:22.902 --> 00:41:24.360
JOHN MULANEY: The
only thing that's

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.070
hard is that George
has to intimidate Gil.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:31.740
And I met Nick, and he was--
like he'll always be a senior.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.420
And I'll like-- I'll always
be intimidated by him.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.350
So that's kind of like
the one weird thing.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.830
NICK KROLL: Do 20
push-ups, jerk.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.203
JOHN MULANEY: All right.

00:41:39.203 --> 00:41:39.703
Fine.

00:41:39.703 --> 00:41:40.250
I'm a man.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.749
I'm a man.

00:41:40.749 --> 00:41:41.490
I'm a man.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:45.680
Come on.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.930
Get up to the microphone, you.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.180
SPEAKER: Hold on.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.280
I want to do a white
board question real quick.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.440
NICK KROLL: What is-- by
the way, what is this?

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:51.880
JOHN MULANEY:
Explain what that is.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.410
SPEAKER: Well, yes.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.660
JOHN MULANEY: Don't pretend
everyone knows your thing.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.520
SPEAKER: All right.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.630
Nobody knows my thing.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.560
I'm going to explain it.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.260
So I want you guys--
we're going to play

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.520
a little like version a Newlywed
Game with the three of you.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.160
JOHN MULANEY: Oh, great.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:03.500
SPEAKER: OK.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.650
So there's my explanation.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:05.977
JOHN MULANEY: Thank you.

00:42:05.977 --> 00:42:07.560
SPEAKER: But answer
as your character.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.430
Alex, you answer as you
would expect one of their--

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.740
ALEX TIMBERS: Oh as one of--

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.302
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:42:12.302 --> 00:42:13.010
ALEX TIMBERS: OK.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.340
SPEAKER: So, you still carry
a tin lunch box from the '80s

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.090
to work every day.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:18.120
Who's on your lunch box?

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.880
NICK KROLL: And it's-- sorry,
we're not guessing it about

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.406
the other person, it's
just about ourselves?

00:42:23.406 --> 00:42:24.780
SPEAKER: Actually,
yes, we should

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.988
guess about the other person.

00:42:25.988 --> 00:42:27.530
That would be the Newlywed Game.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.110
NICK KROLL: And
just to be clear,

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:33.160
I'm guessing what George
would have on his thing,

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.940
or what John would
have on his thing?

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.670
SPEAKER: What George would have.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.210
JOHN MULANEY: And I'm
guessing would Gil would have.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:37.300
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:37.775
JOHN MULANEY: And what's--

00:42:37.775 --> 00:42:38.710
ALEX TIMBERS: And I'm guessing--

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.085
SPEAKER: Just
either one of them.

00:42:40.085 --> 00:42:42.230
NICK KROLL: OK, great.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.960
ALEX TIMBERS: OK.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.293
SPEAKER: We will get imaginary--

00:42:44.293 --> 00:42:47.260
NICK KROLL: There's a reason
we wanted an explanation.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.150
OK, great.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:49.770
All right.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.472
What would George have on a--

00:42:53.472 --> 00:42:54.680
SPEAKER: You have 10 seconds.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.672
JOHN MULANEY: OK.

00:43:02.672 --> 00:43:03.630
SPEAKER: You all ready?

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:04.421
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:43:04.421 --> 00:43:08.100
SPEAKER: And 1, 2, 3, reveal.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.070
NICK KROLL: Cast of "Dynasty."

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.350
SPEAKER: The famous cartoon
character Michael Gross.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.680
JOHN MULANEY: Michael
Gross played the father

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.422
on "Family Ties."

00:43:17.422 --> 00:43:18.380
NICK KROLL: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.534
Yeah, he was great too.

00:43:19.534 --> 00:43:20.950
JOHN MULANEY: He
was a good actor.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:21.950
NICK KROLL: And he
is-- you're right.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.951
He is like a Gil and
George, like that liberal--

00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:25.241
JOHN MULANEY: Oh, very much so.

00:43:25.241 --> 00:43:27.460
NICK KROLL: He's like a
liberal-- that liberal hippy

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:28.210
'60s guy.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:31.170
JOHN MULANEY: He was also in
that play "Art," which I feel,

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.280
when it was in Chicago
he was in "Art."

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:37.610
and I feel like that was a
big watershed moment for Gil

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:38.110
and George.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:39.651
NICK KROLL: And
Bernie Goetz, I don't

00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:42.770
know if you young millennials
know who Bernie Goetz is.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.849
But he's a dear friend
of Gil and George.

00:43:44.849 --> 00:43:45.640
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.500
NICK KROLL: He's the guy who
shot four people on the subway.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.540
JOHN MULANEY: He was known for
like three days as the subway

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.240
vigilante, and then
he stepped forward.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.930
And they realized
he was just like a--

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:57.850
NICK KROLL: Turn
of the narrative.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:58.240
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:58.680
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.930
JOHN MULANEY: A weird racist
in a Members Only jacket.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.260
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.690
JOHN MULANEY: Allegedly.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:05.910
He's a litigious guy.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.890
SPEAKER: Question over here.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.590
I'm wondering if
you think YouTube

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:13.300
has been an overall
benefit to or detriment

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.695
to comedy and theater.

00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:16.531
NICK KROLL: Ooh.

00:44:16.531 --> 00:44:17.030
Oh.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.120
In the belly of the beast.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.590
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.840
It's been a benefit.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.090
It's been a benefit to comedy.

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:27.270
I think exposure is
always good for comedy.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:28.561
NICK KROLL: I think that, yeah.

00:44:28.561 --> 00:44:31.210
I think that YouTube,
and I would put podcasts

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.800
in a similar regard.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.920
And that woman just clapped
for the word podcast.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.167
That--

00:44:40.167 --> 00:44:41.500
SPEAKER: She's a podcast teamer.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.166
NICK KROLL: Yes.

00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:49.610
That's great, and
blogs-- I think

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:52.260
it's about the
democratization of comedy,

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.390
and content in general.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.410
And so I think there's
a great utility

00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:00.710
that all types of people could
have their sketches and videos

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.790
seen, and all types of stuff.

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:05.950
And it just allows
a lot more people

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:07.850
in a lot of different
places to see stuff.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:11.440
Whereas 10 years ago, when we
started doing our characters,

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.910
we were desperately trying
to get into the Aspen Comedy

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:14.710
Festival.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.845
Which was a Comedy Festival.

00:45:16.845 --> 00:45:19.220
That's where all the managers,
agents and industry people

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.500
would go to see your act.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.520
And if you had a
sketch show that's

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.210
where you could get a deal
to get to go do a show

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.120
or whatever.

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.860
With the advent of
YouTube and podcasts,

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:34.070
all of that ivory tower shit and
gatekeepers, became irrelevant.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.070
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.880
It really ended the
year we tried to get in.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.140
They said, it's
a young festival,

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.711
and you guys are
playing old men.

00:45:42.711 --> 00:45:44.950
We were like, peace.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:45.742
It ended that year.

00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:47.616
NICK KROLL: And that
was the last year of it.

00:45:47.616 --> 00:45:49.310
And so it really
felt like-- and I

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:51.950
think YouTube had a major--
and a lot of the other stuff--

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:55.690
I think it's amazing that
there are friends of ours who

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:59.440
are super talented people who
maybe not are household names,

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.640
can build a following on
YouTube or on podcasts,

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.516
and go and play really
great theaters and venues

00:46:07.516 --> 00:46:08.390
all over the country.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.880
Because they've been
able to build a fan base.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.882
JOHN MULANEY: What do
you think about-- so what

00:46:11.882 --> 00:46:12.810
do you think about theater?

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:13.990
ALEX TIMBERS: I think
it's a double-edged sword.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.370
Because I think for writers
and performers it's great.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.120
Because you get your material
out there in the same way

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.280
you guys are talking about.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.400
I think the thing that's tricky
for designers and directors

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.427
and choreographers,
is if you're doing

00:46:24.427 --> 00:46:26.760
a first-class production of--
say you're doing "Wicked,"

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.795
and someone films it.

00:46:27.795 --> 00:46:29.170
And then someone
else wants to do

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.970
"Wicked." you can steal
copyrightable material

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:32.610
from that.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.800
And so you see a lot
of replica productions

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.062
of professional productions
where normally you

00:46:38.062 --> 00:46:39.520
wouldn't be able
to go to a theater

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.700
and transcribe all the
blocking that they're doing.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.658
So that's kind of where
it becomes complicated.

00:46:43.658 --> 00:46:46.920
JOHN MULANEY: Is that--
blocking is like trademarks?

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.500
ALEX TIMBERS: Yeah, yeah,
yeah; like dance steps.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.530
SPEAKER: Because it's officially
part of the finalized show.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.405
JOHN MULANEY: It's like
writing or something.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:00.777
Isn't that fun to watch
someone learn something?

00:47:00.777 --> 00:47:01.735
What a wonderful world.

00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:05.070
SPEAKER: All right.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.530
Another white board
question here.

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.469
If you could pick
someone from history--

00:47:08.469 --> 00:47:10.260
NICK KROLL: How about
a white guy question?

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.190
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:12.270
Isn't it time?

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.149
NICK KROLL: Isn't it
time we had our chance?

00:47:14.149 --> 00:47:14.940
SPEAKER: All right.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.730
Here's a white guy,
white board question.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.880
JOHN MULANEY: Yes.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.490
SPEAKER: If you
could pick someone

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.620
from history
already dead, so you

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.540
have as a guest during "Too
Much Tuna," who would be?

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.810
NICK KROLL: And are we
still answering this for--

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:25.400
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:25.840
NICK KROLL: George.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.050
SPEAKER: Rules have not changed.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:28.140
JOHN MULANEY: There's only one--

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.562
NICK KROLL: Is there?

00:47:30.562 --> 00:47:32.770
SPEAKER: He just wrote down
a bunch of stick figures.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:33.653
NICK KROLL: Oh, man.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.970
OK.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:44.910
SPEAKER: All right.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.775
Show them.

00:47:47.775 --> 00:47:49.562
Hey!

00:47:49.562 --> 00:47:50.520
NICK KROLL: Boss Tweed.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.870
I like Boss Tweed.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.614
ALEX TIMBERS: He's
the original Ed Koch.

00:47:53.614 --> 00:47:55.280
JOHN MULANEY: He's
the original Ed Koch.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.650
There you go, yeah.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.622
NICK KROLL: That
Tammany Hall genius.

00:47:58.622 --> 00:48:00.830
JOHN MULANEY: And these guys
are the bosses of tweed.

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:01.538
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:48:01.538 --> 00:48:04.650
JOHN MULANEY: That's not funny.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:05.492
SPEAKER: A question?

00:48:05.492 --> 00:48:05.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.130
Thanks so much for coming out.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:09.280
I saw the show a few
weeks ago, very funny.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.540
There was a lot of very
specific references.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.834
It's sort of like a
satire on theater.

00:48:13.834 --> 00:48:16.557
Also just caught up on season
two of "Documentary Now,"

00:48:16.557 --> 00:48:18.140
which John, I know
you wrote on, which

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:21.620
I've heard described as a loving
parody or like a loving satire.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.785
Which I think also kind
of fits with "Oh, Hello."

00:48:23.785 --> 00:48:25.410
And I kind of wonder
what your approach

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.610
is to do a parody or
a satire, but that's

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:30.675
also very loving and
not in a mean spirit.

00:48:30.675 --> 00:48:33.120
JOHN MULANEY: I never think
of when people are like,

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.860
oh, with "Documentary Now,"
or "Saturday Night Live,"

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.210
I'm sure with "Kroll Show,"
and "Oh, Hello," people

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.670
are like, oh, so you guys
are taking down blank.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.970
And I'm always like,
no, not at all.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:49.510
We can parody or name
check or reference things

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.570
that I'm just
like, no we're just

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:54.290
saying them and emulating
them in a funny way.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.950
But I have very--
I mean sometimes we

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.400
were just like on
"SNL" sometimes we're

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.170
just making fun of something.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.970
But for a lot of
stuff I've done,

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.250
like we did this whole
Spalding Gray episode.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.747
And people were like, oh you're
taking down Spalding Gray.

00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:10.580
And it was like, no.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.570
I'm the biggest Spalding
Gray fan in the world.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.970
It was so fun to
get to do an insane

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.870
version of that type of thing.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:17.490
Right?

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:22.950
So I think with "Oh, Hello,"
again, we're in the M&amp;M store,

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.120
making fun of the M&amp;M store.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.160
But we love M&amp;Ms.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.310
NICK KROLL: But also just to
be clear, regular M&amp;Ms suck.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:29.330
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.570
NICK KROLL: The peanut M&amp;Ms are
the only M&amp;M's worth having.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.830
JOHN MULANEY: Which I
didn't have till I was 30.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:34.520
NICK KROLL: Peanut M&amp;Ms?

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.240
JOHN MULANEY: I never had them.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.246
NICK KROLL: Oh, John.

00:49:36.246 --> 00:49:37.760
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.260
Yeah.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.800
I mean, like we say in the
show or have said in the past,

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.280
it's a love letter to
Broadway, but or more

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.210
realistically a
stalkers note written

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.320
in lipstick on a mirror.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.120
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.642
We're like guys who are too
in love with certain things.

00:49:51.642 --> 00:49:53.850
So when it comes out of our
mouth, you're like, easy.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.530
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.560
And again, it's like bringing
in Alex and his team of people,

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.304
I'm like we love
theater and plays.

00:50:01.304 --> 00:50:02.720
But also there are
things about it

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.320
that drive us crazy about it.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.980
And there is a way, I
think, to celebrate it

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.640
without mocking it and
being inclusive of it.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.470
And that I think that's
the goal is to make stuff--

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.750
JOHN MULANEY: We have a lot
of jokes about Steely Dan.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.402
And I see them every year
at the Beacon Theater.

00:50:19.402 --> 00:50:20.110
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:21.484
JOHN MULANEY:
Like, so everything

00:50:21.484 --> 00:50:24.300
is kind of kidding
and deadly serious.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.560
SPEAKER: Hmm.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.060
All right.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.100
White board question.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.860
If we were to look at Gil
and George's Google search

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.360
history--

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.151
JOHN MULANEY: Sure.

00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:37.600
SPEAKER: What would be the
most frequently recurring term?

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.260
Ready?

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.051
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:48.924
ALEX TIMBERS: Oh god, I'm
bowing out of this one.

00:50:48.924 --> 00:50:49.715
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah!

00:50:54.242 --> 00:50:55.700
NICK KROLL: The
only difference is,

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.050
and this is the difference
between George and John

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:00.673
and Nick and Gil, is
that his are in quotes.

00:51:00.673 --> 00:51:02.600
JOHN MULANEY: Oh, someone
knows how to search.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:08.530
SPEAKER: Yes, question.

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:09.362
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:09.362 --> 00:51:11.730
I want to learn to talk
like Gil and George.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.687
Is there a manual?

00:51:13.687 --> 00:51:16.020
NICK KROLL: We have a podcast
that we're doing about it.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.060
JOHN MULANEY: Pdcast.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.460
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.920
That's actually a good example.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.150
They wouldn't say podcast.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:23.190
They would say "pdcast."

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.717
It's the--

00:51:23.717 --> 00:51:25.300
JOHN MULANEY: Bury
the first syllable.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.950
NICK KROLL: Bury the first
syllable of everything,

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:28.835
but not like--

00:51:28.835 --> 00:51:29.960
JOHN MULANEY: "Jn" Stewart.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.090
NICK KROLL: "Jn"
Stewart, "lmp" shade.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:32.980
There's that.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:36.380
JOHN MULANEY: Change o's to
soft u's whenever possible.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.350
NICK KROLL: And then also turn
anything like A-U into an A-R.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:45.303
So it's the "ardience."

00:51:45.303 --> 00:51:48.740
JOHN MULANEY: Add r's
wherever you want.

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:52.260
Bury the first
syllable, m space.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.650
But then also bury "dtcom"

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.470
NICK KROLL: Yeah,
m space "dtcom."

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:57.410
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.310
NICK KROLL: "Utube," "dtcom."

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.020
JOHN MULANEY: So I guess it's
on the one and the three.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:00.380
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:00.760
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.900
It's like German--

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.400
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.460
ALEX TIMBERS: Yeah.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.010
NICK KROLL: Like we-- we
didn't-- but we got a lot

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.165
of people saying like
Trump like in the--

00:52:10.165 --> 00:52:11.540
JOHN MULANEY: He
said, "sisfire."

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.920
NICK KROLL: He said, "sisfire."

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:18.500
JOHN MULANEY: There should
be an immediate "sisfire."

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.300
Oh, hello.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.692
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:52:20.692 --> 00:52:22.929
JOHN MULANEY: Oh, hello.

00:52:22.929 --> 00:52:24.720
NICK KROLL: How does
that-- does that help?

00:52:31.951 --> 00:52:32.450
SPEAKER: OK.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.329
White guy question.

00:52:33.329 --> 00:52:34.120
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:34.910
NICK KROLL: Nice.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.535
SPEAKER: If Gil and
George were running

00:52:36.535 --> 00:52:38.080
on the same ticket
for president,

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.290
what would the
campaign slogan be?

00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:45.410
NICK KROLL: You're
bowing out again?

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.130
SPEAKER: I would say oh, hello.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:50.920
What's that?

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.310
AUDIENCE: Can you read them out?

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:54.680
NICK KROLL: Oh, read them
out, read out once we've said?

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.080
The last one was feet.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.535
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:52:57.535 --> 00:52:59.420
Gil and George both liked feet.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.712
And before that they would
want to prank Ed Koch.

00:53:01.712 --> 00:53:02.420
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.540
JOHN MULANEY: Can
you read them out?

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:09.965
What's everyone laughing about?

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:17.725
NICK KROLL: OK.

00:53:17.725 --> 00:53:18.440
Ready?

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.970
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:21.591
All right this is their ticket.

00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:22.090
Yes.

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:23.590
SPEAKER: Yes, yes.

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:24.690
JOHN MULANEY: Oh my god.

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:25.190
Come on.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.450
NICK KROLL: Please!

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:31.470
JOHN MULANEY: Please!

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:33.870
Hey!

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.852
Or there's their
campaign to women.

00:53:35.852 --> 00:53:37.298
Why don't you smile more?

00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:38.262
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:53:38.262 --> 00:53:41.152
Very effective.

00:53:41.152 --> 00:53:42.586
JOHN MULANEY:
You're so beautiful.

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:43.542
NICK KROLL: Gorgeous.

00:53:43.542 --> 00:53:44.976
JOHN MULANEY:
You're so gorgeous.

00:53:44.976 --> 00:53:46.713
Why don't you smile more?

00:53:46.713 --> 00:53:50.170
Come ride the subway with me.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:50.990
Pocket.

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:52.950
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.440
Do you guys just
think this is so funny

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.250
that it's been the same
thing for 10 years,

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:58.420
or does it evolve at all?

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.950
Because I feel like--
I feel like if you've

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:03.575
been doing the same thing for
10 years, it's either like,

00:54:03.575 --> 00:54:04.810
you just fucking love it.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:06.935
And you think it's the
funniest thing in the world.

00:54:06.935 --> 00:54:10.868
Or it's like, I'm finding new
nuances to the characters?

00:54:10.868 --> 00:54:15.997
JOHN MULANEY: We--
that was like-- you

00:54:15.997 --> 00:54:17.536
seem like a
wonderful guy, but it

00:54:17.536 --> 00:54:20.560
had like slightly bully energy.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.944
Hey, do you guys just--
do you think it's funny?

00:54:23.944 --> 00:54:25.610
AUDIENCE: I was going
to raise the mic--

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:30.060
JOHN MULANEY: That you've
been doing this for 10 years.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.000
My answer is yes.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.792
That honestly made
me laugh a few times.

00:54:35.792 --> 00:54:36.750
NICK KROLL: That it's--

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.874
JOHN MULANEY: Just on stage,
I'll look over at you,

00:54:38.874 --> 00:54:42.052
and you're like--
and I'm like, my god.

00:54:42.052 --> 00:54:43.510
We've been doing
this for 10 years.

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:45.350
NICK KROLL: And
I-- but there are

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:47.610
jokes-- there are jokes
that are in there that we

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.680
have been doing for 10 years.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.460
And there's nothing
else that I would ever

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:55.460
do that-- I would never do
another-- I would never do

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.819
a stand-up joke for 10 years.

00:54:56.819 --> 00:54:59.110
There are jokes in there that
we've been doing forever.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.570
And then there's also
stuff that we are learning

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:07.060
every day about the guys.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.390
It was like-- I don't know if
it was in a rehearsal or the run

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:12.640
through when we first
got to the stage

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.290
that we realized that Gil's
father ratted out other Jews

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:19.405
during the Holocaust.

00:55:19.405 --> 00:55:21.280
JOHN MULANEY: That came
out during an improv.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:29.080
NICK KROLL: So it's fun,
light stuff like that.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.200
But it's like there's new--
you've got 70 years of stuff

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:33.870
to learn.

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.370
And so and that's really
been also the fun of theater.

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:43.260
Is when you make TV
or film, you write it.

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.710
You do your best to write it.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:45.850
And then shoot it, right.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:48.590
And then you edit it, and
hope you can figure it out.

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:51.100
With on stage, it's
the same thing.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.890
And then it's like
"Groundhog Day,"

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:57.162
where you just get to keep each
day learning more and more,

00:55:57.162 --> 00:55:59.120
and trying to get it more
and more interesting,

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.294
and figure out if you can make
Andie MacDowell interesting.

00:56:02.294 --> 00:56:04.210
ALEX TIMBERS: And you
guys have discussed also

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.880
continuing to do it, until you
actually become Gil and George.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.320
JOHN MULANEY: Yes.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.385
NICK KROLL: That is the goal is
to do Gil and George until we

00:56:09.385 --> 00:56:10.468
don't have to wear makeup.

00:56:10.468 --> 00:56:12.919
JOHN MULANEY: Until we go
like, this isn't funny.

00:56:12.919 --> 00:56:15.460
SPEAKER: You guys even-- you
put on liver spots on your hands

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:15.670
even.

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:16.336
NICK KROLL: Yes.

00:56:16.336 --> 00:56:17.210
JOHN MULANEY: Yes.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.490
My wife, who is our
amazing makeup artist,

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:21.180
really makes us pretty gross.

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.080
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.990
And every guest who
comes up on stage,

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:26.360
is like, what's wrong
with your hands?

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:31.120
JOHN MULANEY: Well John
Oliver, from "This Week Tonight

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.480
with John Oliver,"
he was on the show.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.080
And he was like, you don't
understand how ridiculous it is

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.600
to look you guys in the face.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.510
And at one point
during his interview,

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:43.730
I said, Gil you have a
question about Israel.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:45.580
And John Oliver
started laughing.

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.220
And he said, I knew
I was going to have

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.720
to turn and look at Gil.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.908
And that he would then
start talking about Israel.

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.880
But with how much
stuff now, people

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.480
want new content and
people like-- is stand-up,

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.470
so you burn your hour,
and never do it again,

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:06.740
and have an hour every year.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.600
It is so funny to do what is
truly like a vaudeville thing,

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.014
where like I'm like I've
said this joke 1,000 times.

00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:16.180
But tonight I'm going to
say it a little differently

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.250
to make myself laugh.

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:18.160
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.610
JOHN MULANEY: It's very weird.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:21.864
But it's sort of
reverse liberating.

00:57:21.864 --> 00:57:23.530
ALEX TIMBERS: And I
think your fans love

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:25.367
hearing some of the
same jokes, and actually

00:57:25.367 --> 00:57:26.200
giving them a laugh.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.390
NICK KROLL: It is like music.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.056
JOHN MULANEY: It's
like old school vibe.

00:57:29.056 --> 00:57:32.410
NICK KROLL: And I will
blame YouTube for this.

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:36.650
The only problem with it is
how hungry the internet is.

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:39.280
It's voracious in its appetite.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.990
And so you constantly,
as comedians,

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:46.010
feel like you have to constantly
be putting out new content.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.550
Where years ago, you
would just hone your act,

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:52.340
go make your show, and you'd
be able to-- or you'd go

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.250
tour it for 2-3 years,
and then put it out.

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:59.599
But it's such a hungry
beast that-- and that's one

00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:01.390
of the fun things about
doing live theater.

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.960
It's like, no.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:02.430
This is the show.

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:04.096
JOHN MULANEY: You've
got to come see it.

00:58:04.096 --> 00:58:06.870
NICK KROLL: You've got to come
see it and experience it live,

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:09.630
and for a very
unreasonable price.

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:12.407
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:58:12.407 --> 00:58:14.490
SPEAKER: Through which
googlers have the discount.

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.156
NICK KROLL: Yes,

00:58:15.156 --> 00:58:15.940
JOHN MULANEY: Yes.

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.320
NICK KROLL: Yeah, sure.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.730
JOHN MULANEY: What?

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.630
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.910
SPEAKER: Would you ever
consider the final performance

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:27.750
recording it, and putting
it up on the Netflix.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:31.720
NICK KROLL: Well, I think
our goal is to make something

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.650
for prosperity, I mean for
it live in some other format.

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:37.090
JOHN MULANEY: Some other way
beyond the Lincoln Center VHS

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:38.720
archives.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.180
NICK KROLL: But I
think it is, I mean

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:44.630
I think for sure like we've
worked really hard on it.

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:46.780
It would be great to
have it seen somewhere.

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.740
But there is something about
the live experience of it

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.270
that is, I think, unbeatable.

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:54.750
JOHN MULANEY: Do you like
watching shows on tape?

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:55.458
ALEX TIMBERS: No.

00:58:55.458 --> 00:58:56.779
It's terrible.

00:58:56.779 --> 00:58:57.570
JOHN MULANEY: Yeah.

00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:59.220
But like film versions?

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.210
ALEX TIMBERS: Yeah.

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:02.797
There aren't that many that are
great that you want to-- that

00:59:02.797 --> 00:59:03.180
you feel like--

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.440
JOHN MULANEY: It's
so hard, yeah.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.880
ALEX TIMBERS: Some day
you'll have the Oculus Rift,

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.490
and you'll be able to be
with Mandy Patinkin, right?

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:09.140
JOHN MULANEY: Right, on stage.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.250
ALEX TIMBERS: That's the goal.

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:11.083
JOHN MULANEY: Mandy.

00:59:11.083 --> 00:59:13.520
NICK KROLL: The goal is always
to be with Mandy Patinkin.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.280
But I want to be an Oculus
Rift, in an episode of "Chicago

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:18.450
Hope."

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:19.900
JOHN MULANEY: The real ER.

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:20.620
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.480
I mean you could have said, no.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.688
It wouldn't hurt my feelings.

00:59:22.688 --> 00:59:23.420
That's fine.

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:23.800
JOHN MULANEY: OK.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.130
NICK KROLL: OK.

00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:25.504
SPEAKER: Yeah,
one more question?

00:59:25.504 --> 00:59:28.450
AUDIENCE: Yes, John, so
you've done both stand-up

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:29.870
and also been a
writer for "SNL."

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.620
JOHN MULANEY: Yes.

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.620
AUDIENCE: What's your
process for coming up

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:37.746
with jokes, other than
observing old men at diners?

00:59:37.746 --> 00:59:40.120
JOHN MULANEY: So, I feel like
in the past couple of years

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.670
I've had to get
more disciplined.

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:46.690
I was lucky when I was
younger, in that I don't know.

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:50.009
I just could like-- I had more
free time, and less on my mind.

00:59:50.009 --> 00:59:52.300
And I would just kind of walk
around and think of bits.

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.790
And I was kind of lucky
with stand-up stuff.

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:57.190
A lot of early stuff
kind of came to me,

00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:59.720
like semi-fully formed.

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.900
Or I would just think about a
whole run, or a whole long joke

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.280
on a walk or something,
and then try it that night.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.500
And in general,
it's still a process

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.060
of trying stuff that night.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.540
And I have the benefit
with stand-up as does Nick,

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.100
that we can just go to a club
and work on stuff that night.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:22.612
But I have now had at the--
now at the end of my life,

01:00:22.612 --> 01:00:28.820
I've found-- like I just can't--
my brain is like preoccupied

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.570
with other things.

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.637
And I really need to
make time to go, OK.

01:00:31.637 --> 01:00:33.220
I'm going to the
Comedy Store tonight.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.820
I need to think of jokes.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.086
Now that has positives
and negatives about it.

01:00:38.086 --> 01:00:41.530
I miss the fertility of
like, I'm just this dude

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:42.320
walking around.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.920
But now with some
responsibilities, it's harder.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.280
And I need to make time for it.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.340
So I've had to carve out,
think about comedy time.

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.690
Whereas I used to have
zero life and no friends,

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:58.125
and thought about
comedy all the time.

01:00:58.125 --> 01:01:00.250
AUDIENCE: What is you,
carving out time, look like?

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:01.530
Are you sitting in the chair?

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:03.029
JOHN MULANEY: I'm
sitting at a desk,

01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:05.210
with a notebook and no computer.

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:09.540
And I try to do it-- I read
Philip Glass's autobiography.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.950
And he had these three-hour
horrible sessions where he just

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.370
would sit at the piano.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.610
And he was not
allowed to get up,

01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:18.600
like couldn't go-- you
can't go get a snack.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.540
You just have to
really sit there.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.979
And at the end of
the three hours,

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:23.270
you could have written nothing.

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:25.200
And then you get up,
and you're so happy.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.820
But you have to sit
there with nothing else.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.880
And I found that that does work.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.860
Because I almost-- I
hate writing so much.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:38.869
And I almost am like-- well,
I better entertain myself

01:01:38.869 --> 01:01:39.910
by thinking of something.

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:42.130
Because this is so boring.

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:44.000
So the displeasure
of my own company

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.160
outweighs my dislike of
the creative process.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.040
I hope that inspired
millions of children

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.200
that by 34, you'll
be brain dead.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.940
And you'll have
to force yourself

01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:00.350
to do the thing you love.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.630
NICK KROLL: As you watch
this on your computer,

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:04.630
instead of doing whatever
it is that you're that

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:05.360
supposed to be doing--

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.943
JOHN MULANEY: By God though, I
still love talking about comedy

01:02:07.943 --> 01:02:09.180
so much more than writing it.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.150
It's crazy.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:11.417
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:12.000
SPEAKER: Cool.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.400
Thank you.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:13.940
JOHN MULANEY: You're welcome.

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.300
SPEAKER: So before-- we're
almost out of time here.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.510
Before we go, I
wonder if you guys

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:21.710
would be nice to explain to us
how we make a one-sided phone

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.430
call, which was one of my
favorite bits of the show.

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.221
JOHN MULANEY: Oh, the
one-sided phone call.

01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:27.310
SPEAKER: You need a prop?

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.018
NICK KROLL: Sure.

01:02:28.018 --> 01:02:32.717
I have my phone, not that I
don't want to use your phone.

01:02:32.717 --> 01:02:34.550
JOHN MULANEY: Not that
you don't want Google

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.500
all over your phone.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.309
NICK KROLL: Yeah.

01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:39.600
JOHN MULANEY: But so, as
George St. Geegland would say,

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.520
the one-sided phone call,
is when a character makes

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.760
a telephone call, but they do
it in a very stagey way, where

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.460
they repeat the phone
call information out loud

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.570
to everyone else on stage.

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:52.750
So Gil will now show us
a one-sided phone call.

01:02:55.124 --> 01:02:56.040
NICK KROLL: Oh, hello.

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:02.330
Sergey Brin?

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.535
That's who you are.

01:03:05.535 --> 01:03:06.920
Uh, huh.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.190
You love "Too Much Tuna?"

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:10.960
You love this GoogleTalks?

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.500
You want to give us a project X?

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.930
You're going to check out
our blood sugar by putting

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.500
a fucking contact in our eye?

01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:34.310
And pay us enough money
to get a micro kitchen?

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:34.810
All right.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.140
Well, we'll do it.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:45.700
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.540

People like to line up
and buy physical tickets.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.370

SPEAKER: Because--

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.040
