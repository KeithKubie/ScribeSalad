Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. C. H. N. P. R. All right. K. Yup. I want to start with a parental daydream for a second. It's an idea that's been kicking around for me since my kids were born. Okay. Actually the idea itself is pretty old. It goes back to the 18 hundreds, right around Napoleon's time to a fellow by the name of John Baptist, Pierre Antwan, Monisha Bulgaria, the Lamar Lamarck Jean-Baptiste Lamarck who according to writer, same keen. He was really, uh, one of the first grand theorists in biology. He actually coined the word biology to really? Yup. His big idea, as you might know, is that what a person does in their lifetime could be directly passed to their kids very easily. His famous example was giraffes. Lamarck said, do you want to know how a giraffe got his long neck one day? This giraffe mother draft, let's say he was looking up into tree and saw some fruit and had to stretch her neck and stretch again, whole lifetime stretching.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       And then when she had a baby stretching, got into the baby and then that baby would stretch and stretch and stretch and him give a little more stretching to its baby and eventually over the millennia, what you'd get is a creature with a very long neck because they're reaching for the tops of trees. It makes a kind of common sense really. It does and it does make kind of a folk sense. He thought it worked with humans to his example with humans was a blacksmith. He thought that because they're swinging hammers all day, they got big bulky muscles and then they would pass the muscles to their children. The sneaky idea here is that the blacksmiths, the giraffes, they made it happen. They will the neck to get longer, the muscles to get bigger, and the key point is that it wasn't something in born in them. It was something they acquire during their lifetime, which they passed to their kids. Right, and that's wrong. That's not how it works. We're telling you now know that that's not the case, but, but it'd be nice

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       if that's how it worked. Let's, let's read the book first because you know, now that I've got these two kids right now, I'll find myself thinking like, okay, I know these kids have their jeans half for me, half for my wife, and I know I can't change those genes. I know fate is going to give them a couple of random mutations in those genes that I have no control over that. It's just the cold logic of Darwinian evolution. What's offensive? I mean the idea that they could be constrained by their DNA, maybe one of us gave them a bit of DNA that's going to hold them back. It's a terrible thoughts. This letter right here. How about this one? And so what you do, I think all parents do this, is that you slip into this Lamarckian delusion that knows what you do with your kids could somehow rewrite all that that you can somehow by just being nice them reading them stories or whatever, that you could break

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       them free of all that. Rewrite their, their, their blueprint. Like, I dunno, you don't really say it to yourself that way, but yeah, you can make a deep difference. Yeah. Like you can help them overcome you. Is that cool? Hello? No, you can't. I know. That's what Darwin says. You can't, I know, I know.

Speaker 3:          00:03:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       once they're born, their genes are fixed and change does not happen in a generation or two. It happens in really, really, really slowly. Gradually. Achingly slowly one parents stretching isn't going to do anything. See that's the bummer of Darwinian evolution. As a parent, you are a tiny blip and a very, very long story.

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       but this hour we're gonna fight this sort of sad sack feeling of inevitability and impotence and rewrite the so-called rules of genetics. That's right. Today on radio lab, we are going to lick some rat, starve some Swedes there. Realized some women. I mean we're not going to do that ourselves. No, but we're going to play the stories where these things actually happen. Yes. I'm Chad. I Rod, I'm Robert Krulwich this is Radiolab. Stick around. It's gonna get messy.

Speaker 3:          00:04:26       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       okay, so let's get going. Uh, and stick with your boy to the mark just for a second. Okay. Cause we were talking to science right across Zimmer and he told us that back in the early 19 hundreds, this, um, tension between the mark and Darwin got extra tense. Yeah. In a sort of fascinating way. Right. And it all started in Vienna

Speaker 4:          00:04:46       at this really marvelous place called the vie varium. [inaudible] yeah, this was a really radical place at the time because you have to remember that people studying animals up til now, they were basically, you know, studying a preserved specimen and so on at the Vive varium as the name suggests, they have

Speaker 5:          00:05:07       man, it was like a zoo. Well it was a zoo where there was all sorts of experiments going on,

Speaker 4:          00:05:14       you know, the fact is that taking care of animals, trying to keep them alive in a building is not an easy thing, especially if it's 1903.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       But Luckily for the vive and for our story, they had a guy,

Speaker 4:          00:05:29       Paul Kammerer, who was he? Um, so he, and when was he? He was born in 1880 in Vienna, Jewish family, by all accounts. A pretty good looking guy in, in pictures. He has that, you know that crazy Einstein fuzzy hair thing. Virginia's cut. Yep. He's 22, 23 and you already had this reputation for being amazing at keeping animals alive that otherwise would just die.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       His reputation was, did he could get inside the mind of say a salamander. I know just

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       what it wanted to eat or how much humidity it preferred. Right. He was a born nurturer and he adored animals. He actually named his daughter, uh, less Serta, which is a genus of Lizard. That's the Kinda guy he is. So of course the folks at the varium asked him to build these terrariums and aquariums and stock them with animals, including a particular in fib Ian, that plays a very big part in this story.

Speaker 6:          00:06:24       The midwife towed the midwife towed, right? That's right. You're Sam Kean again. And here's, he says what you need to know about the midwife tote. Basically the midwife toad has a strange habit for toads. Most toads, he says, love to stay in the water. They like to hang out in the water and the females like to lay eggs in the water. But with the midwife toad, the female lays her eggs on land and then the male midwife toad comes along, grabs the eggs and actually kind of sticks them to his back legs, like a bunch of whitish grapes and then hops around with them basically until they hatch. So he's got to live his life as a towed with all this baggage on him

Speaker 4:          00:07:04       just until they hatch and then til they go off still it's a burden if he's carrying a big burden there. Is your wife going to hear this? She cares your kids for nine months and you're like that par mail toad. Anyhow, so you've got this Guy Paul Camera, who's good with animals. You've got these toads who hate water and in one day we can imagine he gets curious as he's doing his rounds, he stops by the midwife toads where, and he looks down at that little mail towed with a grape stuck to his legs and he wonders how adaptable is that little guy. I mean, he hates water. Females seem to hate laying eggs in the water, but is that the end of the story? What would happen if I made them go in the water? Could they adapt? I know what I'll do. I'm going to set up a terrarium for them and I'm going to make it hot,

Speaker 6:          00:07:51       really uncomfortably hot,

Speaker 6:          00:07:54       but I'm going to give them a base and a water. Nice, cool water, and he would basically turn the heat way, way up in music aquariums until they had to go under water. You can imagine these tilts are like, dammit, fine. All right, I'll get in the water. Maybe they'd try and jump back out, but it was still hot so they'd have to jump back in and sit. The camera kept the heat up. Toads basically had to stay there in this watery place that they had not evolved for. Darwin's theory would have said, you know, 90% of the toads are going to die. There's going to be this massacre of toads and only a few lucky ones are going to survive. And those lucky ones, according to Darwin's theory, they would've had to have been born with some random mutation in their genes that gave them an advantage in this situation

Speaker 4:          00:08:42       and that advantage, whatever it was, because it starts with one individual and then it gets passed onto the kids and then onto their kids. It would take a long,

Speaker 6:          00:08:52       a long, long time to spread through the whole

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       population because generally that's how evolution works. It takes awhile. But according to camera, here's what happened. When he heat it up, the toads little cage that hit spend more time in the water as expected. And when it came time to mate, the males and the females, they would meet in the water and at first didn't go so well because you know if you're Atlanto and you trying to have sex in the water, it's kind of hard. Your slippery partner's slippery. You just have it evolved for this and there's no way you can, at least not quickly, but according to camera, shortly after these toads got into the water, they did begin to evolve fast. They began to grow these little puffy things on their hands, the these kind of rough scratchy pads, what's known as a nuptual pad, nuptial path, right. It was just what the males needed so they can grab onto the female and hold tight while they're mating.

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       And they didn't have these on land? No, they did not have them on land. They just appeared in the water. Yup. And how long did it take right away, Willie? In just two generations. These toads seem to have done something that should have taken, I dunno, 50 a hundred generations maybe more camera thought. Wow. They can respond to the environment. Do we revealing it with experiments? They're not trapped by their genes. Around 1908 he starts publishing all of these results and it's big news and he grabbed his toads and he hit the road. He hit the lecture circuit and he hit it big. He was known for going around and giving what he called his big show lectures where he would wow whole audiences of people. And in 1923 he actually comes to England. There was a newspaper called the daily express, and they have these headlines that come out.

Speaker 4:          00:10:40       It says race of Superman. That's the headline for his doc race. And below that, right below the headline it says, scientists, great discovery, which made change as all what's he talking about? I said, we're just talking about a tote. I thought, it's not just talking about toads anymore. He's gone way beyond toads key extended this idea to people. He thought that you could kind of engineer societies by changing the environment. I just have to read this to you. The results make it probable that our descendants will learn more quickly. What we know well, we'll execute more easily what we have accomplished with great effort, we'll be able to withstand what injured does almost to the point of death where we sought. They will find where we began. They will account and this idea won him a lot of fans, including not surprisingly the Soviets. Yeah, it was a very attractive theory to them in Moscow because the Soviets, they believed in Karl Marx's idea that human beings are an improvable species. That if you can change the conditions around people, you change the people. Your camera was saying, you know, you can do this even on a physical,

Speaker 7:          00:11:44       but

Speaker 4:          00:11:46       you know, there are a lot of skeptics and there were from the beginning when Cameron published his results initially a bunch of immediately began

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       to say, wait a minute, hold on here. It'd be nice if life was like that. But life isn't like that. Life is hard. People can't just will themselves into a more perfect form according to Darwin, life and changes are ruled by chance and fate and to believe anything else that's naive. So this whole toad thing to the Darwinian faction, it didn't scan really. So some scientists began to ask camera if they could look at his totes and just take a little peak for themselves and every time Canberra or said, no, they were his specimen, get your own. It was kind of this struggle for a few years. Then world war one came and that kind of disrupted everything. Camera for one was sent off to work as a sensor for the Austrian military and his lab ended up getting destroyed, including all his toads, except he had one,

Speaker 8:          00:12:43       one,

Speaker 6:          00:12:44       he had one remaining midwife

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       towed to this whole debate, two totally different ways of seeing life. It all came down to this jar with his towed in it and you have to bear in mind that at this point it only had one hand left the right and had been cut off for, for microscopic slides. And so you could only see one nuptial pad and it all comes down to this and all of it was just about to fall apart. What happened? Well there was a,

Speaker 6:          00:13:19       a uh, expert on reptiles named g Kingsley Noble Gladwin Kingsley Noble [inaudible] sounds like trouble. And he was for camera. He was mighty skeptical. So he, uh, he actually went to Vienna, visited cameras lab when camera wasn't there and he makes a very careful study of this hand. Andy, when he examined it, he noticed that there was a syringe hole there. And he says, this isn't a nuptial pad. It looks darkened, but that's just ink. What do you mean ink ink? Like the big no, like India ink. What? Yes, he doctored the toad. That was the implication except camera or tried to defend himself by saying, do you think I'm a dumb cop or an idiot? Because that's what I would have to be if I left a forgery with ink standing around openly in the laboratory where so many of my enemies would have entry. So how did he explain it? Well, he thought it might've been an assistant trying to frame him because he was Jewish and you know, there was kind of antisemitism growing at this time. So he thought that someone had framed him. And six weeks after a noble published his results in nature, camera rose sent a letter to Mascoutah turning down a job that they'd offered him because it would reflect badly on the Soviet. And then

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       following day camera puts on a suit and he walks off into the mountains outside Vienna on a rocky mountain trail, and he shoots himself. Chase Lamarckism

Speaker 4:          00:15:13       pretty much died there.

Speaker 3:          00:15:20       Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       so then over the next 70 some odd years, lamarck basically became the poster boy for like the big dumb idea. The idea that you want to believe in,

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       but that, you know, isn't true, but, but, but there's, but there's, there's like some hope here because, um, okay. All right. This is interesting. Then Carl told us about this research that showed that if, if a mother really couldn't quite remember the details, does what a mother, a mutual for Carl mouse or rat, I'm trying to remember. Was it rats or mice? No, it's rats. Rats, Yup. We ended up talking to the guy who did the work. Michael Meaney I think. Yep. I'm a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill McGill University in Montreal. So here's the backstory. About 30 years ago I was in undergraduate, Michael was in school and he got interested in a very, very basic question, but how things get passed down. Like, have you ever had one of those moments where you suddenly are your dad and it catches you off guard? Oh, of course. I mean it's pretty common.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       But like here's a, for instance, my dad from my entire life had this thing where if someone was whistling, he'd be so, he would like, they could be whistling six tables over to a restaurant and he would turn around and be like, stop that. Like it was like, it was scraping his very nerves and the other day someone was whistling and I was like, stop it. And it just hit me. I was like, Oh God, that was hit. It's never appeared until now. And you went to like weird. Did that come from, is that a genetic hatred of whistling that I just had or did I somehow learn that that in a sort of ass backward way, it was Michael's question, how does that happen? How do these simple little traits get passed forward?

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       So, so we started looking at maternal care. Many years later he, and this woman, Francis Champagne, who now works at Columbia University, they decided to explore this question looking at in rats. So we have our rats in the lab and they thought, let's just see if we can figure out how it is that rat mothers pass down their parenting skills. That's right. If you were a great rat, mommy, what would you be doing with your baby? You would be looking them quite a lot. Uh, that's what good rat mothers do. They look their babies a lot, but she says you can tell right away just by looking at some rat moms don't look their kids a lot. There's a normal distribution, right? You got your good parents and your bad parents would they decided to do first was to try to figure out which rat was which, which meant interestingly

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       counting all the licks, putting this into context, you know you have a rat mom and they have about 16 to 20 babies all at once at once and we're watching 40 litters at a time. How do you count those? That's 40. That's too hard. You have to look at one cage say, are they licking? Yes. No. Okay. Move on to the next cage. Yes, no, move on to the next cage. Yes. No. You have to do that for five hours a day for six consecutive days. Move on to the next cage. Yes. No, move on to the next cage. Yes. No.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       See, this is the story of science that that doesn't get told. Just mind crushing tedium. Yes. Yeah. The next day. Yes. No. Yeah. It drifts into something like a shopping channel. In any case, what they saw the end of all this counting was, well, first of all, what they saw was this pattern that rat pups who got licked a lot as babies when they grew up, they lick their babies a lot and the rat pups who didn't get licked a lot when they grew up, they didn't look their babies a lot. So the great rat nightmare comes true with the females become their mothers.

Speaker 9:          00:18:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       I think that makes a lot of sense actually. It's kind of obvious, right? Right. Yeah. I mean, we all kind of know this, that there are cycles of abuse or whatever. You know, like if you're abused as a kid, you were more likely to abuse your kid. It's still, you've got a wonder

Speaker 6:          00:19:08       why. Why would that happen? How do those cycles perpetuate? I mean like with the licking, is it a teaching thing

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       where you know, the babies become good mothers because they've learned it by watching their mothers, they've seen it and they've repeated the experience, or does it get passed on such a deep level that doesn't even require teaching? What do you mean? So that's the reason of course, that we work with rats because we can get inside the brain. So Michael and Francis looked inside the brains of these rats, and what they saw was that the rats had been licked a lot as babies. They had more stuff in their head. What do you mean? One more brains up more. What kind of stuff brings us more up? More of this particular kind of protein that activates maternal behavior. When rats have more of this protein, they will act more motherly. And they, they had more. So we'll think about what makes proteins DNA. Well, yes. Genes and DNA. Yeah. Don't you see some, how the mother's tongue is getting all the way down in there and going messing with the baby's DNA? Is that what you're saying? That the leaking is changing the baby's DNA. That's what I know. I'm quite saying that because you know that that's out. Again, that's the rule against the rules. You can't change your DNA. Yeah. You can't touch that. It's off limits. But that tone is doing something to the DNA.

Speaker 6:          00:20:25       So what is [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       the licking doing that, that's, that's our challenge. Do you have any theories for how this tongue is tickling the DNA or whatever it's doing? Um, well so then, so what Michael just launched into this thing. What happens when moms lick their pups is that the puppy comes aroused. The reason they're more aroused is that the mom's

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       licking activates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the pop. He says those two chemicals kick off certain hormonal systems and one of them is called the thyroid system. Irate hormones then get into the brain and they turn on certain neurochemical signals. And the neurochemical signal that gets activated during licking is Serotonin as in the mood chemical. Yup. So mom's looking activates serotonin and it's released onto brain cells in the hippocampus. You still with me? I think I'm with you started with the tongue four or five steps later. We are in brain cells, so almost instantaneously the mother's tongue has reached into the baby's brain cells. Now inside the cells in the center coiled up little spools is the DNA, so we're getting close to the moment of truth. It's there. It is. That's the stuff that makes you you, but that you supposedly can't get to. But here's what I did not know about DNA. According to Francis, it's not just sitting off. They're perfectly preserved. It's in the middle of the cell, it's crowded. You've got all these chemicals around racing by, you know, in the south and very often one of them will just go crashing into the DNA

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       and it'll stick there like a, like a barnacle or a glob of peanut butter. Exactly. Peanut butter. There we go. What will happen is it'll get stuck to one little part of the DNA and now that little bit of DNA is very difficult to get at. It's basically unusable because it's got the thing stuck to it. Yeah, and these things are called apparently methyl groups. Methyl groups are pretty sticky. They're hard to get off. So

Speaker 4:          00:22:32       imagine the DNA in that brain cell, all of these chemicals racing by crashing into it, sticking in. One of the bits that gets covered up is that little bit that makes the proteins that create a maternal instinct, the bit of DNA that we'll give this baby when it grows up instincts to be nice to its baby and lick them. And you're saying that part of the DNA is covered up? Yes. And when methyl groups stick to that part of the DNA, the maternal instinct is effectively turned off.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       But if you've got a mom who licks you,

Speaker 4:          00:23:02       mom's looking activates serotonin. Serotonin gets into the brain cells and according to Michael, unleashes a whole series of molecular events inside the cell. The critical part of this is it all these changes wake up, this little gang of proteins known as transcription factors. And if they see methyl groups sitting on that bit of DNA, they are pissed. And so they bring water friends to the party, they all go down to the DNA, surround that methyl and just knock it right off the DNA. That's it. And then they're going to basically revel at that particular spot. Turn on that gene. So now the genes can make the proteins that make the rats a good mom. Exactly. Exactly. That was awesome. Wow. That was amazing. Why? Why are you so thrilled? Well, think about it. This is nature and nurture slamming into each other. Like you know when people, smart people say, you know, there's no such thing as nature nutrients on the interaction with the team and you're like, what the hell does that mean?

Speaker 4:          00:24:04       Well, this is it. This is real physical chemical interaction between what's going on in the environment and what's going on with the DNA. Because you begin with a mothers lick that ends up with a deep, deep change in the baby, not just the good, warm, fuzzy feeling, but a fundamental shift in who that baby is and who that baby will be. You're now hearing the Mark's name invoked these days because there are things beyond genes that we pass down to our children. Now, according to Carl [inaudible], Jeez are still fixed. We can't rewrite our genes. That is impossible so far as we know. But there seems to be this layer on top of the genes, this second channel of heredity. If the genes are the bottom floor, then this layer on top is sometimes called the epigenome. And that thing can change based on your experiences, which when you think about it, it has a very lamarckian flavor.

Speaker 4:          00:24:59       Yeah. I think that's where La Mark's ideas can be woven in and make some sense. So do you call yourself a Lamarckian? Not usually because it upsets people. And I'm Canadian. I don't like to, plus, you know, the mark didn't get all the biological details right. Had no idea about DNA or very many of them right at all. But you know, his basic idea seems to be true. I mean, when you think of camera, there was a report in science, um, outlining a theory about how cameras, toads got these characteristics that invoked the, these epigenetic inheritance and, and imprinted genes. And it made it plausible. Oh, so redeeming him. Yeah. Maybe or maybe not.

Carrie Bronson did your Tyro gave her union and more. My pits are sweating. Just thinking about [inaudible] girl, come on over to two dope queens. Wherever you get your pocket Bon, I'll call me.

Speaker 1:          00:27:08       Yeah. And Go, Hey, I'm Jen. I boom, rod. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. And today it's inheritance today. Yeah. We're exploring questions of like, uh, what can you pass down to your kids in their kids? What can't you, how much of you will echo into the future and how much of you won't? And I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good about this show so far because well, if, uh, if, if a mother, a little rap mother licking her baby can have such a profound effect, basically change the expression of the genes in the baby. Well that's you. You'll think you can get deep down. Look, in the end, what do I know? I take it that we have more control over our destinies and our kids' destinies. And we would've thought, well, let's not get too excited too fast because, uh,

Speaker 12:         00:27:58       we own it. We have a story to tell. And this, this one, this tale leaves me a little queasy. Oh, there was a contact. Hello? Hello. Yup, it's me. Oh, this is Oola. Hi. We'll let you get in. I'm in public health,

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       the Karolinska Institute in Sweden where he studies population data,

Speaker 12:         00:28:16       looking for patterns in cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure and such. But the story he told us begins around 25 years ago, way up in northern Sweden that Sam keen again, he's the guy who told us about all his work in our little community called over Calix. What does it look like? Is it a big town? A little village? It's a small forest area. Very beautiful. But this was a really, really tough place to grow up. Very isolated and very cold. Are you near the Arctic circle or north of it? North of the Arctic Circle. Yeah. My home village grows 10 miles north of popular circles. Oh, so you grew up in uh, over Kaylin's. Yeah, we had uh, an expression here. Dig where you stand. And it just so happened

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       cause this town is a perfect place today.

Speaker 4:          00:29:09       Okay. I'm here. Fix Our keep at the kingdom archive because there is more data, more information about the people of overkill is going farther back into the past. And you could find almost anywhere else on earth. Yeah, we are really data rich. This is the era of colleagues. Yes. Church parish. Yes it is. Because here's the thing. The churches up and over Calix kept incredibly detailed records. We actually sent our friend pike off skeet to the archives in Stockholm to check it out. Vicky Easter Register.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       In those books you can meet everything about the citizens of over calyx going back hundreds of years. What's his name? You know their names? Yes, yes, yes. [inaudible] what year they're born? 1814 1881 she was born 1904 and this is everything happening in the family is in these books and they listen. Who was an idiot? He was an idiot. It's, sorry, what does that mean? He was an idiot, I guess. Yeah, he was, you know retarded, right? Yeah. ELN the at score that he was, he was miserable to look at. It's not very politically correct. In any case, these books tell you when each of these folks died, how they died from disease, from a pneumonia accident. She drowned. Oh my God. A lot of diagnosis actually. I mean influence cancer, heart disease, brain disease,

Speaker 4:          00:30:38       [inaudible]. The church is also kept track of the farmers, crows crops, lifestyle, how much they were growing each year, which turned out to be kind of an interesting thing to look at because at time the people in over calyx who were farming trying to make a living out of the soil, we have 'em how much they harvested. They would experience these wild changes from harvest to harvest. What you see in the records is that one year potatoes crops to do great a hundred liters. Wow. That's a lot of potatoes. A few years later there'd be a harsh winter and the crops failed and when the crops failed. Fabulous.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       Yeah, so sad. They basically start, I mean when you look at the records, you don't see huge spikes in mortality, so they didn't starve to death. They suddenly had to get [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:31:26       tiny fraction of the food that they were used to. It didn't have grains. I mean they didn't tell the partridge until they just had to hold on for the entire winter, but then a few years would pass. Craps would bounce back, but we have a lot more grain here and suddenly plenty of food. I could eat twice, three times as much then oh no. Total crop failure

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       fam. And again, these changes would just bounce back and forth, famine these salmon east again

Speaker 4:          00:32:02       and looking at these swings and Fortune Oola realized what he had here was a nice natural experiment because with all this data, he and his team could follow families forward in time through the generations. So if they saw somebody who was starving as a kid in 1820 they could then see, well, when those people had children and grandchildren, did anything change? Were there any consequences? They wanted to see basically the effects of starvation on multiple generations. What did you discover? Whether it was very interesting in

Speaker 12:         00:32:40       this gallery, that's a little odd actually. Here's what was a says. He, he found in the data, if you were a boy in overkill, it's between the ages of nine and 12 years old. So that's the window, nine to 12 year a boy, and then we have one of those terribly rough winters and you're eating much less than normal, assuming that you can survive the ordeal and you grow up and you have kids of your own. The data seems to say that your kids will benefit from your suffering. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:33:10       better if you have a starving daddy. It turns out that the baby actually gets some sort of health benefit really. And these effects in fact were so strong that you could trace it to the grandfather, the grandfather, two generations. It seemed to have been passed down from multiple generations.

Speaker 12:         00:33:29       You mean if you had a starving grandfather, you would be a healthier grant boy for the, because you had a starving grandfather,

Speaker 6:          00:33:37       you got a health boost. If you had a starving grandfather,

Speaker 12:         00:33:42       what sort of health boost? Well, um, we'll have told us, uh, take heart disease or disease. You said if you were a boy and you starve between the ages of nine and 12 and then you went on to become a father, then a grandfather, your grandkids, they were protected. Meaning that they had less incidents of heart disease, much less how much less, whether it's um, one fourth of them can receive one fourth. Let me say this again. If you're a starving boy between nine to 12 years old now, it doesn't matter a whole lot. What happens to you after this? Your grandchildren will have one quarter of the risk of heart disease. And if you were eating a whole lot between nine and 12, one quarter,

Speaker 6:          00:34:22       not only that, apparently those grandkids were less prone to diabetes. They lived longer lives. Something like 30 years on average.

Speaker 12:         00:34:31       This was a [inaudible] effect. Instead of dying at 40, I'd live to 70. That kind of 30 years. Yes, exactly. I just don't, I wonder, it's such a surprising result. I wonder how much you believe in it so that it's solely a, the mechanisms are not so clear, but the results are very clear. The results are obvious to you and there it is. The results are quite obvious. Just to be sure. We asked Francis Champagne, which she thinks of this data. I believe it. Oh you do? And I'm Michael Meaney as well. I think the Swedish data are, are really, really strong and very reliable. Everybody we talk to seems to think there's something really interesting going on here, but what exactly, maybe you can explain this to me, Robert. What exactly happens between nine to 12 that makes this big difference? Wow. So here's the thing. How old are your boys right now? Three and eight months. Okay, so here's what you're going to notice. Your boys will first grow taller and taller for the next few years, and when they get to be up about nine 10 years old, they're gonna stop growing just for a few years. This is what's called

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       the slow growth period.

Speaker 12:         00:35:41       Just for those years. That's nine 10 11 just before puberty, they won't grow much on the outside, but on the inside,

Speaker 13:         00:35:50       that is the time where the sperms probably developing

Speaker 6:          00:35:54       what's happening during this time is that you're setting aside the stock of cells that you're going to draw on in the future to make sperm cells.

Speaker 13:         00:36:04       So they are pre sperms.

Speaker 12:         00:36:07       So the thought is when those little boys in over cakes were really, really hungry, their hunger started a chemical process that reached all the way down to the DNA. Inside the boys' sperm.

Speaker 13:         00:36:22       Something happens on the molecular level. What exactly? Well, uh, the DNA, the RNA micro RNA is a histone.

Speaker 6:          00:36:32       Anyway, that's it that you're just renamed

Speaker 13:         00:36:34       methylations phosphorylation and so on that this just judo, that's all this is because we don't know

Speaker 12:         00:36:41       no precisely how this happens, but somehow the experience of starvation marks the DNA. Maybe like those methyl things we were telling you about with the rats. Yeah. Telling some genes to turn off now or the genes to turn on. And the incredible thing is

Speaker 6:          00:36:57       those marks stick around. This sperm carries these marks to the next generation and then the next one after that, right.

Speaker 14:         00:37:09       [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         00:37:09       so somehow by some kind of chemical mechanisms, starving grandpa back when he was about nine to 12 years old turned out to be a good thing. So it's like, um, GRANDPA's struggle is sort of jumping forward and giving me a leg up. Well, that's the good news. But unfortunately there's, um, there is some bad news here. Yeah. If your grandpa didn't starve, instead he lived through great times. He stuffed himself silly nine 10, 11 years old. So he's a happy grandpa. You the grandson, you then

Speaker 13:         00:37:41       would have high frequency. So heart attacks as to diabetes. It was uh, a fourfold risk

Speaker 12:         00:37:50       for four full 400% greater. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:37:54       Can I say this is spooky. This is spooky because it's like it does get, yeah. It's like what if GRANDPA has a bad day? Suddenly you're marked. Yeah. Frankly, this makes being nine, 10, 11, 12 like a rather crucial and at a time and you're not making the best decisions anyway cause grandpa's just nine. I should add to that. They have found very similar affects for smoking. For instance, if you start smoking when your, you know, 10, 11, something like that, you end up having children with more problems. I initially felt very hopeful and excited about this research because it seems to suggest that that w a body one body can respond to an environment and change and be flexible in a way we didn't think was possible. But this you're telling me about Sweden

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       feels very, um, grim in a certain way. You know, sometimes that your grandfather's suffering helps you, even if it helps. It's horrifying claim makes me claustrophobic. You feel kind of hemmed in by what your grandfather did? A little bit, I guess. I guess the way I would I would look at it is that, um, you can change your environment a lot more easily than you can change your genes.

Speaker 15:         00:39:02       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:39:02       I think is, what's weird here is that, is that we started trying to, to make a difference in our children and our surprise attack by our grand plan. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do though. When a meal gets to be eight, I'm cutting him off. He's not eating it at all. This may hurt you, my friend, but I'm doing it for my grandchildren.

Now the sweetened story from our last segment, leftists both fill a little strange. Yeah. Because while you might have a lot of influence, no genetically speaking over your kids and their kids, you don't seem to have a lot of control. Oh. So we're going to leave you with a story from our producer, Pat Walters, about one woman's radical, even troubling attempt to

Speaker 17:         00:41:34       regain that control. [inaudible] come on in again. Few months ago, pat made his way down to North Carolina to a small suburb outside of Charlotte to visit this family memos Dublin. I'd come to see, she and I snuck away from the children into our office. Right. This is nice and quiet. Um, well I guess, um, I was thinking we could just start at the beginning. What year was it? Where were you?

Speaker 18:         00:42:00       Okay. Um, 1989. So this is Barbara, Barbara Harris. I'm the founder and director of project prevention.

Speaker 17:         00:42:10       And in 1989 when the story we're telling now started, she was living in California in Orange County, and I was a waitress. I worked for I for over 30 years. And she was a mom to six sons. She and her husband really Harris. What'd he do for a living? Surgical technician, six boys. There's a lot of boys. But at that point, just two of the six boys were living at home, Brian and Rodney, and they were seven and eight at the time. And Barbara found herself returning to a thought she'd kind of always had. She started to wish again that she could have a daughter. Yeah. And by this point, she's 37 years old.

Speaker 18:         00:42:43       And I knew the only way I was gonna get a daughter was if I went and became a foster parent and asked for one

Speaker 15:         00:42:50       [inaudible].

Speaker 17:         00:42:50       So she did, she filled out the forms [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:42:53       through all the training that we had to do and first aid fingerprinted and had a background check done.

Speaker 15:         00:43:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         00:43:00       and then they waited for the call. I already knew that if I ever got a little girl, I was gonna name her destiny.

Speaker 15:         00:43:07       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:43:08       and um, that summer it was, um, July they got the call, I had asked for a newborn. So when the social worker called me, she said, I had this cute little baby girl for you, but she's eight months old. Is that too old? And I said, no, no, that's okay. She said, well, she's just beautiful. And she has lips that like a baby doll. That's what I remember her saying.

Speaker 17:         00:43:30       So Barbara and her son got in the car and drove across town to the foster home where destiny had been living for the past eight months since birth.

Speaker 18:         00:43:37       We went to the foster home and went in. The lady knew why we were there and destiny was in the other room. I'm sleeping or something, I'm not sure. So we talked to her for a little while and

Speaker 17:         00:43:47       there's a certain point, the social worker pulls out a stack of papers with a child. They give you a whole folder full of information. It tells you all about them. And she told Barbara, there's something you need to know about this baby. And she is born and tested positive for PCP, crack and heroin. And um, doctors would later explained to Barbara that Destiny's mom had been addicted to drugs while she was pregnant. And the psychologist who gave destiny, her first checkup told Barbara that she was delayed and she was always going to be delayed because of her prenatal neglect. Did that scare you at all as like, I mean that would seems like a thing that would be kind of frightening. No, it didn't scare me because she says as soon as she saw destiny

Speaker 19:         00:44:32       and sat her in my lap with her little dress on and her look curly hair, she just knew this is my daughter. A couple of days later I had already bonded with her so much. It was as if I gave birth to her. Honestly, I think it never seemed like she was anything but my real mom, if that makes sense.

Speaker 20:         00:44:51       This of course is destiny. She's 22 now and she never even met her birth mom. No, no. Barbara says they've reached out to her many times, but they never heard back and destiny says she doesn't really care. I mean at all.

Speaker 19:         00:45:06       I got these jeans from somewhere, but I kind of feel like she was a surrogate. Like she carried me for my real mom. That's how I've always looked at it. You know, my mom needed a girl and she got one. It's just, that's just how I've always, yeah,

Speaker 20:         00:45:24       and even though they look basically nothing alike. I mean, for one thing, Barbara's white and Destiny's black. They both say that they actually often forget that they're not biologically related. They told me a bunch of these stories. One of them involving, well,

Speaker 19:         00:45:40       yeah, so I don't have the biggest boobies in the world. You can't see that on the radio, but it's a fact of life.

Speaker 20:         00:45:48       And destiny says, one day she and her mom were in the car and her mom said,

Speaker 19:         00:45:52       she said, I don't know. You know, maybe. I mean, maybe they'll grow picker like mine, minor, bigger, and you know, and then she goes, oh wait, I didn't give birth to you. That doesn't matter. Nevermind. You're stuck with small boobies. Okay, now I just had to accept it,

Speaker 20:         00:46:09       but we're getting ahead of ourselves here because even that really sets the story in motion. The set of events happened a few months after Barbara had brought this to me when they got another call from the social worker saying that same mother, Destiny's birth mother had given birth to another child.

Speaker 18:         00:46:26       Yeah. The social work call and told me the mother had given birth birth. Mother's name was actually the same as me. So Barbara, really? Yeah, she has the same name as me, so I should tell me Barbara had had another baby and a boy did we want it.

Speaker 20:         00:46:42       So I went to the hospital and picked them up. And you picked him up right from the hospital? Yeah, and as soon as she got there to pick them up, she could tell that something was wrong. It wasn't little happy baby because when a woman uses heroin while she's pregnant, the fetus gets hooked on it to two fries. They're being born with like just being cut off and he was going through withdrawal.

Speaker 18:         00:47:03       Light bothered him, noise bothered him as a beat it out. This is Smitty again, projectile vomiting because he couldn't hold formula down. He'd fall asleep and just wake up screaming. And he was just Nyla, you know, most babies, Ocala peaceful. He was nowhere really peaceful. And Day after day, literally for months, Isaiah would sleep and he would scream. That was it. It was just, you know, should have to come into the world like that. And nobody has a right to do that to a baby.

Speaker 20:         00:47:34       But a year later, the social worker called again,

Speaker 18:         00:47:38       Sam, the mother had given birth to a baby girl. Did we want her, this is the same birth mother. Yeah. And again, Barbara, thanks. Come on. But this little girl is here. She should be with her brother and sister and so she should be with me. And I called my husband again at work and said, they want to know if we want to take the baby and he's a barber. I'm not buying a school best because we had already had to upgrade from a car to a van, from a condo to a home. And um, so I said, okay, well this will be the last one. We'll just get one more.

Speaker 20:         00:48:06       But a year later, no. She gets another call, another little boy. That's how we ended up with four of them. These are four kids from the same birth mother? Yeah. Wow. So by now

Speaker 19:         00:48:19       it's 1994 and Barbara is thinking, I just don't get it. You know, like how did this happen? How was this woman allowed to walk into the hospital and drop off a damaged baby and just walk away with no consequences over and over again? How dare you do this? The way she sought the state, the federal government, somebody should say, you're not doing this. You're not leaving this hospital unless you have longterm birth control. Barbara tried to get a law passed requiring just that, but it failed and when I found out the bill didn't pass, I just thought, I have to come up with something else. I have to be creative. And she says one day this idea just came to her. She was thinking, everybody's motivated by money.

Speaker 20:         00:48:57       So

Speaker 18:         00:48:58       can I offer these women money to use birth control?

Speaker 20:         00:49:02       Any other words? Could I pay women who have drug problems to stop having babies?

Speaker 18:         00:49:11       I decided to have a press conference in my front yard to announce what I was doing and my naive mind, I didn't have a clue what a big deal this was. The story exploded.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       Barbara Harris, his solution is simpler than anything else out there. Instantly she's offering $200 $100 200 bucks. It's 300 down to any drug addicted woman who will agree to have no more babies and I'm going to go out into the streets and offer addicted women money to use birth control. This could mean sterilization. It could mean getting an IUD

Speaker 17:         00:49:40       if she gives the woman a choice. If you've already had a kid, you can be sterilized and if you haven't, you can choose to have an IUD or an implant put in which will last for several years. Wait, and when you say they can choose to be sterilized, do you mean permanent? Yeah, permanent like tubes tied.

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       Wow. Sounds bizarre, but it's a solution here. It says her program, children requiring a caring community or crack crack can prevent thousands of unwanted births to drug addicted women. I'd like to everybody to meet please. Barbara Harris, please welcome Brian [inaudible].

Speaker 17:         00:50:11       As Barbara made the rounds on the daytime talk shows the reaction was split right down the middle and the one hand, she says immediately check started arriving

Speaker 18:         00:50:19       25. This is 50 from all over the country. This is 750 and it's 200 all over the political spectrum from Hollywood to social

Speaker 20:         00:50:28       conservatives

Speaker 17:         00:50:29       together pledge more than $150,000 to her

Speaker 20:         00:50:32       program. And that number, by the way, has grown a lot. That 1 million. Uh, yeah. Over the past five years. If you look at our tax return. Wow. But along with the support came attacks, particularly as drug addicted women began to sign up.

Speaker 17:         00:50:48       Barbara Harris says she's convinced more than a dozen women, 14 women, 25 women have accepted her offer to be sterilized in return for money.

Speaker 20:         00:50:55       Right away. People accused her of targeting women at their weakest moment and enabling their drug abuse.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       You know what they're going to go do with that money. You get them $200 each. I can spend on crack and that's their choice. But the babies don't have a choice.

Speaker 20:         00:51:08       Barbara started finding herself on panels with women who used drugs during their pregnancies and that's when things would start to get out of here.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       I feel that they should all be sterilized.

Speaker 21:         00:51:18       Sterilize, like you said, you were like your head when you ran your advice and like she is. I didn't say I'm glad she asked my opinion. Okay. This lady right here is, you know, taking drugs and try and be pregnant again.

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       First hear about this. What goes through your mind? I think I was really horrified and terrified. That's Lynn Paltrow. I'm executive director and founder of national advocates for pregnant women.

Speaker 20:         00:51:45       Lynn has become one of Barbara's fiercest critics and full disclosure, she's Robert Sisters. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       Well her, her explanation is that these women are having, in her terms, litters of damaged babies and society forever will be responsible for them. She said litters

Speaker 20:         00:52:03       in this magazine Article Barbara Even said, quote, we don't allow dogs to breed. We spay them, we neuter them.

Speaker 17:         00:52:10       I'm not saying that these women are dogs, but they're not acting anymore responsible than a dog in heat.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       Are there people whose drug use is so out of control, they can't parent. Yes, but creating an assumption that there is a class of people who don't deserve to procreate who aren't worthy. Appropriating the human race leads you down a path that is is we should have great concern about that path is basically called eugenics.

Speaker 17:         00:52:36       Well, I mean Hitler thought that if you were Jewish that you had given up the right to be mother and he sterilized people as well. Well, I just want to eliminate drug-addicted babies from being born. I mean, I don't think that puts me in the same category as Hitler. What's the worst thing you've been called by one of your critics? Probably Racist.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       I mean, I'm married to a black man, so that was just funny to me.

Speaker 20:         00:52:56       And according to Barbara, the majority of the women she pays are white. Do you think like, but ask Barbara about some of the things that she'd said because to be totally honest, they kind of turned my stomach. I like you. I get the sense that like you have, there's a lot of warmth in you. You're obviously a great mom, but that feels cold to me.

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       I was just pissed and what they'd done to my children. Now babies I had seen and all the people that have me and tell me about

Speaker 18:         00:53:25       their babies that were damaged. I had everybody's abuse on my back and I didn't care how he said it or how we did it. Just don't have any more children because at that point I didn't really know any of them so I didn't see them as people. I just saw them as child abusers might be a mixture, but she says she doesn't feel that way anymore. After I've gotten to know so many of the women. Barbara has this drawer in your desk and Ms. Harrison staff are filled with dozens of letters from women that she's paid. I want to thank you for your support and kindness as always. She said, thank you so much for the gift. I bought my son an excavator track, remote control and some summer outfits. This is from 2000 to whom it may concern. I have been doing very good. I just got custody of my eight year old son and I'm so proud and I have four years clean and I anyways, God bless you sincerely, Jennifer [inaudible],

Speaker 20:         00:54:23       have you ever had someone call or write you and say that they regret their decision? No, I've only had somebody call and say they regret that they didn't stay on birth control, which I find kind of hard to believe. But then again, I must've read at least a hundred news articles as I was reporting this story and I didn't find a single case of someone saying that they regretted what they'd done.

Speaker 22:         00:54:50       [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         00:54:50       how many women have you paid?

Speaker 22:         00:54:57       We have paid,

Speaker 17:         00:55:00       um, 4,000, 266. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. Yeah. She actually emailed me afterwards and adjusted that number down like a hundred. Um, and so in the end of, you know, where do you come down on this? I ended up finding myself really conflicted about it, but the, the, the like I agree with Lynn that this program does perpetuate a stereotype. Tell me what your image of a drug using pregnant woman is. Who are they? It will be wrong to assume the women Barbara talks about on TV and these women don't just have one and two babies. They have six, seven eight, 10 14. All these women who have so many babies and never try to seek drug treatment. It would be wrong to think that they represent all women who use drugs while they're pregnant. The women who I've worked with who've had a history of drug problems aren't like the examples that she gives. These are women who loved their children, who sought help and she says oftentimes the women who want help have a really hard time finding it. And Barbara's not offering that. She's not offering treatment. She's not offering counseling. And there are programs that do that.

Speaker 20:         00:56:04       But I said this to Linde Bite,

Speaker 17:         00:56:07       all the things that troubled me about Barbara's program, I feel like what she's trying to do is to stop it. To stop a kid from getting born into a childhood that's going to suck.

Speaker 18:         00:56:20       The fact that you're motivated by a really beautiful,

Speaker 17:         00:56:24       important, um, value that we want healthy kids doesn't mean the mechanism you're using is going to end up helping those kids. Because the truth is you have no idea how these kids are gonna turn out. Yeah. Like nobody's arguing that women should do drugs when they're pregnant. That is a bad way to start a kid's life. But that's just the beginning of the kid's life. So much can happen after that. Once you [inaudible] you and for me, this whole story really shifted or you and Jesse, when I started spending some time with destiny, Barbara, 22 year old daughter, you know, as you can see, I like to talk, even though Destiny's mom was doing all sorts of drugs during her pregnancy and the doctors told Barbara that destiny was going to be mentally and physically delayed, not feeling the way I'm supposed to, she just isn't. Could you just tell us like what you are doing now? You're finishing college, right? Yes.

Speaker 19:         00:57:21       I'm almost done. I'm graduating in December. It's exciting and right now I'm student teaching, so that's fun.

Speaker 17:         00:57:29       But the moment I really felt like, Whoa, was it when we started talking about the little baby that we keep hearing in the background. Okay. Everything.

Speaker 19:         00:57:37       That's my little girl, she's 20 months old. She'll be two in January and so her name is Kalia and she's a complete nut. I don't know where she gets that from. Oh hell yeah. She keeps me busy. Were you planning to have clean? Nope. She was an oops kid. She was totally new skid. See, we'll just be honest. We just didn't think, I just didn't think, you know, you know, they say it only takes one time. All. Yep. That is so true. One time, and I'm one fighter, so yeah, that's embarrassing. But I believe everything happens for a reason and I think that no, I didn't plan on it, but I wouldn't take her back for anything because she made me better. I want her to be able to look back on her life one day. Maybe when she's getting interviewed, I don't know. And be able to say that, yes, my mom was there for me 100% without a doubt. And I'm going to have straight A's and I'm making it work and I'm going to graduate with honors and one day I'm going to be able to tell her, look, I did this. You can do this. Like push yourself and you got it. That's really impressive. I mean, you're just, you're saying a lot of things that are really impressive to her. Like I matter, like I make a difference to her.

Speaker 17:         00:59:04       Okay. All right. We can stop. So we did stop and I packed up my stuff. It's pretty much done. And Barbara and destiny walked me out to my carb. Kaliyah came too. They had a little basketball for her. My goodness. Loving is here and at a certain point I noticed like over my shoulder, Barbara is crouched down and she's got her phone out and she's taking a picture of this just perfect little scene. You can get her in here. All right, you're going to kick in. And I just felt like I was in one of those moments that like, look, I'm going to contains everything that's good about us as people. You can do one buddy, you're watching this. I couldn't help but think that destinies, very existence is probably the most interesting argument against what Barbara is doing. You're, I can it back because if Barbara had gotten the Destiny's birth mom, destiny CLIA this moment, none of it would exist. Yeah. And I told destiny I was thinking about this and asked her about it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:22       [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         01:00:23       my situation turned out positive. Like, I mean as far as you know, positives can go. Like I think I hit the Jackpot. A lot of times that's not the case and you just had to have to weigh it. Like is it worth it? Like I could have turned out like some of the other kids,

Speaker 17:         01:00:43       destiny says before she was born, her mom had four other girls. These were kids that didn't end up with Barbara. Yeah. Three of them ended up in other foster homes and seem to have done pretty well. But one of them,

Speaker 19:         01:00:54       okay, well one of them don't really know what happened to her. She's somewhere, but it's not good. From what we've heard

Speaker 17:         01:01:03       last, they heard she was living on the streets in La

Speaker 19:         01:01:06       and that could've very easily have been one of us. Yeah. I mean, yes I might get a great family but I might not.

Speaker 17:         01:01:16       The question that was stuck in my head right then was like, if you could choose between being born knowing that your life might end up like that and not like it is now or not been born at all, what would you have done? Um, not been born at all. I wouldn't want to put it up to chance because what kind of life is that? You mean that I do mean that. Yeah, I'll check the side. I know I've been joking a lot in this interview, but I mean with all that I am,

Speaker 3:          01:01:54       see

Speaker 17:         01:01:56       she wants to see it Gaffin back together. What's she saying there? Taylor swift's never getting back to you. You say never ever. Oh no baby. Be careful just saying, okay. She's, do you want to say bye bye. Say Bye. Aw, you blew my kids. That was nice. Okay. That was good.

Speaker 17:         01:02:35       Remind me this destiny has, uh, what three brothers and sisters that also were raised with her? Two brothers and one sister. What happened to them? Isaiah is in college and Taylor and Brandon W I met them at Barbara's house and they, they seemed to be, uh, to be fine. And what about the four kids that weren't raised with Barbara? Do you know anything about the other, the other four at just a little there? There were four girls, and Barbara and destiny told me that a few years ago they found three of them and they all either were in college or had finished college. So then the one that's in trouble is just one of one. One of eight. Yeah. One of it. So I guess you could say to yourself, seven out of eight of these kids did it right. [inaudible] that's interesting. I mean, that's, that's a different kind of odds, but it's, yeah.
