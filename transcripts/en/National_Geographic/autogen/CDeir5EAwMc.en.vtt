00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.053
- [Narrator] San Francisco is a rush.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.275
A rush of art, flavors,
history, and innovation.

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:11.525
(funky rhythmic music)

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.520
It's all packed into a
seven-by-seven-mile square,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.233
between the Pacific Ocean
and the San Francisco Bay.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.800
The city has long attracted

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.450
trailblazers and countercultures.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.240
The Gold Rush, immigration, beatniks,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.280
hippies, the LGBTQ community,
and the tech industry

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.890
have all fueled San
Francisco's enduring influence

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.973
on American culture.

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.520
If you've seen a movie
set in San Francisco,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.193
you've probably seen Chinatown.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.560
The Dragon Gate arch at
Grant Avenue and Bush Street

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.633
tells visitors they're entering
America's oldest Chinatown.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.510
In the mid-1800s, the
lure of the Gold Rush

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.440
and the availability of work
building the Pacific Railroad,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.403
drew large numbers of Chinese
immigrants to San Francisco.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.480
Today you can take in the
scene on packed Grant Avenue,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.670
and head to Stockton Street

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.860
for the authentic Chinatown experience.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.430
You can shop for traditional
Chinese ingredients,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.610
sip a cup of fragrant jasmine
tea, and eat at some of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.833
the best Chinese restaurants in the world.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.240
The Golden Gate Bridge might be

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.960
the most iconic San Francisco landmark,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.410
but the massive Golden Gate Park

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.213
is one of the most visited
green spaces in the U.S.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.640
20% larger than New York's Central Park,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.900
it covers a thousand square acres

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.680
in a near perfect rectangle,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.670
stretching from the oceanfront west,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.420
to the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.330
It includes numerous gardens,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.530
the historic Conservatory of Flowers,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.000
and two world-class museums,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.730
the California Academy of Sciences,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.883
and the de Young Museum of Fine Art.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.510
It also has some pretty unusual
residents for the big city,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.210
a herd of bison.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.250
Buffalo have lived in
the park since the 1890s.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.500
And the tradition continues
today with a small group

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
of six bison that spend their days

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.453
in a bucolic green pasture
next to Spreckels Lake.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.823
Keep going west and you'll
find yourself at Ocean Beach.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.320
The top of the five-mile
stretch of shoreline

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.030
borders Lands End, a national
park with otherworldly views

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.780
on the Northwest coast of the city.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.903
You can also explore the modern
ruins of the Sutro Baths.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.170
When they opened in 1896,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.720
it was the largest indoor
swimming facility in the world.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.230
But the massive complex of
saltwater pools, restaurants,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.073
games, and even a museum,
burned to the ground in 1966.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020
After you've climbed the crumbling walls,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.330
stairs, and tunnels,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.093
you can unwind at the historic
Cliff House restaurant.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.650
Originally constructed in 1863,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.693
the resort has been rebuilt
three times over the years.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.290
Today you can take in the panoramic views

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.580
in one of the two restaurants

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.553
that now occupy the
neoclassical structure.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.860
The lure of the city by the bay

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.383
goes so much deeper
than its natural beauty.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.850
San Francisco's diversity,
artistic spirit,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.080
and innovative drive all make
it a rich source of adventure

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.973
for any free spirited traveler.

00:03:18.973 --> 00:03:22.056
(upbeat funky music)
