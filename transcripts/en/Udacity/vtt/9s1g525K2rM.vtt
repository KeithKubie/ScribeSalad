00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.159
We're going to use this difference of square pattern to help us simplify the

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.644
binomial radicals we saw earlier, in the denominator. But before we do that,

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:12.535
let's learn a new term, the term is conjugate. The conjugate of a binomial is

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:17.775
the same exact binomial, with an opposite sign in between the two terms. So the

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:22.874
conjugate of the root of 7 plus 2 would be the root of 7 minus 2. We just

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:26.390
change the middle sign. What's so great about the conjugate is that if we

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.212
multiply a binomial with it's conjugate, we just get a number. We won't have

00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:35.216
any more radicals. For example, if we multiply these two binomials together,

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:40.510
we'll just have a squared minus b squared. We square the root of 7 to get 7,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.262
and we square the 2 to get 4, 7 minus 4 equals 3. So what do you think would be

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:50.595
the conjugate of these binomials. List those conjugates here. And then I want

00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:54.793
you to multiply it, the binomial with it's conjugate, to get the product.
