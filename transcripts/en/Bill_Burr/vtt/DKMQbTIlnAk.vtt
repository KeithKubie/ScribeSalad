man.
Uh,
yeah,
the,
the guys,</v>

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.440
I actually had him on the podcast,
uh,
yesterday,
uh,
that executive produced,

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.360
um,
hot tub time machine.
They did a Harold and Kumar,
and they're doing this too,

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.670
and they're doing this.
Do you know it's going to be quality?
Yeah,

17
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:04.770
it's pretty cool man.
And,
and uh,
uh,

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.580
basically it just picks up with Johnny in,
uh,

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.540
and Daniel when they're 15.
And if the FTC,
yeah,
Daniel Daniel runs a,

20
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.374
a,
uh,

21
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.920
a car dealership in the valley and Johnny's just down on his luck.

22
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.270
<v 0>I'm fucking in now.
Do they have the,
uh,</v>

23
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:24.280
what was the name of the actor who played the,
uh,

24
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.810
<v 1>Billy's APP?
W Williams.
ATPCO.
Is he in it?
Yeah,
he's in it.
Fuck yeah,</v>

25
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.770
Johnny's in it.
And uh,
it's,
it's pretty cool cause it's,
uh,
they're given the,

26
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:37.570
they're screening the first two episodes in theaters like across the country,

27
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.280
but like select theaters.
But,
um,
it just,
it got into Tribeca,

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.450
which a Tuesday,

29
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.600
<v 0>this whole thing,
you know,
sometimes when they reboot something,
I'm just like,</v>

30
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.840
why?
Um,
I'll just be,
that's,
that's kind of weird.

31
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.740
I thought they kind of completed it.
Um,
and you know,

32
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:56.740
there's some instances where they literally have to bring characters back from

33
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.574
the dead.
Yeah.

34
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.930
<v 1>We don't have any CGI Miyagi in this.
Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.731
<v 0>But this one here,</v>

36
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:08.200
what I like is they're not like hiding the f the time that went by and that,

37
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:13.120
okay.
Picks him up.
They're in their 50s.
And I think that's a really a,
you know,

38
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:16.720
interesting thing just as far as being finally in a writer's room after all

39
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.850
these years on,
on a show that I do is,

40
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.620
is just getting to write to that and you get to fill in all of this cool.

41
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.513
Like backstage,

42
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.570
<v 1>what happened as you learn more about Johnny,
like nobody ever really touched on,</v>

43
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.570
you know,
cause people forget he was still a kid in high school,

44
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.010
you know what I mean?
But now,
um,
you learn a little bit more about him,
you know,

45
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:38.640
and then,
uh,
I play,
actually,

46
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.630
<v 0>I don't want you to give anything away,
but he was,
he was a kid of divorce,
right?</v>

47
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.610
Yeah.
His Dad wasn't around that,
which was perfect because that eliminated,

48
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:48.444
why wouldn't your dad,

49
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.520
<v 1>you had a fight?
They got rid of that.
I mean,
he had this,
uh,
what,
16,</v>

50
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:57.160
17 year old kid with this,
uh,
you know,
horrible Sensei,
you know,
that,

51
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:01.840
that was so impressionable on them.
But,
um,
it's pretty cool.
Oh,
I know.

52
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.460
I'm talking,
I don't know that character's name.

53
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:04.580
I thought you were talking about the crime.

54
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.810
I tell you talked Ralph Machio is not named,
uh,
Johnny,
Johnny,
Johnny,
Johnny is,

55
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.210
well,
I mean it's pretty,
I think a decorative,

56
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.510
I guess at that time where,
you know,

57
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.550
I was a latch key kid and go everybody at single moms and yeah.

58
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:22.240
Well Daniel's both get Penn.
Both my parents worked,
so we all had,

59
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.560
we all had keys.

60
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.770
And I remember I had all the names of the kids right by the door and we would

61
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:29.050
all crap our keys.
And then yeah,

62
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:33.640
you'd come home and whoever was the oldest was running shit.
Yeah.
And uh,

63
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.451
could tell,
you know,

64
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:38.260
just had total fucking authority could tell you to go to bed.

65
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.550
Like my older brother would tell me to go to bed and I had to do it.

66
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:44.700
And if I did,
he'd beat the shit out of me.
Yeah.
The,
you're like,

67
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.350
you're only a year older than me.
Two years older than me.

68
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.040
But I started fighting back.
So then what he understood was like,
all right,

69
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.940
I'll keep him under my wing and now I've got a four year buffer between the next

70
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:57.640
kid.
And then that's when his power was solidified and I sold out.

71
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.210
I sold out all my younger siblings just so I could stay up and watch fucking

72
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.840
deputy dog.
Now I was the middleman.
But,
um,

73
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.580
my older brother had all the authority.
Yeah.
I would come home and you know,

74
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.150
he was like the man of the house at 12.
Oh,
were you at nine?
10?

75
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.050
I was a CCI was four years old.
Oh eight.
Yeah.

76
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.630
Eight keep was a three or five.
Five.
So yeah.

77
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.030
So you know that that lasts a pretty much most of my,

78
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.520
my child you about power.
How quickly can corrupt somebody,

79
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.200
how most people can't handle it.
I said,
I'm really fascinated about the,

80
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:33.530
so Johnny is the Corporate Kai Guy.
I'm sorry,
but you're both,

81
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.570
you're right on both ends.
Um,
I do think Johnny's father wasn't around either,

82
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.110
but Daniel yet Daniel had to learn from the fucking maintenance

83
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.420
can father.
Yeah.

84
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.870
So you know who better than the guy that fixes the sink.

85
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.320
I think this is a,
that's a really brilliant way to go.

86
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:01.270
And uh,
I I this,

87
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:05.800
this seems like a cool youtube thing cause I feel if this was on a more major

88
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:09.550
network,
they would be like,
yeah,
but who are we going to root for and blah,

89
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:10.780
blah blah.
Let's like,
let's,

90
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.740
let's have it based around the Ralph Machio character.
Well apparently,

91
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:18.880
I mean there was a lot of,
you know,
there was a lot of offers for this.
I think,

92
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:19.360
you know,
the,

93
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.080
the Netflix of the world maybe even including Netflix that they kind of bid on

94
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:27.810
it and youtube red got got,
you know,
they got the nod.
So,
uh,

95
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.780
Jesus,
they,

96
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.380
well they were telling us because I was asking them yesterday on the podcast,

97
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.460
the producers,
I'm like,
you know,

98
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:36.250
through the process and everything and they said they went into youtube red and

99
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:41.090
just figured all right,
this would be like the practice pitch.
And,
but as,
as it,

100
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.651
you know,

101
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:44.830
as they sat on it some more and saw the interest and what they were going to be

102
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.100
able to do and it just became more appealing and they went with,

103
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.820
I'm a great believer in that.
I'm a big believer in not taking the money.

104
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:55.330
If somebody else will give you more yeah.
What you wanna do.

105
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.040
Cause then he goes down swinging with what you,
you want to do.
And I,

106
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.580
<v 0>I was,
you'll get,
you'll get more control.
You get more of,</v>

107
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.020
I said this great thing one time,
uh,

108
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:06.020
this heavy metal band that never made it and it just,

109
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.490
I forget what the name of the documentary was,

110
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.070
but it just took them through their whole career and uh,

111
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.530
how they just stayed together and stayed together and stayed with that.
And Phil,

112
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.910
this guy knows everything.
He's like Google.
Oh,
thank you Aaron.
In the court.

113
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.810
Sorry,
Aaron in the corner.
Um,
Advil and this guy is,
he just set this thing.

114
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.480
He said at the end of the day,
he goes,

115
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:31.190
you're better to own 100% of something and sell 20,000 copies.

116
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.220
Then to own nothing and sell 20 million,

117
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.170
like that's how bad you get fucked with like all of the expenses and all of that

118
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:39.740
type of shit.

119
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.160
That was my thought process and giving a special away for free is that,
you know,

120
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:47.510
I put my own money into it and you know,
it wasn't cheap.
I mean for me at least,

121
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:51.790
you know,
as a comic,
you know,
you're always checked the check.
So,
um,

122
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.660
it basically like,
I think my next special,
I'll try and shop it,
but excuse me.

123
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.150
Well,
don't ever give up ownership.
No.
Well I,

124
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.380
well the the thing for me was that this was kind of a personal thing for me.

125
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:07.040
Like it's kind of like a one man show in a standup format,

126
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.470
but I only had one I only enough money for one take.

127
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.630
I did it in a colony theater in Burbank,

128
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.760
but the concept was basically I want to own it because I found that dare you,

129
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.490
well,
all my other business,
how dare you?
Well,
the thing that,

130
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.330
that kind of,
I should be worried about exposure.

131
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.250
We're going to pay you and exposure.

132
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.150
Well the thing is too is that like all this stuff that I did before on comedy

133
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:32.180
central show,
I didn't own any of it.
I wasn't even able to share it,

134
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.890
you know what I mean?
On Facebook.

135
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.310
So I released it for free@brettcomedy.com and you could go there,

136
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.360
but the thing is you could just watch it.
You don't have to,
I mean,

137
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:45.830
you can give me your email if you want.

138
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.200
If you want to donate or I mean our own it,

139
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.860
download it for $5 or buy a tee shirt.
You get to download if you want to,

140
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.170
but you don't have to do anything.
I just want you to watch it.

141
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.650
And if you like it,
you like it.
If you don't put your head on the desk,

142
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.750
you know what I mean?
Or Click something else,
we'll move on.
It's fun.

143
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.200
It's fucking free.
I remember early on I had a,
uh,
I made a CD.

144
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.840
I had to stand up CD.
That's how long I've been like,
you know,

145
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.250
way back in the day.
And,
uh,
I,
you know,
put all my money up,

146
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:16.070
paid to have it recorded,
edited the thing,
the thing was done.

147
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.490
And then these big guys came around and,
uh,

148
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.700
they were going to get it into stores.
This is 2006,

149
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.630
right before every virgin closed.
And I was such an old school guy.
I was like,

150
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.290
I want my CD in a record store,
you know,
and,
and with,

151
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:32.390
with the power of these guys feel,

152
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.470
get me on the display towards the front of the store.
Right.
And,
uh,

153
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:40.130
but I knew enough that I wanted to retain ownership and they just kept,

154
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:44.630
they kept trying to get to own it and it was like,
I don't need you to own it.

155
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:47.750
It's done.
I don't need any money on this thing.
I just,

156
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.200
I just need you to distribute it.
And this guy goes to me,
he goes,
well,

157
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:54.290
ownership shouldn't be that big a deal to you,
which it,

158
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.250
because what you should be concerned about is exposure.
So I said to him,

159
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:00.360
I go,
all right,
fair enough.

160
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.330
But if ownership shouldn't be that much of a big deal for me,

161
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.480
why is it such a big deal for you?
And my manager was in the room and he goes,

162
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:11.481
great fucking question and this guy stammered for about 15 seconds.

163
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.860
And then basically said,
well,
you know,

164
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.520
we got in business with these other comics to make cds in their CDs bombed and

165
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:19.170
we have to make up the money.
It's just like,
well,

166
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:23.510
it's not my fault that you got into business with those fucking guys.

167
00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:26.490
And the greatest thing I ever did was retained ownership.

168
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:29.010
I ended up getting in business with somebody else and that was like,
you know,

169
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.690
hey,
you get 60% we get 40% I'm like,
hey,
that sounds like a good deal.

170
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:37.020
And then all the expenses come out of my end.
Yeah.
And they get,

171
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.310
they get 40 off the gross.

172
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.430
I got 60 off the net and they ended up making more money than I did and to this

173
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.770
day they tried to tell me that that was a good deal.
It's like,
dude,

174
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.340
this thing came.
It's like we,

175
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.480
you always think like we're getting in business together to make money off of

176
00:09:49.481 --> 00:09:53.070
them.
And that's not how they do it.
Of course,
like we're getting work.
Yeah.

177
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.570
They're gonna fuck the people and you and all the money's going to go to them.

178
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.870
My favorite thing is I get in business with somebody else and all the money goes

179
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.890
to them and then when I get my cut their names on my check and it's just like,

180
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.190
so how the fuck do I know what came in?
And then if you audit them,

181
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.390
then you get labeled as difficult to work with it.
Yeah.
No,

182
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.720
it's like difficult to work with,

183
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:16.260
a difficult to steal from and that like I am one of these deals I had,

184
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.920
it was like,
um,
if there was one of the DVD companies,

185
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.400
if I was to audit them and they were off less than like 8% than I had to pay for

186
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:27.600
the audit.
And it's like what?

187
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:31.890
You just gave them a license to steal seven and a half percent.
Yeah.

188
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:33.510
And it's just like I'm telling you

189
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.610
the number one commandment of the 10 commandments that's fucking,
uh,
that's,

190
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.450
that's,
uh,
broken.
May I,
maybe it's lying.
But what I've seen is stealing,

191
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.170
like all of these fucking idiots who were out there who are stealing on the

192
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:49.050
illegal side of stealing,
selling drugs.
I mean,

193
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:53.610
anybody who was in the mob who was smart eventually went legit so you could

194
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.170
steal on the legal side.

195
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.800
Then you didn't have to hide your fucking money and you could drive down the

196
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:00.270
street and you're fucking Bentley.

197
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.950
<v 1>Well,
I've never look,
I love our business.
I love the people in our business,</v>

198
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.820
you know,
but there's a good amount of them that are just fucking garbage.

199
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.680
And I don't even know if the garbage is just the weight,
the,

200
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.150
it's like the way it was set up.
Well,
when you first way it was set up,
you fit,

201
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.550
just play in the game.
Like when you first come in.

202
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:21.110
This is why I love this era of,
of comedy and where we're at,

203
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:25.040
especially with the digital in the,
in the Internet and stuff.
Like,
I always say,

204
00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:28.780
I only need 1% of American to like me and I'm good.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

205
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.650
You know what I mean?
That's then you know,
even if,
uh,

206
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.070
even if I can see a joke on stage,
you know,
in,

207
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.760
in a room full of fucking adults at somebody,
he's going,
oh,

208
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.410
I don't fucking,
somebody just sent,

209
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.070
somebody just sent me this for this fucking article.
Somebody just sent me this

210
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.120
<v 0>article like this.
I can't,
I can't even fucking read this.
Uh,</v>

211
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.920
but there are some scumbags in our bed.
Every guy himself,

212
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.730
a little New York comedy clubs adjust to me too.

213
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.910
And it's just like,
this is just like such like a,

214
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:04.480
you didn't even stick your head in the comedy clubs,
I'm seeing the opposite.

215
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.700
Yeah.
This like this backlash and this,

216
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:11.701
this time now to be more irreverent than ever because you know,

217
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.140
not all feminists are bad,
but these extreme ones,

218
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.620
like what they're doing now with these articles is like the way we left Vietnam

219
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:20.710
where we go,
hey,
we won and they're leaving.
That's what they're saying.

220
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:23.770
Like I'm finding myself,
I'm saying shit on stage now.

221
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.020
I never would have gone that far.
But it's just like,
cause you have to

222
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.640
<v 1>[inaudible] I mean we're all,</v>

223
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.790
you would have to agree that we're contrarians by nature.
Yeah.

224
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.720
Which should be fun if you disagree,
but I'm just saying no,
no,
no,
I don't.

225
00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:40.590
I don't,
you totally loved it over and I fucking missed it.
No.

226
00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:44.310
Um,
uh,
but even some of the women are going the other way too.

227
00:12:44.311 --> 00:12:47.790
Like I've been noticing a lot of comp,
a female comics doing jokes,
you know,

228
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:51.990
where they wished,
you know,
like in other words,
I'm now,
they're now,

229
00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:55.080
they're not getting any action,
you know,
and,
right.
And,
but it's just

230
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.640
<v 0>becomes inevitable way where it just,
one thing just gets it get,</v>

231
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:03.440
becomes exhausted.
Like it's all been said,
we get it.

232
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.680
And then it's just like,
how many times can you keep reiterating the same point?

233
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.190
<v 1>I,
I really believe that if co comics,
you know,</v>

234
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.430
we're such a great think tank because,
uh,
we really don't.

235
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.660
I mean real good comics,
you know,
uh,
cause you could sit around,

236
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.900
you have no real skin in the game.

237
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.640
It's more about the joke or the perspective or you know what I mean?

238
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:22.474
Anytime anybody

239
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.350
<v 0>tries to fucking do that thing where they go like,
uh,
you know,</v>

240
00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:30.280
like where they try to put too much weight on a joke,
I always just get no dude,

241
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.290
no,
it's just,
I,
I just,
what I always say to them,

242
00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:35.230
like if they sit there like what you're saying does influence people and Blah

243
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.310
Blah,
I just say to them,
I say,
look,
are you homophobic?
And they of course say,
no.

244
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.600
I go,
okay.
In during a 60 minute set that I do,

245
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:46.480
what Joe could I tell that would then make you homophobic?

246
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.680
How can I undo everything that you were taught in 60?
What,
how,
how many,

247
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:54.820
how many of those jokes where I have to do,
so my point of that is,

248
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.470
is is people come in,
I'm so sick of talking about this too.
People come in,

249
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.380
okay,
they're,
they're,
they're adults.

250
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.440
Their brains are fully formed and they have their ideas in the amount of times I

251
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:10.420
say shit and it's just like people take it a completely different way is one of

252
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:14.250
the cool things about like somebody listening to music,
comedy or anything gets,

253
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.780
it goes into your brain and your experience and how you interpret it.

254
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.020
But like it's not my responsibility to babysit you.

255
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.530
And if you take it in some really bad fuck away,
you walked in with that shit.

256
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.030
Cause if I had the power to undo your 26 years of experience with a couple of

257
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:32.150
fucking jokes than standup comedy would not be legal.

258
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.650
They wouldn't let a fucking moron like me go onstage.

259
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.760
<v 1>Hey,
I haven't read about shit.
You know what I think about the Syria?</v>

260
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.700
I mean I always not disarmed myself,
but I always,
I am a jerk off.

261
00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:47.660
I know I'm a jerk off.
I'm not,
I'm not like,
you know me both.

262
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.250
You know what I mean?
Like I don't,
I don't take myself seriously.

263
00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:53.620
I have the high school to prove it.
You've always got a gay dude.
You,

264
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.900
you're not as dumb as you say.
Oh,
it's like,
yeah,
I am.
I am.
I,

265
00:14:56.901 --> 00:14:59.390
I'm good that you're just,
you're watching the one thing that I'm good at,

266
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:03.320
which is basically acting like a fucking idiot.
But if you got me on,
uh,

267
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.420
and I could do like a,
like basic jobs,
you know what I mean?

268
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.190
Like I was a fucking like,
workhorse.

269
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.150
If you told me to go over there and pick up all those boxes and stick them over

270
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:15.890
there,
I would fucking crush that.

271
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.610
But if you wanted me to come up with a machine that could fucking make this

272
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.010
easier to do that,
yeah.
I'm out.
I'm like,
well,

273
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.600
fucking lunch pail Louie.
I'm a moron.

274
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.900
What makes me laugh too is that even the comics that take themselves so

275
00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:32.540
seriously in a sense is like,
we like,
you know,

276
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.440
that [inaudible] game that we were on as take themselves seriously hacks,

277
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:39.230
think they're fucking change in the world because they're too fucking,
we,

278
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.300
we're just realized they stink here.

279
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.570
I realized that I was on a plane that we had to emergency land.
Okay.
And,
um,

280
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.830
always fun.
Some do.
Try to kill another two next to him,

281
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.840
started choking him and shit.
Like we were literally five minutes in the air.

282
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.280
And I'm like fuck,
cause I was going to miss my gig that night,
you know,

283
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.820
that's all I care about.
Oh,
we're not crashing now.
Why are we going?

284
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:04.430
I gotta I gotta make my Gig.
You know,
he tried to kill the game,

285
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.860
starts choking and dude,
so then the guy who had proceeded it,

286
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.660
I was always in the back.
I think the guy just flipped on him.

287
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:14.080
It was like some dude that was in,
I'm going to go with the armrest,

288
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.980
there's an armrest fight
the guy.
So,
uh,
anyways,

289
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:22.970
long story boring the guy's face obviously playing it up now that he,
you know,

290
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.990
so they start now us in the back don't know what's going on.
Okay,

291
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.370
so then the stewardess friends back.

292
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.730
So is there anybody here in the medical profession?
You know,

293
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.380
in the medical field,
a couple of people get up.
I see a guy that was a cop,

294
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.620
get up,
a guy that was a fireman because he should have said attention.
Everyone.

295
00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:42.470
There's nothing wrong with the plane.
Well,
they made that.

296
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.630
They say that it came back,
it came back to us.

297
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:47.240
I mean this is after they were asking for for everybody is that would've been

298
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:49.340
the back.
How the fuck is a cop?
Gonna fly the plane.

299
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.650
But the point being is that they said all these people started getting up and

300
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:58.670
that's when you realize that your job is just so fucking useless.
Oh yeah.

301
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.550
It's like I,
in any I,
I'm not even,
I just need to watch and may,

302
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.940
you know,
unless they're like,
hey,

303
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:09.470
can you come up and do five minutes to cheer everybody other than that,
fuck.

304
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.780
All these people have a real purpose.
And I'm not saying we don't,
but you know,

305
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.520
if you're doing the Maslow's hierarchy thing,
comics are not like,

306
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.820
we're like junk food.
Absolutely.
You know what I mean?

307
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:24.680
Is this a comfort food kind of fucking,
we're Mcdonald's not nutrition.
Yeah.

308
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:27.090
So,
well,

309
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.010
I would say you're going to be hungry again for knowledge 10 minutes after

310
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:34.560
watching my act.
Yeah.
Like if you're,
if you're learning from me,
that's,

311
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.720
there's some off.
It's sad my,
and if anybody ever said that to me,
I'd be like,

312
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.710
oh no,
no,
sorry.
Pointed towards a library or something.

313
00:17:42.711 --> 00:17:45.230
Like all these comics think they're Carlin,
but,

314
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.880
and I don't think there's a lot of that though.

315
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.230
I don't think there's a lot of political aspire.
I was going say,

316
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:50.010
especially in like the

317
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.410
<v 0>open mics where,
and,
um,
even,
uh,</v>

318
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.050
there's a couple of younger comics that were talking to me that they coined a

319
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:58.750
term called [inaudible].
What is that like these colleges called,

320
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.270
they don't laugh.
They just make up,
make a statement and everybody's like,

321
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:07.040
yeah,
you know,
like,
I used to call that was the Oprah show for somebody.

322
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.150
You do need to get a job,
just starts fucking clapped her.

323
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.910
Well,
I think,
uh,
you know,
if,
if you're online all the time and like,

324
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:20.580
you just get stuck into that fucking swirl,

325
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.230
a rabbit hole of that shit where it's just like,
ah,
you know,

326
00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:29.070
when people just start posting these,
this information that you need to know,

327
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.900
it's like,
where did you get this?
Who the fuck are you?
And,
uh,
uh,

328
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:37.290
there's a couple,
two words I hate the most on the,
as curating an algorithm.

329
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.550
If I see that anywhere,
I just fucking,
I just,
cause I gotta be honest with you,

330
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:45.030
like even like I,
as much as I love Netflix and everything like that,

331
00:18:45.031 --> 00:18:48.150
it's like you watch one season of Narcos,

332
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.530
your whole fucking thing is just now going to be all drug drawer behind the

333
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:57.330
scenes of prisons.
You know,
San Quentin,
the real,
the real fucking,

334
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:59.460
it's just like,
you know,
you almost get offended.
Like,

335
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:04.410
you know this more to me than just that.
So I want you to look a little,
but like,

336
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:06.360
um,
when,
when I did my last special,

337
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:09.600
when I went in there and they showed me how the algorithm worked,
I mean,

338
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:13.050
I was fucking blown away,
but like,
so maybe it isn't their fault.

339
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.590
Maybe I'm such a fucking moron that I watched too many.
They just like,

340
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:19.500
we give up on this guy,
let's just,
well,
I'll share one with my wife.

341
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:21.300
And she's always like,
oh,
I watch cartoons.

342
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.070
I'm dead serious.
She's like,
what are you fucking 12,
you know,

343
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:32.100
I would love them to bring back is Johnny quest.
Johnny quest was all right.

344
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:34.650
I wasn't,
yeah,
I gotta be honest with you,
man wasn't a big fan of that.

345
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.530
You know what I loved about Johnny Quest,
if you fell off a cliff,
you'd died.

346
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.880
Is that blew my mind.
You got shot.
You fucking died.
Like people would dying.
Yeah.

347
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.390
You used to bugs bunny where everybody just came back.
You know,

348
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.810
Wiley Coyote turned into a fucking accordion,
gave you a look like,

349
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:50.940
well that didn't work.
And then he comes back totally fine.

350
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.180
Should have been in a fucking wheelchair.
Um,
let's get back to,
let's get a,

351
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.990
I saw a meme talking about the Facebook shit real quick.
Um,
I,

352
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.860
I was dying laughing.
It was a general and it says,
uh,
well,
we,

353
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.010
we bombed Syria and let me go into Facebook and see what the experts say.

354
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.760
Need to know what our next move is.

355
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.400
They go to Facebook and find out what all the experts say.
Yeah.

356
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.500
I'd be honest with you,
I don't understand that whole part of the world.
I,

357
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.360
the people that were fighting and all that.

358
00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:23.040
But I also know that I haven't read up on it,

359
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:25.830
but I just look at it like the people fighting don't have a plane or a boat.

360
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.400
I just don't get how they're going to get us.
I know nine 11 happened,

361
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:32.130
but they caught us with their pants down.
So all you have to do is just,

362
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:35.790
what is Israel do is really hasn't had a hijacking of a plane and like,

363
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:38.820
I don't know how many of you in the front and then when they watch the planes

364
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:42.510
all night so it's not even a fucking option and they're sitting right in the

365
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:46.950
middle of that Hornets nest over there and they're able to survive it.
So,
uh,

366
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.820
I dunno,
I,
my host,
I'm just worried about us financially.
Just,

367
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.010
I feel like those,
these fucking jerk offs,

368
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:58.720
they're dragging us into the deep water here.
And uh,
you know,
the whole,

369
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:01.390
there's more than one way to skin a cat and it's just because,
you know,

370
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:03.460
realistically,
why would you ever try to fight us?

371
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.790
We could literally blow up the whole fucking thing with one push of a button if

372
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:09.040
we wanted to.
But um,
I dunno,

373
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.730
maybe somebody over there as good at math and knows it better than I do,

374
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:16.660
but I just sit there.
I like just is debt.
Debt wakes me up at night.

375
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.470
That's why I try to not to,
I try to like keep all of my shit.

376
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.850
I'm not good with it.
So like anytime I see a store channel that stuff,
no,

377
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.170
no,
I do.
I am a fucking onestop operation.

378
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.850
I handled the whole fucking thing.

379
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.880
<v 1>Oh,
it's a couple of days later and now I'm doing the advertising old Billy</v>

380
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:44.400

I can't breathe out.

382
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:51.310
Mind knows to do two to me are days me on days.
I'm going to use my mouth.

383
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:55.750
That's how it goes.
Mouth breathing more on in the south.

384
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.440
Shut the fuck up.
Just close your mouth.

385
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:03.790
No one cares about your ar 15 or the fact that Trump's gonna build a wall.

386
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:06.880
Put on your Roundy's.

413
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.620
<v 0>Yeah,
I even do dishes too.
It's just,</v>

414
00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:34.454
it's just fucking,

415
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.690
I actually enjoyed doing dishes and cleaning up cause I'm a fucking lunatic.

416
00:23:38.691 --> 00:23:40.130
I can't sit still.
I don't know how to,

417
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.950
the only time I could fucking relaxed it pumps smoking a cigar and I'm off him

418
00:23:42.951 --> 00:23:45.020
right now.
Let me ask you this question.
Out of the,
uh,

419
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.340
if you were to say you had one

420
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.720
<v 1>of those,
uh,
the popular three that Comedians have,
the uh,</v>

421
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.130
add a check.
Oh,
CD don't have that.
Um,

422
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.030
depression.
I had a,
I didn't have the chemical one.

423
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.370
I was just walking around bummed out for a long time.

424
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:03.650
I didn't realize it cause I was always like that.

425
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.040
Well there's depression through intelligence,
you know,
like,
like in other words,

426
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:11.680
and not saying you're intelligent,
but
no,
I'm saying like you,

427
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:17.010
you see all these patterns and you just see like what the fuck is wrong with

428
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:22.160
people.
Like you know,
uh,
and it just gets to you because that used to,

429
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:26.390
but I know how to,
I know how to talk my way out of that.
I got,
as I got older,

430
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:30.620
I call,
I just see,
oh two we used to get into it.
You and I,
it was just sports.

431
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:34.910
I mean,
and that's what,
no,
should sports politics.
Did we get into a politics?

432
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.670
Oh Dude,
we would have our eyebrows all the way up.

433
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.090
I thought we were on the same page with that.
I think it was mostly sports.

434
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:45.710
I think the one time we got into it,
as I remember,

435
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:50.711
I had to like literally tell myself the next time you and Brett get going,

436
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.110
you have to be the guy that taps out.
And I started tapping out and we have,

437
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:57.850
we've been good ever since.
Well I said no,
it never got ugly,
but we would,

438
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.630
it would be like Unitus,

439
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:04.310
we both agreed on Johnny was something important like that.
It was.

440
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.870
And I think he wanted to kill me at the time cause I think I said Elway over

441
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:13.190
Brady.
I went,
I went Montana La Brady and you went,
no,

442
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.140
I don't no problem with that.
No.
At the time you did.
No,
I did it because no,

443
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.660
I remember I hit you.
Oh No.
You know what?

444
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:20.830
It was something different cause I was always the guy people going like Brady's

445
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.690
better than Montana.
I went once he got four rings.
I said,
dude,

446
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.100
Montana needed four tries to get four rinks,
Brady needed six.

447
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.620
And then once he got his fifth I said,
okay,
now we've got is 50 my whole back.

448
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.900
My whole list has changed now because the year that the,
that,
uh,

449
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.860
Denver went is when I texted you and I said this this year Brady,
really,

450
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.290
not that it matters that he impressed me,
but I'm like,

451
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:45.650
this year I was really impressed with what he had to deal with.
And you're like,

452
00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:48.260
yeah,
but it was always over sports.
I mean,
the,

453
00:25:48.261 --> 00:25:51.050
the politics that I think we were on the same page when a lot of it,

454
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.520
if I can recall,
there was some huge fucking,
oh,
who cares for log?

455
00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.780
I can't remember.
All right.
I didn't know.
I forgot you played drums too.
Yeah.

456
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.000
You said you do on your pocket.
Like,
I mean,
I'm,
I'm,
I am,

457
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.020
I used to have a set the trap set I played for years and then my grandmother

458
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:10.290
sold it.
But you know,
every once in awhile I'll go into the guitar center and,

459
00:26:10.291 --> 00:26:13.690
and start,
you know,
playing on the,
Oh,
you got it,
do it.
But when I opened free,

460
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.810
get those Fucking v drums.
No,
you gotta get it.
You get those fucking things,
man.

461
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:20.480
I'm telling you like,
uh,
you know,
um,

462
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.500
if you like when I lived in an apartment in New York,
I,

463
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.030
I just put like this,
I forget,
it was some sort of foam rubber thing down.

464
00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:32.660
And then I built like a little riser on top of that and then foam rubber on that

465
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.630
and then I put the kid down or something like that.
And what I want to know,
wait,

466
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.260
it had to be solid so that things would stand up.
I don't know,

467
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:39.330
it was foam to that,
but I,

468
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.100
and then I went downstairs to the guy below me and say,
hey listen,

469
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.250
I played drums as a hobby

470
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.210
<v 0>and he's looking at me like,
you motherfucker.
I said,
no,
here's my phone number.</v>

471
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.600
I go,
I work at night.
You work during the day?
Yeah,
go.

472
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:54.840
I'll only play between 11 and two during the day.

473
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.630
If for whatever reason you take a day off,
you have a day off,

474
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:00.990
call me the second you call me,
pick up the phone,
Sam downstairs,

475
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:04.920
I will immediately stop.
I mean,
how could you have a problem with that?

476
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.480
And you know what?
This fucking asshole did.

477
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.070
Fucking three months later I'm playing at like two in the afternoon and my phone

478
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:14.940
rings and I go,
hello.
And he goes,
we can knock it off.
Yeah.

479
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.250
The first time I say,
hey buddy,
I get you.
Fuck

480
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.400
<v 1>fucking saying that.
Like you said it to me 20 times.
Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

481
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.400
And I hung up.
I never talked to him again and he never called again.

482
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:26.010
But I still only play during the day and I wouldn't play weekends either.

483
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.900
Now if he's watching Conan or something,

484
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:31.440
he's like [inaudible] drummer guy that lived upstairs from me.

485
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.870
He must've switched careers.
That thing cause he sucked.

486
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:37.950
It trumps it was terrible.
You said you do on your a,
you're on the list podcast.

487
00:27:37.951 --> 00:27:41.030
You do a lot of top 10 stuff.
Yeah,
we just list shit.
I mean again it's,

488
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.980
it's arguing with your friends over dumb things,
which is all right,

489
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:47.250
you got one for me.
Well let's try it.
Let's try and get the fires going and get,

490
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.770
we can do fine.
We can do top five.
I mean this is more your opinion.
I'm,

491
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.110
I might show him,
you know,
it's not so much me sometimes,
although a,
I've,
I've,

492
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.930
I've gotten a little hot hot edit like over dumb shit.
I keep,

493
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.290
I keep for over rocky three,
you know,
stupid shit.
Yeah,
that's important.

494
00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.510
It is very important in the scheme of what matters to you.

495
00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:10.860
You're living your truth.
You should start a blog about it.
Um,
I was gonna say,

496
00:28:10.861 --> 00:28:15.140
did you want to,
um,
discuss who and who the top athletes,

497
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.710
Boston athletes are of all time.
Okay.
Like would you take Brady over bird,

498
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.720
<v 0>do you think he's number one.
Oh,</v>

499
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.880
and then the next one could have been top top week.
We don't have to do 10.

500
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:29.160
We can do fine.
Get rid of Larry.
Larry's like,
and that,

501
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:33.750
especially now looking back 30 years and his stuff is still amazing and I know

502
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:36.600
Brady is going to be amazing too,
obviously,
but uh,

503
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.410
and I know he's won two more than Larry One.
Uh,

504
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.140
my thing about Larry was if I could go back in time,

505
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.290
the second he started to do the blacktop on the driveway,
I'd be like,
Larry,

506
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:50.060
let me,
let me do that.
Let me do that through such like a fucking,

507
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.570
I'll call a guy and cheap.
Well,
the,
the here's,

508
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.410
remember those when you black top of driving that little fucking brush they'd

509
00:28:55.411 --> 00:28:58.560
give you yeah.
Yeah.
That was not made for a six foot nine,
six foot,

510
00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:01.320
10 inch guy and he blacktop his own fucking driveway.

511
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.580
Rather than paying somebody that whole blue collar,
I'll do this myself.

512
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.690
And he fucked up his back.
It wasn't that,
it was never the same after that.

513
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:14.410
I was gonna say,
uh,
uh,
all right.
Tell him smoke coke if we're doing a,
if we're,

514
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.650
yeah,
if we're,
if we're doing championships,
I mean,

515
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:19.380
then you gotta you gotta Throw Bill Russell obviously no bill Russell's at the

516
00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:22.530
top.
Yeah.
It would be the Russells and say he's got 11.
Right.

517
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.850
So a lot of people leave him out.
I put them in my top five.

518
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.170
And then you've got Ted Williams,

519
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.900
and then you've got Bobby Orr who totally changed the game.
Bobby Orr was,

520
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.970
Wayne Gretzky says,
that's,
yeah,
Wayne Gretzky goes,
that's the guy.
So,
um,

521
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.650
you know what it is at this point.
There's so many people at Boston now.
Well,

522
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:41.740
I just love being an arrogant now.

523
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.150
<v 1>Well listen,
[inaudible] office and,
and you're,</v>

524
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.690
you don't have to go that far back last.
No,
you don't have no,
I don't.
And uh,

525
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.260
and I was going to say two or why would put my top 10 in Boston athletes cause

526
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.670
he's my,
he's,
he would be your don Mattingly was wade Boggs.
I like blogging.

527
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.840
I used to like weigh box.
Yeah,
no,
and I,

528
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.910
and I might throw Andre Tidbit in there as well.

529
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.450
<v 0>Andre tip though.
So there's a,
there's a lot of great guys that never got,</v>

530
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.110
uh,
never.
I mean,
I mean,
Jim race,
we had to,

531
00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:17.420
we had rice,
Fred Lynn call your strengths ski.
We just had all the straps,

532
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.320
keys for all of these great guys that,
uh,
you know,

533
00:30:21.321 --> 00:30:24.790
and I always hated that.
Um,
I always make fun of day.

534
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.340
I don't hate the people that got hit.
Dan Shaughnessy.

535
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.390
I just like breaking his boss.
Um,
but like he wrote that book,

536
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.540
the curse of the baby and it was just such a cop out [inaudible] where you just

537
00:30:36.921 --> 00:30:39.290
don't even address,
granted I never read the book,

538
00:30:39.291 --> 00:30:43.120
but I just looked at the title and I judged a book by its cover and um,

539
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.530
it's just was such a cop out.
It's just like not do,

540
00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:49.830
we were just a really bad franchise.
We were a bad franchise.

541
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.930
We will like the flyers with the flyers got two one,

542
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.160
two cups by beating the fuck out of the league.
And they were like,

543
00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.020
that's what works.
And that's what the fuck we're going to do.

544
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.360
Now they're finally coming out of it.

545
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.480
But do they had like a 30 40 year fucking hangover of trying to continue to make

546
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:11.720
maybe 30 is more fair that that a,
he bullies a doc is fucking amazing.

547
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.680
It's incredible.
Yeah.
But they were so successful winning back to back.

548
00:31:15.681 --> 00:31:16.161
You've got to stand.

549
00:31:16.161 --> 00:31:19.550
They will only in the league since 67 and they won that first cup.
It's,

550
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.470
they went back to back 74,
75.

551
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.810
There's seventh and eighth year in the league and everybody's like,

552
00:31:23.811 --> 00:31:28.210
this is the future.
And that almost destroyed hockey.
And um,

553
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.300
they just continued.

554
00:31:29.301 --> 00:31:31.610
It was okay during the 80s because there was still a lot of that left.

555
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.740
<v 1>But in the 90s,
early eighties,
it was still,</v>

556
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.670
I remember going to Brendan Byrne Arena and watched the devils and flyers go in

557
00:31:37.671 --> 00:31:41.760
it.
We just went just for that,
for the fights.
Yeah.
Dude,
it was crazy.
The first

558
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.680
<v 0>nine Bruins games I went to,</v>

559
00:31:43.681 --> 00:31:46.230
I would only go if they played the Canadians cause I knew there was going to be

560
00:31:46.231 --> 00:31:49.410
a bunch of fights.
And there's a classic one on Youtube where,
uh,

561
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.290
there's a bench clearing brawl back when the benches facing each other.

562
00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:56.670
The Old Boston Garden and a Christian island was walking off the ice.

563
00:31:56.671 --> 00:31:59.310
And according to him,
somebody threw something at him.
I don't know what happened.

564
00:31:59.311 --> 00:32:02.010
He pushed Ken Lindeman and then a little Ken Lensman,

565
00:32:02.011 --> 00:32:05.750
the rat goes down after this heavyweight nylon and all of a sudden too,

566
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.900
there was like cops involved in that.

567
00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:08.990
The bench benches cleared and I was at that game.
See,

568
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.930
<v 1>the thing was sports to me now and again,
man,
I know the athletes are,</v>

569
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:16.070
you know better.
But the uh,
no,
that's,

570
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.580
that's what a big Papi,
I've got to put pickpockets.
They poppy's please.

571
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.580
Even the 10.
Yeah,
I don't,
he might even be five.

572
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.560
But that's what we were arguing because he turned,

573
00:32:24.561 --> 00:32:27.350
I remember waiting Ramirez know that Jerry Rice thing,

574
00:32:27.351 --> 00:32:31.720
that he was faster than lightning and you were like,
how the fuck is a professor?

575
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:34.670
And I said,
I saw this sports.
That's what it was.

576
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.000
And like how the fuck is that campaign?
Yeah,
you can't be,

577
00:32:38.001 --> 00:32:39.740
but it was just sports that I saw.

578
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.740
But getting back to the athletes today are crossing not a scientist thing or

579
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.810
documented or you moved your hands around.
It's a sports thing.
Like,
okay,

580
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:53.470
well wizards,
no,
uh,
uh,
but we saw,
um,
oh,

581
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.410
I'll get it back.
I believe I,
I,
and I wasted a good 40 minutes of my,

582
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:00.080
almost a headlining set,
which is tactically 45 minutes,

583
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.940
45 minutes arguing though that,
I mean there's a part of me that enjoys it,

584
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.560
especially with people that are a,

585
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:09.770
I mean not when you get worked up over stupid shit,
but I mean,

586
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:13.790
but that's just inevitable.
Maybe cause the German in us,
maybe that's what it is.

587
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.390
But I do like the mental,
the mental check,
like,
like the,

588
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.950
the point for point because you know,
I don't,
I don't really do,

589
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.190
you don't really get that a lot.
That's why it's only with comics,

590
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:29.400
like regular civilians.
I hate going,
I haven't done it.
Have you ever done it yet?

591
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.081
And you're in it,

592
00:33:30.081 --> 00:33:32.420
you're having a great time and all of a sudden you look around at the other

593
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:37.100
people's face and just see people walking away or,
or worse laughing at you.

594
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.870
What are they arguing?
But comics get it.
Like I,
I don't,

595
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.580
I don't do well with civilians.

596
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.340
That's like when we go out to dinner with like some random couple.

597
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.650
I'm just so fucking bored.
Man.
I don't care about your kids and Oh,

598
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:55.250
no,
no,
it,
when conversations on idol the whole night,

599
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.960
you got to act on my kid and the kid playing soccer at blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

600
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.480
That's wonderful.
Yeah.
You try to,

601
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.290
they're good about going to to Mexico and all of a sudden they have,
well,

602
00:34:06.291 --> 00:34:09.380
what do you think of Trump's immigration policy?

603
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.720
And my wife just starts kicking me and you're not just like,

604
00:34:11.721 --> 00:34:14.020
we need something here.
No,
you can't.
Yeah,
you can't do that.

605
00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:16.940
And I start telling you about some fucking winery that you can visit.

606
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:19.100
And it's good for the kids because they have a little zoo,

607
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:26.120
complete pigeons and there's,
you know,
like fucking horrible.
I know.

608
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.500
And then the worst than they see you.
And just like,
I just haven't,

609
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.490
it's on my face.
I can't do it.
Like Nia stopped doing this to me,

610
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:35.750
but like there was this time,

611
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:40.751
every time we would go to a fucking party afterwards on the drive home,

612
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.640
I would get like this whole breakdown.
Well,
I get,

613
00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:45.860
I do actually have a bit where I talked about the report card.

614
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.480
I always [inaudible] I needed to tell you that before we get into,
oh yeah,
no,

615
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.150
they all do it.
You get this fucking report.
You think you had to go,

616
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:58.100
what is your report?
Yeah,
I know [inaudible] and then they're like,

617
00:34:58.101 --> 00:35:01.070
you think,
and then they break out this fucking report card and you're like,

618
00:35:01.071 --> 00:35:04.340
what the fuck can you the document and here's the thing,

619
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.990
can you fucking imagine the fire if you ever did it to them?

620
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.290
Oh you can't.
You can't.
You can't.
I,
it's so funny.
My,

621
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.870
my wife tells me what to wear.
Sometimes you look,
why are you always dressed up?

622
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:20.920
She always tells me that you're dressed like a bouncer.
Cause I just,
no,
I was,

623
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.370
no,
it's the thing about women,

624
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.930
they will step up your fucking wardrobe as I'm dressed like a complete jerk off.

625
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.300
I was going to wear my Adidas track suit and I said,
if I come in with this,

626
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:33.510
he's going to fucking murder me.
No,
no,
no.
You're not going with,
no,

627
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.630
I'm wearing this because I'm doing one of those all things.
Comedy,
poker thing.

628
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:40.270
So I'm dressing like a fucking Skye was born,
but I had an Adidas one day.

629
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.220
No.
Um,
but you know,
it was funny.
We were,

630
00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:48.510
I Sebastian's a party.
I remember uh,
for the,

631
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:52.470
for the baby and uh,
you were fucking hammered and,
and we were,

632
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.140
we were hanging out and telling you I was 22.
I went to go take a picture.

633
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.780
I was by his pool and somebody backed into my hand,

634
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.410
like barely touched my hand and I dropped a full whiskey into his fucking pool.

635
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.580
I was so embarrassed.
I just go,
no dude,
it's fine.
It's fine.

636
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.180
Was I've had hammered,
no it wasn't.
No,
I was here.
I'm seeing that a good way.

637
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.310
Cause we were all,
we were all drinking and it wasn't a drinker.

638
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.470
I was watching our wives and they just look at us from a distance and my wife's

639
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:22.630
nervous.
I can tell we don't,
we live in a great time.
I like,
dude,

640
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.060
we're going to read a fucking yacht in the Mediterranean.
We go,

641
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:30.240
all of us that we made,
we made these guys,
it'd be 300 bucks a piece.

642
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:33.840
We have an a great tire,
we'll get the fucking NFL network,
we'll film it.
Yeah,

643
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.930
you're special.
You weren't like,
yeah,

644
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.200
we're having a great time and I'm watching my wise and they're just nervous.

645
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:42.510
They're just watch and going,
what the fuck is going to happen?

646
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.040
I really don't think women get our relationships.
Like I,
I find that men,
we,

647
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.320
I mean,
at least me and my friends,
we bond through conflict in a sense.
Like,

648
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.540
like if I know you're an eagles fan and you know,
I'm a cowboys fan,

649
00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:58.510
I'm expecting you to go on your soup,
you know,
uh,
whatever.
Uh,

650
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.350
it's weird to say like watching them argue on real housewives,

651
00:37:01.351 --> 00:37:05.760
but they loved the drug when we act like real housewives over sports for some

652
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:10.620
reason that this is the thing I've been really,
uh,
I've been trying,

653
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.593
uh,

654
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.320
I guess the most accurate way to describe this as I've really been trying not to

655
00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:20.860
be me in my relationship.
It's so fucking hard.

656
00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:24.270
Like I'm starting to feel like that is the problem.
Like,
no,

657
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:27.510
we get along great.
But when there's,

658
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.140
when there's work to be done in the relationship,
it's,

659
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.460
it's always now bill,
you're this,
this and this.
And like,

660
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:38.370
I want one time I was hanging out with this,
this,
uh,
we,
we're,

661
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.630
we're treading on hard.
We're treading,
we gotta be careful with this.
Yeah.

662
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.900
At this party.
And I don't give a shit,
but like,
my wife's cool.
She'll fucking,

663
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.380
she doesn't listen to me anyways.
She has,
I forget what the other day,

664
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.720
my wife hasn't been to a stand up show of mine,
like three fucking,

665
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:54.930
she doesn't need to,
she lives with me.
My wife's sick of it.
Yeah.
I mean,

666
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:59.690
and it's not conducive for what?
Like,
you know,
for,
it is for like,
you know,

667
00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.280
imagine having to watch your wife talk for an hour.
Can you imagine?

668
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.760
Why would you do that?
Why would you do that to the person is same thing,
ah,

669
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:09.870
over why would you put them through that?
I have to,

670
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:13.440
I have total fucking empathy for my wife when it comes to that shit.

671
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.750
It's just I also,
what I might do,
the dishes.

672
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.570
What I also found that try to get something in the good and the good side of the

673
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:23.160
ledger
on the scorecard.
Yeah.
Something I,

674
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:27.580
uh,
I,
um,
I've found that my wife,
uh,
you know,
when,
when,
uh,

675
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.840
the one thing I've found attractive about her is that she was not laughing at

676
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:35.710
some of the Shit I was saying.
And I'm like,
okay,
this cross.
Yeah.

677
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.240
Like in my special about Robyn Shit when I was younger and stuff and you know,

678
00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:44.620
cause I was kind of a bad kid in a bad early adult and you know,
and she's like,

679
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:49.150
you know,
I,
I don't find that,
you know,
I mean,
I get why people think it's funny,

680
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:52.820
but,
and I'm just like,
alright,
this is a normal person.
Yeah.

681
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:57.100
Because I grew up in so much this function,
you have morals.
It's this,
this,

682
00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:57.934
this is new.

683
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:02.740
I'm saying I grew up in so much dysfunction that I didn't realize I grew up in

684
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:03.191
dysfunction.

685
00:39:03.191 --> 00:39:06.760
Like you think your shit's normal until you meet normal people and then,

686
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:10.800
and then you're like,
you know like Oh,
you know you have a dad would say to you,

687
00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:13.300
you,
you meet dialed down people.
Yeah,

688
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.220
they're not normal because eventually you just,

689
00:39:15.221 --> 00:39:18.100
you realize that on some level they're out of their fucking mind.

690
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:22.000
It's just not the kind of automated mine that's going to get you arrested.

691
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.410
Well like my,
my,

692
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:28.150
nobody in my wife's family knows anybody that's been to jail and I know like 15

693
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:31.210
people,
you know and tell them you are in those circles.
I don't know.

694
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:32.980
But I'm saying to me and my friends,
you know,

695
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:35.260
you think that shit's normal and then,

696
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.350
but it's not like I've met people though.

697
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.620
Those are like the tips you're getting like how to survive in jail as a part of,

698
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.470
it's supposed to,
you need two years of a language.

699
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.410
I have a couple of extra curricular activities so you can get into a good school

700
00:39:48.411 --> 00:39:49.540
that there are people that around it,

701
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:51.490
people that are in it and people that are about it.

702
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.420
I was just around it and I kind of dip my toe in it and I,
and I actually,
uh,

703
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.950
again,
not to preface it by saying on stage this,
that,
uh,
I'm,
I'm,
I just,

704
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:03.910
because I committed crimes as doesn't mean I'm a criminal and yes it does.
No,

705
00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:06.460
it does some millennial shit.
No,
it's not.
If you ever,

706
00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:08.810
if you ever hang out with a fucking criminal there,

707
00:40:08.811 --> 00:40:11.260
it's just a whole different breed.
And when you're saying,

708
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:14.230
I played high school football,
I'm not a football player.
Yes you are.

709
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.550
You're not a pro.
What do you got to kill?
Somebody says,
why?
We argue.

710
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:25.150
I'm saying is that like,
yeah,
okay,
you commit crimes,
you know,
you know,

711
00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:29.440
but when you're younger it's not,
you're not,
there's a certain type of,
all right,

712
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.000
how about this?
Get it [inaudible] Bob,
you know,

713
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.770
you go get a fucking party doesn't make you a comic.
Okay.

714
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.250
But it makes you funny worked if it worked.
This is what I'm picturing you on.

715
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.980
Like the,
you know,
the draft day for the NFL,

716
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.910
it's for the mob and you're waiting to get that call.
And it's like the seventh,

717
00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:50.350
eighth round and you just didn't get it.

718
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.330
You got on the taxi squad that League folded.
Yeah.

719
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:57.220
You got on the taxi squad and everything and you will never,
you just weren't,
uh,

720
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.380
you didn't quite make it to the mop so you weren't like,

721
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.300
oh you want a career criminal.
But a few,

722
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.290
I just like my wife and she's normal and her families,
uh,
you know,
nor,
okay.

723
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.800
That was the point.
You're trying to turn into a big argument.
Okay.
No,
but I,

724
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.580
I get what you're saying.
I'm not trying to sugarcoat and it just,

725
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:17.050
it is what it is.
What,
say you,
Erin,
what would you say?

726
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.870
Is he a cause there's different levels.
Cause there's,
there's a punk,

727
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:25.450
there's a dirt bag and then there's a criminal and then as a career criminal and

728
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:28.960
then there's a psycho.
Where would you say he,
he's on that spectrum.

729
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.230
It's like he was a punk.
He,
he grew out of it.
You know,

730
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.020
that was a juvenile delinquent.
Yeah.
Jane,
fairness to him.

731
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:39.860
He never said what he did.
But I figure if somebody said I committed crimes,

732
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.580
that's beyond,
you know,
writing clearly just stealing shit,
stealing.

733
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.880
Like I stole a car in middle school and then that's a felony.
I know.

734
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.510
And then me and my brother wanted cars,
like you'll go to jail for that.
But my,

735
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:55.220
my friend,
I just rode shotgun and laugh the whole fucking time.
What kind of car?

736
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.930
I don't even remember.
It was like an 85 86 tried to steal a car.

737
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.410
It was actually a truck.
We've tried to steal a truck.
Did you?
This,

738
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.060
we got in it and then we were looking for keys on the visor and we couldn't find

739
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:12.380
it.
So then we just pushed it down the hill into a ribbon.
That's just being dumb.

740
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.230
And you know what I mean?
That's not,
you're not a criminal.
I don't remember.

741
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.890
I remember we were pushing all the wheels were like locked and then when

742
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:22.880
something snapped and it was going,
I remember pushing it and laughing so hard.

743
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.610
I couldn't feel my legs and we almost,
we will,

744
00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:31.020
we was shit faced and trying to run back to the car drunk laughing.

745
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:32.510
It just what you did.

746
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:36.230
And then I remember we all had to get ruined some but then we all had to get the

747
00:42:36.231 --> 00:42:39.110
fuck outta there.
God I haven't thought about that.
And Trevor,

748
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:42.320
we all need to get the fuck out.
And I remember the next day my buddy,
uh,
going,

749
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:46.040
I feel like we got cheated out of that laugh cause we all had to fucking just,

750
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.660
well you're the funniest out of your friends during the day too broad daylight

751
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.140
and you were drunk and we would drunk was it summer or some shit now somebody

752
00:42:54.141 --> 00:42:56.430
somehow that was the winter.
That was a lot.

753
00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.480
It was the weekend and somebody somehow had got a case of beer and you know,

754
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:04.970
one of the steels you just start drinking like you know,
and I got an idea.

755
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.800
Well you know how like you,
uh,

756
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.100
like the way you drink when you first drink is like give me that shit about like

757
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:12.170
it's way worse.
Like,
if there's a poisonous snake,

758
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:16.190
its way worse to get bitten by a baby one than a,
an adult because adult,
no,

759
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.390
we'll give you just enough to fuck you up or the baby,
the baby,

760
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:23.030
just like both barrels.
That's how you drink.

761
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.000
Like when you're an adult and you drink,
you're a gentleman,
you sip and shit.

762
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.910
You know you're like Gleason in the fucking the hustler.
Right?

763
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:31.760
But like when you're a kid,
you fast Eddie and you're sucking it down,

764
00:43:31.761 --> 00:43:35.690
you're fucking mess.
That's the way we were drinking.
And we ended up,
you know,

765
00:43:35.691 --> 00:43:39.560
and we were underage.
So you end up in a parking lot of the woods.

766
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.870
Now here's where you were in a parking lot.
Here's the difference.

767
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:43.640
To my point now let's just say that.
And I'm,

768
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:46.550
I'm with my friends and there's one kid that's like,
Hey,
I have an idea.

769
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:51.020
Let's break into this dude's apartment.
Okay.
And then you're like,
okay,

770
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:53.900
cause it'll be fun to break in somebody's apartment.

771
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.400
But this guy's got other motives.
Like he's like,
he's like,
Nah,
Nah,
Nah.

772
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.820
I know we're going to take the credit cards.
I'm going to take the keys,

773
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.900
like he's got it planned out,
but I'm in it just because I think it's fun.

774
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.100
You're in it for the story.
Yeah.
And the laugh.
Yeah.
The story.
Absolutely.

775
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:12.920
You know when you're a young dude and you're trying to get a rep,
you know and,

776
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:15.770
and you're just so,
that's when you commit the crime.

777
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:18.380
But then there's the guy that's like,
no,
no,
no.

778
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.690
Oh he sees a future and see like he's,
he's like,
here's what you're going do.

779
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.130
I'm to put a house on this.
Yeah.

780
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.330
And then this other guy's going to have to pay for.
Absolutely.

781
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.440
Ever since you were never going to get caught.
That would be a huge,

782
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.290
that would be the difference between like,
cause when,

783
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.990
when my buddy pulled up with the car,

784
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.880
I jumped in the car and we just went cruising and we ended up wrecking it.

785
00:44:37.881 --> 00:44:38.551
It was four of us.

786
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:42.630
I would love to tell this story one time about that night because there was four

787
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:43.261
of us,
me and my,

788
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:46.530
well you should tell it on your podcast if you're on the list and I won't do it

789
00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:48.930
now.
Yeah.
And is that what you said?

790
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:52.650
A passive aggressive way for me to say shut the fuck up with this story or is

791
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:53.484
that like a week?

792
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.040
Cause cause that seemed like he didn't want to tell it now if you want to tell

793
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:58.050
it now.
Always said no it's not even that long.

794
00:44:58.051 --> 00:45:01.200
I'm just saying like if I could ever write a short film or something.
Oh okay.

795
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:04.470
It was just an interesting night that the two of us,
the four of us,

796
00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:06.120
two of us got pinched in.
The other two didn't.

797
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.770
And they didn't write you out or anything?
No.
Did you ever have the only time we,

798
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.220
we still a case of beer out of a,

799
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:14.710
out of a fucking liquor store and the whole thing was like a,

800
00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.270
as soon as the deal.
So we came up with this idea,

801
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.830
oh I can't tell this story because we just don't use names because we're,
we're,

802
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:27.630
we're,
we're doing some of it,
uh,
on a project that I'm working on,

803
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:31.020
so I can't,
I can't give this away,
but we fucking were given these,

804
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.770
these people like blue ball story,
Blue Blob,
Paul's here.
Um,

805
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.580
you know the deal is there's basically you fucking walk in the oldest guy

806
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:42.240
looking kid and you just fucking,
you walk in,
you stay aligned.
You know,

807
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:45.090
you act like you're going to pay.
And at the last second you fucking run out.

808
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.400
And uh,
yeah,
it was one of those grocery stores when I,
I mean I had no money man.

809
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:55.080
And um,
I'm like 19,
I was washing dishes at Hooters.
I had like three,

810
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:57.870
I was bouncing at a nightclub washing dishes at Hooters.

811
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.760
I was trying to do something with my life.

812
00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:03.140
I was going to have to clean the grease trap.
That's the fucking worst man.

813
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.470
We had do it every night.
Cause cause that's not bad.
Ours was every three months,

814
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:10.320
it'd be three months.
Agree to clean the fucking fryers,
man,

815
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.400
that was a pain in the empty all the oil out.
I was a prep cook.
I robbed,

816
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.980
I robbed every place I worked for a man.
That's how I ate.

817
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:21.120
I used to kangaroo pouch,
my apron.
And then when I was like prepping food,

818
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:25.680
I would put it in my apron.
I had a fuck.
Do you mean that's how you ate?
Well,

819
00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:27.960
I was,
I was pretty much on my own.
I mean,
I was,

820
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.900
I was one of those losers that went away to community college.

821
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:37.830
I'd never heard of that,
you know,
I never knew say [inaudible].
No,

822
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.430
it does it,
that's the point.
I'm,

823
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.630
I'm crashing at some other dude's apartment and then,
um,

824
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:45.590
I was trying to go to school and just try and get my life going,
man.

825
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.740
And when I worked there,

826
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:51.060
I just used to stack up on food at a cooler in the trunk.
Oh,
you will,
bro.
Okay.

827
00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:54.150
Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
But I've told this story before.

828
00:46:54.151 --> 00:46:57.030
I was working in this restaurant and it was this guy who worked there and he

829
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:57.864
fucking,

830
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.010
he lost his license for drinking and driving so many times that there was no

831
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:05.850
date that he was going to get his license back.
And this was the 80s,

832
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.111
and he had lost it.

833
00:47:07.111 --> 00:47:09.180
This is right when mothers against drinking and driving came out.

834
00:47:09.181 --> 00:47:10.680
Like he did the level of fuck up.

835
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:15.150
You had to be [inaudible] and he was about 34,
35.

836
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.440
And he already had the gin.

837
00:47:16.441 --> 00:47:20.430
Blossom knows he looked like he looked like WC fields.
Yeah.

838
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.510
And he was dirty for 35.
Right.
And uh,

839
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:29.230
so he used to ride this moped to work.
I was living in North Carolina and fuck,

840
00:47:29.231 --> 00:47:30.040
he used to ride this

841
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.420
<v 0>moped to work and he lived in a trailer park.
So this fucking moped,</v>

842
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:37.300
he didn't have a driver's license.
This was it.
This was it for this guy.

843
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:39.730
Like this was his motive.
Fucking transportation.

844
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.030
I remember he used to be like an on cold winter days that you'd come to work and

845
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:45.670
he would always be drunk and hungover.
See would shower late.

846
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.490
And he would come to work and his hair would still be when he would have frost

847
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:50.830
on his hair.
He was like fucking grandpa monster.
Right?

848
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:56.310
So time he parked it back there and this other kid who was Emma was into

849
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.080
Metallica,
classic burnout teenager.
He had like,

850
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.640
he like never shaved his upper lip.

851
00:48:00.641 --> 00:48:03.010
So he had that awful prepubescent in fucking mustache.

852
00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:06.460
That little looked like somebody said a little tip on.
Yeah,
it's always blonde,

853
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.160
no matter what color you have.
Jet Black.
Hey that little blonde mustache,
right?

854
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:14.330
So we thought it'd be funny if we took his moped and hid the thing and he think

855
00:48:14.331 --> 00:48:16.790
that it was stolen.
Watching them freak out and be like,
ah yeah,

856
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:17.501
we'll tell you what it is.

857
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:20.830
So just to freak this guy out in this guy had like nothing,
right?

858
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.160
So he was in waiting tables and we took his moped and behind the restaurant was

859
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:29.710
this little shed built into a hill that they kept all the extra kegs of beer and

860
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:33.040
all that stuff.
So we wheeled it around and put it up on the roof.

861
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:35.050
Cause you could just walk up and it was like a driveway.

862
00:48:35.051 --> 00:48:38.320
You went up and we just stuck it up on the fucking roof and just left it there.

863
00:48:38.321 --> 00:48:40.830
And he came out and he thought he was fucking freaking out.

864
00:48:40.831 --> 00:48:44.410
I remember pretending to wash dishes and my shoulders were shaking watching this

865
00:48:44.411 --> 00:48:46.270
guy.
I mean this was like his fucking hope diamond.

866
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.960
And then finally we couldn't stop and we just all started laughing.
He's like,

867
00:48:49.961 --> 00:48:52.390
you fucking assholes.
And we go,
yeah,
it's up on the roof.
And we walked out,

868
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:54.550
we went up on the roof and it was gone.
Somebody stylist.

869
00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:01.090
That's so fucking awful.
No,
it gets better.
So he reports it stolen.

870
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.170
They ended up catching the kid like two days later and the kid had tried to

871
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:07.270
paint it,
I'll never forget,
it was a silver one in needs,

872
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.750
sprayed all this black on it,
did a shit job and it looked like fucking shit.

873
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:15.130
And I remember like three days later the Guy Riding Back to work with Frost and

874
00:49:15.131 --> 00:49:19.060
his mustache and this horrible silver and like fucked up black paint all over
it.

875
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:22.060
I actually really felt bad.
I felt bad about that.

876
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.190
Do you ever remember the kid growing up with the minibike?

877
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.270
That kid was always gonna equal scumbag like he did.
You guys make many bikes?

878
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:31.320
Have that kid that had the mini bike with the lawn mower.
I met mom.

879
00:49:31.321 --> 00:49:33.130
My parents were like,
you're not riding those fucking things.

880
00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:35.770
They both in the medical field.
So,
uh,

881
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.900
one of my brothers bought one and had it hit buttons,
another shed.

882
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.340
There was always a shed when I was growing up.

883
00:49:41.341 --> 00:49:45.280
He sh he had it hid behind there and just the pressure of it,

884
00:49:45.281 --> 00:49:47.770
cause he had to keep it away from us.
He thought I was going to read it.

885
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:51.310
He did he buy it from a kid that made it or was it like a legit don't always a

886
00:49:51.311 --> 00:49:54.760
moped and we bought it.
It wasn't a,
it wasn't a dirt bike,
but my,
uh,

887
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:57.220
my parents were like,
you know,
in the medical field.

888
00:49:57.221 --> 00:49:59.410
So no matter what you wanted to do,
if it's remotely dangerous,

889
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.780
my dad's thing was Christ.
They had to paste in the other day,

890
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.990
she's riding a moped,
a blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and he's gone.

891
00:50:04.991 --> 00:50:07.390
He was always dead.
No matter what the fuck you wanted to dope.

892
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:10.330
He had a patient in the end of the day,
you know,
and it's just like,

893
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:13.510
I've got data instead.
It was just so fucking,
well what a coincidence dad.

894
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.510
Every fucking thing I want to do.
And it's like one of those,

895
00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:20.080
they always play that worst possible scenario game.
But here's the thing,

896
00:50:20.081 --> 00:50:22.360
now that I've got a kid,
I totally get it.
I totally did.

897
00:50:22.361 --> 00:50:27.160
They tell you that like once you have a kid you'll understand.
No,
no baby.

898
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.310
My parents were great thing about them is they let you figure out as much as

899
00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:35.570
they stayed on you on the big shit,
don't do drugs and all of that and uh,

900
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:40.490
stressed education.
They let you figure out a lot of shit.
Um,

901
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.980
and I think that that's why,
you know,

902
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:47.840
people in my family are like self sufficient and have that fucking,
you know,

903
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.150
you don't stand around looking at the rock.
You're like,
oh,

904
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.740
I guess I have to push this fucking thing or it's not going to move.
Yeah.
I,
uh,

905
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:58.230
I remember like in like the life lessons,
remember,
uh,

906
00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.560
a piece of shit pickup truck.

907
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:04.550
And I bought and it was my first car and it broke down.

908
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:09.560
And so I got on the pay phone so long ago,
this was,
I fucking called my mom,

909
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.990
like mom,
big talkers and storing with,

910
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.750
through the whole fucking scenario when I got to be at work and we'll have
lunch,

911
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.330
she listened to the whole fucking thing.
Was it saying anything?

912
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:21.440
And then I finished that.
She goes,
well,
what would you have me do?

913
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.590
And I was like,
Oh shit.
And I looked down,

914
00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:26.330
there was a phone book right there and I was,
you know,

915
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.610
somebody fucking ripped all the pages out.
And I said,
all right,

916
00:51:28.611 --> 00:51:32.510
I guess I got to call a tow truck.
I mean,
yeah,

917
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.520
she was one step away from calling me a pussy.
My mom.

918
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:41.270
Yeah.
Like,
why are you fucking like,
what am I a fucking mechanic?

919
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.440
All of that was in that.
You have a dime.
Why didn't you fucking,

920
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.620
it was a dime back there.
Why did you fucking call me?
Call a fucking toe.

921
00:51:48.621 --> 00:51:51.020
What am I going to go down there and pick the truck up?
You fucking moron.

922
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:54.320
I know you suck at math.
Are you bad at life too?

923
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:57.020
I heard all of that and I felt stupid.

924
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:01.650
I remember I was mad at her and then,
but was it tough love or was it no,

925
00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:05.060
it was total tongue bothering me.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It was all planned.

926
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:09.320
It was tough love because it was just like,
this kid's got to learn.
Yeah,

927
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:11.750
because one of these days you're going to be on your own.

928
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:17.390
And like I saw Dana Carvey dual hilarious bit about that where,
you know,

929
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:20.030
his kids were calling him up or something like that because something wasn't

930
00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:22.670
working rather than calling the landlord.
And I guess,

931
00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:25.760
I guess that's a thing with kids nowadays.
Like they,
uh,

932
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.500
his generation went too far over correcting because like,

933
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:32.990
you know,
if you watch like his comedy,
you know,

934
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:36.890
the old guy and I got a game called stare at the sun,
you know,
like,

935
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:40.010
I think his was so tough that then there was maybe like a bit of an

936
00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:42.950
overcorrection,
but I remember when he was doing that bit,
it's,
uh,

937
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.680
I'm not gonna try to Redo it.
It was fucking hilarious,

938
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:49.430
but it reminded me of that story and that they can like,
once again,

939
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:53.270
how right my mother was being like,
all right,

940
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:57.200
well you have a fucking brain use it.
The,
the thing that,
uh,

941
00:52:57.201 --> 00:52:58.370
I found the difference,

942
00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:03.410
like the way our parents were raised and the way they raised us is like,

943
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:07.040
my mom,
when she was younger,
you know,
you stay outside,
kids played outside,

944
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:09.350
you come home when the lights came on.
I mean,
you're,
you're,

945
00:53:09.351 --> 00:53:11.420
you're a little older than me.
Um,

946
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.660
and where I grew up is also was a little different too in North Jersey at the

947
00:53:14.661 --> 00:53:19.010
time,
you know,
it wasn't,
our parents raised me the US the same way,

948
00:53:19.011 --> 00:53:21.950
but the outside wasn't safe,
if that makes any sense.

949
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.360
When they were younger it was safe.

950
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.520
But then like come home when the lights are on,
you're like okay and I'm Ryan,

951
00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:29.130
bye bye fucking crack heads.
And you know,

952
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:33.930
because to them they were raised that way and then I think our parents saw a lot

953
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:37.430
of shit they shouldn't have seen at a young age.
People our age,
you know,

954
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.170
and now they're over protective.
Yeah.

955
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:45.000
I don't know how to like [inaudible] with like kids like your kids your age.

956
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:46.950
I know you guys are going to be a happy medium.

957
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.850
You don't really fucked me up was you know that I'm about to catch a predator.

958
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:51.480
Yeah.

959
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.480
Like that like makes it seem that there's a fucking creep behind every tree.

960
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.840
And I don't know if back in the date,

961
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.870
cause back in the day you just say he's a dirty old man,
stay away from them.

962
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:09.030
But I think that there's a,
uh,
with the Internet.
Yeah.
Yeah.

963
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:14.450
I see the ability for people to act on stuff and feed shit [inaudible] and watch

964
00:54:16.411 --> 00:54:18.570
all this porn and all of this type of stuff.

965
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:21.150
And I think it drives these fucking people.
Well,

966
00:54:21.151 --> 00:54:24.980
the Internet is like one big fucking neighborhood and,
and,

967
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:28.140
and there is no really securing,
I mean,

968
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:31.880
there's shit that I see in my feet and I'm like,
what the fuck are you of?

969
00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:34.320
Comments are kind of getting away from kind of getting okay.

970
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:37.830
But the thing about it is though,
the Internet is fucking incredible too.
If you,

971
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.740
if you try to learn shit,
they'll ride shit.
Like,
dude,

972
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:42.660
if you want to get that Fucking v drums,

973
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:45.720
if you want to learn a bunch of Shit [inaudible] uh,
you know,
there's some,

974
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.820
there's everybody,
there's always somebody doing a drum cover.
We'll,

975
00:54:48.821 --> 00:54:51.780
we'll break down something that you can't fucking figure out right now.

976
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:56.970
There's like some monster fucking teachers out there.
Uh,
uh,
Mike Johnston,

977
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.910
uh,
the guy take lessons with Dave [inaudible] just started doing shit.

978
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:03.720
And these guys are like,
these guys are like legit fucking like,

979
00:55:03.721 --> 00:55:07.550
they know what they're doing.
Uh,
and,
and like,

980
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.670
so if you stay in those areas,
learning how to cook,
you're good,
you're good.

981
00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.790
<v 1>But the Internet is,
is an exact,
uh,
what's the word I'm looking at?</v>

982
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.760
It's just an exact replica of human nature.
Is that like,
you know,
first of all,

983
00:55:19.761 --> 00:55:21.800
the idea that we're going to build this information highway,

984
00:55:21.801 --> 00:55:23.420
we're going to connect people all over the world.

985
00:55:23.421 --> 00:55:26.980
We're going to learn from each other.
And like 80% of it is porn.

986
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.270
And then click bait.

987
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:35.930
He got these fucking scumbag people in these fake articles and

988
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:40.690
<v 0>Oh,
fun.
Yeah,
we bought it.
And then there's that.
That's human nature man.</v>

989
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:45.030
And it's an exact uh,
replica of,
I've kind of been,
I've,
I've been awake,

990
00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:49.570
I'm trying to be vice lists here in April.
Like,
nope,

991
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.840
no poor,
no cigars,
no booze.
I fucked up the other day.

992
00:55:52.841 --> 00:55:56.950
I took a couple of hits a week cause I jerked off to,
so while smoking a cigar,

993
00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:01.230
um,
dude,
I haven't had a drink since new year's man.
Oh,
you know what,
Dude,

994
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.830
I think what we're going over here before,
uh,

995
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.940
before I just saw in the next podcast guy look into here.
Um,
before I,
uh,

996
00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:09.940
get outta here,
I do have to address the fact that the,
uh,

997
00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.470
congratulations to the maple leafs.

998
00:56:11.471 --> 00:56:15.760
You guys finally fucking showed up and played a hell of a game.
Uh,

999
00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:17.700
but I feel good,
but this is going to come out Thursday.

1000
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:21.720
I feel good about our chances Thursday considering,
uh,
you know,
I,

1001
00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:25.630
I just don't see us getting 40 on goal again and,
and losing.

1002
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:28.030
So all we gotta do is when this next one,
we'll up three games to one,

1003
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:32.890
but it was a phenomenal game and that was the first game in this series that

1004
00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:36.220
felt like playoff hockey where,
uh,
both teams will fucking out there killing it.

1005
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:39.910
So I look forward to tonight's game for a Brett Arts.
