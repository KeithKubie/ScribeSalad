there in the watch face complications

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410
there in the watch face complications
 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.770
there in the watch face complications
are also capable so you can deep link to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780
are also capable so you can deep link to
 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.659

them the third design principle is

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
them the third design principle is
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.600
them the third design principle is
consistent complications should have a

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610
consistent complications should have a
 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.310
consistent complications should have a
healthy relationship with the watch face

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320
healthy relationship with the watch face
 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.520
healthy relationship with the watch face
as Olli just said with complications or

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530
as Olli just said with complications or
 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.440
as Olli just said with complications or
not on Android wear the watch face

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450
not on Android wear the watch face
 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.969
not on Android wear the watch face
decides how the complications are

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979
decides how the complications are
 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.340
decides how the complications are
rendered so they feel part of the same

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350
rendered so they feel part of the same
 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.590

so complications are all about data

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970
so complications are all about data
 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.060
so complications are all about data
supplied by provider apps and displayed

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070

on watch faces this could include
 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.500
on watch faces this could include
numerical data like your battery level

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510
numerical data like your battery level

not every type of data will fit on every
watch face there might only be space for

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139
watch face there might only be space for
 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.450

you might want to use numerical data

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690
you might want to use numerical data
 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.089
you might want to use numerical data
without having to show text or images so

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099
without having to show text or images so
 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.800
without having to show text or images so
watch faces need to say what they can

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810
watch faces need to say what they can
 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.770
watch faces need to say what they can
display and data providers need to say

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780
display and data providers need to say
 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.800
display and data providers need to say
what they can supply to help with this

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810
what they can supply to help with this
 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.020
what they can supply to help with this
we've defined a number of complication

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030
we've defined a number of complication
 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.219
we've defined a number of complication
types complication types determine what

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229
types complication types determine what
 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.920
types complication types determine what
kinds of data are included there's

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
kinds of data are included there's
 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.690
kinds of data are included there's
usually one field that's the key piece

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700
usually one field that's the key piece
 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.820
usually one field that's the key piece
of information and we've named the types

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830
of information and we've named the types
 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.250
of information and we've named the types
after that field so here you see

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260
after that field so here you see
 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.129
after that field so here you see
examples of the short text type these

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139
examples of the short text type these
 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.779
examples of the short text type these
are all short text complications but as

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789
are all short text complications but as
 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.219
are all short text complications but as
you can see there are optional elements

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229
you can see there are optional elements
 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.650
you can see there are optional elements
there may be an icon or a second string

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660
there may be an icon or a second string
 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.719
there may be an icon or a second string
but the most important value is

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729
but the most important value is
 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.500
but the most important value is
contained in the short text field if

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510
contained in the short text field if
 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.649
contained in the short text field if
you're a data provider you can choose

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659
you're a data provider you can choose
 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.940
you're a data provider you can choose
which of the optional fields to include

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950
which of the optional fields to include
 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.310
which of the optional fields to include
but a short text complication must

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320
but a short text complication must
 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.480
but a short text complication must
always include the short

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490
always include the short
 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.629
always include the short
next field if you're building a watch

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639
next field if you're building a watch
 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.270
next field if you're building a watch
face and you support short text you need

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280
face and you support short text you need
 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.350
face and you support short text you need
to consider all of these variations in

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360
to consider all of these variations in
 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.450
to consider all of these variations in
with some other examples you might not

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460
with some other examples you might not
 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.300
with some other examples you might not
need any text to convey the information

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310
need any text to convey the information
 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.230
need any text to convey the information
then maybe the icon type is enough or if

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240
then maybe the icon type is enough or if
 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.050
then maybe the icon type is enough or if
you have numerical data within bounds

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060
you have numerical data within bounds
 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.689
you have numerical data within bounds
like a percentage then the ranged value

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699
like a percentage then the ranged value
 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.520
like a percentage then the ranged value
type could be for you we also have a few

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530
type could be for you we also have a few
 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.240
type could be for you we also have a few
other types you'll notice that we have

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250
other types you'll notice that we have
 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.149
other types you'll notice that we have
both icon and small image the difference

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:14.159
both icon and small image the difference
 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:16.939
both icon and small image the difference
is that images for the icon field should

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:16.949
is that images for the icon field should
 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.710
is that images for the icon field should
be tinta Balai the watch face there

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720
be tinta Balai the watch face there
 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.730
be tinta Balai the watch face there
should be single color with a

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740
should be single color with a
 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.189
should be single color with a
transparent background this allows the

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199
transparent background this allows the
 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.439
transparent background this allows the
watch face to fit it better to its style

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:24.449
watch face to fit it better to its style
 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.899
watch face to fit it better to its style
so if you're building a watch face where

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909
so if you're building a watch face where
 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:29.770
so if you're building a watch face where
full color images won't match the style

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780
full color images won't match the style
 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.689
full color images won't match the style
then you can support the icon type but

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699
then you can support the icon type but
 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:33.950
then you can support the icon type but
you might not want to support the small

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960
you might not want to support the small
 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.379
you might not want to support the small
image type where images may be full

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389
image type where images may be full
 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.820
image type where images may be full
color so when you're thinking about the

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830
color so when you're thinking about the
 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.469
color so when you're thinking about the
different complication types if you are

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479
different complication types if you are
 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.570
different complication types if you are
building a provider think about the

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580
building a provider think about the
 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.480
building a provider think about the
different forms your data can take and

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490
different forms your data can take and
 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.830
different forms your data can take and
if you're building complications into a

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840
if you're building complications into a
 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.110
if you're building complications into a
watch face think about how many of the

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120
watch face think about how many of the
 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.790
watch face think about how many of the
types you want to support now back to

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800
types you want to support now back to
 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.800
types you want to support now back to
Tony to talk about some more guidelines

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:57.810
Tony to talk about some more guidelines
 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.879
Tony to talk about some more guidelines
for watch face developers okay so I want

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:01.889
for watch face developers okay so I want
 

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.020
for watch face developers okay so I want
to talk a little bit about the things

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.030
to talk a little bit about the things
 

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.610
to talk a little bit about the things
you should consider when designing

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620
you should consider when designing
 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.850
you should consider when designing
complications however bear in mind there

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860
complications however bear in mind there
 

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.860
complications however bear in mind there
isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:09.870
isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to
 

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.290
isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to
this we have a diverse collection of

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300
this we have a diverse collection of
 

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.600
this we have a diverse collection of
watch faces on the platform and we think

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:14.610
watch faces on the platform and we think
 

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.520
watch faces on the platform and we think
it's important that complications are

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:16.530
it's important that complications are
 

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.870
it's important that complications are
flexible enough to measure of that

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880
flexible enough to measure of that
 

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.409
flexible enough to measure of that
diversity so please use these guidelines

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419
diversity so please use these guidelines
 

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:23.870
diversity so please use these guidelines
as a starting point but if you feel your

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:23.880
as a starting point but if you feel your
 

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.459
as a starting point but if you feel your
watch face would benefit from deviating

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:25.469
watch face would benefit from deviating
 

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:27.140
watch face would benefit from deviating

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.240
how this all fits together
Android wear manages the flow of data

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.250
Android wear manages the flow of data
 

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.590
Android wear manages the flow of data
between data providers and watch faces

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600
between data providers and watch faces
 

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.150
between data providers and watch faces
when data is needed for a complication

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160
when data is needed for a complication
 

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.520
when data is needed for a complication
Android wear will send an update request

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:45.530
Android wear will send an update request
 

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.740
Android wear will send an update request
to the data provider asking for a

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:47.750
to the data provider asking for a
 

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.610
to the data provider asking for a
specific type of data the provider

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:51.620
specific type of data the provider
 

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.250
specific type of data the provider
builds a complication data object of

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:54.260
builds a complication data object of
 

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.190
builds a complication data object of
that type with the required fields and

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200
that type with the required fields and
 

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.510
that type with the required fields and
sends it back to where Android wear then

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:01.520
sends it back to where Android wear then
 

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.640
sends it back to where Android wear then
forwards that onto the watch face which

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:03.650
forwards that onto the watch face which
 

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.170
forwards that onto the watch face which
can then include it when it renders

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:07.180
 

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.940
Android wear also provides the UI that

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:09.950
Android wear also provides the UI that
 

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.280
Android wear also provides the UI that
allows users to choose providers for

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.290
allows users to choose providers for
 

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.170
allows users to choose providers for
each complication and we'll talk about

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.180
each complication and we'll talk about
 

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.560
each complication and we'll talk about
that in a bit but now let's take a look

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:17.570
that in a bit but now let's take a look
 

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:18.670
that in a bit but now let's take a look
at what you need to do to add

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680
at what you need to do to add
 

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:24.280
at what you need to do to add
complications to a watch face so first

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.290
complications to a watch face so first
 

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.840
complications to a watch face so first
of all you need to decide how many

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:25.850
of all you need to decide how many
 

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.540
of all you need to decide how many
complications to include and what types

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:28.550
complications to include and what types
 

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.020
complications to include and what types
to support in each one so for this

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.030
to support in each one so for this
 

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.150
to support in each one so for this
example let's say you want to include a

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160
example let's say you want to include a
 

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.110
example let's say you want to include a
small round complication on the right

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120
small round complication on the right
 

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.540
small round complication on the right
now in that space we could support short

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:40.550
now in that space we could support short
 

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.570
now in that space we could support short
text we could also support icon and

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:45.580
text we could also support icon and
 

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.790
text we could also support icon and
there's also enough space there to show

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800
there's also enough space there to show
 

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.300
there's also enough space there to show
a ranged value now in that space we

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:52.310
a ranged value now in that space we
 

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.640
a ranged value now in that space we
could if we wanted support small image

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:54.650
could if we wanted support small image
 

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.590
could if we wanted support small image
as well but let's say for the for this

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600
as well but let's say for the for this
 

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.280
as well but let's say for the for this
example that we don't want to now let's

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.290
example that we don't want to now let's
 

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.510
example that we don't want to now let's
say we also want to include a

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:01.520
say we also want to include a
 

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.840
say we also want to include a
complication at the bottom this one

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:04.850
complication at the bottom this one
 

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.180
complication at the bottom this one
could support the same types as the

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.190
could support the same types as the
 

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.180
could support the same types as the
first one but there's also enough space

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:10.190
first one but there's also enough space
 

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.180
first one but there's also enough space
to make this one wider so it could

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.190
to make this one wider so it could
 

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.570
to make this one wider so it could
support the long text type note that we

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:16.580
support the long text type note that we
 

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.830
support the long text type note that we
consider this to be the same

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:17.840
consider this to be the same
 

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.180
consider this to be the same
complication even though it's a

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.190
complication even though it's a
 

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.080
complication even though it's a
different shape depending on the type so

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.090
different shape depending on the type so
 

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.700
different shape depending on the type so
to summarise these are the types

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:24.710
to summarise these are the types
 

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.230
to summarise these are the types
supported by each of those complications

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240
supported by each of those complications
 

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.310
supported by each of those complications
one more thing you need to give each

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320
one more thing you need to give each
 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.880
one more thing you need to give each
complication a numerical ID so that you

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:33.890
complication a numerical ID so that you
 

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.340
complication a numerical ID so that you
can refer to it with the system that's

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:36.350
can refer to it with the system that's
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.920
can refer to it with the system that's
chosen by the watch face we call it the

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:38.930
chosen by the watch face we call it the
 

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.230
chosen by the watch face we call it the
watch face complication ID and it can be

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240
watch face complication ID and it can be
 

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.590
watch face complication ID and it can be
any

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600
 

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.590
okay so next you need a way for the user

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600
okay so next you need a way for the user
 

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.300
okay so next you need a way for the user
to choose providers for each

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:49.310
to choose providers for each
 

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:53.860
to choose providers for each
complication as I mentioned earlier

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:53.870
complication as I mentioned earlier
 

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.710
complication as I mentioned earlier
Android wear provides the UI to choose a

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720
Android wear provides the UI to choose a
 

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.989
Android wear provides the UI to choose a
provider for a particular complication

00:14:58.989 --> 00:14:58.999
provider for a particular complication
 

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.710
provider for a particular complication
but the rest of the UI is up to you

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720
but the rest of the UI is up to you
 

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.299
but the rest of the UI is up to you
so what we're showing here on the slide

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:04.309
so what we're showing here on the slide
 

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:07.629
so what we're showing here on the slide
is a basic list that could be part of

00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639
is a basic list that could be part of
 

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:09.519
is a basic list that could be part of
the watch faces config activity as the

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:09.529
the watch faces config activity as the
 

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:12.069
the watch faces config activity as the
watch faces own settings so this screen

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079
watch faces own settings so this screen
 

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:15.790
watch faces own settings so this screen
is not provided by the system so when

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800
is not provided by the system so when
 

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.319
is not provided by the system so when
they use a tap on an item in this list

00:15:17.319 --> 00:15:17.329
they use a tap on an item in this list
 

00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:19.660
they use a tap on an item in this list
the watch face needs to launch that

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:19.670
the watch face needs to launch that
 

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.710
the watch face needs to launch that
system provider chooser let's look at

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720
system provider chooser let's look at
 

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.009
system provider chooser let's look at
some code so in order to do that you use

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:27.019
some code so in order to do that you use
 

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:29.439
some code so in order to do that you use
this support library method to get hold

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:29.449
this support library method to get hold
 

00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:31.179
this support library method to get hold
of an intent that's create provider

00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:31.189
of an intent that's create provider
 

00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:34.960
of an intent that's create provider
chooser intent you pass in the watch

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:34.970
chooser intent you pass in the watch
 

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.840
chooser intent you pass in the watch
face component name that's the package

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:37.850
face component name that's the package
 

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.879
face component name that's the package
and class name of your watch face that's

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:39.889
and class name of your watch face that's
 

00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:41.290
and class name of your watch face that's
just how you refer to your watch faces

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.300
just how you refer to your watch faces
 

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.660
just how you refer to your watch faces
to the system and you also pass in the

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:43.670
to the system and you also pass in the
 

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.809
to the system and you also pass in the
watch face complication ID for the

00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:46.819
watch face complication ID for the
 

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:49.600
watch face complication ID for the
complication that is being configured so

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:49.610
complication that is being configured so
 

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.259
complication that is being configured so
that's the number we chose earlier you

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:53.269
that's the number we chose earlier you
 

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:57.220
that's the number we chose earlier you
then pass in the types supported by that

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.230
then pass in the types supported by that
 

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.730
then pass in the types supported by that
complication in this list the order does

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:00.740
complication in this list the order does
 

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.530
complication in this list the order does
matter you list them in order of

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:02.540
matter you list them in order of
 

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.939
matter you list them in order of
preference with the most preferred

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:03.949
preference with the most preferred
 

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:07.030
preference with the most preferred
coming first in this example would put

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040
coming first in this example would put
 

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.280
coming first in this example would put
ranged value at the top that's because

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.290
ranged value at the top that's because
 

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.960
ranged value at the top that's because
that type conveys the most information

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:10.970
that type conveys the most information
 

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.759
that type conveys the most information
to the user so that's often a good

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:12.769
to the user so that's often a good
 

00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:14.049
to the user so that's often a good
choice and that's a good way to think

00:16:14.049 --> 00:16:14.059
choice and that's a good way to think
 

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:17.319
choice and that's a good way to think
about this okay so then when you have

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:17.329
about this okay so then when you have
 

00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:18.809
about this okay so then when you have
the intent you call

00:16:18.809 --> 00:16:18.819
the intent you call
 

00:16:18.819 --> 00:16:21.939
the intent you call
startactivityforresult to show the

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:21.949
startactivityforresult to show the
 

00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:25.269
startactivityforresult to show the
system provider chooser so when the user

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279
system provider chooser so when the user
 

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:28.449
system provider chooser so when the user
taps on an item in this list the system

00:16:28.449 --> 00:16:28.459
taps on an item in this list the system
 

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:31.990
taps on an item in this list the system
provider chooser is shown now when the

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000
provider chooser is shown now when the
 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.019
provider chooser is shown now when the
user chooses a provider in this UI it

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:35.029
user chooses a provider in this UI it
 

00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:37.419
user chooses a provider in this UI it
gets set up automatically you don't need

00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:37.429
gets set up automatically you don't need
 

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:41.799
gets set up automatically you don't need
to do anything else okay so to show the

00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:41.809
to do anything else okay so to show the
 

00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:43.600
to do anything else okay so to show the
data what you need to do is tell the

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:43.610
data what you need to do is tell the
 

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.460
data what you need to do is tell the
system that your watch face is ready to

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.470
system that your watch face is ready to
 

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.650
system that your watch face is ready to
receive it so let's move into the watch

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.660
receive it so let's move into the watch
 

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.669
receive it so let's move into the watch
face service itself specifically the

00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:51.679
face service itself specifically the
 

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:54.600
face service itself specifically the
engine so what you need to do is call

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:54.610
engine so what you need to do is call
 

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.720
engine so what you need to do is call
active complications and pass in the

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:57.730
active complications and pass in the
 

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.389
active complications and pass in the
watch face complication IDs for the

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399
watch face complication IDs for the
 

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:04.020
watch face complication IDs for the
complications that are ready here we're

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.030
complications that are ready here we're
 

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.740
complications that are ready here we're
showing it done in oncreate of the

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:06.750
showing it done in oncreate of the
 

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.020
showing it done in oncreate of the
engine that's usually a good place to do

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.030
engine that's usually a good place to do
 

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.490
engine that's usually a good place to do
it but you can call this method from

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:11.500
it but you can call this method from
 

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.679
it but you can call this method from
elsewhere for example if the active

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:13.689
elsewhere for example if the active
 

00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:17.970
elsewhere for example if the active
complications change once you've done

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:17.980
complications change once you've done
 

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.110
complications change once you've done
that you will start to receive data in

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120
that you will start to receive data in
 

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.870
that you will start to receive data in
calls to the on complication data update

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880
calls to the on complication data update
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.210
calls to the on complication data update
method the the data will come with the

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:30.220
method the the data will come with the
 

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.950
method the the data will come with the
watch face complication ID that it

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960
watch face complication ID that it
 

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.370
watch face complication ID that it
relates to now you'll only receive data

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:35.380
relates to now you'll only receive data
 

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.049
relates to now you'll only receive data
when it changes so you'll have to hold

00:17:37.049 --> 00:17:37.059
when it changes so you'll have to hold
 

00:17:37.059 --> 00:17:39.350
when it changes so you'll have to hold
on to the complication data object and

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360
on to the complication data object and
 

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.270
on to the complication data object and
any images such as icons should be

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280
any images such as icons should be
 

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.340
any images such as icons should be
loaded asynchronously and be sure to

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:44.350
loaded asynchronously and be sure to
 

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.100
loaded asynchronously and be sure to
cache them

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:46.110
cache them
 

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.659
cache them
now once you've got the data it's up to

00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:48.669
now once you've got the data it's up to
 

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:50.430
now once you've got the data it's up to
you how to incorporate it into your

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440
you how to incorporate it into your
 

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.650
you how to incorporate it into your
watch face but before rendering it you

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:52.660
watch face but before rendering it you
 

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.299
watch face but before rendering it you
need to check if the data is still

00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:54.309
need to check if the data is still
 

00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:57.600
need to check if the data is still
active some complication data is only

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:57.610
active some complication data is only
 

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.180
active some complication data is only
valid until a certain time so for

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:00.190
valid until a certain time so for
 

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.919
valid until a certain time so for
example it might be for a next event

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:01.929
example it might be for a next event
 

00:18:01.929 --> 00:18:03.840
example it might be for a next event
complication and then the piece of data

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:03.850
complication and then the piece of data
 

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.360
complication and then the piece of data
will only be relevant and up until the

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:06.370
will only be relevant and up until the
 

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.130
will only be relevant and up until the
end of that event you check it using

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140
end of that event you check it using
 

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.409
end of that event you check it using
this method the is active method on the

00:18:13.409 --> 00:18:13.419
this method the is active method on the
 

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:15.419
this method the is active method on the
complication data so you just pass in

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:15.429
complication data so you just pass in
 

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:17.190
complication data so you just pass in
the current time when you're drawing a

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200
the current time when you're drawing a
 

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.740
the current time when you're drawing a
frame to see if you still need to draw

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:19.750
frame to see if you still need to draw
 

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.100
frame to see if you still need to draw
that data there's one other thing you

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.110
that data there's one other thing you
 

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.720
that data there's one other thing you
should do which is to check to see if

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:24.730
should do which is to check to see if
 

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.169
should do which is to check to see if
complications are tapped on you do this

00:18:28.169 --> 00:18:28.179
complications are tapped on you do this
 

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:30.150
complications are tapped on you do this
using the interactive watch faces API so

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160
using the interactive watch faces API so
 

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.360
using the interactive watch faces API so
that we announced last year so that is

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:33.370
that we announced last year so that is
 

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.590
that we announced last year so that is
by implementing on tap command if a

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600
by implementing on tap command if a
 

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.690
by implementing on tap command if a
complication is tapped on then you need

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:39.700
complication is tapped on then you need
 

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.539
complication is tapped on then you need
to check the complication data to see if

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:42.549
to check the complication data to see if
 

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:46.340
to check the complication data to see if
it specifies a tap action pending intent

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:46.350
it specifies a tap action pending intent
 

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.990
it specifies a tap action pending intent
if there is one you need to fire that

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000
if there is one you need to fire that
 

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.440
if there is one you need to fire that
intent when the computation is tapped on

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:51.450
intent when the computation is tapped on
 

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.940
intent when the computation is tapped on
this allows deep linking from the

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:53.950
this allows deep linking from the
 

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.310
this allows deep linking from the
complication straight into a relevant

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320
complication straight into a relevant
 

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.570
complication straight into a relevant
activity

00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580
 

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.330
okay so that's how to add complications

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:03.340
okay so that's how to add complications
 

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.419
okay so that's how to add complications
to your watch face one important tip

00:19:06.419 --> 00:19:06.429
to your watch face one important tip
 

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:08.490
to your watch face one important tip
that goes for watch face development in

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:08.500
that goes for watch face development in
 

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.990
that goes for watch face development in
general but particularly for

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000
general but particularly for
 

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.299
general but particularly for
complications is minimize the work you

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:12.309
complications is minimize the work you
 

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:15.570
complications is minimize the work you
do in every draw call especially if

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:15.580
do in every draw call especially if
 

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.960
do in every draw call especially if
you're drawing more than once a second

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:17.970
you're drawing more than once a second
 

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.580
you're drawing more than once a second
avoid object creation in on draw

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:20.590
avoid object creation in on draw
 

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.769
avoid object creation in on draw
wherever possible as that can lead to a

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:22.779
wherever possible as that can lead to a
 

00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:24.480
wherever possible as that can lead to a
lot of garbage collection and hence

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:24.490
lot of garbage collection and hence
 

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:29.519
lot of garbage collection and hence
support performance okay so now let's

00:19:29.519 --> 00:19:29.529
support performance okay so now let's
 

00:19:29.529 --> 00:19:31.019
support performance okay so now let's
take a look at how to build a

00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:31.029
take a look at how to build a
 

00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:36.269
take a look at how to build a
complication data provider a data

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:36.279
complication data provider a data
 

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:39.480
complication data provider a data
provider is a service and to create one

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:39.490
provider is a service and to create one
 

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.210
provider is a service and to create one
you need to extend complication provider

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:42.220
you need to extend complication provider
 

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.430
you need to extend complication provider
service from the support library this

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440
service from the support library this
 

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.769
service from the support library this
class has one abstract method that you

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:49.779
class has one abstract method that you
 

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:52.889
class has one abstract method that you
must implement that is on complication

00:19:52.889 --> 00:19:52.899
must implement that is on complication
 

00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:56.519
must implement that is on complication
update this method is called

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:56.529
update this method is called
 

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.680
update this method is called
whenever the system wants data from you

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:58.690
whenever the system wants data from you
 

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.590
whenever the system wants data from you
so it will be called when a complication

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600
so it will be called when a complication
 

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.049
so it will be called when a complication
using your provider is activated by

00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:04.059
using your provider is activated by
 

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:05.940
using your provider is activated by
which I mean when the watch face calls

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:05.950
which I mean when the watch face calls
 

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.029
which I mean when the watch face calls
set active complications and will also

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039
set active complications and will also
 

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:11.279
set active complications and will also
be called when your provider is chosen

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:11.289
be called when your provider is chosen
 

00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:14.840
be called when your provider is chosen
for a complication that's already active

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:14.850
for a complication that's already active
 

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.490
for a complication that's already active
it can also be called with a certain

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:17.500
it can also be called with a certain
 

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.860
it can also be called with a certain
frequency such as every hour if that's

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:19.870
frequency such as every hour if that's
 

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.310
frequency such as every hour if that's
what you want and it's also possible to

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320
what you want and it's also possible to
 

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.129
what you want and it's also possible to
trigger updates if you need a push style

00:20:26.129 --> 00:20:26.139
trigger updates if you need a push style
 

00:20:26.139 --> 00:20:28.619
trigger updates if you need a push style
for example if you have a messaging app

00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:28.629
for example if you have a messaging app
 

00:20:28.629 --> 00:20:30.779
for example if you have a messaging app
and you want to update a complication

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:30.789
and you want to update a complication
 

00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:34.009
and you want to update a complication
when a message arrives you could do this

00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:34.019
when a message arrives you could do this
 

00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:36.539
when a message arrives you could do this
if you want more information on that and

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:36.549
if you want more information on that and
 

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:38.549
if you want more information on that and
then check out the provider update

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559
then check out the provider update
 

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:41.100
then check out the provider update
request class in the preview support

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.110
request class in the preview support
 

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.879
request class in the preview support
library ok so let's take a look at how

00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:44.889
library ok so let's take a look at how
 

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:46.560
library ok so let's take a look at how
you might an example of how you might

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:46.570
you might an example of how you might
 

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.889
you might an example of how you might
implement this method so you'll see that

00:20:49.889 --> 00:20:49.899
implement this method so you'll see that
 

00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:52.200
implement this method so you'll see that
one of the parameters is the type that's

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.210
one of the parameters is the type that's
 

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.810
one of the parameters is the type that's
the complication type that's required

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:54.820
the complication type that's required
 

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.909
the complication type that's required
and first thing we're going to do is

00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919
and first thing we're going to do is
 

00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:59.340
and first thing we're going to do is
check that now in this example we're

00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.350
check that now in this example we're
 

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.350
check that now in this example we're
only going to support short text in a

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360
only going to support short text in a
 

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.909
only going to support short text in a
real world example you would probably

00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919
real world example you would probably
 

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:07.140
real world example you would probably
support more than one type

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:07.150
 

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.600
so first thing now as we start building

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:10.610
so first thing now as we start building
 

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.180
so first thing now as we start building
a complication data object of that type

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.190
a complication data object of that type
 

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.310
a complication data object of that type
type short text and now we're setting

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320
type short text and now we're setting
 

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.960
type short text and now we're setting
the short text field which is the

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:19.970
the short text field which is the
 

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.600
the short text field which is the
required field for this type and we've

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:22.610
required field for this type and we've
 

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.230
required field for this type and we've
just setting it to a simple string hello

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240
just setting it to a simple string hello
 

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.610
just setting it to a simple string hello
you'll notice that it's wrapped here in

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:27.620
you'll notice that it's wrapped here in
 

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.580
you'll notice that it's wrapped here in
a complication text object all of the

also be used for other things and we'll
 

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.279
also be used for other things and we'll
talk about that a bit later

00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:47.289
 

00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:50.680
okay so we're also going to specify an

recommend you use of vector drawables

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.030
recommend you use of vector drawables
 

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.140
recommend you use of vector drawables
for this that's because the watch face

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.150
for this that's because the watch face
 

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.779
for this that's because the watch face
could draw the draw the icon at

00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:28.789
could draw the draw the icon at
 

00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:30.640
could draw the draw the icon at
different sizes and using a vector will

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:30.650
different sizes and using a vector will
 

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.710
different sizes and using a vector will
allow it to resize cleanly okay so that

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720
allow it to resize cleanly okay so that
 

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.960
allow it to resize cleanly okay so that

for this example all you need to do next

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:40.820
for this example all you need to do next
 

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.480
for this example all you need to do next
is send that data to the system and you

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:43.490
is send that data to the system and you
 

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.669
is send that data to the system and you
do that using the complication manager

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679
do that using the complication manager
 

00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:47.770
do that using the complication manager

are activated when the watch face calls

00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039
are activated when the watch face calls
 

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:12.370
are activated when the watch face calls
set active complications and they are

now as a service your provider has to be
 

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.119
now as a service your provider has to be
declared in the manifest and that's also

00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:28.129
declared in the manifest and that's also
 

00:23:28.129 --> 00:23:30.999
declared in the manifest and that's also
where you use metadata to declare things

00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:31.009
where you use metadata to declare things
 

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:34.299
where you use metadata to declare things
like what types you can support and what

with the supported types the order does
not matter and that's because as I

mentioned earlier the watch face gets to

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:43.580
mentioned earlier the watch face gets to
 

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.090
mentioned earlier the watch face gets to
decide the order of preference for any

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:46.100

represents the current time we have time

00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:19.789
represents the current time we have time
 

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:23.379
represents the current time we have time
format text and protect that represents

00:25:23.379 --> 00:25:23.389
format text and protect that represents
 

00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:26.470
format text and protect that represents
the time to or from a given time use

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480
the time to or from a given time use
 

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.780
the time to or from a given time use
time difference text

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:28.790
time difference text
 

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:34.610
time difference text
let's take a look at an example so let's

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620
let's take a look at an example so let's
 

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.840
let's take a look at an example so let's
say that we're building a complication

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:35.850
say that we're building a complication
 

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.940
say that we're building a complication
showing the time to my next meeting and

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:37.950
showing the time to my next meeting and
 

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.550
showing the time to my next meeting and
we're using the short text type so I'm

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:40.560
we're using the short text type so I'm
 

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.410
we're using the short text type so I'm
building a complication data of type

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:42.420
building a complication data of type
 

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:47.000
building a complication data of type
short text we saw earlier that set short

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.010
short text we saw earlier that set short
 

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.550
short text we saw earlier that set short
text takes a complication text object

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:49.560
text takes a complication text object
 

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.030
text takes a complication text object
and that so that here we can pass in a

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.040
and that so that here we can pass in a
 

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.560
and that so that here we can pass in a
different kind of complication text

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:54.570
different kind of complication text
 

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.600
different kind of complication text
object so we're going to use time

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:56.610
object so we're going to use time
 

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.520
object so we're going to use time
difference builder to create one so

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:00.530
difference builder to create one so
 

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.170
difference builder to create one so
passing into the Builder we need to set

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:03.180
passing into the Builder we need to set
 

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.480
passing into the Builder we need to set
the reference period that is the time

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:05.490
the reference period that is the time
 

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.820
the reference period that is the time
that the text relates to so in this case

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:07.830
that the text relates to so in this case
 

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.600
that the text relates to so in this case
it's the time of my next event let's say

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:11.610
it's the time of my next event let's say
 

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.910
it's the time of my next event let's say
that's from 4:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. in

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:13.920
that's from 4:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. in
 

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.400
that's from 4:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. in
that case start time here is 4 p.m. and

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:16.410
that case start time here is 4 p.m. and
 

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:21.380
that case start time here is 4 p.m. and
time here is 5 p.m. now we add a style

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:21.390
time here is 5 p.m. now we add a style
 

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.070
time here is 5 p.m. now we add a style
so this just determines how the text is

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080
so this just determines how the text is
 

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.310
so this just determines how the text is
is formatted is displayed in this case

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320
is formatted is displayed in this case
 

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.010
is formatted is displayed in this case
we're using short jewel unit that means

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020
we're using short jewel unit that means
 

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.530
we're using short jewel unit that means
for example if the time difference was 5

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:33.540
for example if the time difference was 5
 

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.440
for example if the time difference was 5
hours and 15 minutes it would show 5h

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.450
hours and 15 minutes it would show 5h
 

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:42.110
hours and 15 minutes it would show 5h
15m that completes the time difference

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120
15m that completes the time difference
 

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.590
15m that completes the time difference
text so we call build there's one more

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600
text so we call build there's one more
 

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.570
text so we call build there's one more
thing as I mentioned earlier

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580
thing as I mentioned earlier
 

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.870
thing as I mentioned earlier
complication data is not it can cease to

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880
complication data is not it can cease to
 

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.760
complication data is not it can cease to
be valid after a certain time and that

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:52.770
be valid after a certain time and that
 

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.590
be valid after a certain time and that
is the case here and it's particularly

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600
is the case here and it's particularly
 

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.290
is the case here and it's particularly
important here because the time

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:57.300
important here because the time
 

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.750
important here because the time
difference text is the time to the event

00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760
difference text is the time to the event
 

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.640
difference text is the time to the event
but it's also the time since the event

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:01.650
but it's also the time since the event
 

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.940
but it's also the time since the event
so if it were 10 minutes after my event

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:04.950
so if it were 10 minutes after my event
 

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.120
so if it were 10 minutes after my event
then the complication might show 10 M

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.130
then the complication might show 10 M
 

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.830
then the complication might show 10 M
which is not what we want so we have to

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840
which is not what we want so we have to
 

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.050
which is not what we want so we have to
set an end time so that it shows nothing

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.060
set an end time so that it shows nothing
 

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.710
set an end time so that it shows nothing
after the event okay so that completes

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720
after the event okay so that completes
 

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.050
after the event okay so that completes
the complication data so we just call

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.060
the complication data so we just call
 

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.770
the complication data so we just call
build and let's see what that would look

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:21.780
build and let's see what that would look
 

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.940
build and let's see what that would look
like on the watch face so the event is

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:25.950
like on the watch face so the event is
 

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.510
like on the watch face so the event is
at 4:00 p.m. one hour and 45 minutes

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520
at 4:00 p.m. one hour and 45 minutes
 

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:36.050
at 4:00 p.m. one hour and 45 minutes
before we would see this at 3:45 p.m. we

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:36.060
before we would see this at 3:45 p.m. we
 

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.810
before we would see this at 3:45 p.m. we
would see this so although it's the

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820
would see this so although it's the
 

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.910
would see this so although it's the
short jewel unit style when it's only

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:40.920
short jewel unit style when it's only
 

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.780
short jewel unit style when it's only
minutes

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:41.790
minutes
 

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.730
minutes
we only show the minutes we never show

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740
we only show the minutes we never show
 

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.770
we only show the minutes we never show
seconds for in this style during the

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:48.780
seconds for in this style during the
 

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.500
seconds for in this style during the
event we would show this so the time

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:51.510
event we would show this so the time
 

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.540
event we would show this so the time
difference text actually shows the text

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:53.550
difference text actually shows the text
 

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.730
difference text actually shows the text
now and these strings all of these

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740
now and these strings all of these
 

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.440
now and these strings all of these
strings are localized according to the

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:57.450
strings are localized according to the
 

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.330
strings are localized according to the
locale of the device after the event we

locale of the device after the event we
 

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.110
locale of the device after the event we
see nothing because we set the end time

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120
see nothing because we set the end time
