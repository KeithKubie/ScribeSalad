00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.220
James Bowie is a man today known primarily
for two things- his participation in the Battle

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.640
of the Alamo and a large knife design that
bears his name.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.869
It’s impossible to separate fact from legend
concerning an amazing amount of this American

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.910
folk hero’s life, owing to Bowie leaving
exceptionally little in the way of a paper

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.609
trail documenting the events of his life and
the fact that contemporary news articles about

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.539
him are conflicting in their reports.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.789
That said, concerning the topic at hand today,
we do definitively know how the style of knife

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.940
now known as a “Bowie” knife got the name
and how it was popularised.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.170
It all started in 1826 when Bowie and his
brother Rezin were staying in Alexandria,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.170
Louisiana.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.230
In the years leading up to this, the brothers
operated an illegal foreign slave trade business

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.730
in which they’d acquire foreign slaves from
Jean Laffitte, who in turn had acquired these

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.980
unfortunate individuals via capturing slave
ships traveling through the Gulf of Mexico

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.980
and the Caribbean.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.310
The brother’s profit from this slave smuggling
scheme supposedly made them almost $65,000

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.030
(about $1.1 million today) in the two years
they were involved in it before moving on

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.860
to land speculation.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.000
This brings us back to 1826 in which James
was in need of a loan for a business deal-

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.470
a loan that one Norris Wright, banker and
sheriff in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, denied

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.470
the frontiersman.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.370
It is widely reported that there was bad blood
between the two owing to Bowie previously

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.820
supporting Norris’ opponent in the election
to become sheriff.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.890
Later, Bowie and Wright seem to have gotten
in a physical tussle, with Wright drawing

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.330
his pistol and shooting at the unarmed Bowie.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.570
The bullet missed, but various accounts claimed
Bowie then lunged at Norris and the two fought

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.730
hand to hand.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.080
Ultimately Bowie had to be pulled off of Wright
lest he kill him.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.670
But, again, at the risk of being a bit of
a broken record, so much of Bowie’s history

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.950
lacks any sort of definitive primary documents
to back up these stories, and even first hand

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.210
accounts, when available on some aspects of
his life, are often contradictory.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.440
So whether this is exactly how it happened
or not isn’t clear.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.950
The real point here is that the pair most
definitely didn’t like each other, partially

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.060
leading to a more famous incident to come
between the two, which gave us the name “Bowie

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.060
knife”.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.409
After the fight, Bowie was given what was
essentially an overly thick butcher’s knife

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.289
by his brother for protection.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.800
This was a knife Rezin would later claim in
a letter that he had custom made, reportedly

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.790
forged by Louisiana blacksmith Jesse Clifft.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.719
At this point, you might be wondering why
Bowie would want to carry that knife around

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.719
and not a gun.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.209
It’s important to remember here that flintlock
pistols of the age were notoriously unreliable

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.329
for a variety of reasons, so a knife was sometimes
preferred in relatively close quarter fighting.

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.310
In fact, it was partially the unreliability
of sidearms at the time that led to so many

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.939
people wanting a Bowie knife, and later why
its popularity diminished rapidly when more

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.900
reliable hand guns, like the Colt pistol,
became available to the masses.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.680
In any event, in 1827, a friend of Bowie’s,
Samuel L. Wells III, was set to duel a prominent

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.450
Louisiana native known as Dr. Thomas H. Maddox.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.739
Both men were known to be mostly friendly
with one another, but relations between their

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.919
respective families were heated, with things
eventually escalating to honour needing to

00:02:58.919 --> 00:02:59.919
be satisfied.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.579
Thus various duels were fought between the
sides, including this one.

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.779
At the time, anti-dueling laws were in effect
in the region, so the men arranged to shoot

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.299
at each other on a small island in the middle
of the Mississippi river, where they assumed

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.579
state jurisdiction didn’t apply.

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.090
Supporting each man was a contingent of friends
and witnesses, some of whom had themselves

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.370
previously dueled or otherwise come to blows
with each other.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.769
Notable here is that one of them was the aforementioned
enemy of Bowie’s, Norris Wright, who supported

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.069
Maddox in the duel.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.099
Taking place on September 19, 1827, the actual
duel itself ended without any bloodshed; both

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.099
Wells and Maddox missed their agreed upon
number of shots.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.939
With that, the pair resolved to end the duel
with a handshake, honour having been satisfied.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.680
Up to this point, we can be reasonable confident
the details are accurate from surviving news

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
accounts.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.349
What happened next, however, is much less
clear.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.220
While there are numerous newspaper accounts
covering what would be called the “Sandbar

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.760
Fight”, for legal and personal bias reasons,
as well as possibly just notoriously inaccurate

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.319
human memory, the participants of the event
would later tell contradictory stories, and

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.480
even impartial observers’ accounts differ.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.959
So take the details on the next bit with a
grain of salt- the important thing in terms

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.160
of the topic at hand today, the Bowie knife,
is simply the general event and Bowie’s

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.919
use of the knife in it.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.890
After the shots were fired, it seems the two
men shook hands, but tempers flared between

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.240
Wells’ contingent and Maddox’s and a fight
broke out.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.920
In subsequent news accounts, it appears that
Bowie was a central target for Maddox’s

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.590
side’s men, with it later being speculated
that this was because “they considered him

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.020
the most dangerous man among their opposition.”

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.560
However, it should also be noted that Bowie
wasn’t exactly the type of man who endeared

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.280
himself well to others for various reasons,
including somewhat unscrupulous business practices-

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.319
the bottom line being that Wright wasn’t
the only one who loathed him.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.259
So they may have simply targeted Bowie particularly
in the fight because they just really didn’t

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.940
like him and thought this was a great opportunity
to kill him without getting into too much

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.940
trouble with the law.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.349
Whatever the case, Judge R.A.

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.710
Crane drew his pistol and shot at the frontiersman,
hitting him in the hip, then later let loose

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.509
a second shot that missed and killed an unarmed
innocent bystander, Dr. Samuel Cuney.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.280
Bowie then got up and charged at the judge,
at which point the judge used the gun to club

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.360
Bowie on the head, knocking him down once
again.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.280
It was at this point that Wright took the
opportunity of his hated foe lying on the

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.250
ground to rush him with his cane sword, stabbing
Bowie straight through the chest.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.030
With sword through his body, Bowie then grabbed
at Norris and pulled him to the ground.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.110
Using the knife he was about to make famous
world-wide, he violently disemboweled Wright.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.060
His nemesis dead, it was then reported that
Bowie once again joined the rest of the Wells’

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.060
party attacking the Maddox contingent.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.509
Using a whirlwind of knife slashes, he seriously
wounded one Alfred Blanchard while his brother

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.479
ineffectually shot and then stabbed Bowie
some more.

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.759
During the estimated 90 second brawl, according
to the physicians’ reports, Bowie sustained

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.650
about a dozen serious wounds from various
attacks, including having been shot and stabbed

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.120
multiple times.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.009
After the melee ended, the physicians present
attended to the wounded, including Bowie and,

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.290
miraculously, he survived.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.960
Shortly thereafter, the “Sandbar Fight”
was national news, and Bowie’s exploits

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.910
in it became the stuff of legend.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.270
Most pertinent to the topic at hand, reports
tended to focus on the “large butcher’s

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.789
knife”, as it was described by one witness,
Bowie used in the fight.

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.930
In the months following the brawl, blacksmiths
across the country were being asked by hunters

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.550
and other men to make them a knife “like
the one Bowie used”- a general knife design

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.080
that was good to passable in use in knife
fighting, eating, chopping, and various uses

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.610
in hunting, such as skinning and carving up
animals.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.110
In fact, within a few years of the fight,
even blacksmiths across the pond in England

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.550
are known to have started producing similar
blades known as “Bowie” knives.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.819
The term “Swiss Army Knife” was coined
by United States soldiers after WWII.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.349
The soldiers had trouble pronouncing the original
name of “Schweizer Offiziersmesser” (Swiss

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:54.129
Officer’s Knife) and thus began calling
the multi-tool a “Swiss Army Knife”.

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.509
The company that makes Swiss Army Knives is
Victorinox, named after the founder, Karl

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.210
Elsener’s, deceased mother, Victoria.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.360
The “nox” part comes from the fact that
stainless steel is also known as “inox”,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.139
which is short for the French term “inoxydable”.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.210
Karl Elsener himself was originally the owner
of a surgical equipment company.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.409
He later took over production of the original
Modell 1890 knives, which were previously

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:15.409
made in Germany.

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.810
He moved the production to Switzerland and
greatly improved the design of the original

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.810
multi-tool.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.469
His big breakthrough came when he figured
out a way to put blades on both sides of the

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.990
handle using the same spring to hold both
sides in place.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:08:58.779
This allowed him to put twice as many features
into the multi-tool as was previously possible.
