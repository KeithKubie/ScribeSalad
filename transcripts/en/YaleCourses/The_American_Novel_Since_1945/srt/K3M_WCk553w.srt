1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:01,811
Today,

2
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:06,811
I'm going to talk about a censorship
in the United States since 1945 in the

3
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,760
period that we're studying.
Um,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,790
and I'm going to connect that with
the human stain and some of my general

5
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:18,250
thoughts about Roths work, uh,
at the very end of lecture.

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,040
So I'll give you a little
bit of history and,

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,160
and then a little bit
of meditation on Roth.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,820
I asked you for today to go around to
the various bookstores in new haven,

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,350
choose one and go and observe
what you saw there. In particular.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,120
I asked you to think about what
you are not seeing there. Um,

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,530
so does anyone want to tell me what they
saw on their little observation trip?

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,380
What did you observe?

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,720
Yes,
I went to the library

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,370
and a ton of history,

15
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:03,371
history being cultural studies both
upfront and that seemed like very

16
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:08,360
deliberately, uh, actually,
uh, diverse in what way?

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,280
Like diverse culturally as in time.
As far as the,

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
as far as history goes to the Ida,
I looked at the end of the range.

19
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,760
Everything from Germany
during the Weimer Republic,

20
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:24,440
like a history of like tragedy potential
or some top title like that too.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,400
Um, you know, death and the Atlantic
slave trade to mean all of, all of his,

22
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,260
but other, mainly you're
syndicates, but yeah,

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,170
not there.
It's interesting.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,420
I looked for specifically because I
thought that we be, there was my comp.

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,630
Did you look back in the stacks to uh Huh.

26
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,580
I didn't see it there. Elaborate on.
So I guess they don't support it.

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,460
I approve it.

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,870
They go, you, you approve of mine. Calm
for not being in, in labyrinth bookstore.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,870
That's right. Again, I
guess one cup can be a risk.

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,100
Very good. Okay. What else?
What else do people notice?

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,820
Did you notice about the bookstore?

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,570
Yes.
Graduate.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,150
Which bookstore did you go to?

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,940
Okay,
great.

35
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,340
By Yale graduates. But here's a
question, not by your professors.

36
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,280
It's a significant difference.
Um, what else did you notice? Yes,

37
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,270
local market.
What else did you notice?

38
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,610
Yes. You like, I guess, uh, that, um,

39
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,670
I really hadn't thought
about this as much,

40
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:57,560
but how much or how much would this
isn't is to decide what kind of shelf the

41
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,980
book goes in? Yes. Like history versus

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,030
philosophy and ice. It's probably the
polishers do you do that or I don't know.

43
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,040
Well, this is a really important
question where to shelve the book.

44
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,460
Now it's not just about categories,
although it is partly about categories.

45
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,010
What subject matter does a book belong to?

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,980
It's also about what
kind of shelf physically.

47
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,780
So those tables, uh, that, you know,

48
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,350
we're thinking about in labyrinth
with that array of literature.

49
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,000
Who chose that? Does anyone know who chose
that? Let her try to put on that table.

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,820
I can tell you in a minute. Uh,
one question is who chose that?

51
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,980
Now those tables are in
Barnes and noble too.

52
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:43,360
So you walk in into the bookstore on
the ground level and they're all those

53
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,460
tables and the stacks go up really high.

54
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:50,020
There are all these elaborate ways
of getting books covers to face you.

55
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,160
Okay?

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Then there are all the stacks and shelves
up on the upper level and those books

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
are interspersed with smaller displays.
So if you go up there,

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,500
you'll begin to see some very interesting
things. There's a little table,

59
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,940
for example,
up on the right,

60
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,710
if you notice this right as you come up
the stairs in Barnes and noble and it

61
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,170
usually has it's,
it's uh,

62
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,080
promoted as like urban
literature. Well, it's really, uh,

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,830
in my experience having seen
it over the years, it's really,

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,390
it's just like code for
black writers somehow. Um,

65
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,220
so it's all these books about the black
history of new haven or whatever. Um,

66
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,090
so you have these little
tables around now,

67
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,410
the big tables in front of Barnes and
noble, who chooses what goes on there.

68
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,340
That space is bought and
paid for by publishers,

69
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,190
bought and paid for.

70
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,770
It's part of the contract with the
publisher to stock that book that it be

71
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,630
displayed in certain ways.
You know,

72
00:04:55,631 --> 00:05:00,631
those Nice discounts that you get 20%
off the New York Times bestseller books

73
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,490
when they're in hardback.

74
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,040
Those are possible at Barnes and noble
because of the huge buying power of that

75
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,100
bookstore.
So they buy in huge volume.

76
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,670
Now a store like labyrinth or its
predecessor Brookhaven wasn't able to have

77
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,300
that kind of volume in sales and so they
couldn't negotiate with the publisher

78
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,800
that sort of discount.
So that means that a smaller bookstore,

79
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,630
because of its smaller buying power,

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,880
can't provide a competitive price in a
market where Barnes and nobles right next

81
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,980
door.
Now,

82
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:43,090
there were ways that independent
bookstores try to compensate for that,

83
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,950
especially in this market.
Um,

84
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,780
by giving discounts to faculty members
stocking their books at the bookstore.

85
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,580
This is somewhat controversial,

86
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,780
although it's Barnes and noble that
has tried to make it controversial, um,

87
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,610
by bringing it up with
the university and saying,

88
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,500
now isn't this a kind of bribery?

89
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,160
But that's the way that a store
like labyrinth or like Brookhaven,

90
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,200
before it was able to try to be priced
competitive among people it knew,

91
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,400
wanted to buy from them,

92
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,730
those professors who stock their
book at an independent bookstore.

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,230
So back to this question of who decides
what's on the table at labyrinth?

94
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,110
I went in and I said, who decides
what's on this table? And they said, oh,

95
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:28,280
she's over there.
And I went and talked to her and I said,

96
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:32,240
how do you decide what's on the
table? She said, well, you know,

97
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:36,470
I had a good general education,
uh, as a young person.

98
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,570
And I kind of know who's who in the
intellectual circles in Europe and in the

99
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,404
United States.

100
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,550
And so I browse the lists and I talked
to sales rep when they come in and I read

101
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,170
and I look at what certain
courses or stalking, um,

102
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,130
and I see what people
are reading on campus.

103
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:57,131
And the night aside has really different
from that space being bought and paid

104
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,250
for by a publisher as part
of a marketing agreement.

105
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Those tables are very powerful in four
browsers in shaping what browsers might

106
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:12,290
possibly by or think about when
they come into a bookstore.

107
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,790
So that space is particularly key to
a bookstore presence culturally in the

108
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,370
community.
And uh,

109
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:27,050
Sarah's point about the Yale
graduates on the bookshelf,

110
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,070
that is a nod to Barnes and nobles,
immediate context.

111
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,870
So there is that local marketing piece.
But think about this.

112
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,860
There are just a few fiction buyers
who work with publishers to decide what

113
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,210
novels will be in Barnes and noble.

114
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,470
So writers,
when they're thinking about,

115
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,500
can I sell my book instead of thinking,

116
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,040
I wonder if I can impress
the owner of the seminary,

117
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:05,510
Co op in Hyde Park in
Chicago, very famous, huge,

118
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:10,340
wonderful bookstore, not a chain.
Instead of saying, you know,

119
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:14,990
I want to sell my book in Chicago, it's
set there and maybe it'll be appealing.

120
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,670
I wonder if I can impress the owner of
that bookstore and having a strategy that

121
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:24,420
addresses those kinds of individual
circumstances in different spaces. Um,

122
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,790
Powells in Seattle,
labyrinth in New York. Um,

123
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,440
they have to say,

124
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:34,610
I wonder if I can impress the
buyer from Barnes and noble.

125
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,030
So instead of many people making that
decision about whether or novel is worthy

126
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:43,910
of being promoted,
it's one person.

127
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,620
That person becomes extremely powerful
in shaping what literary texts reach us,

128
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,590
what comes to our attention
through the bookstore. Now,

129
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:02,010
have you ever wondered as
you're driving down the street,

130
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,700
why there might be a Dunkin donuts here
and a Dunkin donuts just like two blocks

131
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:09,450
away.

132
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,650
Have you ever noticed that there are
various stores that you'll see this gas

133
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,770
station,
sometimes fast food restaurants,

134
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,000
sometimes Walmart bookstores or another
that you will sometimes see this.

135
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,700
Why is that?
Well,

136
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:28,701
what they're doing is competing in an
overwhelming way with another store in

137
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:30,991
that market.

138
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,710
Usually this happens when they're trying
to drive another store out of business.

139
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,380
So there are big enough chain they can
absorb losses from an unproductive second

140
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:45,381
store to saturate a market and then they
can absorb the closing of that second

141
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:49,440
store once the competitor has
been driven out of business.

142
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,990
So that's why that market
saturation happens.

143
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:58,340
It's not because they think it's going
to be profitable that there's another,

144
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,910
you know, hundred percent increase
when they add that second store,

145
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,380
one block over. It's, it's
all about market saturation.

146
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,310
It's getting it as close to a
hundred percent as possible.

147
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,990
So those kinds of tactics are possible
for chain stores and they are not

148
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,000
possible for independent bookstores.

149
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,440
And this is how many independent
bookstores have been, uh, have, have,

150
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,180
have been taken off the map in
our cities and in the suburbs.

151
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,780
So this is one way that
censorship comes to us,

152
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,940
not in that old fashioned
way of censorship laws,

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,050
but in a new way.
Markets Censorship.

154
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,140
This is always been part of how
things work in a capitalist economy.

155
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,920
It's true that in the past
literary enterprises be they
selling books or writing

156
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:02,000
books or publishing books had to make
a profit in order to stay afloat.

157
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,390
But the way that profit was made has
changed from the early 20th century until

158
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,520
this point.
And I'm going to say more about that.

159
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,370
So just by going into the bookstore,

160
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,360
I want you to think about
the next time you go in,

161
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:23,210
think about how things are
being presented to you. Now.

162
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:27,650
How many of you get most of the
books you buy? Not For classes?

163
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,220
Well, let's just ask this blanket
and then I'll break it down.

164
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,570
How many of you get most of the
books you buy, um, from a bookstore?

165
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,230
Still? Quite a few of you. How many of
you get the mostly over the Internet?

166
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,700
Okay. Not, not a majority. Um,

167
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,450
taking out classes,
books you buy for pleasure,

168
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,320
your own decision to buy them.

169
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,730
How many of you are still buying
those in bookstores? Okay.

170
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,170
Actually a lot of you so that,

171
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,250
that really even tips the
scale in favor of bookstores.

172
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,230
So That's interesting to me. I
wasn't sure what you would say, um,

173
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,000
that suggest that bookstores are
still powerful purveyors of culture.

174
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,470
They still shape what you
think about and what you read.

175
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,540
It's browsing or maybe that you've read
about something and you go looking for

176
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,060
it. Um, that brings
you into the bookstore.

177
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,793
Okay.

178
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Censorship does have a legal
history in this part of the century.

179
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,670
And so now I want to
just give you a little

180
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,420
rundown of that.
So this is,

181
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,150
this is actually a title of
a chapter of a book that I,

182
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,560
I will be writing on the post 45 novel
and I'm going to have this as the last

183
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,150
chapter of that book.
Um,

184
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,650
the reason for that is that censorship
and what I'm calling to censure,

185
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,600
that's the public outcry against
literature, even not on legal grounds,

186
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,550
um, is a way for the culture
to speak back to the literary.

187
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,660
So I spend a lot of time in this class
and in my teaching in general and in my

188
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:15,720
writing talking about
what books say to us,

189
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,460
but what do we say back to those
books as a, as a society? Well,

190
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,140
censorship and, and it's,
it's companion censure. Uh,

191
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,540
do a lot of that talking back.

192
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,230
Yeah.

193
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,900
So there are two sides
of access to literature.

194
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:36,830
I've just been talking a little bit
about market constraints on what can be

195
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:37,880
published and read.

196
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,200
And now I'm going to talk a little
bit about legal constraints.

197
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,900
I'm going to get back to the market
constraints in a little while.

198
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,180
Yeah.

199
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,070
Since the early 20th century,

200
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,050
a lot of the legal constraints on
publishing and distributing, um,

201
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,400
literature have east in the 1870s,

202
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,410
the Comstock laws in the United States
aim to regulate the use of the males for

203
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,800
the, the um, uh,

204
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,360
for the dissemination of
obscene materials. This,

205
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,390
these laws were used in 1914 to indict
Margaret Sanger for sending information

206
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,430
about contraception across state lines
and she had to flee and she left the

207
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:28,500
country, uh, to protect herself.

208
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,610
So just the description of
how contraception worked, uh,

209
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,710
was a violation of the Comstock laws.

210
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,960
So of course we're happily out of that
moment in 1933 for literature was a major

211
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:49,851
decision by Judge Woolsey declaring
the James Joyce's Ulysses,

212
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,980
not obscene.
Um,

213
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,180
often censorship in literature would
have to do with the import of literature

214
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:01,790
into the United States.

215
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,000
So this is sort of on the same
logic as the Comstock laws.

216
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,650
Comstock laws regulate the traveling of
obscene literature, Cross state lines,

217
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,080
customs regulations,

218
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,500
regulated obscenity coming
into the United States.

219
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,020
Why is obscenity important?
Well,

220
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:23,021
obscenity is largely a recognized by
legal scholars as not being protected by

221
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,980
the 14th amendment.
It is not protected speech.

222
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,520
So that's why it was important for
someone who wanted to keep Ulysses out of

223
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:38,040
American hands to call it obscene.
Now,

224
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,070
it's very interesting to read
what Woolsey says about Ulysses.

225
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,350
It just shows you how the learned reading
of literature comes to have a legal

226
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:55,800
impact in the world.
So this is Woolsey on Joyce.

227
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,870
Joyce has attempted,

228
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:03,871
it seems to me with astonishing success
to show how the screen of consciousness

229
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,300
with it's ever shifting kaleidoscopic
impressions caries as it were on a plastic

230
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:14,440
Pallium c'est not only what is in the
focus of each man's observation of the

231
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:18,520
actual things about him,
but also on a penumbral zone.

232
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,460
Residual of past impressions,

233
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,620
some recent and some drawn
up by association from the
domain of the subconscious

234
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,810
is telling you about the
stream of consciousness,

235
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,060
method of narration and Ulysses.

236
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,560
Okay.

237
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,370
He shows how each of these impressions
affect the life and the behavior of the

238
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,820
character, which he is describing
it. I'm going to skip down. Um,

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,200
he goes on to to detail more
about Joyce's technique.

240
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,440
It is because Joyce has been loyal to
his technique and has not funked it's

241
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:51,880
necessary implications,

242
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,290
but has honestly attempted to tell fully
what his characters think about that.

243
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,730
He has been the subject of so many
attacks and that his purpose has been so

244
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:03,370
often misunderstood and misrepresented.

245
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,060
So here Woolsey takes a very serious
view of Joyce's artistic project and he

246
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,550
takes as the mark of its success,

247
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,970
what he calls the loyalty of Joyce to
that project of showing exactly what

248
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:26,731
characters think in their subconscious
associations as those rise into

249
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:28,810
consciousness and into language.

250
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,190
That principle is,
um,

251
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,590
is furthered in the
United States in 1957 with

252
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,860
a case called Roth. Um,
it's, let me get the,

253
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:48,940
it's Wroth v United States.
And

254
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,320
in this,
in this case,

255
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Woolsey's approach to the literary is
enshrined in American Law affirmed as a

256
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:06,880
precedent.
So according to the Roth case,

257
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,380
something can be judged obscene
only if it meets three conditions.

258
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,320
And those are these,
the books,

259
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:22,321
descriptions of nudity or sex must go
beyond the limits of taste established by

260
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:27,220
community standards.
So that phrase,

261
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:31,090
community standards will become
very important in later law.

262
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,730
Know mentioned how in a minute

263
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,460
it must not appeal to the
interest of the average adult.

264
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,130
So yeah,

265
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,720
you have to be really abberant
in order to meet this standard.

266
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,320
It can't appeal to the
interest of the average adult.

267
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,390
That's what makes it obscene.

268
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,590
So I dunno necrophilia maybe that counts.

269
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,460
And lastly,
this is the kicker.

270
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,810
It must have no redeeming social
or literary value whatsoever.

271
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,580
That means if you can prove just that one,
you're safe.

272
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,110
So no matter what it is,
even if it is necrophilia,

273
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,370
if you can prove that
it has literary value,

274
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,190
it cannot be obscene.

275
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,033
Okay.

276
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,190
And so this particular standard
comes into play when, um,

277
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Allen Ginsberg's howl goes on trial
and I think it's 1959 it goes on trial.

278
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,040
Similarly, accustomed case, uh,
or, and a case about selling,

279
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,121
uh,
the book,

280
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:49,121
it was bought at city lights bookstore
in San Francisco and the poor sales clerk

281
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:51,830
was indicted for selling it.
Uh,

282
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,800
and also the bookstore was
indicted for importing it.

283
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,770
It had been published in Europe.
Um,

284
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,350
all they had to do in that trial, and
it's very funny to read the transcript,

285
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,650
is to prove that Ginsburg in Howell
was doing anything remotely resembling

286
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,680
literary work.

287
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,230
And it's very funny to see people
trying to argue that he was not. Um,

288
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,700
so it's, it's not enough to say that
he uses the word cock, for example,

289
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,880
in that poem, that's not
enough. And they try to, the DA,

290
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,520
the prosecutor tries to make the case
on the basis of individual words.

291
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,810
And then you see them having
these hilarious conversations
about how individual

292
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:40,130
words work in metaphors and uh, how
they, how they mean different things.

293
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,090
This standard really saves literature
from any kind of legal continuing legal

294
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,583
censorship.

295
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,340
But there are other ways of,
uh,

296
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,540
producing century censorship
that community standards
comes to be a problem in,

297
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:59,860
for example,
textbook design.

298
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,850
So there are these huge markets in
public schools in Florida and Texas and

299
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:08,560
California.

300
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,370
And so textbook publishers have to appeal
to the community standards of those

301
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:16,480
huge,
powerful markets.

302
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,770
And that has an impact on what's
available to school systems all over the

303
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:21,604
country.

304
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,870
So there is a way that
those community standards,

305
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,460
while in the Roth case there a redeeming,

306
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,530
they help to make the case
against censorship against
a two wide definition of

307
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,184
obscenity.

308
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,370
It does have an impact in other ways
in the opposite direction in the,

309
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:48,510
since the 1990s in the
wake of these changes, um,

310
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,550
libraries have become the primary
place where legal cases are based.

311
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,830
So in 1982,

312
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,840
the school board of Long Island, uh, in,

313
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,850
in island trees as long island tries
to remove or actually does remove black

314
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,460
boys slaughterhouse five,
um,

315
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,180
and various other sort
of books of the 1960s,

316
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,130
mainly about,
um,

317
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,950
politics mostly has them
removed from the school library.

318
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,470
And as soon as brought against
that school system for doing that,

319
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,090
the decision in that case affirms that
even though public school systems are

320
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:39,631
within their rights in the context of
the classroom to restrict what is on the

321
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:43,300
syllabi of their teachers,

322
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,490
that the school library represents
what they call special environment.

323
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,200
The special environment is
a place of voluntary study.

324
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,610
It is a place where the 14th
amendment cannot be suspended.

325
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,860
And as they say,
sort of poetically,

326
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,400
students do not leave their
rights at the school door.

327
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,750
And so school libraries can't
be regulated in that way,

328
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,690
but these things come up over and over.

329
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:15,691
And what's interesting about
that particular case is
that the objection was that

330
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,830
these books were anti American.

331
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,790
How far have we come since
black boy had to be truncated,

332
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,040
not that far in certain sectors of the
country, in certain ways of thinking,

333
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,440
black boy was cut in half because it
didn't seem like a good reflection on

334
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:33,250
America.

335
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,110
It's still a problem for some
books and being accepted and red.

336
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,830
So I began to talk market constraints
and I want to just say a little bit more

337
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:53,720
about that and how it affects the writing
of literature and the publishing even

338
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:58,010
before you arrive at the bookstore.
Um,

339
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,260
traditional publishing has gone,

340
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:03,470
undergone a huge
consolidations since the 1980s.

341
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,840
So there are large multinational
corporations that have
bought up publishers.

342
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,090
The one,
um,

343
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,190
signal example of this is when Bertelsmann
a German company bought up pantheon

344
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:21,230
books. Um, this is written about, uh,

345
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,750
in a book. Now I'm forgetting the
name of it. Um, it'll come to me.

346
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,213
Um,

347
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,880
one of the Pantheon editors led
a revolt when this happened.

348
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,380
It became clear that

349
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,250
Bertelsmann was going to impose a
new standard of profitability on

350
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,730
the lists in Pantheons uh,

351
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,273
portfolio.

352
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,180
So it used to be in old time publishing
sort of mid century publishing and up to

353
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:01,500
the 1980s that the list
of literature list,

354
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,460
and that's the list of books
that any publisher publishes,

355
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,480
the list should be profitable.

356
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,070
That does not mean that every single
item on that list will be profitable.

357
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,550
So add utters in the old time mode could
work with writers who they found to be

358
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:27,660
difficult,
interesting.

359
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,280
Pathbreaking unusual,
not catering to what was popular.

360
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,730
They could work with writers and cultivate
them and they knew that they were

361
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,970
taking on a book,
say it's a collection of short stories.

362
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:43,770
These are notoriously hard to sell.

363
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,240
They were taking on a book that
was not going to make a profit,

364
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,540
but then they would also
take on the joy of cooking

365
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,180
or the joy of sex since it's censorship
day and they knew that the profit from a

366
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:05,511
popular book could help to carry and
balance those less profitable books or not

367
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:10,590
at all profitable books
that they had on the list.

368
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,520
So there was a management of lists that
could be tilted to allow different kinds

369
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,520
of books into the public domain.

370
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,723
When

371
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,670
publishers were taken over
by multinational corporations
that were very distant

372
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,830
from the in interaction
between an editor and a writer,

373
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,730
they looked at the numbers and they
started to demand that every book have its

374
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:47,541
profit loss analysis and that a very
strict regulation be followed in ensuring

375
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,790
that all titles,
we're going to make a profit.

376
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,630
That's a very different standard and
it had a huge impact on how editors,

377
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,320
what kind of latitude editors
had in working with writers
who they thought might

378
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:07,380
be a little unusual or not so marketable.

379
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,040
At the same time,

380
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,190
agents began to have a role in the
publishing business in the 1950s when at a

381
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,840
ters we're encouraging
literary writers directly.

382
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,520
They had a much more collaborative
relationship with writers,

383
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,250
but as profit became more important,

384
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,170
writers needed to turn to someone else
who wasn't going to pressure them to

385
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:41,790
follow the market and
agents came to have a role.

386
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,900
Now it's interesting,
there's yet a third role, um,

387
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,950
that has just begun to emerge in,

388
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,440
in this structure and that
is of the of the coach,

389
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,390
the writing coach.

390
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,770
So you can now pay big
bucks if you're a writer,

391
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,520
to have someone who will call
you up every week and say, hey,

392
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:06,240
how's the book going? Let's talk about
your ideas. Are you writing today?

393
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,480
It used to be that agents
took that kind of active role.

394
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:17,481
Will agents are very busy now with their
clients selling movie rights and such

395
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:21,900
things. Movie rights are where
a lot of the profit in a,

396
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,400
in a book sale come from.

397
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,250
Yeah.

398
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,720
So agents began to be what
the old time editor was.

399
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,900
And I think we have yet to see whether
coaches become what agents used to be in

400
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:35,774
turn,

401
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,940
but as profitability becomes more and
more of an issue in selling a book to a

402
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:41,774
publisher,

403
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,800
there's an ever ongoing search for
that person who will be the ally of the

404
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:50,870
literary in this process.

405
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,143
Okay.

406
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,810
I've talked about the consolidation and
bookselling the rise of the chains and

407
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:07,160
I've also talked about those financial
relationships between booksellers and

408
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:11,030
publishers where spaces bought.
They also have incentives, um,

409
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,260
that publishers give sometimes give
money for readings to be held at a

410
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:21,740
bookstore. So, so sometimes those things
are bought also who's kinds of events,

411
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:23,240
promotional events.

412
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,010
There is of course,

413
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:36,011
this whole context of the rise of the
Internet and all kinds of competition from

414
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:38,120
the film industry.
Other media.

415
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,020
Yeah.

416
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,070
Market constraints are

417
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,080
sometimes a paradoxically produced
by that overload that we get from the

418
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:52,700
intranet.
So yeah.

419
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:58,550
What that means is the culture
is finding new arbitrators.

420
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,980
So you have this huge volume
of information and cultural
offerings being given

421
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:05,694
to you.

422
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,613
Okay.

423
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,350
In that welter of information,

424
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:14,650
we all look to some arbiter to
tell us how do I sort this out?

425
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,260
Nobody has the time to read all the blogs
and decide which one they're going to

426
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:21,680
read regularly.

427
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,770
So you might get a link from someone
else's page, someone you are friends with,

428
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:31,400
someone you admire, a writer
you've seen elsewhere. Um,

429
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,410
you might read certain print publications
and from there follow them into the

430
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:38,150
Internet,
into cyberspace.

431
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,950
Most books now come with a web address
somewhere on them. A lot of films do.

432
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:43,850
Most films do.

433
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,643
Okay.

434
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,960
This is still in a,
in a period of development.

435
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,410
How profit gets connected up with
those arbitrators isn't yet very clear.

436
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,390
So companies are experimenting
with paying for placements.

437
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,900
You know like when you do the Google
search and there are certain Google

438
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,790
sponsored links at the top,

439
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,590
that's like having the space in the
front of your store bought and paid for.

440
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,640
So you think that you're getting,

441
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,490
or I think we all know that
those are sponsored links now,

442
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,060
but at the beginning people
didn't really quite know that.

443
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,080
So it looked like you were getting the
product of a disinterested electronic

444
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:28,140
search,
but in fact you are getting a promotion.

445
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,930
So the intranet experiments
with all kinds of uh,

446
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,100
both new and tried and true ways of using
money to create prominence among the

447
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,120
welter of information.

448
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Then there is another rising problem
in question and that is of intellectual

449
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:51,410
property in access as books are digitized.

450
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,910
So I don't know if you have heard of
the Google book project and also all the

451
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:59,090
digital libraries initiatives.
There are, there are various ones,

452
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,040
but the Google book project is,

453
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:04,520
I'm digitizing with a special technology.

454
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,150
People think it's probably
a robotic technology.

455
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:12,440
It's kept secret for scanning books that
are in the public domain and they've

456
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:17,180
made agreements with lots of university
libraries, including Stanford, Cornell,

457
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,014
Michigan,

458
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,910
to digitize all the books that are
beyond the copyright that are in their

459
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:26,750
collections to make a
huge digital library.

460
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:32,450
And the dream is that this will
be a sort of bonanza of access.

461
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,470
It'll be searchable, it'll
be fine. Well maybe free.

462
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,980
It'll be accessible all the world.

463
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,490
So there is a dream here that's very noble

464
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,050
publishers.
And writers groups.

465
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:53,051
Unions are very worried about copyright
infringement because Google has stepped

466
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:58,571
over the line and is interested in
pushing the envelope into scanning

467
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:00,890
copyrighted material.

468
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,690
So what has started to happen is that
individual publishers have made deals with

469
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:09,464
Google

470
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,090
to let Google digitize
their list for a fee.

471
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,760
But see now that money starts
to come into this arrangement,

472
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,600
it starts to look less like free access
and more like an access that is once

473
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,740
again shaped by these
financial considerations.

474
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,520
It's not at all clear how the nobility
of the project and the financial context

475
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:39,440
are going to work themselves out.

476
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,750
And it's not at all clear yet what
the general approach of educational

477
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:49,430
institutions will be towards this. Yale
has not signed on to this, for example.

478
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,510
So some universities have, some
haven't. These are huge, uh,

479
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,640
looming questions that will impact
what we get to see as literature.

480
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,110
Um,

481
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:08,110
how much access we have among the vast
choices that the Internet makes available

482
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,020
to us.
Um,

483
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,370
I want to just mention one more thing
and that's about internationalization.

484
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,350
One thing that,
um,

485
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
you didn't probably see the
bookstore is fiction and translation,

486
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:30,080
contemporary fiction in translation,
notoriously impossible to sell.

487
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,023
Um,

488
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,410
there is a press called the new press
that was founded after some of the

489
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:40,880
Pantheon editors left. And, uh,

490
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,280
they founded this nonprofit press

491
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:49,070
that is the only kind of fiction that
the new press publishes contemporary

492
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:54,071
fiction in translation because they
knew that only a nonprofit press could

493
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,810
publish this,
it will never sell.

494
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,370
One of the objections to the Google book
project is that the vast majority of

495
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:02,570
its texts are in English.

496
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,560
And it seems to present an English
centric vision of the world's knowledge

497
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,060
because it does have pretensions to be
the repository of the world's knowledge

498
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,290
in the reception of literature.
There are other forces.

499
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:21,620
And here's when we start to move
into the realm of the human stain.

500
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,510
In the 1990s,

501
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:28,511
there was a very lively and often
acrimonious debate in academia and,

502
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,710
uh,

503
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,710
among intellectual commentators about
whether literature was the purveyor of

504
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,860
ideology, political
ideology. So the question is,

505
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,190
does literature have a message
that it's trying to tell us?

506
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:50,270
And one way to think about this is to
think about English one 25 major British

507
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:52,950
poets, the sort of, uh,

508
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,170
the picture of what the old
fashioned Canon might look like.

509
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,460
It's all white guys.

510
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,900
I think there might be one woman that you
can put on the syllabus in the spring,

511
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,290
a modern poet.
You can probably teach bishop.

512
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,520
I think people do teach bishop in
the second term of English one 25.

513
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,580
Did those poets represent the
communication of an ideology?

514
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Because a lot of contemporary fiction
became the object of contention along with

515
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:29,870
these very traditional syllabi.

516
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,290
Are you going to include Toni
Morrison on your syllabus? Well,

517
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,940
this is no longer controversial.

518
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:40,570
She's such an overwhelmingly powerful
author at this time by the sheer quality

519
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:44,750
of her work.
But at her early in her career,

520
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,610
it would have been a question.

521
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,990
One of the striking things of course
about American fiction in the second half

522
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:55,730
of the 20th century into the 21st is
the demographic really does change.

523
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,060
Writers of color are much
more prominent there.

524
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,830
There are many more points of
view present in that Canon.

525
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,203
Okay.

526
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,620
So his literature,
sociology is sociological.

527
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,930
Does it speak to society
or is it an aesthetic, uh,

528
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,300
an aesthetic object?

529
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,410
Something that we should understand
as part of the history of an art form?

530
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,290
Do you have to choose between
these two? And I cite here, uh,

531
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,620
what became an incredibly important
book. It's really a wonderful book. Um,

532
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,400
by actually a Yale
graduate, John Guillory, uh,

533
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,170
title is cultural capital,

534
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:36,950
the problem of literary Canon Formation
Publish right at the height of the

535
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:40,430
culture wars of the cannon wars.
Um,

536
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,900
in it he argues that in
the mid 20th century,

537
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:48,860
literature was a kind
of social elite good.

538
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,320
And that the aesthetic,
if it had an ideology,

539
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:56,440
it was an ideology of bourgeois privilege.

540
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,040
So it wasn't that the content of
particular poems would be communicating

541
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,460
something about an elite
bourgeois ideology,

542
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,590
but rather that the very act of being
in the institution where you would study

543
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:14,800
such a thing at Yale in English one 25,

544
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:20,610
that was the repository of the
elite power of these texts.

545
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,930
So it had much more to do
with institutions than it
did about the content of any

546
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,310
particular literary work.

547
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,490
And he makes them very persuasive readings
of canonical poems that demonstrate

548
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
the undecidability of their ideology or
the way that they resist how they'd been

549
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:43,900
cast,
how those poems had been cast by critics.

550
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:54,070
There are also ways that novels were
received and complained about that become

551
00:38:57,291 --> 00:39:00,710
part of this picture.
So we've talked about black boy.

552
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:05,830
I mentioned how how controversial woman
warrior was because of its impurity as a

553
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,370
Chinese text.
Um,

554
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Toni Morrison became a real advocate of
writing by women of color in particular

555
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,490
and also as a literary critic.

556
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,030
She mounted an argument about
how whiteness functions as a,

557
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,510
uh, a central part of the
traditional Canon of literature.

558
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,100
And she wrote playing in
the dark whiteness and the
literary imagination in 1992

559
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:38,900
very influential text
internationally.

560
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,350
We had the phenomenon of Selman.
Rusty's Rusty's persecution.

561
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:47,351
The fatwah issued against
him by the Ayatollah Khomeini
after the publication of

562
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:52,310
the say tannic versus for
its depiction of Islam.

563
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:58,040
That kind of persecution becomes,
uh,

564
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,240
a feature of this more internationalized
debate about what is okay to say,

565
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,070
especially about religions.
And then of course,

566
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:12,050
we have the Danish cartoon episode with
the cartoons of Mohammed that are now

567
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,300
seemingly it's resurgent.

568
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,890
There's another question about
a film about Mohammad's life,

569
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,710
I believe it is.
Then there's Roths work.

570
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,070
And here's where I just want
to meditate for a minute.

571
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:30,071
On Roth Philip Roth's work has been
defined by these kinds of objections that

572
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:35,450
censure that I was
talking about. He was, um,

573
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,600
very widely acclaimed in 1960 when goodbye
Columbus won the national book award.

574
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,340
Goodbye Columbus is a set
of stories mostly about, um,

575
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
young Jewish protagonists living in a
Jewish context in Jewish communities in

576
00:40:54,111 --> 00:40:55,970
Newark or in New York.

577
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,210
It included a story called the conversion
of the Jews in which a young boy,

578
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,050
uh, actually it was a little older
than young boy. Maybe he's a teenager.

579
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,260
Ozzy Friedman becomes extremely agitated
because all his questions to his family

580
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,570
and to his rabbi about
Christianity are dismissed.

581
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,350
He finally comes to be punished for
asking these kinds of questions.

582
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,300
So Ozzy stages,

583
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:28,160
his revolt by climbing to the top of the
synagogue roof and threatening to jump

584
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:30,710
off if his family,

585
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,890
all the assembled students from his
school and the rabbi won't kneel down and

586
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:40,970
pray to Jesus, which of course they
do because it's about to jump off.

587
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,010
This story was quite controversial,
uh,

588
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:50,480
as you might imagine.
So there was a taste of Roths,

589
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:56,000
um, vexed relationship to
Jewish community in that story.

590
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:01,130
So it was all about how a hidebound
Jewish community was preventing and,

591
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,170
and circumscribing the curiosity
of a young American boy.

592
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,860
And it really highlighted
Ozzie's Americanness and
Roth has always emphasized

593
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:16,260
that about himself. He's
an American writer. Um,

594
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,380
like Saul bellow before him,

595
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:23,381
Saul Bellow had been his mentor and
teacher for a brief time at the University

596
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,740
of Chicago. Bellow insisted on
bringing into American literature.

597
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,950
The voice and Sensibility of an
immigrant Jewish family bellow was,

598
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,430
uh,

599
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:39,430
from a Russian Jewish family
that emigrated to Canada
in the early 20th century.

600
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,960
Bellow was told he would never,
because of his heritage,

601
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,520
when he was at the University of Chicago,

602
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:50,390
he was told he would never have the ear
for language that would allow him to

603
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:54,680
write beautifully because of
his linguistic background.

604
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,330
And because he was Jewish,

605
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,200
well bellow pioneered the way of bringing
in a particularly Jewish and European

606
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,620
notion of literature and a sensibility
about the body that could enter American

607
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:12,530
literature and change it from,

608
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:16,340
it's either waspish or
southern genteel quality.

609
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,210
And certainly this was
a very powerful current.

610
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,680
And Roth is the continuation of
that current in American letters.

611
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,870
Roth comes out in 1969
with Portnoy's complaint.

612
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,820
Portnoy is quite a novel. Um, it's
really all about masturbation.

613
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:40,270
It's about Alex Portnoy jacking off
in the bathroom to every possible a

614
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,950
provocative thought he can have.

615
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,220
And it's told as if to Alex's psychiatrist
in a sort of ranting over the top

616
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,820
style,
very explicit.

617
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,540
This got Roth into big trouble,

618
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,710
partly because Alex lives in a
very tight knit Jewish family.

619
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:07,730
In. This enters into the whole
story of his obsession with sex

620
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,720
Irving house. Uh, uh,

621
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,390
very prominent Jewish literary critic,

622
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,140
public intellectual wrote a famous essay
in 1972 called Philip Roth reconsidered

623
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,470
and he basically said that Roth,

624
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,620
the adulation given to Roth
was entirely inappropriate.

625
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,010
He now saw on reflection now that he
had read complaint because Roth had,

626
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,270
uh, an unfocused hostility
towards the Jewish community.

627
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:45,410
This enraged Roth that rage
fueled huge portions of his career

628
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:54,590
when in the human stain.
Roth has Coleman silk,

629
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:58,520
say all of Western literature
began with a coral,

630
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,480
the wrath of Achilles in a certain way.

631
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:07,280
He's describing his own
origin as a writer. Now.

632
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,940
Um, feel bear with me. Can
you do have just five minutes?

633
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,800
I want to get to one last point.

634
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,730
Yeah.

635
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,150
Roth in case you haven't noticed,
uh,

636
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,830
is a very misogynist writer.

637
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,360
Did you notice hard to,
hard to miss that,

638
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,320
why do I like Roth in this context where
writers are taken to task for their

639
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,830
offensiveness on cultural grounds,
on gender grounds,

640
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,990
on the grounds of identification?

641
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,920
How can you like someone who has this
major flaw who seems to see all women as

642
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:52,221
sexual objects who is unembarrassed
about saying his writing is about a man's

643
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:57,480
life. The life of men. It's
not about the life of women,

644
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,610
so why do I like Roth I this is
actually baffled me for years.

645
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,530
Why doesn't it bother me? Why
doesn't it bother me? You know,

646
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:11,910
there are parts in the human stain that
really are quite amazingly objectionable.

647
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,840
My favorite is the gift
of the molestation.

648
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:19,170
Do you remember this when they are talking
about Fanya and how great she is in

649
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:23,370
bed and what she's like at
breakfast afterwards and he's,

650
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,380
and they speculate Coleman and Nathan,

651
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:29,670
that that maybe that was the
gift of her having been molested.

652
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,910
Well,
molestation is never a gift.

653
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:37,140
If there's anything that comes
from living through a hard a life,

654
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,600
it is not the gift of the molestation,

655
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,470
but the gift of the person who
survived it. This is insane.

656
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,490
Why do I still like broth?
Well,

657
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:50,580
partly it's that like no one else.

658
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,640
He can take me into a voice
seamlessly draw me in.

659
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,330
Some of his ranting voices
are more and less convincing.

660
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,160
Some are more or less charactered.

661
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,310
Of course the women's are more
characters than the men's.

662
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,440
Nevertheless,

663
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:12,270
he can take me in there and the way his
sentences work are really sometimes just

664
00:47:12,271 --> 00:47:13,500
astonishingly beautiful.

665
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:14,960
Okay.

666
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,080
There's a part in the human stain
that I particularly like. Um,

667
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,710
and you'll get to it as you finish the
novel for Monday and that's when he's

668
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:25,070
describing Coleman and
Fanya at Tanglewood.

669
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:29,120
So just think about that when you read
that pause for a minute over that.

670
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,380
I think what it is ultimately is that
I'm very moved by two things and Ross

671
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:40,381
writing that is the meditation on
mortality and what goes along with that.

672
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,960
I think the focus on and
the dignity of the body,

673
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,690
there's a very wit Manian sense to his
understanding of sex and the body in all

674
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,900
its complexity.
I appreciate that.

675
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:03,090
I moved by that sense of the
inaccessibility of the other person.

676
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:04,590
This was for my lecture on Monday.

677
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,780
The way you always get the other
fellows life somehow wrong.

678
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,310
That speaks to me about the difference
between my consciousness and anyone I

679
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:18,360
encounter in the world.
That to me is profound and moving.

680
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,660
It reminds me that for all Roth's
linguistic energy and skill as a writer,

681
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,180
there's still that great divide
that language is trying to cross.

682
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,910
And that's what I appreciate
about literature in general,

683
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,260
that it's that great attempt
to cross that divide.

684
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,220
I can overlook the massage
in e for those things.

685
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,460
Am I like Roth? Probably not.
But that's why I like him.

686
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,990
I read to see what I'm not,

687
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,560
not to see what I am.

688
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,633
Yeah.

689
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,390
And so Ross,
very different from me.

690
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:04,391
His misogyny is part of what allows
me to feel that I am entering,

691
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:06,230
however, partially, however,

692
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:11,231
always in a compromised way into the
consciousness of another person through

693
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:17,030
that beautiful,
amazing medium of language.

694
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,790
So that's why I like Roth.

695
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:24,440
And I would encourage you to think about
your own responses to the books that

696
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:25,460
we've read together.

697
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:29,510
Think about what it means
about you as a reader,

698
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:33,620
that you respond in certain ways.
So we'll pick this up on Monday.

699
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:34,400
Thank you for waiting.
