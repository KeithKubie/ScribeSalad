00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.340
What do you call cheese that’s not yours?

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.340
Nacho cheese!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.330
Did you just smile or laugh out loud?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.330
Turns out it could depend a lot on your genes.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.400
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.200
How happy of a person you are depends on a
lot.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.670
Your personality, your circumstances, and
even your culture can all impact your happiness.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.920
And some people are happier than others.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.800
Some people when they hear a stupid pun or
a good joke will crack a small smile while

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.610
others will throw their heads back in a belly
laugh.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.409
Research published in the American Psychological
Association journal Emotion found that there’s

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.219
a link between your genes and how emotionally
reactive you are.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.970
The researchers looked at short and long alleles
of the gene 5-HTTLPR, which might be responsible

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.309
for some of the activity of the neurotransmitter
serotonin.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.719
Most people think that serotonin plays a part
in mood disorders like depression and anxiety.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.000
Previous research suggests that those with
the short allele are more prone to negative

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.769
mood disorders like depression.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.390
But this new research finds that it’s not
all bad news for short allele havers.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.640
Turns out those with the short allele are
also more likely to laugh and smile more at

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.670
funny things.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.030
So maybe this gene kind of acts as an amplifier
for emotion.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.360
People with the short allele might be more
emotionally reactive to their environments.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.659
So negative experiences hurt more, but they
also thrive in positive environments.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.140
Other studies like one published in the journal
Psychological Science, also found evidence

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.700
of a genetic predisposition to happiness.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.939
In this study researchers studied more than
900 pairs of twins.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.829
Twins are often used in studies that look
for genetic links.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.670
The researchers found that those who “do
not excessively worry, and who are sociable

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.960
and conscientious tend to be happier”.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.829
And that these traits might be genetic to
some degree.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.020
This personality can even act as a buffer
during more difficult periods of that persons

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.020
life.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.570
But if you’re worried you don’t have the
right inherited traits, the researchers stress

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.159
that only 50% of your happiness is dependant
on your genes.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.700
Your relationships, health and careers easily
make up for the other half.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.329
On the other hand, being happy can impact
your genes!

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.259
One study published in the journal Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.640
that different types of happiness can change
your gene expression.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.720
Even though they had similar rates of happiness,
people’s gene expression looked different

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.450
based on what kind of happiness that was.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.170
People who rate highly on eudaimonic well-being
or happiness, that’s like having a sense

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.840
of purpose and meaning in life, have low levels
of inflammatory gene expressions and strong

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.920
expression of antiviral and antibody genes.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.141
And conversely, those with hedonic well-being,
like consuming things to gain happiness, have

00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:32.730
high levels of inflammatory gene expressions
and lower antiviral and antibody gene expression.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.510
Which would, you know, change how your immune
system responds to an infection.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.580
So don’t worry, be happy!

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.350
Real happiness, not the kind of happiness
our consumeristic society wants you to have.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.920
Your genes will thank you.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.370
And if you’re happy, maybe you should thank
your genes!

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.740
On a related note, do you ever cry when you’re
happy?

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.040
Why do you do that?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.620
