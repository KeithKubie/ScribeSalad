00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
Vsauce!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.509
Kevin here and you just lost a dollar.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.870
I mean not literally -- obviously this is
a fictional scenario that examines an unexpected

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.060
slice of numerical cognition.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.430
And in our scenario, a dollar is mysteriously
missing.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.540
Right quick, this video is actually sponsored
by LastPass.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.900
Who I reached out to because I like their
service so much.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.800
I've been using LastPass for about a year
now and it's because I was sick and tired

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.730
of getting locked out of my accounts, having
so many different usernames and so many different

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.730
passwords.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.539
And didn't websites having different rules
about what the password can be.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:42.300
I said, 'enough already,' I'll just put everything
in LastPass and just take the burden off of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.219
my brain and made my life that much easier.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.829
And it really has worked.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.649
Basically, it stores everything safely and
securely for you and then autofills your usernames

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.769
and passwords everywhere so if you wanna make
your life that much easier then just click

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.769
the link down in the description below.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.199
It should be this way.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.199
I think.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.400
And get LastPass for yourself and thanks again
to LastPass for sponsoring this video.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Okay.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.130
Now let’s find that missing dollar.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.230
You, and your friends Michael and Jake went
out to lunch and split the $30 bill evenly.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.580
You paid $10 bucks each.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.000
But the server accidentally overcharged you
and the bill should’ve been only $25 dollars.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.030
So she gives the busboy your $5 dollar refund
but he can’t figure out how to evenly divide

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.060
it amongst three people, and frankly, you
don’t even know that you've been overcharged,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.250
so he just takes a $2 tip for his efforts
and gives you, Michael and Jake one dollar

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.230
back each.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.270
So now you’ve only paid 9 dollars each for
lunch.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:58.320
9 + 9 + 9 = 27 plus the busboy kept $2 for
himself for a total of $29.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.750
But you originally paid $30.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.350
So... a dollar is missing.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.070
How does a dollar disappear?

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.590
Where is the missing dollar?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.310
Before we breakdown this riddle let’s try
this with different numbers and just see what

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.310
happens.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.700
Let’s say you still pay a $30 dollar bill
but this time the server realizes there’s

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.970
been a huge mistake, and the total should’ve
been only $10 bucks.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.400
So now the busboy gets $20 to return to you,
Michael and Jake, which he also can’t divide

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.409
equally.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.120
You don’t know about the exact price change,
so the busboy takes his $2 tip, leaving him

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.560
with $18 to cleanly divide three ways.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.049
He refunds each of you $6 bucks.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.769
Reducing your effective price to 4 dollars
each.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.609
So you paid $4 + $4 + $4 + plus the busboy
tip of $2 = $14.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.030
And just like that $16 is gone!

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.239
Because you only paid $14 for a $30 bill?

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.239
No.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.239
No!

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.239
No!

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.590
Something is clearly completely wrong with
this setup.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.739
This is actually a pretty popular and rather
old riddle.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.000
It seems to have originated in the mid 1700s
with mathematician Francis Walkingame’s

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.579
“Tutor’s Assistant,” a sort of arithmetic
textbook.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:29.469
"If 48 taken from 120 leaves 72, and 72 taken
from 91 leaves 19, and 7 taken from thence

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:35.340
leaves 12, what number is that, out of which,
when you have taken 48, 72, 19, and 7, leaves

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.959
12?"

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.269
Part of what makes the Missing Dollar Riddle
confusing is that it bombards you with numbers.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.569
That’s okay, though because your abilities
with numerical cognition are actually pretty

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.569
good.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.310
Yale cognitive scientist Karen Wynn found
that infants can understand simple arithmetic

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.639
like 1 + 1 = 2.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:06.999
If I bombard you with numbers, like 2 + 5
+ 3 + 1 + 7 + 12, you aren’t confused about

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:14.609
what’s happening and you can work through
it to an answer of 30.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.269
But when context is added to those numbers,
it’s easy to get sidetracked.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.340
We get so wrapped up in what’s happening
with the lunch, the refund, and the bus boy

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:33.330
that we gloss over the real math and hear
9 + 9 + 9 + 2 = 29 and wonder where the dollar

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.330
went?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.080
But it’s not missing.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.349
We just played a mathematical sleight of hand.

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.550
Here’s the breakdown.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.090
We started with $30.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.460
$25 of that is still in the restaurant’s
cash register.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.669
The other $5 has been given back -- $3 have
been returned to you and $2 for the busboy’s

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:53.669
tip.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.699
25 + 3 + 2 = 30, so where’s the disconnect?

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.080
Really?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.310
Where exactly &nbsp;is the disconnect?

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.930
Let’s find it.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.479
There are really two huge problems in this
riddle.

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.060
One is how we think about that $3 refunded
dollars-- we’re only considering it once

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.199
when we really need to consider it twice.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.650
And the second problem is how we’re incorrectly
factoring in the bus boy’s tip.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.040
Let’s talk about that tip first.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.220
Because the bus boy takes his $2 tip, that's
money that’s never returned to you, Michael

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.870
or Jake, and therefore must now be considered
as part of the total cost of the lunch.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.220
Which means that the new cost of the meal
is the $25 still in the cash register, plus

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.030
the bus boy’s $2 tip equaling $27.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.970
When each of the three of you pays $10 bucks
and then gets $1 dollar back, your effective

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.170
cost of the meal -- the food plus the waiter’s
tip -- is $9 each, for $27.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.560
That leaves $3 dollars missing.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.750
The $3 dollars returned to you by the bus
boy.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.060
So now we’re left with the $3 problem.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.979
The 9 plus 9 plus 9 plus 2 equation of the
riddle is simply the wrong equation.

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.900
Actually, as we just learned, the 9’s are
right but the 2 is wrong.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.310
The 2 is already factored into the 9’s.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.530
What we need to do is add back the 3.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.310
Which is kinda confusing and part of that
sleight of hand.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.650
The riddle uses the 3 to subtract from the
customers’ new final, total cost of the

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.350
meal, but we have to add it back in at the
end to get to the original $30 that changed

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.350
hands.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.350
Look.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.100
You paid ten dollars each.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.810
Refund your $3 taking the amount you paid
down to $27.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.099
And then give the busboy his $2 tip and the
restaurant keeps $25.

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:04.849
There is no missing dollar.

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:10.039
The riddle is just answering the right question
the wrong way.

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:15.909
Legendary statistician John Tukey once said,
“An approximate answer to the right question

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:21.289
is worth a great deal more than a precise
answer to the wrong question.”

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:27.439
When it comes to the Missing Dollar Riddle,
the precise answer to the right question is

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:33.189
worth at least... a buck.

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:37.440
And always -- thanks for watching.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.180
Hey!

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.840
My podcast where I interview Michael about
Vsauce is finally ready for you to listen

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.749
to right now for free.

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:53.980
We get into the early days of Vsauce, how
I became Vsauce2, Michael's thoughts on creativity

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.830
and being a meme and so so much more.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.330
So first of all, thanks again to LastPass
for sponsoring this video.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.800
Second of all, check out my podcast, The Create
Unknown, where Michael and I talk about How

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.819
To Make Vsauce.

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:15.820
Michael: And there was one day where I had
done an IMG! episode, which I'm not in, right,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.800
those are just my voice, curating funny pictures
on the internet.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.370
Which, also, by the way, is such a dated show.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.159
There are so many better ways to look for
funny pictures on the internet.

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:27.069
But back then people were like, "I don't know!

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:29.990
I guess I have to watch a YouTube video to
see funny pictures!"

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.000
Anyway.
