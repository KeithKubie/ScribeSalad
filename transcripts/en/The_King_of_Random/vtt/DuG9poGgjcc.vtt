00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Everyone is familiar with gum.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.600
Well, we've got our hands
on a whole bunch of gumballs,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.700
and we're going
to see what happens

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.900
if you put them into a blender
in a few different ways.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.940
[Music]

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.440
We've got a nice
powerful blender here,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.100
and we also have
a whole lot of gumballs.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.200
This isn't even all of them.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.000
We've got more gumballs
in this bag,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.480
and this bag comes
with almost 700.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.300
We got to try some stuff.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.340
All right, these appear
to be little ball of gum.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.860
Thin candy coating on the
outside to give us some color,

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.337
and probably some flavor,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.600
a dummy bit,
little bit of air in the middle.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.640
So I just want to point out,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.120
one of these tiny little
gumballs is 10 calories a piece.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.300
The first three ingredients
are different types of sugar.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.980
Sugar, sugar, sugar,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.960
and then a gum base,
and the gum base,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.400
it's literally rubber.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.080
Like rubber from a rubber tree,
very similar to rubber bands.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.200
Let's start out with a few
smaller scale test though.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.680
Let's try putting in
like 10 gumballs in,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200
and seeing what happens
if we blend them up.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.020
Maximum power.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.980
Oh no--

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.240
[Music]

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.700
Um, I was not expecting
that to work.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.920
Wow.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.740
I thought that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.100
the inside gum part would
have liked more resistance,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.600
and it wouldn't get broken up.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.080
But like this is,
we just made gum powder.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.680
Like that's a really
fine powder even.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.220
So we got a white powder.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.580
There are these chunks.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.880
&gt;&gt; Oh, no, it's just...
&gt;&gt; No, Just...

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.500
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Come together a little bit.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.800
White powder was specs
of color all through it.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.400
Well, I got to try some of this.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.100
Oh, yeah.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.200
[Music]

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.480
I can feel a lot of it
just to dissolve away.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.680
The sugar is gone immediately.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.669
Oh, it was a very
big handful I got.

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:51.220
I think I maybe,
I'm swallowing something.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.890
There's not a lot of gum left.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.200
Yeah that really
powderized quite a bit.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.440
Let's do five hundred gumballs,
unchewed in the blender.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.200
Let's do it.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.160
[Music]

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.860
That's 250.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.300
500.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:18.620
[Music]

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.000
Oh my god.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.500
[Music]

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.680
It's actually collapsing
over on this side.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.024
I think--

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:35.855
Yeah, the blades are

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.592
probably like holding
it open a little bit,

00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:38.380
and so now, yeah,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.889
this side--

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.460
I did not expect
that to work that well.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.000
Wow.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.762
What's that like?

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:45.400
Like kinetic sand?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.420
Mmm.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.860
Oh my goodness.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.600
This is fun.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.800
It's like edible kinetic sand.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.280
It doesn't like hold
itself together as much.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.826
No, it feels similar though.

00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:55.200
It does.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.700
It does feel very similar
to kinetic sand honestly.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.623
Just the slight cohesion.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.923
Here, Nate.

00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:03.100
I made this for you.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.900
Oh good.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.860
[Music]

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.840
All right, 500 gumballs
reduced to powder.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.800
The more you play with it,

00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:18.900
the less like
kinetic sand it is.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.720
It's just becoming a mess.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.700
I'm gonna add
a little bit of water.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.080
See if we can make
this look like chewed gum.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.300
All right.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.980
Well, there's some
wet gumball sand.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.611
It's picking up a lot of the dye
and the shells of the gumballs.

00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:37.200
All right.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.700
I'm going to try
some of this too.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.380
That looks even less appealing.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.440
Mmm.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.200
Yeah, that was
like a wet gumball.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.600
Does it-- Does it taste

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.000
like you just pick up
somebody's chewed gum,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.700
and put it in your mouth?

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.920
Actually, there's a lot
more flavor than normal.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.900
Because the water--
I'm like choking on it.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.300
The water like rinsed
off a lot of the sugar

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.823
and the dye and the flavor,

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:01.960
and I'm just getting

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.200
that all immediately at once,
instead of it being released

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.000
as I chew it.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.480
[Music]

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.700
Yeah, that's a--

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.100
Potent.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.900
Yeah, that tastes

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.500
like 17 gumballs all
at the same time.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.958
That was pretty cool.

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.882
We got some gumball sand.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.783
Now, we want to try and put
it in with some water,

00:04:25.783 --> 00:04:26.659
see what happens.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.380
There it goes.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.860
[Music]

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.200
More gumball?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.560
[Music]

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.580
More gumball.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.100
I think we need to add more.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:05:01.740
[Music]

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.480
Yeah, we got a big
old lump in there.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.420
It was getting really
mad about that--

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.900
Blender chewed gum.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.680
Oh, that just very

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.800
strong gumball smell
comes flooding out.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.400
Smells better than
before you blend them though.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.980
Less chemical, more
actually like a--

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.400
Oh no.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.740
It's wet chewed gum.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.300
But it did.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.310
It's really like the consistency
of chewed gum.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.971
I don't know.

00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:28.700
Okay. Well, we have to try this too.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.500
All right, just remind myself.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.220
No one has chewed this gum.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.020
I hate this.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.430
This is not technically
pre-chewed gum.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.000
Oh no!

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.460
[Music]

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.660
Now, I'm struggling.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.840
[Music]

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.100
Oh, it's really really soft.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.900
Rubbery.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.400
The water that we used
was a little bit warm,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.500
and then the blender

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.742
actually can heat stuff up
if you blend it enough.

00:05:50.742 --> 00:05:51.600
I think it did that.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.889
This is like you just

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.740
put somebody's previously
chewed gum right in here mouth.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.577
Except it has all
of the flavor first.

00:05:58.577 --> 00:05:59.400
Yeah, for like

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.922
the first 10 seconds,
then there's no more flavor.

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:02.460
It goes away immediately.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.500
So that was like making
like a concentrated gumball.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.240
It was--

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.839
It was sickly sweet kind
of thing like, so much.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.286
I don't know how you fit

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.600
that much sweetness into
that little liquid to the point

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.500
that I wasn't actually
able to swallow it

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.300
because it was gonna
make me nausea.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.220
But that's a lot
of chewed gum right there,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.720
blender chewed and then
person chewed afterward.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.199
But the blender did.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:25.620
It did.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.444
The blender chewed the gum.

00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:28.924
I just have to remember

00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:31.500
that every choice
I've made in my life up

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.400
until this point has led
me to this moment.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.580
[Music]

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.300
Is it sweet?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.500
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Does it taste like bubble gum?

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.319
Yeah, you know
how concentrated that was?

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.266
This is worse.

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:43.880
Oh wow.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.240
This is so sweet, it's like--

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.392
Normally, like sugar is good.

00:06:47.392 --> 00:06:48.200
I love sugar.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.933
But this hits a level that like,

00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:52.100
like your body almost
wants to reject it,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.511
but it still taste good.

00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:54.700
That's the weird part.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.500
Give it a try.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.700
[Music]

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.600
Oh my gosh.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.900
Well, we've got another
experiment we need to do,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.350
and a lot more gumballs.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.372
Now, we want to actually
try and put pre-chewed gum

00:07:08.372 --> 00:07:09.400
into the blender.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.354
This is going to take a while.

00:07:11.354 --> 00:07:12.400
It is gonna take a while.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.466
I think for speed sake,

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.888
we'll probably try two doing
to gum balls at once,

00:07:15.888 --> 00:07:17.631
but it's still going
to take a while.

00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.890
Should we livestream this?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.390
No.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.500
Two hours later.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.720
So we're not a 500 yet.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.300
But our stomachs really hurt.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.800
This is so much sugar...

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.200
Stomach hurts, jaw
hurts a little bit.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.220
So we have an idea of what might
make this a little bit easier,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.300
and it's gonna change
the gum balls a little bit,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.600
but I think it's worth it.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.500
So the idea is

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.500
that we're going to actually
get rid of this candy

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.640
coated shell on the outside.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.300
That's where a lot of the sugar
and flavoring is.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.800
We're hoping that

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.700
if we can rinse these
off in hot water,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.548
and remove that so it's
just the gum itself,

00:07:51.548 --> 00:07:54.000
it might go a little
bit easier on us.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.300
So unfortunately,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.360
in the inside,
it is white,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.340
so I think our gumball stopped
being so colorful.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.070
But it's going to be easier

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.600
on us to get
through 500 gumballs.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:35.560
[Music]

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.040
Well, we did that.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.620
We chewed so much gum.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.860
So you can see,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.220
we've got the colored gum
from we left the shells on,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.460
and the rest of the gum from
after we washed it off.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.355
And it did make it
a little bit easier,

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:51.708
but oh my goodness,
that was so much gum.

00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:54.100
Well, most of these
are two pieces of gum,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.220
and then Calli
also made a couple

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.700
where there are some tens
and there's a 25 gumball blob.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.400
Okay.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.400
Let's throw these
in the blender,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.560
and turn it on.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.900
[Music]

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.580
It's more than I
thought it would be.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:25.980
[Music]

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.600
Oh, no.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.320
Error.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.580
Overload.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.800
Just hit the highest setting.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800
I'll try and see.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.500
Do it.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:40.300
[Music]

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.480
Oh, no, it's binding.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.400
Overload.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.200
You can actually smell
the motor overheating.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.640
[Music]

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.700
A little bit of hot water,
see how it goes.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.800
We'll see if that helps at all.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.379
Still can't handle it.

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:01.800
Kinda like loosen
it up a little bit.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:13.420
[Music]

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.600
So the blob was just
like sitting on the top

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.366
of the blades,

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.360
and it was like being spun
around, not falling in.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.600
And I'm actually afraid
of what would happen

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.900
if it hit the blades
all at once.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.200
I think this is now
a chewed gum smoothie.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.900
Oh.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.940
Would you like some?

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.700
Mark?

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:40.340
[Music]

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.300
Blendered gum.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.000
There you go.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.730
That's about 500 gumballs
and a little bit of water.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.090
Oh no, why would you do this?

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.980
Viewers have got to know.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.500
They have a right to see this.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.520
I don't think anybody deserves
to have to see this.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.980
I'm sorry then, viewers.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.600
A comparison.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.500
It is basically the same
number of gumballs.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.320
It is.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.580
Guys, that was fun.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.873
But we've always got more
for you to see.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.580
This box up here at the top will
take you to our latest video.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.900
That box down
to the bottom will show you

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.617
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.000
And if you're not subscribed,
hit this bomb in the middle.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.300
That will make you a subscriber,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.800
and that way,
you'll never miss out a video.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.883
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:17.106
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:18.240
Talk to you then.
