WALEED KADOUS: OK, thank
you very much.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.000
We're really excited that
you've joined us today.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.140
My name is Waleed Kadous, and
next to me is Sarah Peterson,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.630
the Business Product Manager
for Indoor Maps.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.490
And we're really excited to talk
to you today about Indoor

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.100
Maps and their potential to make
people's lives a little

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.900
less tedious, a little less
annoying, so they can get on

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.690
with what they really want to
get on about and do whatever

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.720
it is that they want to do,
just as Larry mentioned in

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.880
today's keynote.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.060
So here's what we want to plan
to talk about today.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.990
We want to tell you why we think
indoors are important,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.170
and now is a critical time
for Indoor Maps.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.150
We want to walk you through what
we have right now, what

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.370
the state of the current product
is, where we're up to.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.330
And then we want to take you a
little bit behind the curtain

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.420
of how we made Indoor
Maps, how they work.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.930
And we're going to share some
stuff with you today that we

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.510
haven't shared publicly before,
and that's what we're

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.720
really excited about as well,
and we look forward to your

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.580
questions and answers.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.110
And finally, we want to
discuss with you, as

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.480
developers, some of the exciting
opportunities we

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.340
think are coming for Indoor
Location and Indoor Maps.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.960
So why do we care about
Indoor Maps so much?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.770
So here's the first reason.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.620
According to the EPA,
people spend 90%

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.370
of their time indoors.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.740
And some of you might
say, well, what's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.560
the point of that?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.860
Half of that is me sleeping in
bed, and the other half is

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.140
when I'm at work.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.320
But when you actually look at
where people spend, and you

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.490
just focus on public
indoor spaces--

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.300
places like restaurants, places
like Moscone Center

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.210
right now--

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.380
those types of places, they
spend about an hour, hour and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.960
a half in shopping and all
of those kinds of things.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.100
Now just as Larry mentioned
today, by comparison, people

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.760
spend about 50 minutes every day
outdoors or commuting and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.720
just getting from
place to place.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.060
Yet we've devoted a huge amount
of our efforts to this

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.290
application that works in the
outdoor case, but we haven't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.160
really spent a lot of time
on the indoor case.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.240
And I want to tell you a little
bit more just to give

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.880
you an idea of how present
Indoors can be.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.110
So I want you to think about
what it's like for people in

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.550
Tokyo, and here's, actually, a
story that happened to me.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.750
I went to visit Google's office
in Roppongi Hills,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.560
which is a beautiful,
beautiful office.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.590
I checked into the hotel,
the Grand Hyatt.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.600
I went downstairs, had breakfast
in their cafe.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.600
I went to Google's office, and
if you guys ever get the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.310
opportunity to visit the Google
office there in Tokyo,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.090
it's an amazing, amazing
office with

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.830
views of Mount Fuji.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.840
And then some of my other
colleagues at Google decided

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.220
it was time for us to go out and
get some food for dinner.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.670
And sure enough, we hopped
on the train.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.480
We changed trains twice, and
then we ended up at this

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.260
beautiful, beautiful sushi
restaurant where we had some

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.630
pretty nice food.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.200
And the amazing thing to me
about that entire trip is I

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.620
wasn't outdoors once.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.920
I was indoors the entire time.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.270
And that's what it's like to
live in a place like Tokyo or

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.990
Singapore or one of those
other urbanized centers.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.980
And if you can't provide
information to people in that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.390
kind of environment about how
to go about their daily

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.310
business, then you're
not really

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.740
delivering a great service.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.890
So I want to focus on a few
particular classes and ways

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.620
that we can use Indoor Maps to
make people's experiences

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.140
easier and to get the
inconvenient questions out of

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.040
their lives.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.370
The first is that we can enhance
existing products.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.420
You can imagine if we can answer
questions like, is

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.510
there an ATM inside here, or I
need to find the restrooms

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.420
quickly, those types of things,
we can really remove a

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.950
lot of the annoyance
in people's lives.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.770
But there's another class of
applications that's not

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.960
foreground applications like
this, where the user comes to

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.680
you and asks a question.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.790
Those are background
applications, what we would

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.840
call contextual apps, and we
really think there's a lot of

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.650
potential there for Indoor Maps
and Location to enhance

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.560
the performance on that
particular front.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.650
And I'm going to come back to
that at the end of the session

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.480
just to kind of point you as we
look forward to what we can

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.730
do with that.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.350
All right.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.010
So let's take a deep dive.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.160
Let's say you buy my story and
you agree that Indoor Maps are

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.800
really very useful.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.290
Let's just do a deep dive, find
out what the different

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.090
components are.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.570
So on the left here, you can see
what it looks like before

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.370
we add Indoor Maps to a venue,
and on the right here, you can

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.850
see what we end up
with afterwards.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.530
You can see we've added
a lot more detail.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.550
There's the Floor Selector
over here.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.850
You've noticed that the blue
dot and the blue circle are

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.700
strengthened.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.070
So you can see that there's
a lot of work

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.980
that goes into this.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.960
This happens to be the Mall of
America, which is the biggest

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.390
mall in the United States.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.790
It's so big there's a theme
park in the middle, and in

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.110
wintertime, runners run around
the loop because it's too cold

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.450
to go running outside.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.280
And if you were in that type of
venue, can you imagine if

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.140
you didn't have Indoor Maps if
you wanted to find someone?

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.380
Four levels of just retail after
retail after retail.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.480
You can see how valuable having
indoor information is.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.720
Let's zoom in for a moment
just to kind of see.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.690
So as well as the big picture,
you have the other

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.220
information.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.750
Over here, you have
the restrooms.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.510
You have information desk.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.540
You have elevators
and escalators.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.990
All of that's got to be added.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.570
And what's interesting is those,
what we call points of

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.970
interest, vary from
place to place.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.630
If you're at an airport, what
you care about is the airport

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.870
baggage carousels.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.490
If you're in a museum, you care
about the displays and

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.720
the exhibitions.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.420
And if you're in a department
store, you care about men's

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.700
shoes or whatever else it is
that you're looking for.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.060
And as well as that, you need
to know the walking paths so

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.010
we can give you really
high-quality

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.920
directions as well.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.590
But there's another component
as well as the map, which we

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.780
call a location, of course, and
here's the tricky part.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.960
Maps don't really become that
useful if you don't know where

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.210
you are relative to them.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.690
And we really care a lot about
user location and getting the

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.740
user's location as accurate
as possible.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.330
So this is a screenshot from
the Bloomingdale's that's

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.170
around the corner or across the
road from here, where we

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.090
have Indoor Maps and Indoor
location, and I just wanted to

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.176
give you a feel of the different
error metrics.

00:06:26.176 --> 00:06:30.350
So this circle shows about
25-meter accuracy.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.790
So 25 meters, 30 meters, roughly
speaking, that's what

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.870
you get from a network-based
location.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.000
So you can see it's not really
very useful to the user.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.820
He could be in one of four
different departments.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.670
He could be in women's
fragrances or cosmetics.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.680
We just don't have a clue.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.215
So if you just showed this
circle to the user, it

00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:52.900
wouldn't be very useful.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.550
Now here's the interesting
thing.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.660
Let's go to 15 meters, and
that's a little bit better.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.970
We're starting to work out maybe
they're only in one of

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.560
three different departments.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.540
Now, here's something I
want you to notice.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.080
15 meters is about what
you get with GPS.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.150
So what I want you to realize
is that the error levels for

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.840
Location and Indoors
are even higher.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.210
And it's only when you get to
5-ish, 10-ish meters that you

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.950
start to get useful.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.520
You can identify right
away where you are.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.090
And at the 6-meter level, it
varies a lot from place to

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.130
place what accuracy
levels we get.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.240
But roughly speaking, 6 meters
is kind of the mean of the

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.130
performance when we do
high-quality location.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.900
And of course, our goal is to
get to 1 meter, at which point

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.320
you can really, really
accurately place yourself and

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.450
you can help the user find
what they need to find.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.650
So I really want to tell you why
I'm excited to be talking

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.170
to you today.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.590
It's really about these four
things that are coming

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.980
together right at this
very moment.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.560
Google now has some
really, really

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.960
good indoor maps coverage.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.590
In fact, imagine we took all
of our indoor maps, all of

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.010
them, and tiled them end to
end, you'd have enough to

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.640
cover the entire city
of San Francisco.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.010
And in fact, not just that, but
you'd need a pretty decent

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:16.090
mezzanine, almost an entire
other floor to really show

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.040
what the extent of our coverage
is, and we're going

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.350
to keep adding San
Francisco-sized floors as we

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.880
move forward.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.520
Not only that, but there's the
possibility of adding the

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.280
high-quality indoor location,
as I mentioned.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.960
Combine that with self-service
tools that allow people like

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.730
business owners and venue owners
to upload Location and

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.190
Indoor Maps, as well as
improving developer APIs, and

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.830
I have to ask the question,
are we getting close to a

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.880
tipping point on Indoor Maps?

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.850
And let me be clear what I
mean by a tipping point.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.910
So maybe some of you are old
enough to remember 1999, that

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.950
between 1999 and 2003, there
was this really weird

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.970
transition that happened
to the web.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.900
If you found a company or a
business, and you searched for

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.920
them on the web, and you found
they had a web page, you'd be

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.630
like, cool.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.380
That company is kind of
ahead of the curve.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.480
And then by 2003, what happened
was you found a

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.460
business or company, you looked
for their website, and

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.870
if they didn't have one,
you'd be like,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.630
what's wrong with them?

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.270
Why aren't they keeping
up with the times?

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.650
And in fact, it's borne
out by the statistics.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.560
I took the statistics for the
growth of domain name

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.960
registrations between
1999 and 2003.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.070
And whap, in the space of
four years, domain name

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.390
registrations grew by a factor
of 33, which is incredible.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.410
And what I'm wondering is, is
Indoors on the verge of the

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:47.880
same thing?

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.100
We have all of the
prerequisites.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.760
Will we go to a place where
you open Google Maps on

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.700
Android right now, and you see
floor plans for Moscone and

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.750
you go, ooh, that's
kind of cool.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.440
But going to a business
somewhere, and then all of a

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.670
sudden, you pull out your phone,
and they don't have a

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.660
map and you'll be like, what's
wrong with this business?

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.620
Why don't they have
Indoor Maps?

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.400
And I think we may be on the
cusp of that very, very

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.230
exciting transition.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.120
So you guys are like, well yeah,
I mean, he's preaching

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.840
to the converted.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.280
Why don't we have
this already?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.160
I wanted to spend a few minutes
to explain to you the

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.450
challenges that we face as we
try to really move the needle

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.550
on Indoor Maps.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.210
So the first problem you have is
where do you get your floor

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.440
plans from?

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.470
When you're outdoors, let's say
that you wanted to do maps

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.850
for the entire US.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.090
You can actually go to the US
Census, and there's this

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.830
really nice data set called
Tiger, and it has road names,

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.370
and address ranges, and the
geography, and the layout, and

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.860
the suburbs, and the cities, a
huge amount of information.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.430
But that information doesn't
exist indoors in the same way.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.840
And as well as that, we
don't even have the

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.940
means to verify it.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.350
So as we'll talk about-- and
there'll be a presentation

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.820
after this about
Ground Truth--

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.450
we use Street View and aerial
imagery to really get the

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.110
quality of our outdoor maps up,
so it's going to be hard

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.720
to do that.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.970
The second thing is that
location is very challenging.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.390
As we mentioned, the first
problem is that you've got a

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.290
higher bar to meet.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.000
Just bringing GPS indoors, even
if you could do it, would

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.250
not be good enough, and
that's the problem.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.910
GPS doesn't work indoors, and
I think users don't realize

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.280
that this is the case.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.860
But if you were to pull out a
phone right now, you'd get the

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.550
blinking GPS sign, and you'd
probably get it all day

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.160
because the satellites just
can't get in here.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.860
So you can't use GPS, and one of
the worst things about GPS

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.000
is you can't estimate elevation
very accurately.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.980
So we're going to have to
come up with some other

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.340
technologies that help
us to determine which

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.860
level someone is on.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.360
And some of you who know your
sensors on the phones are

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.030
saying, well, we could use
the barometer, right?

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.710
That's a really, really
accurate sensor.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.930
In fact, if you have a phone
and you open the barometer,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.610
you'll see that the barometers
are kind of awesome.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.510
They can tell the difference
in elevation between this

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.660
height and this height
quite easily.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.000
So you go, great.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.850
That's awesome.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.160
All we need to do is measure
out a difference of 0.4

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.810
hectopascals, which is what the
units of air pressure are,

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.550
and we're golden.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.810
We can just use that and
estimate the elevation.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.220
But there's a problem.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.030
So if you go down the coast to
Half Moon Bay and you take the

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.330
air pressure measurements,
remember how I said it was 0.4

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.310
hectopascals?

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.630
This is the natural variation
that occurs in air pressure.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.110
So let me recalibrate this
graph for you in terms of

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.480
floors, and you can see that
just the natural air pressure

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.020
variation is plus or minus 24.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.215
So you've got to do some really
clever processing just

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:47.940
to estimate your elevation.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.550
And this is just an example of
why we face challenges with

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.260
determination of location.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.710
So we've kind of outlined some
of the potential benefits, why

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.700
we think we're especially
excited, how we can use Indoor

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.990
Maps to help people,
and why it's hard.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.950
But now let's actually do a deep
dive into the technology

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.440
as we show you what
we have so far.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.950
And with that, I'll hand
it over to Sarah.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.270
SARAH PETERSON: Thank
you, Waleed.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.990
So before I get started, how
many of guys have actually

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.830
used Indoor Maps today, just
a quick show of hands?

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.630
Cool.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.440
And how many of you guys
actually used Indoor Maps on

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.470
your journey to I/O?

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.580
So for those if you were out
of town or not out of town?

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.590
About maybe five.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.630
All right, cool.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.710
WALEED KADOUS: It's kind
of low numbers.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.860
SARAH PETERSON: So hopefully,
more of you will be convinced

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.015
to use it on your way home.

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:37.420
So I'm going to do a quick demo
of SFO and then talk a

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.100
little bit about what
we have today.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.550
Hopefully, a few of you at least
were traveling through

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.910
San Francisco International
Airport, or SFO, as I'll call

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.840
it, over the past
couple of days.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.700
So the first thing to notice
with our Indoor Maps is that

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.570
what we want to do is we want
to make sure that we map all

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.160
of the public space
within a venue.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.320
So for SFO, this means all of
the terminals as well as that

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.580
middle circle, which
is a parking lot.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:07.050
And as we dive in here, you're
going to see that the next

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.970
important thing is
that we want to--

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.956
WALEED KADOUS: What
happened there?

00:14:08.956 --> 00:14:10.206
SARAH PETERSON: Bummer.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.640
WALEED KADOUS: There we go.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.890
Let's give that a try.

00:14:18.832 --> 00:14:20.082
Look good?

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.100
SARAH PETERSON: So, of course,
we want to make sure that we

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.430
get all of the important
attributes within a venue.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.200
So within an airport, that's
going to mean things like the

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.590
ticket counters, which you can
see here, the bathrooms.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.100
As I scroll over, you can see in
the middle are the security

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.560
checkpoints.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.590
You're obviously going to want
to know where your gate is if

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.070
you're at an airport.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.870
And on the right-hand side,
you're going to see what

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.140
Waleed mentioned briefly, but
that's the Level Selector.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.090
So within the international
terminal, you can see there

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.500
are actually four levels,
and I can easily

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.330
move between these.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.080
And of course, when I'm in
international, the big--

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.330
bummer.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.830
The big dark piece is not
actually public space since

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.840
you're coming into the US,
so that's grayed out.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.120
And you'll see as I move over
to Terminal Three, there are

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.010
only three floors within
Terminal Three.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.240
Go down to Level One, you can
actually see the baggage

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.120
carousels for United
in this case.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.640
So now, let's just run through
a quick use case to show what

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.156
you guys can actually do with
Indoor Maps at the airport.

00:15:35.156 --> 00:15:37.246
WALEED KADOUS: Should we switch
to the WolfVision?

00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:38.900
SARAH PETERSON: Yeah, we
can do WolfVision.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.760
It's been a rough day with
the demo gods for

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.010
Google, I would say.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.410
Perfect.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.380
So I tend to fly really early
in the mornings, when I'm

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.340
flying out of SFO, what do I
want when I get to the airport

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:10.625
at 6:00 AM?

00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:11.900
I usually want a coffee.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.090
And so I'm just going to go
in and search for coffee.

00:16:16.778 --> 00:16:18.855
And what this is going to do is
it's going to bring up all

00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:20.170
of the coffee shops
that are actually

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.620
within this indoor venue.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.280
So I can scroll around
on the left-hand side

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.430
and see what's available.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.310
Alternatively, I can just
browse within the venue.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.230
You notice that the Level
Selector is now actually

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.820
annotated with a little red
dot to show you on which

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.670
levels a coffee shop exists.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.130
So I can see that not only on
the second level, which I'm on

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.800
right now, are there
coffee shops.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.480
If I click on three, there's
a pizza up here

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.730
on the third floor.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.530
This is a bit of a bummer.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.514
Well, we'll run through
this quickly.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.010
Both those coffee shops look
like they're before security.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.115
I don't like to chug
my coffee.

00:16:58.115 --> 00:17:00.420
I don't think anybody does.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.580
So I'm going to select
this Peet's Coffee.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.180
If I was actually at SFO right
now, what I would do is I

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.619
would simply click on Go, and
it would give me indoor

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.305
directions from where I was
standing to the Peet's Coffee.

00:17:10.305 --> 00:17:13.050
Since we're at Moscone,
we're going to cheat.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.900
I'm just going to click
a point on the map.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.275
The wireless is a little
flaky here.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.850
We might bail out to
the slides here.

00:17:53.894 --> 00:17:55.330
Yeah, bummer.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.120
Let's just roll.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.850
The beauty of not having demos
work is that you can always go

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.560
back to the slides.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.010
So the cool thing that I want
to show you guys is that we

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.820
actually have great indoor
navigation between levels.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.290
So if search for coffee, it's
going to bring up all these

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.120
different coffee shops.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.890
I select the Peet's Coffee.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.010
We can actually navigate you.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.550
So say I got dropped off on
the first floor where the

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.820
taxis drop me off.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.850
We can actually now navigate
you between levels.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.350
And so it's going to tell me to
walk over to the escalator,

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.670
to take the escalator up to the
second floor right here,

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.470
and then it navigates me
right to the Peet's,

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.460
which is pretty sweet.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.890
And we can do this in much more
complex venues than this.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.740
So we launched Indoor Maps in
2011 in the US and Japan.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.200
Since then, we've added 11
additional markets, including

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.780
three just in the last
three months.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.070
So most recently, we've launched
Spain, Singapore, as

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.360
well as Australia.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.930
As Waleed mentioned, we're
excited about adding more over

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.290
the next year.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.670
Within each of these countries,
we're really

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.910
focused on big, public, complex
venues where we can

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.470
help you guys navigate around.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.400
So take a minute and imagine
that you're here.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.870
This is Shinjuku Station
in Tokyo.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.920
It's the world's busiest
passenger train station.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.150
Maybe you want to find
your platform.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.660
So actually, I was here
a few years ago.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.740
I used to live in Japan,
I took this

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.650
actually on a Saturday.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.620
So this isn't even rush
hour at Shinjuku.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.740
I mean, Shinjuku gets crazy.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.040
What we can actually do, a big
focus for us has been on

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.170
really expanding the number of
transit stations that we

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.630
provide Indoor Maps on.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.290
This is actually giving you
platform-to-platform

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.070
directions.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.050
And so you can go from a point
outside of Shinjuku.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.910
We will direct you, navigate
you right to your platform,

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.920
and then even tell you what
platform you're getting off at

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.524
in Shibuya, which is where
I chose to navigate to.

00:19:39.524 --> 00:19:41.710
So in addition to transit
stations, we've had a big

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.160
focus on retail and malls.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.480
So this is the ION Mall
in Singapore.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.900
It's right off of Orchard
Road, for those

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.280
familiar with Singapore.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.960
This is the first floor, and
it shows all of the normal

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.630
shops and whatnot.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.170
But what's really cool about
this mall is that it goes four

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.510
floors underground.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.670
You can see that we've
mapped all of

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.910
these underground levels.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.530
For those that have been to
Singapore, you might know that

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.270
it's pretty hot, and there's
a pretty big mall culture.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.655
You don't really like to go
outside if you can avoid it to

00:20:06.655 --> 00:20:07.390
some extent.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.900
You can actually see within this
mall that you can cross

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.650
underground.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.330
And so instead of going out to
cross the street to go to the

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.600
mall next door, I can actually
just navigate in that little

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.880
bit to the top left.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.480
I can see that it goes
underneath the road.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.760
And then right above
it, that's actually

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.670
the mall next door.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.400
So I can navigate myself from
one mall to the next

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.020
underground using our &lt;&lt; maps.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.830
And then just to show the
breadth, this is the same

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.260
mall, the ION Mall
in Singapore.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.610
It's a multiuse venue.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.120
There are a bunch of apartment
buildings in the middle.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.800
But on the 55th floor, there's
a sky bar, and we've also

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.080
modeled that.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.250
We try to be very,
very complete

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.500
with what we're doing.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.590
Here's my favorite venue.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.330
So this is the Smithsonian
National Air and

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.560
Space Museum in DC.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.360
So the really cool thing about
this venue is that it's all

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.300
about the airplanes.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.400
So what you're going to see here
is that we've actually

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.900
gone in and drawn all of the
airplanes within this museum,

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.560
because that's where you're
going to navigate to.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.910
So say you're trying to find the
Spirit of St. Louis, which

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.760
I've called out on the
top right there.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.320
It's really easy for you to find
that on the second floor

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.645
using these maps.

00:21:08.645 --> 00:21:10.210
It's just kind of pretty, too.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.640
As Waleed mentioned today, we
also have really high-quality

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.440
indoor location.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.120
So this is looking at San
Francisco International

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.900
Airport again before
we had Indoor Maps.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.310
You can see how big
that error is.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.640
And then on the right-hand side
after we had Indoor Maps,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.870
how that error bar really
shrinks down, so you can

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.750
actually see where you are
within the terminal.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.450
Of course, all this is available
today on Android as

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.700
well as on desktop, just for a
single floor right now, and

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.140
then through the Google
Maps Android API v2.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.610
So hopefully at this point,
you guys are interested in

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.710
understanding a little bit more
about how this works.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.660
So now we want to run you guys
through exactly how we build

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.680
this stuff out.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.610
It's a two-part process.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.080
I'm going to start with maps,
and then Waleed's going to

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.170
talk a little bit
about location.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.420
Of course, step one is that we
actually need to create an

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.190
indoor map of venue.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.620
And to create an indoor
map of the venue, we

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.660
actually need to get maps.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.070
So there are two ways
that we do this.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.430
For the bigger venues, we'll
actually go out and directly

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.930
partner to actually get
their floor plans.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.610
We also have a tool, the Google
Maps Floor Plans tool,

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.670
where anyone can come and upload
a floor plan for their

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.400
venue for us to add
to our maps.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.050
So go to
maps.google.com/floorplans,

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.700
you click on Add a
Floor Plan Now.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.980
Search for your building within
the tool, drop the

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.115
marker on top.

00:22:34.115 --> 00:22:39.400
We're using Google Building
43 as our example here.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.230
You then give us a little bit
of additional detail about

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:46.000
your building as well as upload
the actual floor plan

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.410
for a particular level, and
you can upload one level.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.490
It would be great if you
uploaded every level for your

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.570
building to make things
really complete.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.290
And then once you've uploaded
the floor plan, we ask you to

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.380
align it to satellite imagery to
the building footprint that

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.160
is shown here.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.630
Once you do that, you simply hit
Accept and Submit, and our

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.930
team is going to go
and make sure that

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:09.890
it's a public venue--

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.540
we don't want to map
private venues--

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.030
as well as that the floor
plan is of high quality.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.900
We're then going to trace your
maps and actually push them

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.690
live on Google Maps.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.530
So what you're seeing here,
we're back at the Smithsonian

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.780
because it's so cool.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.190
But we're going to go in, and
we're going to trace the

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.180
outline of your building.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.290
We're going to trace and draw
all of the interesting

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.120
attributes within
your building.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.900
We're going to add things like
water fountains, and

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.280
bathrooms, and shops, and
whatever is interesting within

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.940
that indoor space, and publish
this live on our maps.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.860
And I highly recommend, if you
guys are interested in how we

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.650
actually build out maps, Waleed
already talked about

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.930
this for a second, but there's
a really awesome talk right

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.990
after this in Room Nine.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.345
And they will show you more
about how these tools work and

00:23:52.345 --> 00:23:58.346
exactly how we build out our
maps in Google Earth.

00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:00.460
WALEED KADOUS: Thank you
very much, Sarah.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.540
So there are always two
parts to this, right?

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.010
There's the maps and there's
the location.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.110
So let's dive into the
location side.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.580
So before I mentioned, and in
these coming slides, I'm going

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.750
to refer to what I call
high-quality indoor location

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.120
versus normal quality.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.050
Maybe the best way to start is
with a demonstration of that.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:21.210
So what I'm going to show you
now is, again, I didn't think

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.580
this level particularly.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.900
This is just the Bloomingdale's

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.700
immediately behind us.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.410
So let me just zoom out,
and what we have

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.180
here is normal quality.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.510
The yellow dot here, that's our
estimate based on normal

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.975
quality, and the green dot
is Ground Truth's.

00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:40.780
So Google sent someone out to
actually tell us where they

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.310
were walking, and this is
our estimate if we use

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.710
normal-quality location
indoors.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.050
And let's actually
see how it works.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.620
So it kind of follows at
the beginning, but it

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.320
jumps around a lot.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.800
And then as the user comes down
to the second half of the

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.940
building, it doesn't
really follow them.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.520
But if you actually do the math
on this, this is about

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.080
25-meter level accuracy.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.550
You can see it's not doing a
very good job of following the

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.980
user in the sense that if
someone is looking at a map,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.010
the user is there, he pulls out
his phone, and he's like,

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.680
where am on this map?

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.860
It's not very useful.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.280
It just seems to linger
near the entrance.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.640
Now let's actually look what
happens after we've applied

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.015
high-quality indoor location.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:29.720
Again, just to emphasize here,
yellow is our estimate based

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.210
on high-quality indoor
location, and

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.900
green is Ground Truth.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.590
And you'll see here now that it
still has its flaws, it's

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.630
not perfect.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.350
It seems to be out by about
6 or 7 meters here.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.850
But very quickly, you'll see it
does a pretty good job of

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.440
following the user around.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.390
And so if you were the user,
this would be much, much, much

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.910
more useful.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.580
If you were looking for fitting
rooms or something

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.550
like that, you could use
this a lot more easily.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.480
So the question then is, how
is it that we actually get

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.010
these high-quality indoor
location models?

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.940
And just to highlight this,
I think in the keynote you

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.460
remember Hugo Barra
talked about the

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.860
Fused Location Provider.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.330
These results are using that
Fused Location Provider that

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.000
mixes us all of the sensors
on the phone together.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.070
So what we actually have is we
have a tool called Google Maps

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.630
Floor Plan Markup.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.380
That's an app.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.255
You can just search for it on
the web, grab it, and download

00:26:24.255 --> 00:26:25.680
it, and install it.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.740
And let's say that you had
uploaded a floor plan, as

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.740
Sarah had outlined in the
previous stage, and it had

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.880
been approved.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.670
Then as a second, optional
step, you can do the

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.790
normal-quality location.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.390
It will still kind of work.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.730
But it won't give you a levels,
and it won't give you

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.946
that high accuracy.

00:26:42.946 --> 00:26:46.390
So what we do is you can then,
as an optional second step,

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.970
help the process by gathering
location.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.780
So this shows the floor plan
that you uploaded in this

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.180
particular case, yet another
one of Google's buildings.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.300
And then what happens is you
move this circle around until

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.630
it shows where you are.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.240
You hit this marker over here
down on the bottom, and then

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.830
that drops a point.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.760
And then what we ask you to do
is to walk through the level,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.610
basically marking where you've
been, and traverse the entire

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.340
level, leaving a snail
trail behind.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.940
And we use that information to
then build that high-quality

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.930
indoor location model.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.532
Now, a few things I want to
highlight about this.

00:27:24.532 --> 00:27:26.240
This is the self-service
model.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.660
For more complicated and not
quite as detailed and even

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.200
more detailed venues, actually,
Google has its own

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.060
team that it sends out
with a professional

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.790
version of this tool.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.580
But one thing I also wanted
to highlight is the

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.410
data that we collect.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.390
So we collect a variety of
sensors, but we do collect

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.250
Wi-Fi, especially the BSSID
and the RSSI, but we don't

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.510
collect SSIDs and we
don't collect data.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.870
And if you're interested in
actually reading the source

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.740
code that's at the heart of
the collection of this

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.500
algorithm, that's available.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.810
If you look on code.google.com
under Sensor Data Collection

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.180
Library, you should be
able to find it.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.640
So what happens is that you
basically go through your

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.340
venue, labeling where you are
against landmarks in the floor

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.240
plan, and then you
do this twice.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.800
And you upload these data
collections, the marker walks,

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.870
up to Google servers, and then
we basically chew on them for

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.760
a little while, and we process
them so that we can deliver

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.570
this high-quality model.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.700
Now, let's talk a little bit
about what we do next to

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.370
determine where the user is.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.390
So really what happens-- and I'm
going to walk you through

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.410
the process.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.580
We actually combine a lot of
different sensors to give you

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.510
that one estimate.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.830
We use the Wi-Fi.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.340
We use GPS.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.050
We use the sensors, so that's
the accelerometer, the

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.920
gyroscope on your phone, the
barometer as well potentially.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.370
But the truth of the matter,
when you come down to it, is

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:58.810
the one that we actually
dominate in a lot of these

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.440
calculations for absolute
position where you are within

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.940
the level is Wi-Fi.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.740
And Wi-Fi has a lot
of problems when

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.330
you use it for location.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.540
It really wasn't designed with
location in mind in any way.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.970
And it's very, very sensitive,
especially it's very sensitive

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:19.070
to bags of water that happen to
be moving around, getting

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.740
in the way between the
APs and the signal.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.300
And it just so happens that
humans are, more or less, bags

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.220
of water, at least as far
as Wi-Fi is concerned.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.540
So you can imagine that at
really crowded venues like

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.500
this one where Wi-Fi is already
a challenge and you

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.540
have lots of bodies, Wi-Fi
isn't going to

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.840
behave in the same way.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.690
And sometimes it can be
something really trivial, like

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.170
imagine that there's
big metal shutters.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.200
They have a huge impact on the
way that Wi-Fi is perceived.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.100
And the real issue is there's
this thing called RSSI, which

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.790
is the signal strength, and that
doesn't really give you a

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:56.660
good estimate of how far away
you are from the AP.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:01.100
And then the other problem is
every phone measures Wi-Fi in

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.470
a slightly different way.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.300
So you must be thinking, there
must be some other really good

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:11.790
reasons why Google chose to use
Wi-Fi for indoor location.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:12.680
Not really.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.820
There's only really one, and
that is that it's available

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.490
absolutely or pretty
much everywhere.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:21.740
So many indoor venues have Wi-Fi
coverage that we can

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.390
actually do this indoor stuff,
and that's really its only

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.000
redeeming feature, to
be honest with you.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.590
And so we thought that Indoor
is still compelling enough

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.830
that even though there are all
of these technical challenges

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.470
that we have to overcome and
it's not perfect, we still

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.530
think there's a lot of value,
and we can outperform GPS in

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.980
many situations.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.400
So I want to walk you through.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.820
Now that we've built these Wi-Fi
models, what does the

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.820
interaction between your phone
and Google servers look like?

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.150
And I want to emphasize that
this is, of course, anonymous.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.460
It's not user specific
in any way.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.610
And basically, what happens is
the first thing we check is,

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.800
do we have a high-quality
location model at this

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.340
particular venue?

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.270
If we do, we then determine if
you're indoors or outdoors.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.020
And if we determine that you're
indoors, then we send

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.310
what's called a Level
Selector.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.100
And the Level Selector--

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.455
say, we're here at Moscone..

00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:15.800
There would be three levels
that you could be on, one,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.490
two, or three, and it
would report, two.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.880
And I think actually, Sarah
might have something she wants

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.130
to show us.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.861
So let me just zoom that in.

00:31:27.861 --> 00:31:31.280
SARAH PETERSON: So we spent a
little bit of quality time at

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.306
Moscone yesterday to
try and build out

00:31:34.306 --> 00:31:35.240
some new indoor models.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.720
And what you will see here,
this is where we are right

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.275
now, and it's actually pretty
accurate, I'd say.

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.795
I don't know if you guys can see
that, but we're actually

00:31:44.795 --> 00:31:51.606
in a combination of rooms, 2010
and 2012, and it has them

00:31:51.606 --> 00:31:52.078
right there.

00:31:52.078 --> 00:31:55.990
So we're actually a little bit
flaky maybe, but this is what

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.540
we provide.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.920
And if you're using this
throughout Moscone, we will

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.540
note it is a little bit flaky.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.220
You may have noticed also that
the wireless here is

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.660
a little bit flaky.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.006
They are moving, actually, all
around, and so you're not

00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:09.900
going to get the ideal
indoor experience.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.072
But definitely this is what
we're looking to provide, and

00:32:13.072 --> 00:32:15.790
it works really, really well.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.080
WALEED KADOUS: You'll also
notice that there was a blue

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.540
dot there that showed
the level.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.510
So what will happen is when
you are at a venue and say

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.910
you're on the escalator, as you
go between floors, it will

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.620
automatically flip so that it's
always showing you what

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.080
current level that you're on.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.160
So what you're seeing there,
that blue dot on the 2, that's

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.210
the output of the
Level Selector.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.840
That's the thing that tells
you, am I on floor

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.950
one, two, or three?

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:44.040
So we send this little Level
Selector down to the phone,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.730
and once the Level Selector on
the phone determines what

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.400
level you're on, we have this
other little component, this

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.220
level model, that captures the
Wi-Fi patterns that we saw

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.080
when we conducted that walk
through the building.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.610
So now let's talk about the
other side of that, which is

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.120
what happens on the phone.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.710
So as I mentioned before, we
do a lot of what we call

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:04.520
sensor fusion.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.160
If GPS is available,
we'll mix it in.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.780
But even when you do get GPS
indoor, it's subject to

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.770
something called multipath
reflections because the GPS

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.190
signal bounces around a lot.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.900
So we have this stage called
sensor fusion that mixes the

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.970
accelerometer, the GPS, and
the Wi-Fi scan together.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.020
So now that you have the Level
Selector on your phone and the

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.000
level model on your phone, you
do a Wi-Fi scan, and we run

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.390
the Wi-Fi scan through the Level
Selector and that tells

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:33.400
you which level that
you're on.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.430
Once we've determined the level,
we then run the level

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.910
model for this level, so we
would have one level model for

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.800
each of the three different
floors of Moscone.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.180
And that feeds into it
as an input to the

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.720
Sensor Fusion algorithm.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.720
And that's what computes your
long and that's what appears

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.510
in Google Maps and soon through
the Fused Location

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.550
Provider that we mentioned
earlier.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:56.310
So as you can see from here,
most of the computation's done

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.350
on the phone for that extra bit
of nimbleness and speed

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.510
instead of having a round
trip to the server.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.500
And with that, I'd like to talk
a little bit about what

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.460
really excites us about the
future of Indoor Maps.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:14.520
So right now, you can actually
experiment with Indoor Maps on

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.560
Google Maps Android API v2.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.540
It shows the levels, it has the
Level Selector here, it

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.489
does the automatic floor
switching, and you can even

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.969
control the camera to get it to
look at the right things,

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.479
whatever it is that you're
interested in.

00:34:27.479 --> 00:34:31.330
In addition, we're making
available, as part of the

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.219
announcement that Fused Location
Provider, there's a

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.870
component that's going to be in
Google Play services called

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.320
the Location Client, and that
will provide you the

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.530
high-quality latitude
and longitude.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.139
We haven't surfaced the level
yet so we can't say you're on

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:43.889
Level Two of Moscone.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:47.590
We're still working on that,
but it's coming.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.830
So in the short term, this is
what we plan to work on.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.120
It's this question of, can
we do more indoor venues?

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.960
And we're going to keep growing
them, and people are

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.990
uploading them to our servers
all the time.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.370
It's really awesome.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.890
We want to improve the quality
of the indoor location, and

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.720
that's going to happen through a
lot of different mechanisms.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.600
One is technological, because
there are new technologies

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.410
coming along the way, like
Bluetooth Low Energy, and even

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.460
the humble Wi-Fi.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.090
Finally, they're going to start
adding something called

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.920
802.11B, which gives you time of
flight, which gives you an

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.280
estimate of the distance.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.230
So those new technologies that
come online, we're going to

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.150
mix them straight into that
sensor fusion process to give

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.830
you even higher-quality
location.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.040
Not only that, but we can do
amazing things like you can

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.110
match against the map.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.600
You can use the map to constrain
where people are to

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.830
get even higher accuracy.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.140
And the thing that we're really
interested in is more

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.330
improvements for API
developments.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.110
Now when it comes to the longer
term, this is what I'm

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.290
really excited about.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.730
So clearly, we talked about
Google Maps and navigation and

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.800
those types of capabilities.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.540
They're kind of awesome, but
there's something more.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.100
Now, if you remember back to
what Larry said this morning

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.450
at the keynote, he mentioned
that it's really important

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.570
that we make smarter
applications.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:09.080
And Amit talked about the
"Star Trek" computer.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.690
So I have a question for you.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.420
Would the "Star Trek" computer
be useful if it didn't have

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.270
floor plans of the Starship
Enterprise?

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:18.980
That's the question I want
you to think about.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.350
If you are building contractual
apps that are

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:25.170
meant to be smarter, that look
out for information for the

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.140
user like Google Now for those
of you who have used Google

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.950
Now, how can you make those
applications work if you're

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.790
not really aware of where
people spend so

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.470
much of their time?

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.960
And I wanted to kind of show
you guys through the

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.090
applications we've kind
of been toying with.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.880
This is not a launched
application.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.170
It's just a demo app.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.650
But what we did was
just for fun.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.590
We built what we call
Friends in a Mall.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.200
So we surveyed a big mall, and
then what we did is we just

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.700
had it so it would report
where people were.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.760
And when we went out there
testing this, the engineers

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.240
were giggling.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.670
We could imagine a lot of the
different applications people

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:01.830
could build.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.230
Imagine you and your spouse
going to the shopping mall,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.070
and he or she wants to buy
something, and you want to buy

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.300
something else, then
you can split up.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.310
Imagine the opportunities here
for serendipitous encounters

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.220
when friends that you trust
that you've shared your

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.380
location with can appear on
the map, and you can just

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.760
catch up with them because you
found them by coincidence.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.550
So this is one thing that
really made us feel that

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:28.180
indoor is kind of key to these
kind of contextual apps.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.170
And the fast refresh rate, it
was just a really, really

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.840
compelling experience.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.230
And the second thing was I want
to show you what we call

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.440
the invisible search term.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.630
So let's say we're now
at Home Depot.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.210
At Home Depot, imagine that
you're in the painting

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.990
department, and you search for
"painting." So do you expect

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.840
the Mona Lisa, or do you expect
to cover your wall with

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.730
icky yellow stuff?

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.300
If I'm in Home Depot, I know I
should be getting the second

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.030
search result.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.480
But let's say you're in the de
Young Museum, which is also a

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.860
venue that we have indoor floor
plans for, and you do

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.720
the same search, exactly
the same term.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.730
Don't you get exactly the
opposite search results?

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.360
So this is what we mean by using
indoor for contextual

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.610
applications, and this is what
I'm really excited to talk to

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.070
you about today.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.580
And this is why task-oriented
applications, the conventional

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.312
question answering, yes, indoors
is useful for that.

00:38:19.312 --> 00:38:21.600
But I want to see what you guys
as developers come up

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.170
with on this front.

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.390
So the key takeaways, before we
go on, is you know Google's

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.200
mission as well as we do--
organize the world's

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.610
information and make
it universally

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.670
accessible and useful.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.550
But how can you do that if you
don't know about the place

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.490
where people spend so
much of their time?

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.590
It's a very active field.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.270
We've launched three countries
in the last three months.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:42.970
There's so much else going on,
and we're even making more

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.070
APIs available to developers.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.750
And what I'm really excited to
talk to you about, what I

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.060
really think is the potential of
indoor, is these contextual

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.840
apps, and that's the question
I want to leave you with.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.880
What are you going to do?

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.600
How can you use indoor
information to make the apps

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.610
that you guys deliver and make
available to your users even

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.650
more awesome?

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.390
So thank you very much.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:03.240
A few quick pointers.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.810
There's a Ground Truth talk.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.640
I'm giving a talk about the
location side more tomorrow.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.150
There's the Maps API v2 talks
and the Floor Plans Tool for

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:14.400
uploading as well as the Google
Maps Floor Plan Marker.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.010
Thank you very much.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.280
We look forward to
your questions.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.702
[APPLAUSE]
