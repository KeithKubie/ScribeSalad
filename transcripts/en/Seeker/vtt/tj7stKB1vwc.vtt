00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.820
Step aside, oil pulling - there’s a new
trend in town, and it’s… buttered coffee?

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.580
Sounds... rich.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:17.090
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and every
week, it seems there’s a hot new trend we

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.750
should all be getting on board with.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.090
Earlier this month, I came across an interesting
article on something called buttered coffee.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.699
It’s exactly what it sounds like, and while
the idea of adding butter to your coffee might

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.929
sound a little too Paula Deen for some, a
lot of people out there swear by it.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.850
Even doctors are touting its benefits, so
what’s the deal?

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.130
What is buttered coffee, and why is it good
for you?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.489
Well, here’s the official recipe.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.920
You take 1 cup of black coffee, add 1-2 tbsp
of unsalted grass-fed butter, and 1-2 tbsp

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.380
of MCT oil.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.640
Blend until frothy.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.120
MCT stands for medium-chain triglycerides,
and it’s basically a processed mixture of

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.719
fats that naturally occur in coconut and palm
kernel oils.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.760
MCT oil is more rapidly digested and metabolized
than other types of fats, so a lot of studies

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.810
have touted it as a weight loss supplement
- it increases your body’s ability to burn

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.960
energy, while decreasing its fat storage.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.240
It’s a key component of buttered coffee,
but the people who swear by it, also say that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.490
the kind of butter you use, is equally as
important.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.979
It MUST be unsalted, and it must be grass-fed
- just organic is not enough.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.159
Same goes for the coffee - ideally, it should
be organic, single-origin beans.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.329
Obviously, this can get pretty expensive - but
is it worth it?

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.340
Well, to a lot of people, it is.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.159
In addition to curbing hunger and potentially
aiding in weight loss, people also say it

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.009
helps with energy and focus, gives greater
mental clarity, and sustains your coffee buzz

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.340
for longer - up to 6 hours - while eliminating
the post-caffeine crash.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.590
It also curbs the jittery side effects and
the acid-stomach feeling you get from drinking

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.590
straight coffee.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.409
And since it’s technically served frothed,
a lot of people say it just tastes like a

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.210
fattier latte - which doesn’t actually sound
all that bad.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.649
Now depending on how much butter and MCT oil
you use, a single cup of this stuff contains

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.130
anywhere from 200-500 calories, and 45-65
grams of fat - which is 100% of your daily

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.409
recommended intake of saturated fat.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.060
So how can something that bad, be good for
you?

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.690
This is where it gets tricky.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.530
If you were to add buttered coffee to your
daily routine, you would theoretically gain

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.000
anywhere from 20-30 lbs per year.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.210
So it’s generally recommended that you use
it as a meal replacement, and not a supplement.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.160
Assuming you agree that good fats are something
your body needs, then that’s fine.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.110
But even people who believe that saturated
fats get “unfairly demonized” say they

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.190
should be eaten WITH a meal, not AS the meal.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.860
There are also people out there who say that
even if buttered coffee’s not that bad for

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.580
you, a traditional breakfast is still way
more nutritious.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.720
And depending on what you’re eating, that
could be entirely true.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.590
Consuming that much butter, can lead to high
cholesterol - and especially so, if you’re

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.920
not adjusting other aspects of your diet to
accommodate.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.660
Still, I’m a little surprised by how few
doctors seem to warn against it altogether.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.370
Most nutritionists say if you wanna try it
out, go right ahead.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.980
But you should probably get your cholesterol
checked first, to make sure it’s normal.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.750
Personally, I was a little grossed out by
the whole idea of this at first, but I’ll

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.150
admit - after reading up on it, it does intrigue
me.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.090
So I thought we could do a little experiment.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.310
If this episode gets 5,000 likes - then I
will try buttered coffee for a whole week,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.430
and we’ll upload a follow-up video of my
experience, good or bad.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.430
Deal?

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.430
Deal.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.690
I’m sure some of you out there have tried
it as well, and if you have - we’d love

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.130
to know what you think!

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.310
Just let us know in the comments, and as always
- thank you guys for watching!
