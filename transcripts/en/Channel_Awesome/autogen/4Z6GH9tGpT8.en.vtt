without seeing those films I think you

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:48.980
without seeing those films I think you
 

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.270
without seeing those films I think you
would I wouldn't recommend it really

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:52.280

you have to know the movie you have to

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:55.100
you have to know the movie you have to
 

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.010
you have to know the movie you have to
know at least some of the big characters

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.560
and and that's the thing like I think if
you don't know these characters you

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:02.570
you don't know these characters you
 

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.510

would watch this movie like and I think
there's a couple critics who have and we

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:06.890
there's a couple critics who have and we
 

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.740
there's a couple critics who have and we
may know them even but who are just like

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:08.750
may know them even but who are just like
 

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.570

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040
sense and it's just like but yeah if
 

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.400
sense and it's just like but yeah if
you've seen the previous tenant like

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:18.410
you've seen the previous tenant like
 

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.720
you've seen the previous tenant like
watching return the King without seeing

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:19.730
watching return the King without seeing
 

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.640
watching return the King without seeing
the other crew two films I like it's not

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:21.650
the other crew two films I like it's not
 

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.170
the other crew two films I like it's not
gonna have the same impact or making

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.180
gonna have the same impact or making
 

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.780
gonna have the same impact or making
money if you didn't follow it and I also

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:25.790
money if you didn't follow it and I also
 

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.340
money if you didn't follow it and I also
know that in a role and that's the

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.350
know that in a role and that's the
 

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.410
know that in a role and that's the
difference I think with the WB films is

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:29.420
difference I think with the WB films is
 

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.100
difference I think with the WB films is
that they didn't do that they like two

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.110
that they didn't do that they like two
 

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.230
that they didn't do that they like two
films they beta rial before they got to

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240
films they beta rial before they got to
 

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.520
films they beta rial before they got to
there and then they got to Justice

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:36.530
there and then they got to Justice
 

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.730

assembled pushed out I mean there were
 

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.290
assembled pushed out I mean there were
other problems too obviously with the

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:44.300
other problems too obviously with the
 

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.550
other problems too obviously with the
director having to leave and then they

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560
director having to leave and then they
 

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.770
director having to leave and then they
brought in Jess weed but it it just

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:47.780
brought in Jess weed but it it just
 

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.180
brought in Jess weed but it it just

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.190
never worked because you didn't have
 

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.760
never worked because you didn't have
that firmly established connection you

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:51.770
that firmly established connection you
 

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.500
that firmly established connection you
did maybe with Wonder Woman that's one

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:53.510
did maybe with Wonder Woman that's one
 

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.740

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.800
these other ones that you have in there
and it's just like that's what Marvel

00:11:59.800 --> 00:11:59.810
and it's just like that's what Marvel
 

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:00.940
and it's just like that's what Marvel
did and that's what makes it so

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:00.950
did and that's what makes it so
 

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.200
did and that's what makes it so
brilliant the high I don't know really

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.210
brilliant the high I don't know really
 

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.240
brilliant the high I don't know really
if we're ever gonna even see that again

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:07.250
if we're ever gonna even see that again
 

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.460
if we're ever gonna even see that again
like because it's just such a huge

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.470
like because it's just such a huge
 

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.340
like because it's just such a huge
investment for ten years yeah well I

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.350
investment for ten years yeah well I
 

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.990
investment for ten years yeah well I
mean obviously we see other Studios

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000
mean obviously we see other Studios
 

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.420
mean obviously we see other Studios
trying to do it but I mean the closest

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:16.430
trying to do it but I mean the closest
 

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.060
trying to do it but I mean the closest
we've done is probably DC which is not

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.070
we've done is probably DC which is not
 

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.820
we've done is probably DC which is not
doing it that well and yeah you're right

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:21.830
doing it that well and yeah you're right
 

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.130
doing it that well and yeah you're right
this is probably the only one to pull it

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.140
this is probably the only one to pull it
 

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.610
this is probably the only one to pull it
off and it is still mind-blowing how

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:27.620
off and it is still mind-blowing how
 

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.050
off and it is still mind-blowing how
well they're pulling this off even

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.060
well they're pulling this off even
 

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.340
well they're pulling this off even
though not every movie is great or

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.350
though not every movie is great or
 

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.079

their checklist is just incredible like

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:35.270
their checklist is just incredible like
 

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.640
their checklist is just incredible like
unprecedent you've never seen a

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:36.650
unprecedent you've never seen a
 

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.470
unprecedent you've never seen a
checklist of so many good movies they

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480
checklist of so many good movies they
 

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.180
checklist of so many good movies they
have been connected and all add up to

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.190
have been connected and all add up to
 

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.280
have been connected and all add up to
something and it kind of gets bigger and

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:42.290
something and it kind of gets bigger and
 

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.340
something and it kind of gets bigger and
bigger and it's just it's amazing how

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.350
bigger and it's just it's amazing how
 

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.620

they're doing this and I feel like it
 

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.480
they're doing this and I feel like it
builds up to something really good you

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.490
builds up to something really good you
 

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.010
builds up to something really good you
know again this is only a part one so

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.020
know again this is only a part one so
 

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.480
know again this is only a part one so
we'll see how part two does as well but

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:52.490
we'll see how part two does as well but
 

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.090
we'll see how part two does as well but
for a part one I really enjoyed it

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.100
for a part one I really enjoyed it
 

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.280
for a part one I really enjoyed it
um but I think I think that's an

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.290
um but I think I think that's an
 

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.829
um but I think I think that's an
important point because I know that some

00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839
important point because I know that some
 

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:01.240
important point because I know that some
people we've talked to or where we just

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.250
people we've talked to or where we just
 

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.560
people we've talked to or where we just
look at just combined me of Justice

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:02.570

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:05.500
other I didn't follow the plot and then
 

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.100
other I didn't follow the plot and then
but I'm like no that was heavier look

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.110
but I'm like no that was heavier look
 

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.200
but I'm like no that was heavier look
that's the thing that that is the

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.210
that's the thing that that is the
 

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.360
that's the thing that that is the
difference you know that marble

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:12.370
difference you know that marble
 

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.820
difference you know that marble
basically spent their time building up

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:14.830
basically spent their time building up
 

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.650

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.860
once again it's just a shame because I
think a lot of DC characters are grave

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:25.870
think a lot of DC characters are grave
 

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.020
think a lot of DC characters are grave
and I think basically the studio over

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.030
and I think basically the studio over
 

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.530
and I think basically the studio over
