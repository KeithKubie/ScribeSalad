00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:11.110
You have about 20,000 genes in your DNA.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.950
They encode the molecules that
make up your body,

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.990
from the keratin in your toenails,
to the collagen at the tip of your nose,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.287
to the dopamine surging around
inside your brain.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.678
Other species have genes of their own.

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:26.094
A spider has genes for spider silk.

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:30.808
An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,
which turns sunlight into wood.

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:33.332
So where did all those genes come from?

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:35.225
It depends on the gene.

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:40.254
Scientists suspect that life
started on Earth about 4 billion years ago.

00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:42.741
The early life forms were
primitive microbes

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:47.380
with a basic set of genes for
the basic tasks required to stay alive.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.175
They passed down those basic genes
to their offspring

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.321
through billions of generations.

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.955
Some of them still do the same jobs
in our cells today, like copying DNA.

00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:01.942
But none of those microbes had genes
for spider silk or dopamine.

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:06.689
There are a lot more genes on Earth today
than there were back then.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.468
It turns out that a lot of those
extra genes were born from mistakes.

00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:15.605
Each time a cell divides,
it makes new copies of its DNA.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:20.167
Sometimes it accidentally copies
the same stretch of DNA twice.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:24.592
In the process, it may make an extra copy
of one of its genes.

00:01:24.592 --> 00:01:27.818
At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one.

00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:32.054
But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations.

00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:35.394
Those mutations may change how
the new gene works,

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.144
and that new gene may duplicate again.

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:41.947
A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently;

00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:45.035
many in just the past few million years.

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:50.055
The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:54.148
While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise

00:01:54.148 --> 00:01:55.905
to a whole family of genes,

00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:58.872
scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve,

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:01.695
they can quickly take on
essential functions.

00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:06.405
For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.647
that grab odor molecules.

00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:11.298
The mutations let them grab
different molecules,

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:14.951
giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells.

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:19.383
Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes.

00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:22.913
They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ,

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:25.446
or at a different time of life,

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:29.175
or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether.

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:33.640
In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.243
Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated.

00:02:38.243 --> 00:02:40.957
That mutation changed
the signal in the gene

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:43.199
about where it should make its protein.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.800
Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.569
it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.048
So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound.

00:02:55.048 --> 00:02:57.949
And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect,

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.060
and helped the snake catch more prey,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.922
it became favored.

00:03:01.922 --> 00:03:05.733
So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth

00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:07.779
that kills the snake's prey.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.990
And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.883
The DNA of animals and plants
and other species

00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:18.197
contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:22.053
As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences

00:03:22.053 --> 00:03:24.676
of genetic gibberish that serve
no function.

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:28.704
These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do.

00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:31.821
Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:34.307
where a cell can start reading it.

00:03:34.307 --> 00:03:36.977
Suddenly the cell is making a new protein.

00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:40.515
At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful,

00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:43.913
but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein.

00:03:43.913 --> 00:03:45.999
The protein may start
doing something useful,

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.616
something that makes an organism
healthier, stronger,

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:50.941
better able to reproduce.

00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:55.233
Scientists have found these new genes
at work in many parts of animal bodies.

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:58.643
So our 20,000 genes have many origins,

00:03:58.643 --> 00:04:03.577
from the origin of life, to new genes
still coming into existence from scratch.

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:07.196
As long as life is here on Earth,
it will be making new genes.
