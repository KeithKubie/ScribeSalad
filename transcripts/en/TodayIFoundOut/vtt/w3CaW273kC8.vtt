00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.670
At first thought the idea of a human being
hit by some kind of large explosive that not

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.530
only doesn’t detonate and kill the person,
but then somehow becomes lodged inside their

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.260
body necessitating its removal via surgery
seems like the invention of some hack Hollywood

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.890
writer somewhere.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.590
However, while rare, the scenario is something
that has happened a surprising number of times.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.950
Now, as you may have already guessed, cases
of unexploded ordnance becoming lodged inside

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.539
of human beings are limited almost exclusively
to military personnel.

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:24.470
In fact, according to a 1999 study of 36 instances
of this exact trauma, it is described as a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.130
uniquely “military injury” with it being
additionally noted that there were – at

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.271
the time the paper was written – no known
cases of something similar occurring in reviewed

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:35.271
civilian literature.

00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:40.500
This said, during our own research, we did
find a handful of cases of non-military personnel

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.450
sustaining an injury that resulted in an explosive
becoming lodged inside their body.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.800
Going back to the military though, by far
the most common weapon to cause such an injury

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.920
is the M79 grenade-launcher, which according
to the aforementioned study was responsible

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.910
for 18 of the 36 injuries discussed therein.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.050
Further, according to the fittingly titled
paper “Stratification of risk to the surgical

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.429
team in removal of small arms ammunition implanted
in the craniofacial region”, small munitions

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.349
such as certain types of armor piercing and
tracer rounds can occasionally ricochet and

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.569
become lodged inside a person without the
explosive innards going off.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.170
Even in a case such as this, removal of the
round is of paramount importance and the surgery

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.260
team is noted as being in extreme peril in
doing it.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.420
(And, note here, contrary to popular belief
and Hollywood depictions, in most cases it’s

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.510
safer to leave regular bullets and the like
in the body than try to get them out.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.840
Of course, if the thing inside the body is
explosive, that’s a whole different matter.)

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.690
Going back to grenades and the like, amazingly,
while you’d think something like having

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.520
a large live explosive lodged somewhere in
your body would be a surefire recipe for an

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.700
untimely and rather messy death, fatalities
from this particular kind of injury are surprisingly

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700
rare.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.810
For example, according to the first study
quoted in this piece, of the 36 known cases

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.350
from WW2 to the modern day, there were only
4 fatalities (about 11%).

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.280
Even more important here is that all 4 died
before surgery could even be attempted owing

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.980
to the injuries being especially severe, with
half being hit in the face and the other two

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.260
being struck by rocket launchers.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.262
Which any way you slice it is not the kind
of injury you’d expect a person to be able

00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:37.849
to walk off, whether the explosive went off
or not.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.890
Nevertheless, stories of soldiers surviving
even these kind of injuries exist.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.160
For example, consider the case of one Pvt
Channing Moss who was hit by a “baseball

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.459
bat-sized” rocket propelled grenade that
buried itself in his abdomen almost completely

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.110
through from one side to the other, with part
of the device still sticking out.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.030
He survived.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.400
Then you have the story of Jose Luna, a Colombian
soldier who was accidentally shot in the face

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.209
by a grenade launcher and was up and walking
around after several rounds of surgery to

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.500
remove it and repair the damage as best as
possible.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.180
Perhaps the most impressive thing about the
literature we consulted is that in every case

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.209
where a patient with unexploded munitions
inside their body was able to make it to surgery,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.629
the surgical team were able to remove the
explosive without it exploding and they further

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:26.680
went on to survive.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.380
In fact, according to the aforementioned study
covering the 36 known cases, there wasn’t

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.550
a single one where the explosive in question
detonated “during transportation, preparation,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.550
or removal”.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.750
A fact that almost certainly influences this
statistic is that Explosive Ordnance Disposal

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.990
experts are often on hand to offer advice
before and during surgery.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.960
On top of this, from the moment a foreign
object inside of a person’s body is identified

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.190
as an explosive, multiple steps are taken
to reduce the likelihood of it detonating.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.240
These measures include things like keeping
the patient as still as possible and limiting

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.129
the use of electronic or heating devices during
surgery.

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.759
In addition, to protect the surgical team
and others should the worst happen, the surgery

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.680
to remove an explosive is usually (if time
and circumstances allow it) conducted away

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.639
from people in an area designed to absorb
the damage from the explosion.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.240
Surgeons are often also given protective equipment,
though some choose to forgo this as it can

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.909
impede their fine motor skills, which particularly
need to be on form when removing undetonated

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.770
explosives and operating on individuals who
are severely wounded to boot.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.810
We can only assume these surgeons are already
heavily encumbered by the size and density

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.409
of the balls or ovaries they presumably have
given their willingness to operate on a patient

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.509
who might explode at any second.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.900
On a related note, official US Army policy
states that any soldier suspected of having

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.889
unexploded ordnance in their body are not
supposed to be transported for medical treatment,

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.080
as the risk of the ordinance exploding and
killing other soldiers is considered too great.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.839
However, this rule is seemingly universally
ignored in the rare event such a scenario

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:08.839
occurs.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.539
As one Staff Sgt Dan Brown so eloquently put
it when discussing the aforementioned case

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.979
of Pvt Channing Moss who had an explosive
in him powerful enough to kill anything within

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.840
30 feet of him, “He was American, he was
a solider, he was a brother and he was one

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840
of us.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.850
And there was nothing gonna stop us from doing
what we knew we had to do…”

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.790
Thus, the soldiers involved carefully bandaged
his giant wound and chose not to inform their

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.159
superiors of his exact condition in case they’d
order them to follow the aforementioned rule.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.969
Instead, they just reported he had a severe
shrapnel injury.

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.750
The soldiers then carried him to an extraction
point while under heavy fire for part of the

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.750
time.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.399
The crew that then airlifted the soldiers
were made aware of the situation and likewise

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:54.330
agreed they weren’t going to leave Channing
behind as the rules stated should be done,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.369
even though it would have meant all their
deaths if the device had exploded mid-flight.

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:03.360
Once back at base, there was no time to setup
an isolated medical station to get Channing

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.919
away from the rest of the wounded, as he was
in critical condition as it was.

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.599
So they just operated right away, including
at one point having to deal with the fact

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:15.591
that his heart stopped mid-surgery and they
were limited on their options to get it going

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:18.680
again given the explosive embedded in his
body.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.059
In the end, it all worked out and Channing
got to go home to his six month pregnant wife

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:27.419
and eventually met his daughter, Yuliana,
when she was born a few months later.

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.669
In any event, as discussed at the start of
this piece, there are also rare cases of civilians

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:37.319
accidentally getting explosive devices stuck
inside their bodies, though in all cases much

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:39.830
less heroic than the military based events.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.349
For example, consider the case of a 44 year
old Texas man who had an unexploded large

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:49.479
firework mortar lodge itself inside his right
leg after he approached the tube containing

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:54.050
the firework, thinking it was a dud, only
to have it violently shoot off and embed itself

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.099
in said appendage.

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:58.860
Luckily for him, it did not then explode as
it was designed to do.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.580
The good news was that all went well from
there on, with the main precautions taken

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.389
simply not using any electrical or heat applying
device during the removal stage of the surgery.

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:11.999
So yes, to answer the question posed at the
start of this article, someone having an explosive

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:16.399
device surgically removed from their body
is not just a Hollywood invention, but does

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:18.520
occasionally happen in real life.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.759
Although we couldn’t find any known incidences
of megalomaniacal crime lords embedding explosive

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:27.449
devices in their underlings to ensure loyalty
and obedience.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:30.219
So that one’s on Hollywood I guess.

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:34.430
Further, while the occasional terrorist will
shove some explosive in one of their orifices,

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.710
to date these have generally been pretty ineffective,
even in one case where the device, stuck up

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.339
the suicide bomber’s rectum, went off when
the bomber was standing right next to the

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:45.540
intended target- Saudi Prince Muhammad bin
Nayef.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.570
Nayef sustained only minor injuries while
the suicide bomber had his midsection blown

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.630
to pieces.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.160
Naturally, he didn’t survive.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.540
It should also be noted that the often depicted
scenario of surgically implanting explosives

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.100
in such cases, at least thus far, hasn’t
really been a thing according to the various

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.209
counter terrorism agencies out there who’ve
mentioned it as a possibility.

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:11.810
This is despite many a media report implying
such does happen.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.960
In the end, as a Terrorism Research Center
report noted, the procedure involved in surgically

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.260
embedding in a human body an explosive large
enough to do real damage is extremely complex,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.270
requiring extensive medical support and expertise
with high risk to the patient surviving the

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.470
procedure and being then fit enough to execute
the mission.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.770
They also note that even then it takes too
much time to be worth it when considering

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.840
planning and recuperation time after.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.630
Thus, at least to date, terrorist organizations
have stuck with more conventional methods

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.630
of suicide bombing.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.160
For these reasons, while security experts
are attempting to plan for this possibility,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.980
to date it’s noted not to be “on the radar”
yet.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.010
That said, one case of a device embedded in
humans that sometimes explodes and causes

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.890
damage is the case of pacemakers.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.880
It turns out that, while rare, these sometimes
explode during cremation of a body that has

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880
one.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.090
While usually the damage is minimal, in 3%
of the cases looked at in the paper Pacemaker

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.390
Explosions in Crematoria: Problems and Possible
Solutions, published in the Journal of the

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.700
Royal Society of Medicine, the cremator oven
structure was destroyed beyond repair by the

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.560
explosion, including in one case also causing
injury to a worker.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.240
However, it would appear this is still a pretty
rare event, and in most cases the worst that

00:10:25.240 --> 00:14:00.540
happens is a loud bang startling crematoria
employees.
