00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Today, we're going
to see what happens

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.314
if we take a vacuum storage bag,

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:04.600
and hook it up to a pump

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.300
that has way more power
than a vacuum.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:16.160
[Music]

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.700
Guys, I don't know

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.600
if you've ever seen these vacuum
storage bags before.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.400
I've seen commercials for them,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.900
and them in stores
quite a bit.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.400
I've never actually
used one before,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.585
but I had a thought.

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:27.600
I wanted to see just
how they work,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.200
and if we can sort of up
the ante a little bit.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.600
I should point out,
this is not a sponsored video.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.800
I have no allegiance
to this Magic Bag brand.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.199
There's lots of
brands out there.

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.100
They all work pretty
much the same way.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.000
These are just the ones
that I bought at Walmart,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.300
because I wanted
to try this out.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.165
Most of the time,

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:45.100
these bags work
with a household vacuum

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.009
or a shop vacuum.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:47.800
You put fluffy
compressible things,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.608
like clothing or
blankets into them.

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:50.900
It's got a one-way valve.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.200
Well, it occurred to me
that we have some pretty

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.789
powerful tools around the shop.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.200
Something that can pull
a lot more air than just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.300
a regular shop vacuum.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.000
We've got vacuum pumps.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.157
We've got a couple of them.

00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:02.017
This one right here,

00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:03.708
this is our Harvest
Right vacuum pump.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:05.400
This thing is quite
powerful, I think,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.378
and I wanted to see

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:08.500
if there's a difference
between just using

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.660
our regular shop vacuum
to pull air out,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.100
and using our vacuum pump.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.849
And then, I've got
a few ideas for things

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:15.700
that we want to try
putting these bags

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.300
that aren't exactly what
the manufacturer recommends.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.000
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.903
These storage bags are usually
used with a household vacuum

00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:25.360
to make your bedding
and clothing smaller.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.700
Well, we're going
to try attaching it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.381
to our vacuum pump to see just

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.400
how much air we
can pull out of them.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.780
To start off though,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.540
we've got these
ingredients over here.

00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:34.900
You may recognize these

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.377
as the ingredients
used for proto putty.

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:39.600
Proto putty is
a mixture of silicon,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.100
water-based activator,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520
and some corn starch to make
it easier to manipulate.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.000
If you haven't seen this before,
we've used this several times.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.900
We've got whole videos
on how to make it.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.900
It just becomes
a sculptable rubber

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.971
that cures, and then,

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.527
it's just solid but slightly
squishy rubber forever,

00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:54.987
and I want to try using some

00:01:54.987 --> 00:01:57.200
of that to make a seal
for our vacuum pump.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.134
This already pulls pretty well
if I just put it on my hand,

00:02:00.134 --> 00:02:01.400
or this valve right here,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.300
but I want to make sure it
really gets a tight seal to suck

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.100
out every last bit of air
that we can get.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.900
So let's start mixing
up some proto putty.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.140
[Music]

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400
Now, I've got food coloring,
and this serves two purposes.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400
One, it adds a little bit
of color to it,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.200
which is always nice.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.366
But very importantly,

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.200
this food coloring
is water-based,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.000
and the silicone
is activated by the water.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.900
The water is
a very necessary step.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.915
In fact, you could use plain
water with no food coloring,

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:29.500
and you'd get just sort
of a translucent or clear

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
or white proto putty.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.500
But we like to use the color

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100
because we can see
how much we're putting in,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.300
and it's easy to control
and it's single drops.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.586
Now, if I just stir this
up and let it sit for a while,

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.500
this will cure.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.260
This will turn
into a proto putty.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320
But it's immensely sticky.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.100
This right now will stick
to pretty much everything.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.195
It's really hard
to work in shape.

00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:54.100
So, what we use is cornstarch.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.500
You can use other things too.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.340
If you wanted to use
like talcum powder, baby powder,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.900
which I think is
mostly talcum powder,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.315
you can do that as well.

00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:03.700
But we use corn starch
because it's cheap,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.400
and it's, you know, it's edible.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.260
So it's pretty safe
to have around.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.100
Just going to pour a bunch
of that in there.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.200
This will mix in.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.800
It will make it
a little bit more opaque.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100
But it also make it much
much easier to handle,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.400
and makes it less sticky,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.608
and so, you have
a chance to shape it.

00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:19.370
Even with the cornstarch though,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.900
it sometimes is helpful to just
give it a little bit of time.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.000
It takes some time,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.199
a couple of minutes to really
start curing with that water

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.200
mixed in, and so,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.200
if it's too sticky, sometimes,
the answer is more cornstarch.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.700
But if you've just been mixing
it for only a minute,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.482
and then the answer might just
be a wait a little bit.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.900
And I should also warn you,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.100
mixing this stuff up puts off
a very strong acetic acid smell.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.000
It's going to
smell like vinegar,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.400
way more concentrated

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.200
than an actual bottle of vinegar
from the grocery store.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.400
It's pretty strong.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.300
So, good ventilation
is a good idea.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.460
[Music]

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.300
While it's coated in cornstarch,
it's not going to be sticky.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.272
Once all the corn starch
gets mixed in,

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.400
it will start sticking
to my gloves again.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.500
There it is.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.580
Just goes everywhere.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.660
You know what?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.400
I already have a vacuum
right next to me.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.100
So that's all right.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.881
This doesn't actually
leak much air.

00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.820
Once it presses down, this--

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.700
So this brass collar
actually moves up and down,

00:04:13.702 --> 00:04:16.300
and once it's pressed down,
it doesn't leak anymore.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.400
It forms a tight seal.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.200
But because we're not screwing

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.200
this onto a flange or a valve
or anything like that,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.148
it does have a little
more flexibility.

00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:26.200
So we're just going
to throw this on just

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.600
to make sure we've got
a nice tight seal on it.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.800
Okay, we've got a couple
of decently large blankets

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.200
and a very large bag.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.700
I'm not sure

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.450
if I'm gonna be able to fit
both of these in here,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.200
but I'm going to try.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.149
And we're going to see
how flat they squish.

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:39.600
Just using the regular vacuum

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.920
before we move on
to using the vacuum pump.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.420
[Music]

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.580
I am probably
exceeding the recommended

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.360
total amount being put
into this bag right now.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:05:00.220
[Music]

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.900
All right.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.440
Now, let's see if I can
seal this off properly.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.500
This isn't a zipper

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.564
that opens one way
and closes the other.

00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:10.000
It is just a little tool
to help you close down

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.028
the to zip points.

00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:12.400
All right, here it goes.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.800
All right.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.500
I think that has stopped moving.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.800
That's pretty dense.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.100
I'm going to be
interested to see

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.700
how much more this can pull out,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.500
because that seems like
it's pulled out quite a bit.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.300
It is definitely
flattered and skinnier,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.300
and it may add some unintended
wrinkles into things,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.400
but it's for storage.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400
Not bad.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.400
We've got our suction cup.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.300
Should just fit nicely on there.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.900
Make a nice tight seal.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.800
Turn this on.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.780
Certainly, suctioning
well to my hand.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.600
Probably just gave myself a
hickey in the middle of my palm.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.000
Oh, that is still
getting a lot flatter.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.100
That is pulling
out a lot more air.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.060
So I'm gonna say, yeah.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.820
We've got a lot

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.900
more suction power that than
with our regular vacuum cleaner.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.900
Oh my gosh.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.900
I just want to let
more air back in,

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.855
and watch it go.

00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:23.691
I'm going to try
and just break the seal here,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.960
open the zipper,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.000
and just have all
that are rush in all at once.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.100
Here it goes.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.200
That's fun to watch.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.200
So, we know

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.557
that the vacuum pump pulls a lot
harder than our vacuum cleaner,

00:06:37.557 --> 00:06:40.600
and we've seen what it can do
to a pair of blankets.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.329
It shrinks them down,
it's basically a board.

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:44.304
But we're not just going
to do this with blankets.

00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:46.500
We've got some other things
we want to try this with.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.300
Let's see.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.600
I think first off,
I have a couple marshmallows.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.265
I like these ones.

00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:51.920
You can eat them like an apple.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:07:07.000
[Music]

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.500
Marshmallows make a really

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.400
tight seal once they
smush themselves together.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.900
So it's not really able
to pull more after that.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.900
Although, I don't think
there's much air in there,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.000
except inside the confines
of the marshmallows themselves.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.840
It's kind of just making
a interesting texture there too.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.514
We've seen those
gel like pillows.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.200
I'm just gonna give this
a quick little test.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.540
That's not bad.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.480
It's pretty good.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.400
It's also really nice
for good late-night snack.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.600
You just like, oh man,
I could go for a marshmallow.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.200
Next up, we've got about
two gallons of orbeez here,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.413
and we're gonna see

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.900
what happens if we try
and vacuum these.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.820
This will be interesting.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:08:04.040
[Music]

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.600
That pulled in
water pretty quick,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.700
and then it started
pulling in orbeez.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.100
We managed to pull
in some orbeez sludge

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.300
into our hose here.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.497
Don't think they got so far

00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:14.197
as to actually get
into the vacuum.

00:08:14.197 --> 00:08:15.600
So that didn't last very long,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.100
but we do have one more thing
we're going to try with that.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.700
We're going to use the shop vac.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.900
It's a wet dry shop vac,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.584
so that gets a little bit
of water in it,

00:08:22.584 --> 00:08:24.100
it's not going to
cause any problems.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.843
It's not going to pull as hard.

00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:26.650
But at least,

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.700
it's not going
to get orbeez stuck

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.189
inside our nice
expensive vacuum pump.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:32.400
So let's try this.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.480
Orbeez?

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.100
Full of water,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.220
large and non-compressible.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.150
Marshmallows, full of air.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.500
Unfortunately, non-porous.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.989
But we do have one more thing

00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:57.300
that we want to try
that's mostly full of air,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.058
and I think is fairly porous.

00:08:59.058 --> 00:09:01.000
It should smash
down quite a bit.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.900
We're gonna use one
of our big bags again.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.200
This time we're going to start
with the vacuum cleaner again,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.080
our shop vac,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.332
just because there's
a good chance

00:09:08.332 --> 00:09:10.682
that some of this popcorn
could get crumbled up,

00:09:10.682 --> 00:09:12.217
or the air flow going
out could pull lots

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:13.100
of little bits into it,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.289
and that's fine
with the shop vac.

00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:15.085
Again, we don't want

00:09:15.085 --> 00:09:16.400
that to happen
to the vacuum pump,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.576
but I'm hoping that
after it compresses down,

00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:20.400
there will be less of that dust,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.000
and we can move on
to using that.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.800
But let's see

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.300
how squished it gets was
just our shop vacuum.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.500
This is already
quite entertaining.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.600
There's there's no flexibility
to this at this point.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.000
All-- The air has been pulled
out enough that like,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.300
even though this is just single
popped kernels of popcorn.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.700
Like there's no bending.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.600
They're just pressed
together so tight.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.300
Listen to that.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.740
That's the sound of popcorn.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.200
All right, let's try
and kick this up a notch,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.059
and see what's going to happen.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.600
Hopefully, we don't end
up pulling a lot

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.400
of popcorn dust into our pump.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.420
Here it goes.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.200
I can hear all
the popcorn getting crushed.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:35.980
[Music]

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.480
I gotta try something.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.600
This feels very sturdy,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.200
much more sturdy
than popcorn traditionally is.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.480
That's barely...

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.500
Like it's not moving,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.100
and it's barely making
any noise, even like...

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.900
Wonder if you can use this
to sneak your own popcorn

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.100
into a theater.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.940
Maybe I should have used
the medium sized bag.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.700
Guys, popcorn does compress
down a little bit.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.812
All the air gets pulled out,

00:11:03.812 --> 00:11:05.600
and it just becomes
really immobile and rigid,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.800
which I thought was pretty cool.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.515
That really had a lot
of strength to it.

00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:10.100
I was able to stand
on it, like well.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.280
It didn't even seem
like it was moving or shifting.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.600
Guys, if you have any ideas of
things you'd like to see us try

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.900
putting in these vacuum bags,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.017
let us know down
in the comments.

00:11:17.017 --> 00:11:18.119
You can actually add a hashtag.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.500
So we're going to
use the #vacuumbag.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.220
If you use that,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.340
we should be able
to search and find it,

00:11:22.343 --> 00:11:24.100
and find all of the things
that linked to the video.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.700
So, let us know
if you've got some ideas.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.300
Guys, some of our favorite
projects are about

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.700
to become available as kits
in a monthly subscription.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.900
Click the link down

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.100
below to be the first
to find out what's coming.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.300
Guys, we've always
got more for you see.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.400
The box up there at the top
is going to take you directly

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.112
to our last videos.

00:11:39.112 --> 00:11:40.200
You should go check that out.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.019
The other box shows you

00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:42.604
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:42.604 --> 00:11:43.636
That's probably a good one too.

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:44.956
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:46.065
you'll be subscribe
to the channel.

00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:47.600
That way, you're never gonna
miss a cool video,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.085
especially if you remember
to ring that bell,

00:11:49.085 --> 00:11:50.300
so you get the
notification about it.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.257
We'll see you in the next one.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.100
Talk to you then.
