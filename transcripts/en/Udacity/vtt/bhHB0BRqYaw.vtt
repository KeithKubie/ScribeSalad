00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.154
This parabola has a vertex at 1, 2. Excellent work if you figured it out. We

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:12.074
want to start by factoring a negative 3 from these first two terms so we'll

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:17.970
have negative 3 times x squared minus 2x. We'll leave a space in order to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.821
complete the square and then we'll have negative 1 on the end. The b value is

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:27.229
negative 2 here. So, we need to add b over 2 squared in order to complete the

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:33.650
square. B divided by 2 equals negative 1, and this number squared is positive

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.214
1. This means, we add 1 in order to have a perfect square here. But, we really

00:00:40.214 --> 00:00:46.862
just didn't add 1 here, we really subtracted 3. We'll have negative 3x squared

00:00:46.862 --> 00:00:53.719
here, positive 6x here. And negative 3 here. So, in order to make our equation

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.096
balanced, we'll have to do the opposite of negative 3. We'll have to add 3 to

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:04.495
the same side of the equation. This is so that we really add 0. We don't want

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:08.590
to change our equation, we really just want to leave it balanced. We can

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.426
rewrite this as a perfect square, writing x minus 1 squared to replace this

00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:18.529
trinomial. The factor of negative 3 stays in front, and then we combine

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:24.340
negative 1 and positive 3 to get positive 2. This is our equation in vertex

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.745
form. And we can see that the vertex is h, k. Positive 1 and positive 2. Keep

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:35.210
in mind the y value were equal to 2, then that means that this entire

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.646
expression would have to equal zero. Which means the binomial x minus 1 must

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:48.330
equal 0. So, we set it equal to 0, which means x would have to equal 1. That's

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.975
the x coordinate of our vertex. So, we have this for our vertex, and then we

00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:56.818
can get two other points by moving one left and one right of the vertex, and

00:01:56.818 --> 00:02:04.041
then three units down. We can see that more clearly here. One unit left and one

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:10.166
unit right, and then three units down. That's our a value. So, we have the

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:15.485
points 0, negative 1 on our parabola, and we have the point 2, negative 1. And,

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:21.513
notice that these y coordinates are three units less than our vertex.
