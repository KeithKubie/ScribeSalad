00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:11.730
On 
May 6, 1954, just under one year after New

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.700
Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and Nepalese
mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.970
humans to reach the top of Mount Everest,
another seemingly insurmountable barrier was

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.090
crossed- a human being ran the mile in less
than four minutes. The man who did it was

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.079
25-year-old British medical student Roger
Bannister, finishing with a time of 3:59.4.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.730
This not only sent the cheering fans in Oxford’s
Iffley Stadium into hysterics, but shook the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.879
track and field world.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.609
At the time, the previous record of 4:01.4,
set by Sweden’s Gunder Haag, had stood for

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.670
nine years despite a considerable number of
attempts to break it. This ultimately resulted

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.559
in somewhat outlandish speculation by various
contemporary sports writers that finishing

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.359
under four minutes in the mile was simply
physiologically impossible for a human- a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.320
notion the runners themselves thought absurd.
As one of Bannister’s chief competitors

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.470
in the quest for the four minute mile, John
Landy, noted, “It was simply a barrier in

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.550
terms of conditioning by runners at that time,
the track conditions, and the competition.”

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.070
That said, he did note that, “The four-minute
mile had become the Mount Everest of track

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.070
and field.”

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.260
While the Olympic quest to go faster, higher
and stronger has long driven athletes to do

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.060
just that, the Olympics themselves have never
been a place to break the four minute mile

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.390
as this event goes by metric distances. (See:
The Evolution of the Metre) The closest event

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.980
in the Games, the 1500 meter, is only 93.3%
of the full 1609.4 meter equivalent of a mile.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.440
However, it was the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki
that Bannister and his two chief rivals, American

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.540
Wes Santee and the aforementioned Australian
John Landy, suffered defeats humiliating enough

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.530
to seek redemption through chasing the mark.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.300
Bannister was a man who took pride in his
own training methods — with theories on

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.960
everything from oxygen consumption to evenness
of splits –as well as maintaining a balance

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.490
between running and the rest of his life.
However, Bannister was planning on dropping

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.370
running after the 1952 Games to focus on his
chosen career as a physician. But when he

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.019
finished 4th in Helsinki, he invoked the wrath
of the British press who scapegoated his independent-minded

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.540
training ideas as the reason the Brits did
so poorly in the track events. Feeling he

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.640
had something to prove, the medical student
changed his mind and doubled down on running.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.400
landyAnother runner at the 1952 Olympics,
Australian John Landy, left the track in disappointment

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.400
after failing to qualify for the finals. However,
Landy left the meet with a dose of inspiration

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.760
from the era’s dominant distance runner
“the Czech Locomotive” Emil Zátopek.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.650
Zátopek won Gold at those Games in the 5,000
meter, 10,000 meter and the marathon (the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.650
latter being the first he’d ever competed
in, entering on a whim at the last minute).

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.849
One of Landy’s teammates ran three miles
to the closed off Soviet Olympic village and

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.640
slipped past the guards just to seek counsel
with Zátopek.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.879
Regaled with stories from his teammate, Landy
joined the entourage of admirers that followed

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.569
Zátopek around as he warmed up and pontificated
about his running regimen. What he learned

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.840
from Zátopek wasn’t running style and form,
but that the key to success in running was

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.770
rigorous year-round training to build up endurance.
This is something that’s exceedingly obvious

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.079
to anyone today, but at the time went very
contrary to the popular idea that you should

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.950
train as little as possible when not gearing
up for a race, even taking many months off

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.470
at times, thereby not putting too much stress
on the body. Zátopek, on the other hand,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.569
advocated continual intense interval training
and felt the more you stressed the body the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.549
better, so long as you let it heal up sufficiently
between training sessions.

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.609
Using Zátopek’s training methods, within
a few months of the 1952 Games, Landy managed

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:51.189
the fastest mile time since Gunder Haag set
the record at 4:01.4 in 1945. Landy’s new

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:56.889
personal best was 4:02.1, cutting 9 seconds
off his best time from before he changed his

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.610
training routine. Shortly after this, on January
3, 1953, he managed a pace of under 4 minutes

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.059
on the mile until the final 20 seconds, in
which he ran out of gas, slowing considerably

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:10.430
and finishing at 4:02.8.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.329
wes-santeeWes Santee, a University of Kansas
sophomore who had been breaking American records

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.949
left and right, had an even bigger chip on
his shoulder. The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.050
was the bane of his existence throughout his
career, primarily concerning that he continually

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.940
drew truly massive crowds at the races he
competed in, but was not allowed to earn money

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.130
from it. This was something the poor Kansas
farm boy wasn’t shy about railing against,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.350
even publicly, making him many enemies within
the AAU.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.220
In this first run-in with the AAU, however,
the trouble was not about amateur athlete

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.750
exploitation, but in the AAU denying him entry
into his best race, the 1,500 meter, at the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.900
1952 Olympic Games. Their reason? He had already
qualified in the 5K for the Olympics and they

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.169
didn’t think he could perform well in either
if he competed in two events.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.680
To keep him from running at the 1,500 meter
Olympic trials, two AAU officials physically

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.180
pulled him off the starting line mere moments
before the race. Shortly before the Games,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.030
as something of a middle finger to the AAU,
Santee raced the American 1,500 meter entrants,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:22.000
Bill Ashenfelter and Warren Druetzler, in
a 3/4 mile (1207 meter) competition and effortlessly

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.139
defeated them both.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:29.180
At the Games themselves, Santee was alienated
from the team over his conflict with the AAU

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.330
and was given little support from them for
the race. To make matters worse, his college

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.360
coach had not been able to make the trip,
leaving him on his own to vainly try to strategize

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.870
a race where he didn’t really know much
of anything about any of the other competitors.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.760
The result was one of his worst 5K times as
an adult, ultimately finishing 13th at the

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.169
Games. Track &amp; Field News stated that Santee
inexplicably ran the 5K at the Games “like

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.000
a novice.” After the Olympics, Neal Bascomb
noted in his book The Perfect Mile:

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.669
[Santee] wanted to prove what a big mistake
it had been to prevent him from running in

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.509
the 1,500 meter, and more important, he wanted
to show how good he really was. He set his

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.110
sights on a goal that had always been on the
horizon for him: The four-minute mile.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.251
Although Santee and Landy were not the first
to break the four minute mile barrier, it

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:21.070
was the relentless improvement of their personal
bests that pushed Bannister and his support

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.460
team to break the mark sooner than later out
of fear that one of those two would conquer

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.620
the “Mount Everest of track and field”
first.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.639
In the months leading up to the record breaking
race, despite Santee competing exceptionally

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.919
frequently compared to Landy and Bannister
(sometimes even racing multiple times in a

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.800
single day in various events and frequently
racing several times a week), he had nonetheless

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.099
reduced his personal best time in the mile
to 4:02.4. At this point, he hoped to make

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.600
his big push for the sub-four minute mile
after the college season ended that year and

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.750
he could properly rest for such a push.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.710
As for Landy, he’d managed a personal best
of 4:02.0 in the mile and several more times

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.590
in the 4:02.X range in early 1954.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.870
With Santee nearly getting their despite his
rigorous race schedule and Landy coming so

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.039
close so many times, Bannister, whose personal
best at the time matched Landy’s 4:02.0,

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.229
knew if he were to be first, he’d have to
pass the mark soon.

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:23.530
Leading up to the day of the fateful race,
Bannister took five days off of running, though

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.560
did do some light hiking. When the run started,
he later stated, “I can remember feeling

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.240
so full of running that on the first lap I
called out to Chris Brasher, ‘Faster!’

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.340
In fact he did 57 seconds. There was nothing
wrong with the pace.”

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.449
After the second lap, Chris Chataway took
over pacing from Brasher, and continued through

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:45.000
about the half way point of the last lap.
As Chataway tired and began to slow, Bannister

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.210
“unlock[ed] my finishing burst” and sprinted
past him to the finish line. “I leapt at

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.409
the tape like a man taking his last spring
to save himself from the chasm that threatens

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:58.230
to engulf him,” then gasped for breath as
he slowed. He later stated, “I felt like

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.999
an exploded flashlight with no will to live.”

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:06.830
As the crowd and Bannister anxiously waited
for his time to be read, the stadium announcer,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:11.259
Norris McWhirter, finally spoke, dragging
the suspense out as long as possible,

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:15.900
Ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of
event nine, the one mile: first, number forty

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.680
one, R. G. Bannister, Amateur Athletic Association
and formerly of Exeter and Merton Colleges,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.560
Oxford, with a time which is a new meeting
and track record, and which—subject to ratification—will

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.111
be a new English Native, British National,
All-Comers, European, British Empire and World

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:35.070
Record. The time was three…

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.050
The roar of the crowd drowned out the rest
of the digits. His time was 3:59.4.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:45.899
A mere month later, Wes Santee would break
the world record in the 1,500 meter with a

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:52.160
time of 3:42.8, then for good measure continued
running in an attempt to become the second

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.440
person to cross the four minute mile barrier.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.279
He failed, with a time of 4:00.6.

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:04.139
Less than a year later, peaking at 4:00.5
for the mile and holding three of the five

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:08.930
fastest mile times in the world at that point,
he was temporarily banned by the Amateur Athletic

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.380
Union (AAU) for accepting money to race. According
to the AAU, he had been given “at least

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.740
$1,200” (about $10,000 today) to cover his
expenses for travel, food and lodging in three

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.620
races in May of 1955. At the time, the AAU
only allowed the organizers of their races

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.579
to give $15 per race to the athletes, despite
crowds that sometimes swelled into the tens

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:35.209
of thousands paying to watch Santee run.

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:38.920
Later, questions about Santee’s amateur
status likewise saw him permanently banned

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.200
from AAU events and international competition.
Because there was no professional running

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.350
organization at the time, after finishing
up his tour with the Mariners shortly after

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.550
being banned, where he at least could still
compete in their running events, he never

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.420
competed again, his personal best missing
the four minute mile mark by a half a second.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:02.440
Santee later bitterly noted of this, “The
AAU says it is possible to get by on the expense

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.430
allowances permitted by their rules. My answer
to that is, ‘Yes, if you want to become

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.579
an athletic bum.’”

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:12.860
He also mused about the fact that it was AAU
officials who were the promoters who commonly

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.100
offered extra money to the best runners to
come race at their events, including stating

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.430
that the then head of the AAU, Dan Ferris,
had once paid him to race. He quipped of this,

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.450
“I always questioned how they could be the
ones giving me the money and on the other

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.089
hand banning me for it.”

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:32.800
bannister_and_landyAs for Landy, just over
two weeks after Santee’s 4:00.6 failed attempt

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.190
at a sub-4 minute mile, and 46 days after
Bannister’s successful one, John Landy would

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.730
not just cross the four minute mile barrier,
but shatter Bannister’s fresh world record

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:50.120
by 1.7 seconds, managing a time of 3:57.9
seconds (which was officially rounded by the

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.000
IAAF to 3 min 58.0 seconds) on June 21, 1954.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.510
On August 7 of that same year, Landy and Bannister
would go head to head at the 1954 British

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:05.230
Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver,
B.C. in one of the most anticipated races

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.060
of the day. In it, for the first time in history,
two competitors both managed a sub-four minute

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:18.790
mile, with Landy finishing at 3:59.6 and Bannister
at 3:58.8. Landy had led up to the last bend

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.920
before he decided to turn and look over his
left shoulder to see where Banister was- an

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.480
opportunity Banister used to sneak past him
on the other side.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.959
Notably, about seven months later, Landy ran
an incredible race of 4:02.0. Why is that

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:38.850
impressive? Because it included him stopping
completely mid-race after he accidentally

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:44.020
spiked Ron Clarke on the arm when Clarke tripped
and fell in front of him. Rather than continue

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.110
running, Landy stopped to make sure Clarke
was alright, helped him up and apologized

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.010
for accidentally stepping on him with his
spiked shoes.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.610
landy_and_clarkeOnce back on his feet, Clarke
urged Landy to continue the race, which he

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.110
did. The total time Landy was standing still
was about 7 seconds. He finished with the

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.889
aforementioned time of 4:02.0, meaning he
likely would have shattered his own world

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:09.850
record of 3:58.0 had he not stopped. (This
is not unlike that time an Olympic rower stopped

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:15.519
to let some ducks swim by and still won the
gold medal.)

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:19.139
After their respective racing careers were
over, Bannister would be knighted and enjoyed

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:23.660
a distinguished career as a neurologist, his
research in the latter, according to him,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.709
