[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:07.950
NICHOLAS TSE: Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.150
It's an honor to be here.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.570
Thank you for having
me at Google Hong Kong.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.070
Yeah.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.870
I hope today
through this session

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.850
both parties can have a blast.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.030
And at any time if you feel that
you want to voice out or ask

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.050
questions, please feel free.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.720
OK.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.670
So when I first
got the invitation

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.160
to come to Google Hong Kong,
I was thinking to myself,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.900
what the hell am I
going to do at Google?

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.400
Seriously.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.500
Because you guys
are the people I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.850
go to when I look at my stuff.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.860
Seriously.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.050
It could be through
the search engine.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.150
It could be through maps.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.770
I like to travel a lot.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.590
I could throw on a backpack
and just wander off somewhere

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.020
into the world
and see the world.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.320
So I'm always
navigating through maps.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.840
And lately, actually,
speaking of which,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.550
I've been trying to pick
up on more Japanese.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.150
So I do this a
lot now every day.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.312
Hey Siri-san.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:07.060
SIRI: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.980
NICHOLAS TSE:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.472
SIRI: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.930
NICHOLAS TSE: I've been trying
to pick up on more Japanese.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.030
So lately I've made Google
Translate my best friend.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.950
So I've even--

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.860
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.880
I'm even forcing my
smartphone to converse

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.120
in Japanese with me, because
we only have 24 hours a day.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.840
So yeah.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.160
But I must say, sometimes
the translations

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.060
are still a bit funky.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.900
But 80% of the time it
does the job very well.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.600
So thank you for
whoever out there that's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.810
making my life a lot easier.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.470
So yes.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.610
I do visit you guys very,
very often every day.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.980
But I'm not here to talk
about what we can Google.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.500
I think you guys
out of everybody

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.830
knows best what we can
search on the internet.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.870
But maybe today we could touch
on some other keywords where we

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.660
cannot fully understand
through the internet,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.460
maybe keywords like creativity.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.870
I think creativity for me,
it's the biggest thing.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.530
Either it be through my music,
or my food shows, or movies,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.890
or my business.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.110
Because I think without
creativity we cannot really

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.560
ensure our place in the market.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.340
And eventually you will be
left behind in the world.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.480
Creativity comes in many
different forms and styles,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.380
I guess.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.210
It doesn't have to
be through movies

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.280
or that kind of artistry.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.350
It could be through tennis.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.950
It could be through agriculture,
architecture, woodworking,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.320
lecturing, whatever it may be.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.600
It could be through
programming or engineering.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.860
I think if Google
was not as creative

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.800
when they were doing the
algorithms back then,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.850
it would not be
what it is today.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.710
So a lot of people
would say, yeah,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.940
I'm not the creative type.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.450
No.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.360
We all are.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.100
We just have to
find that one edge.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.700
We have to find how we can
synergize and capitalize

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.030
on that on our own strengths.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.040
But it is getting harder
and harder to be creative,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.270
I think, in this world,
because everyday we

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.830
are flooded by so much
content in our phones.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.920
All the blogs that we
look at, all the comments,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.040
all the likes, all the
streaming, all the films.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.430
Everything.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.670
But unknowingly,
unknowingly we are so almost

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.930
too inspired to a point where
we are losing ourselves,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.310
because we are taking in
everybody else's ideas--

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.800
their thoughts, their voices.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.210
Therefore, if we are
not creative enough,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.320
we tend to what we call--

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.580
we would ride on
other people's ideas.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.560
Let's twist.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.530
Let's tweak.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.950
Let's-- in [INAUDIBLE] we
would say [SPEAKING CHINESE]..

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.459
But when we get into
a habit of that,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.250
we forget about being original,
being really creative,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.500
starting our own ideas.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.940
And to me that is very, very
dangerous, because if what

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.080
you put out is no different
than the person next to you,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.180
if what you contribute
to the company

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.697
is just the same as
everybody else in the room,

00:04:38.697 --> 00:04:39.780
let me tell you something.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.810
Next year you won't be here.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.970
The company doesn't need you.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.000
Eventually the market
doesn't need you.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.600
And the world--
they don't need you.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.500
So constantly ask
yourself how you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.320
can contribute more than
the person next to you.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.390
I've been in my industry
for more than 22 years now.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.690
And I tell you, I ask myself
that question every damn day.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.230
Every day.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.380
Through music, through
film, through my shows,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.530
through my business.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.050
How do I be more creative?

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.010
That is very, very hard.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.340
And maybe even in some fields,
it's getting harder and harder.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.640
Like in music, I would say
that it is harder for me

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.040
now to compose a very
good piece of music

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.540
than it was 15, 20 years
ago, because the time

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.390
signatures or the
combinations of the notes

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.370
are simply being taken up.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.920
It is harder to write
something original than now

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.400
and have it not sound like that
it has been written by someone,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.570
sometime, like some
song back then.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.950
Because it's been done.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.010
But in our world,
that's what is happening

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.610
is because all the ideas
are being voiced up.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.560
And we are seeing it.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.950
So if we don't voice out
loud enough, clear enough,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.000
soon enough, we are
actually behind.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.030
So I urge you--

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.810
the first key word that
I would want to touch on

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.920
is actually creativity.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.100
Does anybody have
anything to say?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.970
Any other things that
you want to talk about?

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.390
Another word I would say is--

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.040
a keyword for me is
experience, especially--

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.780
well, experience in terms of the
verb experience, not the noun

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.240
experience,
especially for you lot

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.160
where your work
requires you to sit

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.550
behind a desk and a computer
the whole day, maybe

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.100
the whole year.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.210
But I would say that
it is very important

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.280
to get out there to the world
and really experience it.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.810
Because I think the phone
still only brings you halfway.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.000
And you must walk
the other half.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.690
You know, nowadays
when I'm chatting

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.050
with a lot of the younger
generation kids, what really

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.690
happens a lot is that
maybe the topic would

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.900
be along the line
of, man, I was in--

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.690
I was-- I was in
Finland last weekend.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.140
The Aurora lights,
they were beautiful.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.820
And then the kid would
say something like, yeah.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.320
I know.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.820
I know.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.500
I saw it on YouTube.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.585
Or yeah, yeah.

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:25.460
That was really cool.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.330
I saw it on Facebook.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.200
Yeah.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.770
OK.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.270
Sure.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.590
I'm sure it's an opening.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.190
It's an idea.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.120
It's a glimpse of
what it really is.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.100
But if that's how
you see things,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.506
you don't know (WHISPERED).

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.080
Again, it's a great
entrance to the world.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.620
But it's halfway.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.210
Please, when the opportunity
allows, get off your butt

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.760
and walk the other half, which
may be even more important.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.100
OK.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.840
Experience the world.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.340
OK.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.970
The phone is awesome.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.780
The net is awesome.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.442
But that is halfway, halfway.

00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:08.150
Is it too early for
you guys, because you

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.458
guys look kind of stale.

00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:11.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.960
James, maybe we could
start with a more Q&amp;A.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.420
If anybody wants,
please jump in.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.820
AUDIENCE: One of the
things that is on our minds

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.240
is also giving back
about creativity,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.380
it's about experience.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.330
A lot of that is
because we're sort

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.940
of going through life
through a screen,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.890
and we're not interacting much.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.130
Here at Google we spent a lot
of time thinking about what

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.130
we're doing for Hong Kong, how
we're supporting non-profits,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.929
how we're providing
services for schools--

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.710
training kids that
code, for example.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.820
What advice do you have for
us, and also for the broader

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.790
millennial crowd who is
interested in doing something

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.990
for Hong Kong?

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.940
How to get started.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.940
How to think about that.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.380
And what approach to take.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.140
Thank you.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.548
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:08:57.548 --> 00:08:59.090
I think keep doing
what you're doing.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.630
Really.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.800
But we cannot lose the--

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.440
what we're trying to do is
share, I think, in this era.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.040
And of course, sharing comes
in different forms also.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.800
And that's what
Chef Nic, the brand,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.470
is trying to do is
because I think even now,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.920
when you see families going
off to go out to dinners,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.580
they're eating through
looking through their--

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.510
looking through their
phones the whole time.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.810
Actually, that's
losing the true essence

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.687
of why we are eating together.

00:09:28.687 --> 00:09:31.270
And that's what we're trying to
promote through the "Chef Nic"

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.430
show is [SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:40.800
What is [SPEAKING CHINESE] is to
actually enjoy a meal together.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.640
And that's why-- that's what
cooking has also taught me.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.320
is let me tell you.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.400
I was in really, really
bad terms with my parents

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.710
for the longest time.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.860
I was in boarding school
ever since I was 12.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.620
And then at the age of
14, I was sent to Tokyo

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.580
to start training in music.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.290
By 16, I started working.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.280
And I never really
got a chance to have

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.410
a relationship with my parents.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.470
And we've been on bad
terms for the longest time,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.680
until, until I started cooking.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.760
Because when you cook, it's the
food-- you don't eat it alone.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.720
You want to share it.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.550
You want to get some feedbacks.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.120
And it gave me a
medium to know how

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.320
to talk to my parents and
say, [SPEAKING CHINESE]..

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.243
Or Mom, and [SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:10:34.243 --> 00:10:36.160
Whatever you cooked back
then was really cool.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.202
And you want to teach me?

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:40.095
It became-- now it's
a habit, you know.

00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:40.970
Does the food matter?

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.090
Of course it does.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:49.210
But what really matters is how
you find your way to share.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.670
And I think keep doing
what you're doing.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.800
But if you can think
of the third party,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.158
then I think that the whole
picture is much bigger.

00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:01.467
JAMES TAO: Cool.

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:02.550
Why don't you take a seat.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.258
NICHOLAS TSE: OK.

00:11:03.258 --> 00:11:07.840
JAMES TAO: We'll chat a little
bit and get comfortable.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.060
It was very inspiring
talk hearing talk

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.720
about creativity and the
journey where you just

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.370
mentioned how cooking brought
you and your family closer

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.870
together.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.150
NICHOLAS TSE: Right.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.560
JAMES TAO: So a little
bit on "Chef Nic."

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.240
It's now in its fifth season.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.600
We're seeing a lot of traction
both online and offline.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.920
But I want to kind of turn
back the clock back to 2014.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.950
What besides what you just
mentioned about the parents

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.060
thing-- but what was the
thing that made you transition

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.710
from the singer, the actor
[INAUDIBLE] to Chef Nic?

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.750
And what was that
transition like?

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.590
NICHOLAS TSE: I didn't think I--

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.800
I wasn't looking for
a transition, really.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.570
I thought I could do
everything together.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.110
Right?

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.730
I'm still doing music.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.860
I'm still doing films.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.380
It's weird, because
people look at this

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:06.470
like I'm moving from
woodworking to pharmacy.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.480
It's not that far.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.420
I think what I'm doing with
food, with movies, and also

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.260
music, and the
business together, I

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.200
think, as a whole it
has perfect synergy.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.375
I don't think that
they're really unrelated.

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:20.500
And that's how I do things.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.800
If I cannot pull
resources from somewhere,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.910
somehow to contribute
into a new thing I do,

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.410
then I really would reconsider
to either do it or not.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:38.530
Because to start fresh at
a later age-- later age--

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.140
is maybe at a disadvantage.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.330
But first of all, I found
food to be a true passion.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:52.090
And then I also saw that it
would be the next biggest thing

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.580
after communication and tech.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.630
So I thought how I
could kind of rejuvenate

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:05.400
the whole entertainment
business of mine

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.630
and make it a long
lasting one, I guess.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.670
JAMES TAO: Was this
interest in food something

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.730
that was always there?

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.147
NICHOLAS TSE: It
was always there.

00:13:12.147 --> 00:13:15.650
But I thought to make
it a bit more serious.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.070
And at the time I think
mainland China was actually--

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.917
it was really lacking a
decent food or lifestyle show.

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:23.500
JAMES TAO: OK.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.292
NICHOLAS TSE: Yeah.

00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:26.440
So we started 2014.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.170
Right?

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.430
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.090
NICHOLAS TSE: And
we just finished

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.203
the fifth season this year.

00:13:33.203 --> 00:13:33.870
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.250
I've been watching.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.250
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.100
JAMES TAO: So on the food topic,
I'm sure you hear this a lot.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.240
And even people who know
me doing this have asked

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.080
this as well is that, you've
never worked in the kitchen.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.130
Can you really cook?

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.630
Like, obviously I heard stories.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.350
And I know that you put a lot
of hard work and dedication

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.640
and courage into being who
you are today and achieving

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.527
what you've done.

00:14:00.527 --> 00:14:01.860
But not everybody has seen that.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.140
So what goes through
your mind when

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.820
you hear criticism like this?

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.650
And how do you deal with?

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.690
NICHOLAS TSE: It's
logically acceptable.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.580
Because first of
all, we may think

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.850
that because someone has not
been doing something for really

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.780
long, they can't be good at it.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.540
Right?

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.370
That's the logic.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.300
It's OK.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.260
It's OK.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.110
But that's almost like saying--

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.500
let put it this way.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.380
That's almost like saying
we as a human race,

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.045
we've been using the landline
telephone for centuries.

00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:33.170
Why don't we stick with it?

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.230
That must be the best way.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.940
So dump all your iPhones.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.350
Dump all your mobiles right now.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.170
Let's go back to the landline,
because we've been doing

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.760
that for the longest time.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.020
Right?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.180
That's like saying,
we as a human race,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.560
we've been using the--

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:53.490
we've been driving gasoline
automobiles for centuries.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:58.730
So has Elon Musk gone
crazy to start Tesla?

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.580
Why are there so many
electronic cars out there now?

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.020
Because that must
be the best way,

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.090
because we've been doing
it for the longest time.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.870
I think we are
that narrow-minded.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.520
That really frightens me,
because we are in a new era.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.980
There are perks
and different texts

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.390
now out there that allows us
to pick up on information much

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.840
more rapidly than it has been
in the traditional kitchen,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.707
I would say.

00:15:24.707 --> 00:15:25.290
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.420
But the way I've heard is
maybe the first apprentice cook

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.710
would be peeling vegetables
for maybe a year or two.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:43.300
But I have my ways, or I
have saved up enough money

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.603
to be peeling something
much more in the first year.

00:15:45.603 --> 00:15:46.270
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.010
I mean, like we hear
all these stories

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.000
about like, chefs
training in Japan

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.360
and like they're washing
rice for like seven years

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.680
before they can make sushi.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.513
NICHOLAS TSE: Right.

00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:56.980
So is that the
best and only way?

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.400
I don't think we can be that
narrow-minded in thinking

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.100
like that.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.650
Of course, there has
been a lot of hard work

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.310
and time and effort put into it.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.333
But I don't have
to get into those.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.000
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.270
But how do you stay focused
on doing what you need to do?

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.620
Do you have like a system?

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.105
Do you have a way to do things?

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.590
Because obviously
it's a lot of work.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.090
NICHOLAS TSE: It's
a lot of work.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.290
JAMES TAO: There's a lot
of learning involved.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.880
Like, how do you stay organized?

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.293
How do you stay focused?

00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:29.710
NICHOLAS TSE: That's one thing
I learned in the kitchen is

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.970
time management.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.660
Because when you're trying to
serve two dishes, it's easy.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.680
For two, it's easy.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.580
For four, it's OK.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.420
For eight, yeah, it's not bad.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.270
But when you try and do eight
dishes for a table of 10,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.140
and they all have to be
hot when you serve like,

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.660
in Chinese food.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.190
It's not that easy.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.620
And when you do one
of my Michelin galas,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.070
when you're serving for 700,
they still have to be hot.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.830
And you've got eight
minutes of serving time

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.600
for 700 fine dining.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.920
It's very hard.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.420
But then you learn.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:12.180
Gradually, eventually you
learn how to pace ourselves.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.750
And then your organization.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.339
Like what I just
demonstrated on my phone.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.810
I try to squeeze in all these
little seconds and milliseconds

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:30.330
in my life to gain
just that much more.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.715
But I guess when there's
a will, there's a way.

00:17:34.715 --> 00:17:36.090
I don't know your
time schedules.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.460
But you figure that
out for yourself.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.400
But there are these
little gaps in life

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.790
where you can just
squeeze in a bit more here

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.230
and there, knowledge.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.380
And then eventually
that adds up.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.110
That adds up.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.610
Yeah.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:50.790
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.670
I think it's amazing how you're
able to balance so many things

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.780
and do everything so well.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.030
NICHOLAS TSE: And I'm a very--

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.920
naturally I'm a very
[SPEAKING CHINESE] person.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.610
I'm a very--

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.680
I'm very curious
about everything.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.430
You know?

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.030
I mean, I look up stuff just to
know, just to ask why, where,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.120
when, how.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.870
And when I start
something, I don't

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.350
like to stop until I
actually get somewhere.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.540
That's just a personality.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.265
JAMES TAO: Yeah, I've heard
many stories as well about--

00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:22.140
NICHOLAS TSE: Really?

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.790
JAMES TAO: --deep you go and
how kind of focused you are,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.580
and how deep down you drill
into everything that you

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.270
try to learn.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.560
And I think that's something
that's very admirable.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.840
NICHOLAS TSE: Oh.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.910
I can be a pain in the
ass in that aspect.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.400
Yeah.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.800
JAMES TAO: But like I said,
you're a man of many hats.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.580
You're developing a
chef career on the side.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.870
You have music.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.010
You have acting.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.900
All that together.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.790
Kind of bringing the
conversation back

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.750
to where it started with music,
your last Cantonese album

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.810
was in 2005.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.620
NICHOLAS TSE: Really?

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.687
JAMES TAO: One step closer.

00:19:01.687 --> 00:19:02.520
NICHOLAS TSE: Right.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.353
JAMES TAO: And then
your last Mandarin album

00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:05.490
was 10 years ago.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.222
It was 2009.

00:19:06.222 --> 00:19:06.930
NICHOLAS TSE: Oh.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.220
JAMES TAO: So I know you
haven't stopped doing music.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:16.080
So you've done movie songs,
you did songs for your show.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.780
And over the past 12
months, personally, I've

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.110
seen you kind of do
a little bit more.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.050
Started with 2018 [INAUDIBLE]
in that performance.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.680
You launched three
singles this year.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.270
You were a guest
judge on "The Voice."

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.750
And now just recently you
had the RTHK performance.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.040
So is this
foreshadowing something?

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.323
Are we going to see more
music coming from you in 2019?

00:19:44.323 --> 00:19:45.990
NICHOLAS TSE: I didn't
really plan this.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.180
I think I'm just going
with the flow, really.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.620
Sometimes.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:56.400
But I think at different times
with different inspirations,

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.170
or sometimes I feel that
there are different advantages

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.390
for different fields.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.430
You know how sometimes
the stock market,

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.780
it's doing better
than the real estate.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.860
Sometimes music is
doing better than film.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.320
And that's how I can kind of
weasel around and do my thing,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.570
because there's never one
trend that's always at the top.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:20.920
That's actually true.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.630
If you really look
at the market,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.200
something is always
doing a bit better.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.870
And if the trend is like that,
and you kind of catch the wave,

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.730
man, you're on top.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.990
Because when we started
the "Chef Nic" show,

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:43.150
we are definitely the
biggest food show in China.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.810
When we started in 2014,
by the third season

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:51.160
we were doing over
300 million RMB.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.050
And now we're in
the fifth season.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.860
But if you catch the wave,
that's a different thing.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.090
That's a different thing.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:04.750
So I think we're doing
very stable in "Chef Nic."

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.478
So I think now I have
the time to kind of--

00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:09.520
JAMES TAO: Do more music.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.780
NICHOLAS TSE: --do more music.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.420
JAMES TAO: So does that
mean we'll see the album--

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.510
an album this year?

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:18.160
NICHOLAS TSE: I don't know if
I'm working on a full album.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.940
But I don't really think if
that really matters anymore

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.410
in the new market.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.220
Right?

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.167
But yeah.

00:21:26.667 --> 00:21:27.280
JAMES TAO: But what does matter?

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.530
NICHOLAS TSE: I'm hoping for--

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.950
I'm actually working
on a concert.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.027
But there's--

00:21:31.027 --> 00:21:32.860
JAMES TAO: That's what
we were going to ask.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.360
NICHOLAS TSE: In
Hong Kong everybody

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.310
is starting a concert as if
they have nothing else to do.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.142
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:39.142 --> 00:21:40.850
JAMES TAO: And still
hard to buy tickets.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:41.975
So.

00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:43.600
NICHOLAS TSE: We need
a bigger stadium.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.920
That's what we need.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.550
Yeah.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.360
JAMES TAO: We need a bigger--

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.890
NICHOLAS TSE: A
new, bigger stadium.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:48.130
JAMES TAO: --platform.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.130
We need more creativity.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.240
NICHOLAS TSE: Maybe that's
why I can book my stadium

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.042
schedule, because I've been
dissing it the whole time.

00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:58.000
JAMES TAO: Well, time to
get creative and think

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.180
about something different.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.540
Right?

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.330
Back on the topic of
[SPEAKING CHINESE],,

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.130
"The Voice."

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.060
A lot of people have said that
this season was a lot better

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.920
than previous seasons.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.050
I think so.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.500
Personally, I think you
being on it injected

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.570
kind of a different dynamic.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:25.810
It was-- it was interesting to
see how seriously you took it.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.650
Again, stories.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.280
I heard a story
that maybe I want

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.170
you to share with everybody
about the drumming performance.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.830
So I actually heard from Derek
how hard you prepared for it

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.750
and how you kept on--

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:46.332
NICHOLAS TSE: Well, preparation
for the performance is a given.

00:22:46.332 --> 00:22:48.790
But actually, when you talk
about "The Voice," what I would

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.110
actually want to share is--

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.950
I don't know how many
people has watched the show.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.630
But you know how I
got totally bashed

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.210
when I started hammering
onto the button at first

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.850
in the first two episodes,
because there are actually

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.500
these two new perks.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.510
They changed the way the
game played this year.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:11.935
That to start off with,
all the contestants--

00:23:11.935 --> 00:23:15.730
there are about 150
contestants put into one room.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.650
And they are
watching a live feed

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.110
of whatever is happening
on stage-- the performance,

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.860
along with the judges'
comments and how

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.420
they would choose their team.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.420
That's one thing.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.780
The second thing is, each judge
would have a six-person quota

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.860
to choose into
assembling their team.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.560
And if you do choose
a seventh person,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.660
that person would have to
battle out any of their chosen--

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.910
the person from
the original team.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.540
So thinking like that,
there are a few things

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.200
I tried doing is the
first episode, if people

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.480
who have seen the show would see
me just hearing the first two

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.410
sentences, and then I would
be smashing onto the button.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.270
And then the
reporters, the viewers,

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.910
who would say, he doesn't
know Jack about music!

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.600
Go back to cooking!

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.240
How could you choose
someone from just listening

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.740
for the first two words?

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.973
What I found out was, I am
very aware that for the past 10

00:24:18.973 --> 00:24:19.890
years, like you said--

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.970
my last album was
maybe 10 years ago--

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.340
I'm very aware that a
lot of the younger kids,

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.870
they don't see me as a singer.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.670
They don't see me as a musician.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:34.000
If I were to fight for
these contestants over--

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.720
with the other judges, I would
have a very big disadvantage.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:44.110
The only way I could plant some
ideas into the 150 contestants

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.060
that are watching
the live feed is

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:51.730
by hammering onto that button
and slowly turning around,

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.100
because therefore,
I have the floor.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.597
I have the power of speech.

00:24:56.597 --> 00:24:58.180
Because they didn't
choose the person.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.140
I did.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.350
So actually I'm trying
to voice out and tell

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.400
not the person on the stage,
but the 150 in the room,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.120
what I have done or
what my views on music

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:15.310
is so that they would feel more
comfortable joining my team.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.220
But then, man, I got
totally bashed by the media,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.180
by everybody else.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.670
Yeah, stop this guy, or
he's crazy, or whatever.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.890
And that's one thing I
found that was really

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.990
helping me out strategically.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.880
The second thing is people
are also bashing me for--

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.880
I would choose a
lot of contestants

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.420
because I was solely
pressing onto the button.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.000
But what I was also
doing is, I found out

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.210
if you had to choose
a seventh member,

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:52.150
and if your whole team was
equally matched, six of them

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.300
were equally as good, it's
very hard for a newcomer

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.860
to choose who they
would like to battle.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.590
But if you have two that are--

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.690
it's cruel to say
this-- but, if you

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.770
have two that is
obviously a bit weaker,

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.790
it's easier for the
newcomer to choose from.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.878
So you could always keep
on upgrading your team,

00:26:15.878 --> 00:26:17.170
if that makes sense to anybody.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:23.350
But strategically, I think I've
done something new in the show.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.890
Yeah.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.950
JAMES TAO: So it seems like you
took a very strategic approach

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.320
on how you picked your
team and how you--

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.070
NICHOLAS TSE: Yes.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.830
But at the end, I hope
all these elements

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.190
would bring a better show.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.900
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.050
Right.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.570
So how long was the filming
of the entire process?

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.910
NICHOLAS TSE: The
shooting days was 29 days.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.040
But the whole process
with all the rehearsal

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.290
and all the training
was maybe three months.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.110
JAMES TAO: So over that span,
like being on "The Voice"

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.870
and this is a relatively
new experience for you.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.080
NICHOLAS TSE: Yeah.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.600
JAMES TAO: What do you think
was the biggest thing that you

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.220
learned or gained from that?

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.340
NICHOLAS TSE: For me,
it was a great platform

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.150
to get back into
music, because it

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.680
has the most reach right now
in terms of variety shows

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.180
in China.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.035
So.

00:27:14.035 --> 00:27:15.925
JAMES TAO: Are you
going back next season?

00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:17.050
NICHOLAS TSE: I don't know.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.150
I don't know.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:18.850
JAMES TAO: OK.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.690
But some stuff like that, like
kind of music shows and stuff

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.340
are still something
you'd like to--

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:24.700
NICHOLAS TSE: Definitely.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.480
JAMES TAO: --be
more involved in?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.522
NICHOLAS TSE: Definitely.

00:27:26.522 --> 00:27:28.060
JAMES TAO: OK.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.850
As I talked about at the
beginning of the talk,

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:33.590
you're the first guest
we're having here at Talks

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.110
at Google in Hong Kong.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.080
So I'd be remiss not to
bring the conversation back

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.310
to tech a little bit.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.660
NICHOLAS TSE: All right.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.210
JAMES TAO: I heard that you're
a very heavy YouTube user.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.610
So let's start from there.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:46.805
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:46.805 --> 00:27:47.680
NICHOLAS TSE: No, no.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.640
JAMES TAO: You told
me in the room.

00:27:48.808 --> 00:27:49.600
NICHOLAS TSE: Sure.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.280
JAMES TAO: So what's your
view on kind of technology

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.610
and how we interact with
platforms like YouTube

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.530
and other social media?

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.220
And how do you think that
plays into today's world,

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.368
and even your own
life and career?

00:28:05.368 --> 00:28:06.910
NICHOLAS TSE: Well,
definitely for me

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.580
it's a very important
part of my life now.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.830
I think for any of us, really.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:15.583
We've just got gotten into
the habit of learning a lot.

00:28:15.583 --> 00:28:17.500
Even like, my kids,
they're always on YouTube.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.640
Seriously.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.270
I think the tech
nowadays, it has really

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:26.410
enhanced the speed of
our learning curve.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:31.600
We are picking up the goods
and bads through the internet.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.470
Like, even through food--

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.420
like how tech has really
changed food immensely

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.060
through the past 10 years now.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.400
The delivery system
has allowed us

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:50.290
to choose fresh goods from
the internet, stuff like that.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.260
JAMES TAO: You're not a very
heavy user on social media.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.300
NICHOLAS TSE: Right.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.480
I'm not a social media guy.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.240
But if there's a
destination I'm looking for,

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.450
then I would
definitely go on it.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.600
JAMES TAO: Do you feel
that social media nowadays

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.370
has kind of become something
that more or less kind

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:17.080
of consumes people and has
become more of an addiction

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.310
for some people--

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.602
NICHOLAS TSE: Well, definitely.

00:29:19.602 --> 00:29:22.060
JAMES TAO: --takes away from
the benefits of technology?

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.850
NICHOLAS TSE: But
then I think it's

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.930
a balance between for
everything that we do.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:33.130
If we go to extreme, it's
always kind of harmful.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.810
So we just have
to balance it out.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.477
JAMES TAO: Is that
why you're not on it?

00:29:36.477 --> 00:29:38.110
Or you just don't like it?

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:42.500
NICHOLAS TSE: I'm just not
in the habit of doing the--

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.530
that maybe it's just not me.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.980
Right?

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.060
JAMES TAO: But it's--

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.750
I think it's also a platform
for you to kind share

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.540
your views sure and
share what you've done

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.540
and something like that.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.370
So maybe something to consider.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:56.370
NICHOLAS TSE: Of course.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.100
Of course.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.350
JAMES TAO: I'm sure if you
opened up a YouTube channel

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.150
and shared your cooking
tips, everyone here

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.590
would be love to subscribe.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.430
NICHOLAS TSE: But then
that's another thing

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.600
right now that's really--

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.718
there's a bit of a
language barrier.

00:30:11.718 --> 00:30:14.010
I mean, I have a lot of clips,
but they're in Mandarin.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:14.650
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.442
NICHOLAS TSE: So if I
do put it on YouTube,

00:30:16.442 --> 00:30:19.180
then I would have to kind of
redo the exact same thing,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.790
but one maybe in
English or in Cantonese.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.760
That really pisses me off.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.510
Right?

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:29.690
I have to do three
of the same thing.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.183
I would have to kill three
fish to do a steam fish.

00:30:33.183 --> 00:30:33.850
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.392
And if you only kill
one fish, people

00:30:35.392 --> 00:30:37.210
will be commenting
again and saying--

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.072
NICHOLAS TSE: Right?

00:30:39.072 --> 00:30:40.780
JAMES TAO: --there's
already a cut there.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.906
Yeah.

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:45.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.000
OK, I've been meaning
to ask you about a show

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.050
that you did called "Celebrity
Chef East Versus West."

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.680
So you faced off against
star chef David Rocco.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.140
And it was a five
episodes mini-series.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.210
And spoiler alert-- you won.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:04.210
Why did you choose to
go film an English show?

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.783
What was that experience like?

00:31:05.783 --> 00:31:08.200
NICHOLAS TSE: Well, back to
the part where a lot of people

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.910
has been doubting me
for the cooking part.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.210
So all you could
do really is just

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.180
to go the extent to
prove yourselves.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.340
I think that in--

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.690
I've been doing that
in every field, really.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.480
That's why I put myself
through competitions.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.480
Especially when you do a
foreign show like from Fox.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.200
Then it's not a "Chef Nic" show.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.750
That if I can't prove myself
through that kind of platform,

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.080
then the haters will be haters.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.850
But at least I've
gone the extent.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.610
I might even be
going back this year

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:47.560
to be judging or even competing.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.540
I'm OK with competing.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.500
But, yeah.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.220
I think you just have
to find yourself to--

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.020
find ways to prove yourself.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.450
I have done many crazy
stuff just to prove myself.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:05.410
But sometimes that's the
extent you would have to do.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.970
I've jumped off buildings.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.600
I've jumped off convention
center in Hong Kong

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.480
to do my movies.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.150
JAMES TAO: "Police Story."

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:11.983
NICHOLAS TSE: Right.

00:32:11.983 --> 00:32:14.230
When people also thought
that I-- because I'm

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.200
the son of two
celebrities-- maybe

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.370
I don't take my job seriously.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.360
And that's-- that's why I've
been putting myself through all

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.100
this hardship and this pain
and buildings after buildings,

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.370
because if that's not serious
enough for you, then what is?

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.950
It may be silly to some people.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.660
But then you go try it.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.270
Right?

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.610
JAMES TAO: I mean, I'm
sure in the room not

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.240
everybody is familiar with how
you started and everything.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.360
But definitely as someone who
grew up in that generation,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.620
I was able to witness
all the negative--

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.800
NICHOLAS TSE: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.675
JAMES TAO: All right.

00:32:53.675 --> 00:32:55.890
Same generation.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.010
But I was-- yeah.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.200
NICHOLAS TSE: For
people who doesn't know,

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:06.730
the first four years of
my career was 99% booing.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:11.500
I would not get any
applause anywhere.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:16.690
The minute I stepped onstage it
was all boos and foul language

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.690
and profanities.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.420
Four years.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.560
JAMES TAO: And it wasn't
because of what you did.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.530
It was because of your
background and who you were.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.322
NICHOLAS TSE: Sure.

00:33:25.322 --> 00:33:25.900
Sure.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.560
And it was really, really
tough for four years.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.170
Every time I walked
off stage I would

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.110
see my managers and my team.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.520
They would be just--

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.450
they would be all holding
their fist and just crying.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:45.160
And I would be the only one that
could walk back to the changing

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.360
room and cool myself down.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.640
But I would have to endure that
for every day for four years.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.890
JAMES TAO: And you kept going.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.850
NICHOLAS TSE: Because back
then we had so much promotion

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:01.720
to do, all the performances.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.220
Back then it was
work after work.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.440
And because there
was no internet yet.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.000
So everything was live.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.949
Every day was live.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:13.280
Every time before
I walked on stage,

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.940
I would almost get
paranoid about being booed.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.400
Because it got to
an extent where

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.670
I could not hear one word
of the song I was singing.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:26.730
It was getting that nasty.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:31.397
Then somewhere in year
2000, it turned around.

00:34:31.397 --> 00:34:32.980
JAMES TAO: What was
the turning point?

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.760
NICHOLAS TSE: I don't know, man.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.949
JAMES TAO: You don't know.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:39.980
NICHOLAS TSE: Maybe, maybe there
was some new kid to pick on.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.015
Or maybe they just got
tired of all the hating.

00:34:43.015 --> 00:34:44.265
JAMES TAO: Or maybe they saw--

00:34:44.265 --> 00:34:48.056
NICHOLAS TSE: Or maybe there
was enough buildings jumped.

00:34:48.056 --> 00:34:48.889
But what I mean is--

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:51.400
JAMES TAO: You didn't jump
the convention in 2000.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.525
NICHOLAS TSE: No, I didn't.

00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:54.460
I jumped it in a 2003
or somewhere like that

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.909
with Mr. Jackie Chan.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.220
But yeah.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.070
When there is that
need, you just

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.290
have to find your way to excel.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:08.170
Maybe there are some crazy
things that we've got to do.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.420
JAMES TAO: Thank you for that.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.025
Any live questions?

00:35:12.025 --> 00:35:13.650
AUDIENCE: So during
the first few years

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:17.370
when things were really tough,
did you ever doubt yourself

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.470
and think that you just
weren't good enough?

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.080
And if you did,
what kept you going?

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.390
NICHOLAS TSE: I did.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.790
But maybe for a very short time.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.570
I never doubted myself
in terms of music.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.420
I never doubted myself in
terms of all the hard work

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.270
I was putting in.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.640
I believe in--

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.330
I think I'm a logical person.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.870
And I think anybody
can accomplish anything

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:45.980
if you work hard enough.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.010
Really, I don't think
there was a time where

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:57.040
I think I could have given up.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.730
I would just-- I'm the
person that does not give up.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.130
Naturally, I just have
that kind of personality.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:07.300
And the second thing
is, I can't give up,

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.500
because I had to make a living.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.690
A lot of people would
imagine that because I

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:17.920
came from a family of two
actors and actresses--

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.620
an actress-- that I don't
take my job seriously.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:29.620
But I've been self-sustained
ever since my debut.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:39.030
At the age of 20 I'd been
paying my sister's education.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.180
So that's behind
the scenes stories.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.820
But I could not afford to
give up my job back then.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.400
So I took everything more
seriously than anybody

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.460
would have ever thought.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:57.450
JAMES TAO: I have
a question online.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:01.725
Do you think though you've been
in, like I said, over 50 films.

00:37:01.725 --> 00:37:03.100
NICHOLAS TSE: I
didn't know that.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.852
JAMES TAO: Yeah.

00:37:03.852 --> 00:37:04.560
I looked that up.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.320
What's your outlook on the
genre of [SPEAKING CHINESE]??

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.570
Do you think there's a future?

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.390
What do you think the
future looks like?

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.670
NICHOLAS TSE: Back to
the creativity thing.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.020
I think we are--

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.130
Hong Kong right now is-- we
are really lacking this part.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:28.380
I think we have been
geniuses in the stock market.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:33.440
We are excellent in
the real estate market.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.170
But maybe that's
the last generation,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:36.840
the past generations.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.310
To get by in this
generation we've

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:42.690
got to be really creative
in our own fields.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.490
Like in movies.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.630
If you're talking about
the movie industry.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.760
I think we've all had our
fair shares of the Marvel DC

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.910
franchises where we've all seen
our Supermans, our Batmans,

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:57.480
our Ironmans, our Hulks, our
Flashes, our Wonder Womans,

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.260
our--

00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.470
I can go on and on.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.300
And we have all seen them.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.610
The thing is, don't
we have 5,000 years

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.590
of history and culture?

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.750
But yet we are still
shooting the monkey king.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.780
Right?

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.366
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.410
Right?

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.300
So I urge any of
you guys out there,

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.630
if you guys ever fantasize
about our own superheroes,

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:34.230
please jot down something.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.460
Write a paragraph or two.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:40.260
Send them to me or to
whoever that you think

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.710
can make something happen.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.380
Because we have to.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.540
If we don't, we're going to be
really, really behind really,

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.670
really far.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.760
JAMES TAO: Send in
your movie idea to me.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.700
I'll pass them along.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.200
Yeah.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.930
The next live question.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.850
AUDIENCE: The
question I want to ask

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:04.170
is, can you share with us
one of the failure story,

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.530
or the moment you doubt
yourself-- is a good decision

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.780
to kick off this
"Chef Nic" show?

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.600
And then if that is
yes, how you overcome?

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.540
How you self-motivate
yourself and then

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.870
bring back your passion.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:17.880
Thank you.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.880
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.780
Failures.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.300
Wow.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.680
Many failures, really.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.400
But I think in
business I would say

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.190
one of the more obvious
ones were I invested

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.280
in a company that
did a post-production

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.910
at the age of 22, 23.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.560
That was 2003.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.380
I started a post company--

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.380
post-production company.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.780
And we would do
computer graphics.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.863
We would do color grading.

00:39:43.863 --> 00:39:45.400
We would do editing.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.600
Dubbing for a lot of commercials
and films and stuff like that.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.670
Right?

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:57.050
So when you're in that kind
of a hardware tech company,

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.670
you buy a lot of stuff.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.960
You buy a lot of--

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.960
we call [INAUDIBLE],, editors,
and mics, and this and that.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:11.850
But back then we were at
the end of the analog trend.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.060
And all of a sudden
things changed.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.170
They don't use tapes anymore.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:22.340
They went from
analog to digital.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.440
But all my hardware,
they were a lot of money.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.910
So all those all of a
sudden went into the can.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.460
And that's-- to the well
where I was just saying,

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.950
if you can catch the trend,
that's a different story.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.020
I didn't back then.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.900
And I lost I lost a
lot of money back then.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.820
I had to mortgage my
house and all that.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.633
But that was on me.

00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:49.050
You know, everything
just changed.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:56.060
But do I-- at that
time it was hard.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:00.530
But I still believed in the
network that I had built,

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.420
all the connections, and
the work we were doing.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.280
And then at the end we were OK.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.450
But there were a few years
that was really, really tough.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:12.000
But as long as-- you
have to stick with it.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.340
I mean, a lot of stuff I do,
it doesn't reflect right away.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.830
Most of the stuff doesn't
reflect right away.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.310
The "Chef Nic" show
didn't reflect right away.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.430
But eventually, eventually.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.520
Like how everybody would
doubt me through my--

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.810
in my culinary journey.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:36.030
But then last month,
or two months just now,

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:39.330
I think maybe a lot of people
had also had the "Chef Nic"

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.630
McDonald burger.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:41.880
JAMES TAO: It was really good.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.950
Thank you.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.920
At that price I think
we did a great job.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.770
And you know, Ashley,
right after this meeting

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.350
I'm going into inventing--
into the Central Kitchen

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.450
to invent the 2019 one again.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:59.610
And we sold within five weeks--
just only in Hong Kong--

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.938
we sold over 2 million burgers.

00:42:01.938 --> 00:42:03.480
And there is only,
let me remind you,

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.370
only 6 point somewhat million
population in Hong Kong.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.240
JAMES TAO: I ate like, five.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.820
So.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.341
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:14.020
I thank you.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.540
But then, yes.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.700
It took five years to
kind of prove yourself.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.730
Just you really have
to stick with it.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.040
JAMES TAO: On the-- just
a quick question also

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.073
online on the McDonald's
collaboration.

00:42:26.073 --> 00:42:27.990
Throughout the whole
process, how many burgers

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.890
did you have to eat?

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.265
NICHOLAS TSE: Man, I ate--

00:42:30.265 --> 00:42:33.330
I ate a lot of burgers.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.222
And there are--

00:42:35.222 --> 00:42:36.840
I ate a lot of burgers.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.320
We also tested a lot of the
fries, a lot of the ice cream,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.910
a lot of drinks.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.530
And yeah.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.750
There were a lot of other
crazy stuff that we tested.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.050
JAMES TAO: What's that
creative process working

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.008
to create a new menu item?

00:42:50.008 --> 00:42:52.050
Or to do something that's
never been done before?

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.257
Like the pork chop.

00:42:53.257 --> 00:42:54.090
NICHOLAS TSE: Right.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.160
That one's so good.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.920
Yes!

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.350
JAMES TAO: So good.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.630
NICHOLAS TSE: That's
part of being creative.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.580
I think that's
something that I really

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.030
enjoy is creating menus or
writing songs and making

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.580
something my own.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:17.730
And when they gave me the
homework to start up something

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:22.530
that has [SPEAKING CHINESE],,
Hong Kong [SPEAKING CHINESE]..

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.990
It actually-- I didn't know how
to translate that, that taste--

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.240
JAMES TAO: Taste of Hong Kong.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.820
Right.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.260
NICHOLAS TSE: I
was thinking how I

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.160
could relate the
taste of my childhood

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.140
to a McDonald's burger.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.060
And there are other
ideas that I'm still

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.500
working on right now, maybe
later in the kitchen today.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.580
Stuff like you know how
Hong Kong people love

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.330
their [SPEAKING CHINESE]?

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:48.830
Right?

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.870
I would always think
that it would probably

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.260
work with a [SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:53.760
Right?

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.590
Because that's almost
the same thing.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.420
But maybe a [SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:03.660
Right.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.160
Exactly.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.510
But then there are ups and
downs we have to overcome.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.917
Like if we do work
on a curry dish,

00:44:12.917 --> 00:44:14.250
then the kids would be left out.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:14.790
Right?

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.460
So it's a long journey.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.720
But I really love it.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.690
These are some of the creative
juices that I have to get out.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.320
JAMES TAO: I can't wait to
see what you have in store.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.320
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.048
Thank you.

00:44:25.048 --> 00:44:26.340
JAMES TAO: Any other questions?

00:44:26.445 --> 00:44:27.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:27.870
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:44:27.948 --> 00:44:28.950
AUDIENCE: And thank
you for being so

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.450
honest with everything you say.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:34.360
I can just feel it that
you're not scripted.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.390
So, thanks, James.

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:42.030
It seems like you have a lot
of wisdom invested in a company

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.510
back when you were 22,
even though it kind of went

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.740
through rough times.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.990
So through all these times,
do you look up to somebody?

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.970
Is somebody your mentor that
has always been since day one?

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.720
Or that has evolved depending
on which part of the industry

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.740
that you're in?

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.980
NICHOLAS TSE: Good
question, actually.

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.150
I don't have that person.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.550
I've always thought
of my mentor as logic.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.770
I've really not gone
to anybody about much

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.400
of this kind of stuff.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.180
Maybe I should.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.200
Really.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.950
But I just don't have
that person in life.

00:45:19.682 --> 00:45:22.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:23.270
NICHOLAS TSE: So yes.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.660
In my company, yes.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.228
That's actually interesting.

00:45:27.228 --> 00:45:28.270
I don't have that person.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.130
JAMES TAO: Are you open
to seeking mentorship?

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.030
Like seeking help
and asking for that?

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:36.570
Or I don't know.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:37.290
Like--

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:40.453 --> 00:45:41.620
JAMES TAO: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:41.890
No.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:42.830
But what I'm saying is--

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.080
NICHOLAS TSE: Did you guys
open like a new department?

00:45:46.315 --> 00:45:49.870
JAMES TAO: Like, I know you
help a lot of young people.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:53.200
But you're also a young
person yourself, right?

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.440
So when you do come across--

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.690
NICHOLAS TSE: Same generation.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:57.607
JAMES TAO: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:57.607 --> 00:45:58.510
Same generation.

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:02.560
When you do come across
difficult decisions and stuff,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.120
do you just solely--

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.773
you're comfortable relying
on yourself and just

00:46:06.773 --> 00:46:07.690
thinking that through?

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.815
That's something I'm actually
really interested in,

00:46:09.815 --> 00:46:14.110
because I'm facing similar kind
of situations for my career.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.520
NICHOLAS TSE: I've
always been able to--

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.650
I've always been able
to gradually work out

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.210
the problems in my life.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.440
So yeah.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.273
I've really not found
that person to go to.

00:46:27.273 --> 00:46:28.940
And then because of
the different fields

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.050
that I work on,
sometimes it's music.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.410
Sometimes it's film.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:34.850
Sometimes it's business.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:37.020
Sometimes it's
kind of a bit tech.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.900
So there's not really
that one person I

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.945
can talk to regarding
all the different fields.

00:46:42.945 --> 00:46:44.570
AUDIENCE: Believe it
or not, some of us

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.820
actually delayed our
[INAUDIBLE] flight so we

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.300
can [INAUDIBLE] your talk.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:48.690
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.220
Thank you.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.630
JAMES TAO: Some people
actually flew in.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.900
NICHOLAS TSE: Really?

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:52.440
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:52.940
Thank you.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.420
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious to
know what are the messages

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.435
or expectation or
impact that you expect

00:46:59.435 --> 00:47:03.330
to bring through your music,
your art, or entire passion to

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.190
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.730
NICHOLAS TSE: Through music,
through movies, of course.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.430
Mainly it's entertainment.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:13.435
And music, I could say,
I hope it brings more--

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.740
I hope my music can also
stimulate or console you

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.250
in your everyday life.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.340
But in terms of
a deeper message,

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.650
we're trying to do that
through the "Chef Nic" show.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:29.580
Because as like what I was
saying about we don't share

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:35.440
correctly or how we are missing
the essence of eating together,

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.895
I really, really learned a
lot through the kitchen--

00:47:38.895 --> 00:47:41.520
the time management
stuff, the sharing part.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.480
It has changed my
personality immensely.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.960
I was a really different person
before I started cooking.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:54.040
And I think especially
in this day and age

00:47:54.040 --> 00:48:04.250
we hope to promote a lot
more activities or wilderness

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.680
wildlife activities,
or stuff that you

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:11.360
could do apart from just looking
at the phone or the computer.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.000
I think that's a very, very
important part of life.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.560
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
more about your film career.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.740
So I just wanted to
know moving forward--

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.680
so first of all, congratulations
on the Best Actor award.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.790
Moving forward for your
future film projects,

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:28.310
are you going to be pursuing
more action-driven movies

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.480
like "Police Story"?

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.575
Or are you going to go for more
controversial or dramatic roles

00:48:33.575 --> 00:48:36.560
that kind of further challenge
your acting abilities?

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.730
NICHOLAS TSE: I don't
really have a preference.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:44.780
I think that I am--

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:51.570
sometimes you need a bit of
luck when you're given a script.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.100
The cast has got to be right.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.018
The story has to be right.

00:48:55.018 --> 00:48:56.310
The whole crew has to be right.

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:58.110
The timing has to be right.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:00.070
We always say that in
the movie industry.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:03.870
Each movie has its
own journey, really.

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.280
All you could do is do your
best when it is handed to you.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.500
But I do think there
is one that I'm

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.420
planning on in a few months.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.700
It is action packed.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:21.210
I do think Hong Kong has to find
its roots some way, somehow.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:25.170
And to me, Hong Kong movie
is about Hong Kong action.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:29.190
It has never really been
about Hong Kong drama.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:33.350
So it's going to be tough.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.290
But I think, yes,
I'm going to have

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.860
to dig down and fight again.

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.990
And maybe jump off
some buildings.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:43.480
AUDIENCE: I think many of
us are big fans of yours--

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.480
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.920
AUDIENCE: --here in
the room and on video.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.420
And you started the talk
with your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.240
So I was just wondering
reflecting back

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.450
on your life path, what are
some of the key words that

00:49:55.450 --> 00:50:01.080
define your character, who you
are today that made you to be

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.160
a successful life,
successful career,

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.100
and maybe just share some
words of wisdom with us.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:06.640
Thank you.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.780
NICHOLAS TSE: Key words
would be creativity.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.920
Key words would be--

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.480
would be tenacity.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.890
Key words would be
synergy, actually.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.850
Resourcefulness.

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:26.500
But different key words come
at different times, really.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.000
And to me, if I
was to be greedy,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.290
I would say every
word is a key word.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:35.100
Yeah.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.420
JAMES TAO: Cool.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.710
So before we wrap up, just one
question from somebody watching

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:42.120
from the States, actually.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.290
NICHOLAS TSE: Wow.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.980
What time is it over there?

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.140
JAMES TAO: It is late.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.280
So basically, they said,
at our headquarters

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.200
we have a program
called Kitchen Sink.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.770
And there are chefs
that come all the time

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.650
to teach how to cook.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:01.350
And if you're ever in
the area, would that

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.381
be something you would
be interested in hosting?

00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:04.173
NICHOLAS TSE: Cool.

00:51:04.173 --> 00:51:06.090
Cool.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:10.620
Hey, speaking of which,
I think tech-wise,

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:13.842
right now I'm having problems
with working on the VR goggle.

00:51:13.842 --> 00:51:15.300
Like, when you're
teaching cooking,

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.040
the problem is the depth.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.670
You can't lean into the pot
and see what's in there.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:24.660
If you guys crack that
problem, please tell me.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.860
Yeah?

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.740
JAMES TAO: Oh, we can--
we can work together

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.120
and see what we can do.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.870
NICHOLAS TSE: Seriously,
because I'm still

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:34.170
the Asia-Pacific marketing
director for the digital domain

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.670
company in LA.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:41.250
And we're still doing on the
post-production for "Avengers,"

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:42.610
for all those series.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:46.050
So if you guys ever come up
with that kind of tech, tell me,

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:46.698
please.

00:51:46.698 --> 00:51:47.490
JAMES TAO: Awesome.

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:52.210
So that brings us to the
end of our Talks at Google.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.640
Thank you everybody for coming.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.080
Thank you, Nick, for taking your
precious time to share with us.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.080
NICHOLAS TSE: Thank you.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.430
[APPLAUSE]
