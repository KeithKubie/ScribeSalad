Armstrong:
OVER THE PAST 2,000 YEARS,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.876
THE PANTHEON HAS BEEN
A PAGAN TEMPLE, A CHURCH,

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:13.679
AND THEN A TOMB
FOR ITALIAN KINGS.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.817
THE BUILDING WE SEE TODAY
WAS COMPLETED IN 126 A.D.

00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:20.686
WHEN ROME RULED AN EMPIRE

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.490
THAT STRETCHED FROM
PORTUGAL TO PERSIA,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.725
FROM SCOTLAND TO THE SAHARA.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.762
[ WOMAN SINGING OPERA ]

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.898
I'M EXPLORING
THIS REMARKABLE BUILDING

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:37.270
WITH ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIAN
PROFESSOR ETTORE MAZZOLA.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.847 align:start position:0%
THERE IS JUST SOMETHING
INCREDIBLE ABOUT IT,

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.849
ISN'T THERE?
-FANTASTIC.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.151
THE INTERIOR IS A VAST CYLINDER,

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:55.655
BUT ITS CROWNING GLORY
IS THE DOME.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:02.828 align:start position:0%
THIS IS STILL TODAY THE LARGEST
UNREINFORCED CONCRETE DOME

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.064 size:81% position:41%
EVER BUILT ON THIS PLANET.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.298 size:63% position:31%
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
A BUILDING

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.568 size:63% position:31%
WHICH IS 43.3 METERS
IN DIAMETER.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.370 align:end position:100%
I MEAN, THAT'S --
FOR US IN ENGLAND,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.072 align:end position:100%
WE ALWAYS THINK OF ST. PAUL'S
WITH THIS AMAZING DOME,

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.406 size:84% position:58%
BUT THIS DWARFS ST. PAUL'S.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:15.942 align:start size:91% position:9%
THIS IS BIGGER,

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.912 size:88% position:44%
AND IT'S POSSIBLE
ONLY BECAUSE OF THE MATERIAL

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.881 align:start size:94% position:6%
AND THE TECHNIQUE
USED TO BUILD IT.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:25.518
WITHOUT STEEL TO REINFORCE
THE CONCRETE FROM WITHIN,

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:29.722
SURELY THIS DOME SHOULD COLLAPSE
UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
SO, THEY DEVELOPED A SYSTEM
OF LOAD-BEARING ARCHES

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.360 size:72% position:36%
THAT WERE CONCENTRATING
ALL THE FORCES

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.795 size:75% position:38%
WITHIN THESE
EIGHT HUMONGOUS PILLARS.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.598 size:84% position:42%
AND YOU HAVE LOAD-SPREADING
ARCHES

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.033 size:69% position:34%
THAT ARE CONCENTRATING
ALL THE FORCES

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.902 size:88% position:44%
VERTICALLY INTO THE PILLARS.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:48.174
BUT WHAT ALSO ENSURES
THESE WALLS CAN BEAR THE LOAD

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:52.144
WITHOUT BUTTRESSES IS THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE DOME ITSELF.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:54.246
EACH OF ITS LAYERS IS MADE

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.716
WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
MIX OF CONCRETE.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:02:01.787 align:start position:0%
BASICALLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL
LAYERS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS --

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.857 size:69% position:34%
DIFFERENT MATERIALS
WITH DIFFERENT WEIGHT.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.694
IN THIS MODEL, YOU CAN SEE HOW,
STEP BY STEP,

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.196 align:start position:0%
THE VAULT IS GROWING.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:15.067 size:78% position:39%
SO THE FIRST PART
IS MADE OF ROMAN CONCRETE

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:20.005 align:start position:0%
THAT HAS INSIDE FRAGMENTS OF
TRAVERTINE STONE AND TUFA STONE,

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.840 size:66% position:33%
WHICH ARE HEAVY
AND VERY COMPACT.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.278 align:start position:0%
AND STEP BY STEP, THESE
MATERIALS ARE GETTING LIGHTER,

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:28.314 align:start position:0%
AND THEN AT THE VERY END,
THERE IS ONLY THE PUMICE STONE

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.115 size:69% position:34%
WHICH IS
CLOSING THE STRUCTURE.

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:32.852 align:end position:100%
SO THEY'RE CHANGING THE ACTUAL
MATERIAL THEY'RE USING

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:36.021 align:end position:100%
AS THEY GO UP, MAKING IT LIGHTER
AND LIGHTER AS THEY GO UP.

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:38.057 size:78% position:39%
EXACTLY.
AND THEN AT THE VERY TOP,

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:42.862 align:start position:0%
THERE IS THIS BIG HOLE
WHICH IS 9 METERS IN DIAMETER,

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:46.031
WHICH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE
ALL THE FORCES, STEP BY STEP,

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.735 size:78% position:39%
ARE GOING DOWN VERTICALLY
INTO THE PILLARS.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:53.172 size:72% position:64%
IT'S A CONSTANT PERFECT
BALANCE OF FORCES

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:56.442 align:end position:100%
THAT KEEPS THIS STRUCTURE
STANDING AS IT DOES.
