&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.690
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
I'm Carolyn Rupkafian,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.490
and I am delighted to be
interviewing Onnik Dinkjian

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.530
and his son, Ara Dinkjian.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.920
And Onnik, I wondered
if we could start

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.170
by you telling us a little
bit about your childhood.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.440
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Well, a
little bit about my childhood;

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.050
obviously, I was born in
France, Armenian parents,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.610
and speaking Dinkjian
Agladikca's parents

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.510
from Dikranagerd.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.650
So, that makes me a bonafide
Dinkjian Agladikca, per se.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.420
I was raised in France,
in Paris; young,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.950
at a very young age,
I lost my father

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.090
when I was not quite
one year old.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.060
They had, of course, immigrated
from Diyabakir, Turkey,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.060
to France, and when
I was about 5 1/2,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.110
not quite 6 years
old, I lost my mother.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.520
Her name was Zora.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.210
As a matter of fact, one of
the songs that we made tonight

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.390
that was, I dedicated
that song to her,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.690
which I wrote the lyrics.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.220
But that's not what it is.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.380
When I lost my mother,
then I was then raised

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.750
by my godfather and godmother.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.230
In the Armenian tradition,
the godfather

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.770
and godmother take
over the child.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.840
That was the rule, the Armenian
rule, religious rules and,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.090
sure enough, the fact that they
didn't have any children either,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.580
it made it like a
perfect occasion --

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.280
occasion might not be the
word -- but from that time on,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.260
I was raised with the Dinkjian,
and that's where my name is.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.160
Originally, from
my real parents,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.660
my name was Milleon
[phonetic], Mille yon.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:34.770
Grew up with them until 1946
when we came to America,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.660
right after the Second
World War.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.120
Very quickly, I started being
interested in singing, it seems.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.500
Going to Armenian school,
Armenian school on Thursdays

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.680
because in France, we did not
have French school on Thursdays,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.280
like we don't have it here
on Saturdays here in America.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.070
So, naturally, I had to
go to Armenian school;

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.980
that was the rule of the house,
and in the Armenian school,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.840
besides learning how to read,
write, and speak, and so on

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.520
and so forth, music was
also part of the thing.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.970
You had to learn how to sing,
and I loved that part much more

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.840
than I loved anything else.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.970
So, I would come home and kind
of repeat what I had learned,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.810
and that made the beginning
of my parents, the Dinkjian,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.460
[inaudible] and only
the Dinkjian sending me

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:46.860
to Armenian Church to be part
of the choir, if you will.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.450
But at that time, being I
was maybe 7 or 8 years old,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.240
all I could do was just go and,
according to the choir masters,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.910
you had to just listen.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.020
It was very serious.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.690
So, for about two
years, regardless,

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.860
I would take two subways.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.100
I liked the sound of the
Armenian choir in that church

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.920
so much that I couldn't
wait for Sunday morning

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.610
to take two subways
to go and just sit

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.280
and watch the conductor,
the director.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.130
And after he saw that I was
interested, two years later,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.380
then I became then
Cusholds [phonetic],

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.840
meaning on the altar
they give you this,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.380
we all know in Armenian, I don't
know how to say it in English,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.430
but anyway, to follow the choir,
you used to use that sound

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.760
of the thing, and I thought that
I was already the biggest singer

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.800
in the world without
even singing at all.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.190
But I was part of what was
the music and, lo and behold,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.300
Komatsumatsu [phonetic],
because I was interested,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.090
the choir master would give
me a little two-line solo,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.390
if you will, once in a while.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.170
Like before he would do that,
he would point that it's coming,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.880
you know, pointing to me.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.310
I would get all kinds of aches,
all kinds of things that, oh,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.620
I'm going to do this two
lines, and I would be scared,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.560
but I would do it all right,
and he would point out, okay,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.030
you know, you did it [phonetic].

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.950
That continued on, and that's
why I continued on singing

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.050
until we came to America.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.090
That's another story after that.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.390
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
Well, keep going.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.620
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: I hope I'm
not talking, I hope I'm --

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.650
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
No, that's what we want.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.950
Please, keep keep going.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.870
&gt;&gt; Well, then, coming
to America, of course,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.070
the first thing you do, the
first thing we did is to find

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.210
where the closest
Armenian church was

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.430
because I would not do
anything on Sundays except going

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.520
to church; not because
of religious thing,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.640
not because I found God,
or not because of it,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.870
but because I liked the
sound of that choir.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.520
I thought that was beautiful.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.340
So, regardless of where
we were in Jersey City,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.210
as a matter of fact, in New
Jersey, made arrangements

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.070
for my cousins to take me
to church the first time;

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.610
taking the bus, or
whatever it was and so on.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.820
From there on, every
Sunday, I could, again,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.170
could not wait to go to church.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:44.010
By now, I'm a definite
choir member from,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:51.300
and I feel like Pavarotti
because I'm part of a choir.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:00.160
As luck would have it, the choir
master was Dinkjian Agladikca.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.820
Another little story because
the first time when I went

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.590
to that church, and I was
greeted by the choir master,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.490
and he said, "Where
are you from?"

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:23.110
So, the way he asked me
that question, that one word

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.200
that he asked, I
heard right away

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.200
that he was a Dinkjian Agladikca
child, you know, he himself.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.230
So, he says, "Are you
Dinkjian Agladikca?"

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.380
We would normally in Armenian
say, [inaudible], you know,

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.110
but the fact that I was grown
up by Dinkjian Agladikca family,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.690
I didn't say, [inaudible];
I said, "Ha," meaning yes,

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.930
and that ha made the
bond with me being one

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.240
of the singers in that church.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.680
And of course, after singing
a little here, a little there,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.610
one thing led to another.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:10.140
It was some kind of a Ladies
Auxiliary or a tea party

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:19.400
or something, they would say,
"Oh, if that boy could come

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.690
and sing," you know, "it
would be nice," and so on

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.790
and so forth, and I knew a few,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.120
quite a few Armenian
songs from France already.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.640
So, I repeated that, and
that started, if you will,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.410
one thing led to
another and so on,

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:43.660
and I started singing pretty
much here and there, weddings

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.660
and dances and what
have you, and walla!

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.770
And after that, it's
history, I guess;

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.140
I don't know what else to say.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.010
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: So,
from the Ladies' Guild,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.270
the Women's Guild at the church,

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.140
you were singing
these folk songs.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.440
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Yes.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.740
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Were
you singing by yourself?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.040
Did you have --

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.890
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Yes, at the
very beginning, just by myself;

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.200
no accompaniment, no nothing.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.470
And I realized that, by now,
I'm listening to the radio,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.380
and we're talking 1946,
you know, and it's new,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.170
and I figured, oh,
I like that piano.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.140
Maybe I should, and I really
don't remember how it started,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:32.140
but there was an oud player,
a lute player in New Jersey,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.520
and somehow, again, from
Dinkjian Agladikca's family

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.330
because in Union City at
that time the only Armenians

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.530
that lived in Union City
were somehow their parents

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.120
and grandparents were from
the Diyabakir [phonetic],

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.430
meaning Dikranagerd,
and so was my family,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.830
and it became very natural.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.600
I was very comfortable
with these people,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.000
and this particular
guy was playing; so,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.630
this one time we got together,
and I thought I liked it,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.790
and before you know, we
added maybe a clarinet;

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:11.190
before you know, at that time,
there was no guitars, you know.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.070
So, it was really a clarinet
and oud, and that progressed

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.050
into some other things.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.270
I don't know any
more, but I think --

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.570
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
so, you started playing

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.840
at maybe picnics and dances?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.140
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Yeah.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.510
Yes, of course, at picnics.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:38.310
One little thing I remember very
well that made me very proud is

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:44.790
that in Union City in
1948, or was it 1940;

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:53.180
I think it was 1948, there was
a hall called the Armenian Hall.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.300
It was a place where all the
Armenians would throw dances,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.510
would throw [inaudible] and
dinners and what have you,

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.160
and they had a mortgage,
naturally,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.150
and they were paying
every month,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.450
and this particular time
there was a big get-together,

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.890
and they were going
to burn the mortgage.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.620
I don't know how
much that was left,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.510
but even though we had
just came from France, we,

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:30.370
my parents decided we should
all go and contribute as little

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.780
as we can because we had just
started to work, you know,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.740
coming to America, new
language, new country.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:42.980
So, we went, my sister and
I and my father and, by now,

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.160
it's obviously my
father and mother.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.110
We went, and we sat among
a couple of hundred people,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:55.680
and they started
asking for money

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.990
in order to burn the mortgage.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.100
And there was this one
gentleman; his name was Turpin,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.440
Turpin Geon [phonetic],
short for Turpin.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.740
He was a businessman.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.620
He was pretty successful
at that time.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.490
Somehow, he had probably heard

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.680
that I was singing here
and there and so on.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.590
Among the -- without knowing my
name, and we were sitting in,

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:26.470
we're pretty much in the back
of the thing, of the Hall,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:32.970
and he pointed out when it
came for him to give a donation

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.370
and what have you, he pointed
to our table, and he said,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:42.110
"If that young boy," by
now, I'm 17 or 18 years old;

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.600
"if that young boy will
sing a song or two,"

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:53.230
or whatever it was, "I will burn
the mortgage," meaning he'll pay

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.150
for the rest of the mortgage.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.540
My father, sitting next
to me, gave me a big thing

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.170
on the side and said, "Get up!"

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.060
you know, elite [phonetic],
you know.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.580
By now, I swear to you,
I'm almost dying inside

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.510
because I was the only
one pointing in that area,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.210
and especially when my
father says, "Get up!"

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.790
you know. So, but you know,
whether I wanted or not,

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.810
you listen to your
father; that's number one.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.200
And so, I got up, and I sang.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.440
Whatever I sang, that day was
one of the big day in my life

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:37.670
because he wrote a check for
the remaining of the mortgage.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.730
Whether it was a smaller amount
left or a large amount left,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:46.130
but they gave him the
biggest standing ovation

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.910
when he paid for that.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:53.700
And of course, I was so elated
that, you see, because you sang,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.610
we paid for the Armenian Hall.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.270
That was one of the
nice, big day in my life.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.580
I think that's enough
for me to tell you about.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.950
I took enough of your time.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.250
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: No.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.580
Of course, we want to
hear a little bit more.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.590
I heard that you played at
the New York World's Fair.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:12.890
Tell us about that.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.190
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian:
Oh, my goodness!

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.100
Yeah. Well, that's
another thing.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.950
But that wasn't just I.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.410
It was part of our whole
group, and we were --

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.140
I was very fortunate
to be part of that.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.510
In the New York World's
Fair, not only I,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.400
but at that time my son
Ara, being a young boy,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.810
he also was part of it,

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.930
and at that time he
wasn't playing the oud,

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.690
but he played the
drummy [phonetic] from,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.300
the dunbaggie [phonetic]
from that thing.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:46.370
And we did a pretty nice job
at the New York World Fair.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.250
That's correct, yes.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.550
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
Tell me more

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.950
about the folk music
that you sing.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:58.380
Is it something that you,
you said you heard some

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.780
of it growing up, but I also
think that you've added some

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.690
of your own lyrics,
and different decades,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.000
I think you've had different
styles in your music.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.300
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Yeah.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:17.920
Yeah. Yeah, I do, as I said,
I grew up in Paris, France,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.140
from Dinkjian Agladikca parents,
both sides, from my real parents

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.010
and my adopted parents.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:31.200
It seems that at one time
all our friends, friends,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.980
all our people that
were visiting us,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.880
or if we were visiting, they
were all Dinkjian Agladikca's,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.720
and at one time I thought
that all Armenians, you know,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.790
because we didn't not, not so
much associate, but the fact

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.840
that they all came,
and you always,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.870
you get together, it seems.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.980
I thought that everyone
was Dinkjian Agladikca.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.670
Now, having said that, when
we used to have company,

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:05.370
[inaudible] you know, after
the greetings, the coffee,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.680
and whatever it was, they
used to start singing,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.110
they themselves, our
parents and their friends.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:19.030
And the fact that I loved
hearing music, my job also,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.370
part of it, we had a
phonograph thing that my job was

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.830
to wind the thing, you know.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:32.240
So, music was there, and all
the songs that they sang were

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.540
from the Diyabakir [phonetic].

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.110
Naturally, some of them
just came about 15, 20,

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.160
or 30 years ago, so
it was new to them.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.530
All those songs that I used
to, that I, many of the songs

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:50.640
that I'm either doing now or
fixing them now and so on,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.960
where the root came
from that time.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.140
And they each, each one
of them had a story;

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.600
each song had a story.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:06.600
It was something about
maybe a wedding, how do you,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.900
how did the people
prepare to go to a wedding,

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:17.030
or especially the
[inaudible], the bath house.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:23.770
In the old country, you used to
go, according to what I hear,

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.220
once a week to a bath house.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.190
In Turkish, the name
would have been hamam.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.970
That was the name
of the bath house,

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:39.720
and there was always stories
about the bath house; some,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.950
funny; some, folklore,
and what have you.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.610
And as a matter of fact, on
one of them, which I copied,

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:56.430
and I arranged the lyrics
to fix the music, was,

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:03.580
if I'm not mistaken, Ara, we
did that one song tonight;

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:09.150
the story about going
to the bath house.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.610
Says like, oh, today is
Saturday; it's time to go

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.990
to the bath house, and
you go to the bath house

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.950
with a futa [phonetic],
something you put around you.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.480
But I must say that the
bath house was a big,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.680
big enormous room,
and every five feet

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.140
or six feet there would
be some kind of a sink

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.910
which you would open
cold and hot water,

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:40.350
and on the bench you would
sit in front of that and bath

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.110
with some kind of a press,
you know, you put water.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:52.120
And I would go with, on
Saturdays, they would go

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.670
until 6 o'clock, the ladies, and
after that the men used to go.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.380
I used to hear that.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.460
So, I arranged it, of course,
the first time when I went

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.520
with my mother and the fact that
I was, I have always been short,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.860
and I was obviously, what,
7, 8 years old, I still went

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.310
with my mother, if
you will, you know.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:23.830
So, after the bath, I would come
home, and then the men would go.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.230
Before the men went, my father
would say, "[Inaudible], my son,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.370
come, come here, I have
a question to ask you."

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.250
So, I [inaudible], you
know, yes, what is it?

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:42.500
He would say, "Did you see
any little birds there?"

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.410
I said, "Bubba, there's no
birds in the bath house.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.470
Everything is, you know."

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.680
So, and this is a true
story, I want you to know,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.120
and it is in the
lyrics in my song.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.480
I would say, "No, Bubba,
everything is closed there.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.780
It's indoor.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.290
There's no, there's no birds."

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.570
He said, "[Inaudible] my son,
[inaudible], don't look up,

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.770
look down a little bit."

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:15.890
I know you guys are laughing,
but this is, this is true story.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.290
And of course, my mother
then right there would say,

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.440
"[Inaudible], don't say
things like that to;

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.370
he's a young boy, you know."

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.350
"Oh, he's going to grow.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.670
He's going to know
this kind of thing."

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.970
I think I loved it so much that
years later, and I'm talking

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.930
about 40, 50 years later,
when I was doing a CD

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.780
of Dinkjian again,
that came to my mind,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:51.180
and I arranged the lyrics to
fit that story, and that's one

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.380
of the things where I
said, don't look up;

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.540
look down for the
little bird, of course.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.830
And I keep on saying that my
mother said, "Close your eyes.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.950
Don't look there.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.250
[Inaudible], you
know, it's a shame.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.550
You shouldn't look there."

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.170
And then, "from now
on, you're coming

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.650
to this bath with your father."

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.240
That's all in the lyrics.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.540
But that's part of
Diyabakir [phonetic].

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:24.860
This is what our ancestors came
from, and it was very normal.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.000
That's not something unusual.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.510
That was part of it which we act
right by putting it on the a CD

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.340
like this to keep forever

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:40.410
because after I think my
generation there aren't too many

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:48.080
that are left with the
interest of the old dialect.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:53.100
We assimilate too fast and
too easy in a free country

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.620
like we are, and thank
the Lord we are here.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:02.060
But I feel that I'm, yes, I'm
one of the ones that tried

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:08.600
to keep as much as possible
the dialect, and this will stay

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:16.180
in the Congress, in the
files here, which I'm,

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.710
I guess I'm pretty happy
and, okay, I take --

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.140
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Sing
us one line of the language

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.900
so we can hear the
Dinkjian Agladikca words.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.960
Can you say something
or sing a line?

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.080
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian:
I couldn't sing it.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.460
I would maybe say a few things
with the Dinkjian accent,

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.300
you know, more than
singing, you know.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.100
For instance,

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.280
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.100
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: It's
completely different from,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.400
I won't say, pure Armenian
because, for instance,

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.340
I just said [inaudible].

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.230
In Armenian, we would
say, oh, [inaudible].

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.360
It's completely, [inaudible].

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.160
Oh, [inaudible], you know.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:24.400
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.090
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: That's all
Dinkjian Agladikca proper.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.410
If you are not, you probably
will not understand it as much.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.710
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Yeah.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.010
I only understood
a couple of words.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.310
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: A
couple of words, right.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.990
But to us, it's the
normal saying, you know.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.290
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Thank you.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.590
It's great.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.950
Well, I'm going to come back to
you, but Ara, I want to ask you

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.390
about growing up with
your father and music

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.050
in the household, and
you must have heard music

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.020
from the time you
were born, of course,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:02.430
and how did you come
to follow in music?

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.730
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Yeah.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.070
Before I answer your question,
I just need to get a couple

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.150
of things on the record.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.450
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Sure.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.670
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Based on what
my father has already told you,

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:17.220
first of all, his father's name
was Garabet Milleon [phonetic].

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:23.320
The choir master in France
was Nishon Sequoin [phonetic],

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.390
who was originally
from Istanbul,

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.810
and the choir master is Dinkjian
Agladikca, blood brother

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.800
that he met at 27th
Street Cathedral

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.390
in New York was Arman
Babajanyan [phonetic].

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.990
These are three very important
men in my father's life story.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.720
I just wanted to
get that out there.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.020
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Yeah.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.530
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: And just
to continue the thought,

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.210
my father is the most
important man in my life.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:56.020
Just as you described, I
grew up in a musical family.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:02.750
Music was just part of life,
and it was church on Sunday,

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.740
and it was weddings, dances,
and picnics on Saturday,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.860
and during the week, when they
would have their friends over,

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.350
it was members of
not only the choir,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.860
but they had back then
choruses, Armenian choruses,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.570
that they volunteered, went
to rehearsals every week

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.810
and gave annual concerts.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.430
And they didn't use
babysitters back then,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:31.740
so they would take my sister
and I to these rehearsals and,

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.820
without realizing
it, we were hearing

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:40.110
and learning the foundation of
Armenian folk and liturgical

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.590
and classical music just
because we were around them,

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.280
and they were at
these rehearsals.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.950
So, yeah, how lucky am
I, you know, to have him.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.170
I mean, they never forced
it on me, but like him,

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.470
I was just drawn to it.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.360
I don't think he chose it;
I don't think I chose it.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.230
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Mm-hmm.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.320
Did I hear once a story
that you learned more

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.210
about your birth
parents and music?

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:11.160
Was your mother a singer?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.110
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: It's
actually an astonishing story,

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.710
and I thank you for
asking about it.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:20.400
As my father told
you, his father,

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.900
his biological father
died when he was one,

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.960
so he has no memory
of him whatsoever.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:34.000
We have one picture
of Garavet Milleon.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.520
He remembers almost nothing
about his mother other

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.440
than she would sing lullabies
to him for him to fall asleep.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:49.490
And indeed, the first song that
he sang, he wrote of that memory

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.680
of my mother singing lullabies
to me for me to sleep.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.970
That's all he remembers
of his mother.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.740
So, as anybody would feel,
any bit of information

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.430
about your ancestors, especially
somebody as close as your mother

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.390
or father, would be precious,
even if it was, well,

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:11.450
your father wore a hat on an
angle, or your mother walked

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.110
like this, or any bit

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.780
of information would
be precious to us.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.080
We were doing a concert
in France.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.650
I was about 20 years old, so
he was maybe 35 or something

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:27.980
like that, and an old lady
came up to my father and said,

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.460
"I knew your biological parents.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.940
They were my friends."

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.260
And we were like shocked.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.140
And she said, "Would you like
to come over for breakfast,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.360
and I'll tell you
whatever I remember?"

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.440
Well, we canceled anything

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.670
that we had the next
day, and we went there.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:50.970
And as is often the case,
I'm kind of stepping back

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.020
because this is a big
moment for my father,

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.960
but I'm getting to witness this.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.110
And she said to my father,
"Oh, your mother, Zora,

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.970
had a beautiful voice.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.970
You had no money.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.030
Actually, the shack
they were living in,

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.660
if I'm not mistaken,
had dirt floor."

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.350
So, when we say poor,
the true meaning of poor.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.590
But her friends and
neighbors would come

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:17.990
over and say, "Just sing.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.680
We'll make the coffee.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.640
You just sing."

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.420
So, those songs are the thing

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.930
in my father's head
and in his memory.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:33.540
So, that confirmed his
memory of his mother.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.350
It solidified his memory.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.970
Then, she said to him, "And
your father played the Oud."

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.360
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Okay.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.660
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Sorry.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.050
You know, I'm, sorry,
I'm born in America.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:57.090
I'm raised on the Beetles;
why am I playing the Oud?

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.490
It's not going to get
you girls or money.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.170
I didn't know why.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:10.450
But that moment --
I'm so sorry --

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:17.250
it taught me that your identity,
your ancestors are in you.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.780
It doesn't matter
where you're born.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.450
If you follow what you feel,
there's a truth to that.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:27.930
I may have lived and died
and never known that bit

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:33.500
of information, but it
solidified what I was feeling,

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.180
and this is the lesson that
I've tried to teach my kids,

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.620
don't question; if you
like that food or you think

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.310
that girls I pretty, or you
want to do this for a living

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.940
because it's what you feel,
you have to trust that.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.620
And that dear old lady
gave me the gift of my life

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:57.630
because I never stopped
after that.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.930
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
That's amazing.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:05.280
You must remember that time too?

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.110
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Yes.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.850
Yes. I can't add much
more to this right now,

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.890
but that's a true story.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.210
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Yeah.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:21.890
You've also been to Dikranagerd
in more recent years.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:26.580
Tell us a little bit more about
that, about playing or singing

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.960
or just meeting people.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.730
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian:
I'm sure Ara will,

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.970
will explain it much
more, but better than me.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.390
Go ahead, Ara.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:45.360
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Well,
here's the story.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.720
My dad makes -- I need
a tissue; I'm sorry.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.220
If anybody has a tissue.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.520
I'm sorry.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.150
Oh, you have something, dad?

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.880
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: I do.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.180
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Thank you.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.640
I got it. Thank you.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.960
Thank you.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.340
Okay. Okay.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.370
So, my dad makes
recordings here,

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.960
and the amazing thing is you
have no idea what happens

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:21.330
with those recordings, how far
they travel, who they reach.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.060
We're making recordings
in New Jersey.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.120
There's no distribution.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.420
There's no big record companies.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.290
We're making them on our own.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.820
Those recordings, and then the
cassette copy, and then a copy

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.330
of a copy, it goes
all over the world.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:46.230
And it went as far as Turkey,
and they discovered like a,

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:51.160
what they thought was
an extinct dinosaur;

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.590
there is Armenian
Dikranagerd dialect songs

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.800
that are still being performed.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.710
They had no idea about
that, and I'm talking

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.650
about the Armenian
community as well

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.640
as the Turks and Kurds there.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.000
And there was a cassette
that they have;

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.500
they have told us this, that
it just said, the Arabacue;

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.490
they wrote on it because
they heard the music,

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.720
and that's how they
identified it correctly,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.210
not even knowing the name
of the singer or who is it

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:24.100
and when is it, and that copy
was made hundreds of times.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.960
This is what we were told.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.180
When they discovered that not
only that's this guy in America,

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.520
but that he's still alive,
and he's still singing,

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.360
they immediately reached out
to us and said, "Would you come

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:44.270
to Dikranagerd and dramatically
bring the songs that have been

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:49.500
in exile back to
where they were born?"

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.500
I mean, that, that's
pretty heavy.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.250
I don't know; I mean, he did it.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.550
He did it.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:59.030
He sang Heva Hila [phonetic]
in front of 3,000 people

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.310
in Dikranagerd, none
of whom are Armenian,

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:07.240
none of whom understood one word
but knew and felt the melody.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.540
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian:
Yeah, they connected.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.910
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: They know
that melody because it's sung

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:16.510
in several languages, but
my father, by being there

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.580
and singing it authentically,

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.330
was in essence saying,
we were here.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:27.540
That was something to witness.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.310
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: You
were also talking earlier

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:40.880
about how amazing it is to be
in America and having this music

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:46.000
and other parts of
our culture survive

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.030
because people intentionally
try to keep it.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.160
Can you talk a little
bit more about that?

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.460
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Yeah.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.740
I think people who
have emigrated

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.300
from other countries have a
sense of what this country is

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.980
about more than, let's say,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.600
those of us like myself
who were born here.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:13.230
My parents have made me
appreciate my country even more

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:18.840
than others, and specifically, I
think I was mentioning it to you

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.500
that each of these
villages or cities

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.180
in the old country
had their one dance.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:34.070
But as a result of the genocide
in 1915, as the survivors

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.880
and witnesses started
to emigrate, you know,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.940
the path was something like
Syria, Beirut, France, America.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.850
You know, many of
them took that route.

00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:52.140
They started to gather at
various pockets of America,

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:55.930
mostly the Northeast to begin
with, and they had with them,

00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:58.490
of course, their dialect.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.220
And Dikranagerd is
not the only dialect.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.370
Each one of them had
their dialect, of course,

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.240
and their dance, and their
way of preparing the food,

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.020
and their way of dressing,
and they retained that.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.100
But what happened is in
this country is they started

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.480
to learn all of those
dialects and dances together

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.740
because that's, they gathered
together at dances and weddings

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.240
and for the first time started
learning each other's dance.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:31.690
And it wasn't until Armenians
and Turks from Turkey came

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.890
to visit a dance that we
gave, they're the ones

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:40.270
who shined the light
on the dramatic event

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.320
that was taking place.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.620
This is the only place in the
world where in one evening,

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.230
you can see 15 different
folk dances,

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.970
and everybody knows them,

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.510
no matter where they're
ancestors are from.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.450
So, in essence, and I
said it on stage today,

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.980
people like my father and the
immigrants inadvertently kept

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:05.020
alive their culture because they
were welcomed by this country.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.080
You're free to go to your church
or to speak your language,

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.660
or what have you, and
they kept it alive.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:20.370
I know my father and his likes
never did it with any intention,

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.570
and just now, I'm glad my
father has lived long enough

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.480
to have people tell him, do
you realize what you did?

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.710
And he's just now
starting to say, "Wow!

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.480
Wow! I didn't realize it."

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.780
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: That's right.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.080
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I'm
glad you're realizing it.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.020
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian:
You're right, Ara.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.320
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Yeah.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.360
Well, Onnik, I'm going
to turn back to you.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.660
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Go ahead.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.330
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
You've inspired, I think,

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:50.160
a lot of Armenian music
in this country at least,

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.160
and you've certainly
taught Ara the music

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.480
and probably other
people as well.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.430
I wondered what you
hope for the future

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:06.160
of this music, our culture.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.000
Tell me what you're thinking
about and hoping for.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.130
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: What do
I think and what do I hope?

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:19.900
As a matter of fact,
today, after the concert,

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.400
when we were visiting with
some people that were,

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.160
they were congratulating us
and so on, it was at least two

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.300
or three families with
little children, you know,

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.600
some 7, 8, 10 years old.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.900
I don't know if you --

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.200
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian:
Yeah, I saw them.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.500
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: You
saw all that a lot.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.800
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Yeah.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.540
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: And they,
what I liked very much is

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.750
that two or three of them
had the CD in their hand,

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:54.660
and with their eyes wide open,
"Can you sign, can you sign?"

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.450
And one of them, the youngest
one, I know, "I hear your songs.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.820
I like your songs."

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.960
I hear -- like that's
the future.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:13.870
If I unknowingly did what I
thought that what I was doing is

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.050
because I liked it,
without knowing

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:22.740
that I was influencing some
people that have young ones

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.710
like that and through music,
through CDs, through cassettes

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:32.710
and what have you, playing it in
their homes, made some interest

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.420
to those little ones;
I'm 89 years old.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.060
I don't know how long will I
be alive, but it seems to me

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:47.290
that if I made some little
ones interested enough,

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:52.220
I think I accomplished
through music,

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:57.880
through music, a
little side story.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.730
Speaking of little ones like
this, I knew this family

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.270
from Providence, Rhode Island.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:09.560
They had this little boy.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.520
I didn't notice, but my
granddaughter, Ariv, said,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.780
"There is a little boy in
Providence, Rhode Island,

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.190
that loves to play
the dimbag [phonetic],

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.770
the drum, the Armenian drum."

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:30.380
And my granddaughter says,
"If you have an extra one,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.830
I'd like to give, you
know, to this boy."

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:39.030
As a matter of fact, we all
have extra musical instruments,

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.870
and so I gave it to my
granddaughter, which in turn,

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.470
she gave it to this little boy.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:52.890
So, about a year or so after,
I was engaged to do some,

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.580
a concert, or whatever
it was, in Providence.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.750
Wouldn't you know that
this husband and wife

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:05.160
and this little boy came
without me knowing about them.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.360
So, after the concert,
they came behind the stage

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.140
with this little boy, and
they introduced themselves,

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:17.110
and they said, "I want you
to know that this is my son,

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:24.890
and he's the one that you gave
the thing, the dimbag to."

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.230
Oh, I [inaudible] the last,
you know, "You liked it?"

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.670
"Yeah, I love it," and he's
looking wide-eyed like this,

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:34.900
and like; so, I said,
"Well, do you play it?"

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.230
you know. He says, "No.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.080
No." Because I had signed it.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.380
I had autographed it,
you know, on the skin.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.680
He said, "No."

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.820
I said, "I don't understand."

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.120
[Inaudible] you know, play."

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:55.080
He said, "No, I don't
want the name to be --

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.130
" You asked me what's
the future?

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:01.740
If I did a little thing like
that to, through music, not me,

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:07.070
through the sound that they
must have liked and enjoyed,

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:12.730
I accomplished what I think
that I, unknowingly, was doing.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.030
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Yeah.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.330
That's wonderful.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.630
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian: Yeah.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.930
Walla!

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.230
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian: Well,
before we finish today,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:22.640
I just want to ask are there any
stories that you want to tell

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.300
that I didn't ask you
about, or any other things

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.010
that you'd like to say?

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.710
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: There's
a million and one stories,

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:34.860
but I just want to say that
you have to take your hat off

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:41.900
to the Library of Congress for
recognizing the value of people

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.080
like my father and this dialect.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.330
And by the way, I don't
understand the dialect.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:53.010
In the house, they did not,
he did not speak that dialect

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.030
because my mother is
not Dinkjian Agladikca.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.420
She's [inaudible] Agladikca.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.360
So, he would only
speak that when he was

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.670
with his fellow Dinkjian
Agladikca's and --

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.970
&gt;&gt; Onnik Dinkjian:
With my sister.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.740
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I know
it's a very animated

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.920
and exaggerated kind of thing,
and like you, I got maybe 10,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.820
or 15, 20% at the most; so,
I don't even understand it.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.240
But the Library of
Congress has, apparently,

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:26.010
recognized the danger
of extinction,

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.380
and to document my father
singing these songs,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.630
speaking this dialect, and for
that, we are eternally grateful.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.950
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rupkafian:
Well, thank you.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.650
Thank you both very
much, and thank you

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:38.950
to the Library as well.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.040
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Thank you.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.430
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
