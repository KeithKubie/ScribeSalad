00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.000
We are on problem 56.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.370
Scott is constructing a line
perpendicular to line

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.580
L from point P.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.650
Fair enough.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.170
Which of the following should
be his first step?

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.640
So he wants to draw
a line that looks

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.330
something like this.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.970
He want to draw it
going straight up

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.660
through the point P.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.710
And so how do you do that?

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.860
Obviously, if you just use a
ruler, maybe by accident, you

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.810
draw it at a slight angle or
something like that, right?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.890
So he wants to have
an exact line.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.400
Let's see, I don't even
know what he's doing

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.120
in this first one.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.409
He's drawing these x's.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.910
I don't know how he's
determining

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.150
where those x's go.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.810
So that A doesn't look right.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.610
Step B, it looks like he kind
of picked two points and is

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.590
drawing and using his compass to
pivot off of those to kind

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.480
of draw arcs there.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.940
But that's still not clear
how it could help.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.840
If he knew that he could do some
math and try to figure

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.500
out that these are equidistant
from P.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.770
But still, what he wants to do
is find a point right around

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.040
there, right below P, where if
he draws a line between P and

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.870
that point, it'll be
perpendicular.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.850
So that doesn't seem
to be of much help.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.480
Here, he picked a point and he's
drawing an arc, but that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.690
arc doesn't really tell
me much information.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.690
Let me see, D.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.610
This looks interesting.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.330
So it looks like he took the
pivot of his compass and he

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.730
drew a circle around with
a constant radius.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.230
Obviously, that's what
makes it a circle.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.830
And then what do he
could do now is he

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.770
could take his pivot.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.740
He could you could mark each
of these points, right?

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.110
If he marked each of those
points and just pivoted around

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.040
them and drew a circle, he would
actually-- so let's say

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.580
that around that point, he were
to pivot and the circles

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.530
looks something like--
I don't know.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.325
And he would want to change the
radius a little bit, so

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:55.450
let's say it looks something
like that.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.420
I'm going to try my
best to draw it.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.410
Let's say it looks something
like that.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.070
And then around that point,
he does the same thing.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.900
He pivots around it.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.000
I guess the two would have to
be big enough to intersect

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.250
with each other.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.890
I know I'm drawing it
really horrible.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.690
The point at which they do
intersect would be equidistant

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.240
between those two points.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.120
Another way to think about it,
it would be another point

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.770
that's equidistant between the
two points, because when you

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.210
do it first with P and you
draw that circle, you're

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.230
saying both of these points
are going to be

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.080
equidistant from P.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.100
Just by definition, right?

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.460
This is a circle and that's
a constant radius.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.070
And then if you were to take
each of those points and draw

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.560
circles or draw arcs-- so let's
say from that on you

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.920
draw an arc like that and from
that one you draw an arc like

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.790
that-- you'd say, wow, this
point is also going to be of a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.840
constant distance from
both of them.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.580
So if I were to draw a line
between both of these points

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.810
using a straight edge,
that line will be

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.210
perpendicular to line L.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.320
So if I were to just do
that, then it would be

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.070
perpendicular, so I think
D is the first step.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.630
All right, problem 57: Which
triangle can be constructed

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.950
using the following steps?

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.570
OK, this is interesting.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.520
A lot of compass work here.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.660
Put the tip of the compass
on point A.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.940
Open the compass so that the
pencil tip is on point B.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.310
Draw arc above AB.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.150
So then they drew this
arc right here.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.770
That's this thing that I'm
trying to color in.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.950
Fair enough.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.910
Without changing the opening,
put the metal tip on points B,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.880
so now you put the pivot
there, and draw an arc

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.050
interesting the first
point at C.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.360
So now they want us to draw that
second-- let me do it in

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.640
another color.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.890
They're going to draw
that second arc.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.210
OK, now draw AC and BC.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.830
Now what have we drawn?

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.900
So when you draw this first
arc-- what they drew is really

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.970
a semicircle-- the radius
is constant.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.570
So if the radius is constant,
you know that this distance

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.710
right here is going to be
equal to this distance.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.180
They're just both
radiuses of this

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.190
semicircle or of this arc.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.579
They're just radiuses.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.440
They're equal to the length of
the opening of our compass.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.050
So that's going to
be equal to that.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.760
And then when you put the pivot
here and you keep that

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.110
distance the same, so now the
pencil edge goes here, the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.020
distance is still there.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.460
And now when you do this arc,
you now know that this length

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.840
is equal to this length, because
now they're both

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.030
radiuses of this second arc.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.610
So now, you know all three sides
are equal, so this is an

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.420
equilateral triangle.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.045
Equilateral, D.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.840
OK, the diagram shows
triangle ABC.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.980
Fair enough.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.595
Which statement would prove that
ABC is a right triangle?

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.060
This is clearly not
a right angle.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.270
This is probably the right angle
for the right triangle.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.550
And this is something that maybe
you learned in algebra

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.610
class, and if you didn't,
you're about to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.350
learn it right now.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.470
And I'm looking at
the choices.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.720
They talk a lot about slope.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.800
If I just have a line let's say
here, and it has slope M,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.410
and I want to say what is the
slope on a line that is

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.550
perpendicular to this
line right here?

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.000
Well then, it would
look like that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.735
It would be perpendicular.

00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:36.400
It would have a 90-degree angle,
and its slope would be

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.390
the negative inverse.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.300
The negative inverse of
this first slope.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.060
So if the slope from A to B is
a negative inverse of the

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.530
slope for B to C, then
we're in business.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.110
These are definitely
perpendicular, at least line

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.130
segments, and this would
be a 90-degree angle.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.120
Let's see.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.750
So what did I say?

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:12.110
Slope AB, or we could say slope
BC, should be equal to

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:22.050
the negative inverse of
the slope of A to B.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.300
See, if you multiply both sides
of that times the slope

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:36.570
AB, you get slope AB
times slope BC is

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.400
equal to negative 1.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.470
I just multiplied both sides
times slope of AB.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.000
And if we could go here, choice
B is exactly what we

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.250
wrote right there.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.070
Next problem, 59:
Figure ABC, oh!

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.070
It's a parallelogram.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.540
Fair enough.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.130
That's parallel to that.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.640
That's parallel to that.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.200
What are they asking us?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200
What are the coordinates of the
point of intersection of

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.240
the diagonals?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.650
So what are these coordinates?

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.330
And we've mentioned it before,
but the big kind of crux of

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.350
this problem or what you need
to know is that for any

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.320
parallelogram, the diagonals
bisect each other.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.520
So that means that the distance
from here to here,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.060
from O to the intersection
point is equal to the

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.500
intersection point to B.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.520
And so this intersection
point is the midpoint.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.640
It is bisected by line AC.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.510
And similarly, you can make the
argument that this line

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.760
segment right here is equal
to-- is congruent

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.010
to that line segment.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.500
If this is really the midpoint
between O and B, then we just

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.280
have to find the midpoint
of their coordinates.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.590
And the way to find the midpoint
of two coordinates is

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.700
actually very intuitive.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.830
You just average the
coordinates.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:11.420
So if I were to average the
x's-- so the x-coordinate here

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.490
is going to be-- the
x-coordinate of point B, which

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.340
is A plus C, plus the
x-coordinate of the origin

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.700
which is 0 over 2,
because I had two

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.690
points that I'm averaging.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.570
So that's going to be
the x-coordinate.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.880
And then y-coordinate is going
to be the y-coordinate

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.039
coordinate of B plus the
y-coordinate of the origin.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:34.850
I'm just averaging them.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.610
The y-coordinate of the origin
is 0 divided by 2.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.390
This will give me the coordinate
of the midpoint

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.950
between origin and B.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:51.680
So that equals A plus C over 2
and then B over 2, so this is

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.920
A plus C over 2.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.290
That makes sense because A plus
C is going to be here

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.710
someplace, and we just took the
average of the two between

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.680
zero and that, and you
got the midpoint.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.920
And then the y-coordinate is
going to be B over 2, which

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.970
makes sense because that up
there is B and we're just

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.045
halfway between B and zero.

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:15.800
So it's A plus C over
2, B over 2.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.070
And is that one of
the choices?

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.210
A plus C over 2, I'm assuming
that they want us to do choice

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.140
C and they just forgot to
type the B in there.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.020
This is supposed to be a B.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.170
Because this is definitely
not right.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.100
That's not right.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.620
And we know that this is right,
but it's not A plus

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.890
something over on this side.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.610
It's just B over 2 on
the y-coordinate.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.880
So that's not right.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.270
All right, problem 60.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.580
I tried to squeeze it in.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.290
I don't know if you can
see the whole problem.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.300
But it says what type of
triangle is formed by the

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.560
points A is 4 comma 2, B is 6
comma negative 1, and C is

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.460
negative 1 comma 3?

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.030
So I think the best thing is to
just try to graph it and at

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.490
least start getting an
intuition, and then we can see

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.970
the distances between the
points, and hopefully, figure

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.510
out what type of
triangle it is.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.720
So let's see, some
of the points get

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.090
a little bit negative.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.080
I'll have to draw some of
the negative quadrants.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.320
So if I were to draw
it like that.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.120
OK, let's see.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.570
So 4 comma 2.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.340
That's right there.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.340
That's point A.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.150
And then I have 6 comma
negative 1.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.500
That's point B.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.060
I don't know if you can
see it down there.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.320
And C is negative 1 comma 3.

00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.510
So it's out here.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.290
Now let me connect the dots.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.700
That's one side, that's another
side, and that's the

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.290
other side.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.450
So off the bat, I just
know this isn't going

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.420
to be a right triangle.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.990
It's not an equilateral
triangle.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.455
And the only way it's going to
be an isosceles triangle is if

00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:20.600
this length is equal to that
length, so let's just try it.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.280
Let's just test it out.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.170
So what is the distance
from A to C?

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.240
The distance squared from A to
C is equal to the differences

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.630
in their x's.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.060
So 4 minus negative
1, so there's a

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.905
difference of 5, right?

00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:46.260
So there's a difference in
their x's squared plus a

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.140
difference in their y's.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.910
So 2 and 3.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.170
You could just say 2 minus
3 or 3 minus is 2.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.580
It doesn't matter.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.690
We just care about
the difference.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.050
Plus one squared.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.080
So the distance squared
is equal to 25 plus

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.540
1 is equal to 26.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.580
So this distance is the
square root of 26.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.630
And the distance between
A and B, same logic.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.720
Let's see, when you go from
the distance squared, the

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.210
difference is in there x's.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.740
Between 6 and 4, you have a
distance of 2, so it's 2

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.810
squared plus the difference
in their y's.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.770
2 and negative 1 are
3 apart, right?

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.990
Plus 3 squared.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:33.486
And so that is equal to 4 plus
9, which is equal to 13, so

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:36.090
this is equal to the
square root of 13.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.480
OK, and this number down here,
you can figure it out, but

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.570
it's going to be bigger than
both of them, right?

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.260
You can just look at
it and say that.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.040
So this is definitely
a scalene triangle.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.550
All of the sides
are different.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.020
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
