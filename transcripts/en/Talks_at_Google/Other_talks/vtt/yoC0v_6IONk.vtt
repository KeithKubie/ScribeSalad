INTERVIEWER: All right, as
we have people settling in,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.900
let's get it started
with a bang, bang.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.770
BENNY DAYAL: Thank you.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.180
INTERVIEWER: Welcome
to Google [? Pro ?].

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.420
We are really excited
to have you here.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.309
I don't think Benny
Dayal really needs

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.460
any introduction in Bollywood.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.980
You have songs for
Blockbuster movies,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.620
some songs for my favorite
actor [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.130
That's such an amazing song.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.179
It's great.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.720
Song for the
[? Thick Russian ?] like

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.220
the song for the
[? Thick Russian ?]

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.076
"Bang Bang".

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:32.950
The [? Bailors ?] that's
their favorite song.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.660
Like, his dance and your
song like, so, so good.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.805
Song for two States, Race two
[? Japanese ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:43.312
and the list keeps going on.

00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:45.020
And I'm not even
talking about the movies

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.620
down in South [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.420
You continue to
amaze me, brother.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.720
You're, after the [INAUDIBLE] I
see you as the new [? Hamid. ?]

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.660
This is amazing.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.160
Hats off.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.750
So, Benny, what really
brings you to Bay Area?

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.107
BENNY DAYAL: I have
a concert tomorrrow.

00:01:08.107 --> 00:01:10.190
INTERVIEWER: Tell us
something about your concert.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.130
BENNY DAYAL: It's basically,
the concert is called Bang Bang

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.080
and it's put on by
[INAUDIBLE] and my manager.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.470
So they've probably done
[INAUDIBLE] the founding

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.426
of my band FunktuaTion.

00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:24.233
This is my band.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.566
INTERVIEWER: Guys, a big round
of applause for the band.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.340
BENNY DAYAL: So we actually
started out as a fun solo--

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.023
not the-- just producing
our own fan music

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:38.230
and playing a lot of covers.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.800
And then eventually
things started

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.270
getting really busy
for me as an artist.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.340
And I asked them, is it OK
to play Bollywood music also?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.720
And they were like, but how?

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.172
And I was like, just
the way we make music,

00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:58.397
nothing exactly like Bollywood.

00:01:58.397 --> 00:01:59.480
It needs to be improvised.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.665
It needs to be the
way we feel like it.

00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.790
And everybody was on board
and I really thank them.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.229
Because of them we had to-- ever
since they've come on board,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.180
we go all of the
world and everybody's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.144
been interested in our
sound and [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:16.310
INTERVIEWER: That's amazing.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.730
So I have a question.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.620
Is this the same band that was
part of the song "Bang Bang?"

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.220
BENNY DAYAL: No,
no, no. "Bang Bang,"

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.680
those are pretty--
we did our own rehash

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.181
video of "Bang Bang."

00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.180
INTERVIEWER: I saw that.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.390
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.830
That is exactly them.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.524
That's exactly them.

00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:35.190
The songs are generally produced
by [? Mishar ?] [? Mashakur ?].

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.410
So that's what you
hear in the movie.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.625
But then we create
our own versions.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.250
INTERVIEWER: I loved
your version, man.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.680
BENNY DAYAL: Thank you.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.470
INTERVIEWER: It was awesome.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.761
You guys, check out on YouTube.

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:46.480
Benny's band has done
a "Bang Bang" cover

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.410
and it's really amazing.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.120
BENNY DAYAL: We
actually shot the video

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.850
in all of the hotel rooms that
we've stayed in when we travel.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.750
So we're just keeping it
very real and very intimate.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.650
And it was amazing because
the kind of response we got,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.256
not only from just fans but from
the industry, was unbelievable.

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:10.630
Like including the [? shot ?]
[? that ?] and [? Shakur ?]

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.050
himself was like so impressed
with the production.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.870
And we have to thank
Doby our engineer.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.040
He's not here.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.520
He'll be in the Bay Area
by noon I'm supposing.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.350
So Doby was behind shooting and
recording all of us in August.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.660
We shot and recorded
the stuff in Delhi

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.580
and others in Bombay,
Banglor, and Bangladesh,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.410
stuff like that.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.770
Because we were
traveling very constantly

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:49.790
and we also shot it from the
footage in our concerts--

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.660
biggest live concerts and
also [INAUDIBLE] the shots.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.250
We actually recorded some
of the percussion stuff.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.520
Allen is on persucssion.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.060
So Allen recorded some
of the percussion stuff

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.120
inside using the
bathroom acoustics.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.770
So, no, it was
really interesting.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.699
It's really interesting
because it's

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.990
all about sound at the end
of the day and we actually--

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.960
INTERVIEWER: You were playing
percussion in the bathroom?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.020
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, in
the bathroom, yeah.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.080
INTERVIEWER: Who
gave you that idea?

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.621
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah,
it was-- no, no it

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:19.399
was a great area because
the capture was really clean

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.240
and it was really nice.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.090
A very interesting idea.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.580
INTERVIEWER: I've actually
tried singing in an empty hall

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.766
sometimes and some
people like some of it.

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:30.010
They really, really like it.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.000
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah,
empty definitely.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.090
But when it is
filled with people

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.490
also it sounds even better.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.880
Because first it's
too empty and then

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.250
when an audience come to
a place to watch a concert

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.060
it's when they absorb
the sound properly.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.670
Like, you guys that are
actually absorbing the sound

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.890
and it just sounds
perfect after that.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.450
So yeah.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.860
INTERVIEWER: Great.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.438
So I assume [INAUDIBLE]
was still here?

00:04:57.438 --> 00:04:58.414
BENNY DAYAL: Indeed.

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:00.640
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]
"Bang Bang" really.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.920
So there is a-- did you
always thought of becoming

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.300
a singer from a very young age?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.090
BENNY DAYAL: Yes.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.039
I only wanted to
become a musician.

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.330
INTERVIEWER: Family was singer?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.996
BENNY DAYAL: No.

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:13.650
My mother's a dancer.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.550
I learned and did classical
dance for 14 years so

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.970
that's how it I became so
inclined to performing arts.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:30.980
And yeah, it's-- yes, since the
age of 13 I wanted to become

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.730
a singer.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.300
INTERVIEWER: And did you
undergo any classical training?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.830
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, I've done
[INAUDIBLE] music as a kid.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.252
And that had taught me
some beautiful things.

00:05:41.252 --> 00:05:42.710
INTERVIEWER: And
how did you really

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.980
make it to Bollywood, man?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.630
There are so many singers that
crave for making to Bollywood.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.160
BENNY DAYAL: Well, I must thank
Mr. [? Armaan ?] for, you know,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.180
I didn't define my talent.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.850
He has been the
reason why I wanted

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.900
to become a muscian also.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.360
Because when he
started making music,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.230
we started to listening to
new, new singles every time.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.360
And to be very honest, that
was the time when he came out

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.210
in '90s-- was the time when we
were at a point in India where,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.710
what?

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.266
You want to become a singer?

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:17.880
Like, go get a job.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.680
That's what people are saying.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.890
They're like, become a
manager at some company

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.007
and get married and have so many
kids and give up your pension.

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:29.340
That's exactly what they wanted.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.090
INTERVIEWER: Big family, really?

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.274
BENNY DAYAL: I became socially--
[INAUDIBLE] Who knows?

00:06:36.274 --> 00:06:37.565
That's exactly what I'm saying.

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:41.720
So someone like him actually
made us youngsters want

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.470
to take music as a profession.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.310
And he's the one who opened
the eyes of the entire nation.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.680
Even when I go abroad and I
see people who are supporting--

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.980
they have a normal job but then
they're supporting your concert

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.750
because they have so much
passion towards music.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.570
And then one got a lot of guy
who was running around errands.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.410
But then that [? errand ?] comes
in and says, I love to sing.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.340
And what should I do
to become a singer?

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.660
So just follow the dream.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.460
Don't stop.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.190
INTERVIEWER: I agree with you.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.190
Indian passion face.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.480
If you're really
passionate, you are here.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.124
BENNY DAYAL: Thank you.

00:07:22.124 --> 00:07:23.990
INTERVIEWER: So family
does support you?

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.960
Do you have full
support from family?

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.084
BENNY DAYAL: Not initially.

00:07:27.084 --> 00:07:28.281
Not initially.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.030
They were shocked.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.910
They were shocked.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.217
My father was especially
shocked because--

00:07:33.217 --> 00:07:35.550
INTERVIEWER: Fathers are not
who they may be [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.716
BENNY DAYAL: No, actually
that was the shock for me.

00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:40.830
Because my dad was the most
supportive human being.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.690
And then when I told
him I wanted to become

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.350
a musician, he was like, what?

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.740
And my mother's
like, yeah, why not?

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.500
And I didn't expect my
mother to even say anything.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.380
Then eventually just [INAUDIBLE]
and I had to prove it to them

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.892
that I'm good.

00:07:57.892 --> 00:07:59.850
INTERVIEWER: You're really
good with bell, man.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.740
Like, so awesome.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.730
[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE]

I love [INAUDIBLE] I
don't try to imitate her.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.410
But I try and not upset her.

likely the best.

[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.820
That's most important thing.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.220
INTERVIEWER: So how has been
your experience working with

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:51.820
[INAUDIBLE] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.660
BENNY DAYAL: Even,
actually, I still

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.600
don't have a picture with
[INAUDIBLE] To be very honest.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.159
My brother [? Nazeef ?] has more
pictures with him than I do.

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.700
This my chance to
pick [? his case ?]

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.400
in a public forum.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.910
But, yeah, I'm very
glad I worked with him.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.230
Because I must say,
that we youngsters,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.880
whoever has worked with him, are
very, very lucky to be alive,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.175
to be listening to
his music, and to have

00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:24.120
worked with him above all in
the era when Mr. A.R. Rahman is

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.620
alive.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.310
It's a true blessing.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.250
There's nothing beyond
that for any artist

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.350
because, even if you meet
any singer or any musician,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.304
they say that.

00:09:37.304 --> 00:09:38.470
I was [? there ?] [? too. ?]

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.962
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:39.962 --> 00:09:41.670
BENNY DAYAL: He's an
amazing human being.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.640
I just can't explain.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.980
You can't explain that, right?

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.580
It's very hard.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.600
I just want to say that
I'm so thankful to God

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.852
that it happened
and I work with him.

00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:55.310
INTERVIEWER: Great to see, man
that you're [? successful ?]

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.210
It's really good.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:05.550
And [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.620
BENNY DAYAL: You do
definitely get nervous

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.250
but then I think he somehow
eradicates that nervousness out

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.000
of you.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.570
If you choose to still be
nervous, then it's on you.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.570
Normally, you
shouldn't be nervous,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.690
becuase this is the
opportunity, right?

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.370
When you are in front of him.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.350
you try and do your best.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.610
You try do your best for
anybody in that case.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:35.590
But when you meet him--
he has that energy that

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.650
takes away all of your fear.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.874
It just becomes
focused on the music.

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:42.290
And I like that
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.900
So does [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.430
Besides just singing
and working with him,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.250
you really, really learn how
to be a good human being when

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:51.870
you meet him.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.380
As for me, I wasn't such
a positive human being

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.170
when I-- before I met him.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.290
Because I struggled through
so much to become a musician.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.000
And I've had instances where
music directors have told me

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.180
that, have you got your voice?

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.940
And so yeah, know
what's wrong with it?

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.960
And he's like, you want
to become a singer?

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.660
You will not-- never
become a singer.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.370
There were people
who've told me this,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.940
you think you will
become a singer?

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.050
I don't think so.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.860
[INAUDIBLE] There
are people like that.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.870
And that I have somebody
like [? Rahman ?]

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.750
gives you an opportunity
and shows the world

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.300
what you're capable of.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.390
And that's true magic.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.920
And for me that's
exactly why I said--

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.430
I don't want to say anything
about it because he's

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.090
all about his music,
and he's spoken to you

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.850
through his music.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.797
I want to say this one beautiful
thing, about [? Rahman ?] which

00:11:43.797 --> 00:11:45.255
I have never told,
ever in my life,

00:11:45.255 --> 00:11:46.890
and I can say it right now.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.772
It's that,
[? Rahman ?] said that,

00:11:50.772 --> 00:11:54.760
one of the greatest
crime of our time

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.840
that's to steal all
our hearts with music.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.552
INTERVIEWER:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:03.552 --> 00:12:04.760
BENNY DAYAL: I don't do that.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.890
As a child my heart was stolen
by him through his music.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:16.070
So finally-- eventually work
with him-- it's just surreal.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.750
INTERVIEWER: Amazing.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.280
So you have been in Bollywood
for quite some time now.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.930
What do you think
about today's music,

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.980
as compared to '60s and '70s?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.240
BENNY DAYAL: Well, it's
supposed to evolve.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.040
It's supposed to move forward.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.830
And that's very important.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.120
And so many music directors
have played that important role

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.540
in changing-- and
taking things forward.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.760
Like when everything was
moving in one direction,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:52.690
we had [INAUDIBLE]
[? Rahman ?] just changed

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.160
the entire soundscape of music.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:06.361
And then followed by [INAUDIBLE]
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You name

00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:06.860
it.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.630
And everybody is doing it.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:13.060
And then they are changing a
little by little by little.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.450
The Indian music industry
is a team-- we are a team.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.090
We're a fraternity.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.580
It's-- that's how we work.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.820
We are proving it to
the world that Bollywood

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.760
is such a strong genre.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.010
And we are so versatile
as an industry.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.680
Today, even if you and even
if you're at the immigration

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.832
and they ask you, so
you're a musician?

00:13:35.832 --> 00:13:36.915
So what music do you play?

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:38.650
Do you play Bollywood?

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.520
So I feel proud.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.005
I feel really proud that I'm
a part of that industry, which

00:13:44.005 --> 00:13:44.880
produces great music.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.460
So, hats off to all the
musicians, all the singers,

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.020
all the instrumentalists, all
the engineers who mix the sound

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.830
and make it viable for
a universal audience.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.240
That change is
very, very involved.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.600
from '60s to '70s to right now.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.696
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:09.290
INTERVIEWER: That's amazing.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.540
So what's the latest
that you are working on?

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.280
If anything, you
can share with us?

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.450
BENNY DAYAL: I'm not
supposed to share.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.590
Some extremely,
extremely interesting

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.090
projects coming in for you
within the end of this year

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.801
and the beginning of next year.

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:28.710
Which includes [INAUDIBLE]
and [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.850
and [? Bengali ?] and
lots of other work.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:40.770
INTERVIEWER: Nice
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.440
You've been the
voice of [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.830
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.950
BENNY DAYAL:
[INAUDIBLE] I've not

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.850
sung for [? Shara Khan ?] yet.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.405
I wish to sing
for him some time.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.370
INTERVIEWER: Now
audience, quick questions,

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:16.410
you can have [INAUDIBLE]
Take it later.

00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:25.700
DIVYA: Hi Benny.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.310
Thank you for coming here.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.870
My name is Divya.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.070
"Bang Bang" is one
of my favorite songs.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.890
And I can't stop dancing
to it. [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.270
So I wanted to ask you, which is
your favorite song that you've

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.014
sung?

00:15:42.014 --> 00:15:43.680
And which is your
favorite song that you

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.471
like to dance to,
considering you have da--

00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:48.326
you have danced for so long.

00:15:48.326 --> 00:15:51.420
BENNY DAYAL: I'll
answer the last one.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.680
The answer to the second
part of the question

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.515
is definitely "Bang Bang."

00:15:55.515 --> 00:15:57.840
It's a song that I
really like to dance to.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.030
And my favorite song
personally is [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.310
It's very close to my heart.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.280
Because the first time
you walk into a studio

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.860
and you get startled by the fact
that [INAUDIBLE] sitting there.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.390
It's enormous pressure.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:19.470
And I think pressure-- I
realize that the pressure brings

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.530
the best out of me.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.200
It surely did.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.750
One [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.700
It gave me so many
special moments in life.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.110
INTERVIEWER: It's one of my
favorite songs, by the way.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.086
BENNY DAYAL: Actually
did that song sums up

00:16:33.086 --> 00:16:34.460
everything in my
life, everything

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:40.060
that I've gotten in life whether
it is music or friends or love

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.860
or anything.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.510
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I
just don't even know.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.870
[INAUDIBLE] like a question
and an answer iteself.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:17:00.740
INTERVIEWER:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.770
MALE SPEAKER: I have a question.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.190
Welcome to Google.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.429
Congratulations you have really
carved a niche for yourself.

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:08.720
You have a very distinct style.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.730
Like they say, if people start
living together for long,

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.480
they start looking alike.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.540
And I just couldn't
help but see your band,

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.780
and everybody looks alike.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.930
Everybody looks like Benny
One, Benny Two, Benny Three.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.246
Is it because you have
lived for long together?

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:28.137
BENNY DAYAL: No, no.

00:17:28.137 --> 00:17:29.470
MALE SPEAKER: Or you are family?

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.800
BENNY DAYAL: We all
have individual lives.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.670
I'll tell you something.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.300
It's because it's the music.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.520
It's the music.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.990
If you look at all
of us, we actually

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.940
wear what we listen to.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.760
It's the music that
speaks through us.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.320
And it grooms us, too.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.340
Music is such a beautiful thing.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.250
It teaches you about life.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.870
Teaches you how to be humble.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.660
Teaches you how to be arrogant.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.750
Teaches you how to be
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.820
It really, really teaches
you how to live your life.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.260
And brings in lots of beautiful
principles in your life.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.760
It grooms you as a human being.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.260
And makes you-- puts you-- music
is quite a lot of discipline.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.837
And we wouldn't
be playing the way

00:18:19.837 --> 00:18:22.410
we play without any
amount of discipline

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.020
that each individual has put
in to the art of musicianship,

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.610
as they were growing up.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.020
We watch a lot of music.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.770
We have a lot of influences.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.260
And we quite a lot of
time-- a lot of things

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.650
that we love from it.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.360
We choose the best out of it.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.820
We try inculcate
that into our life.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.490
So that's exactly what you see.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.620
And somehow you are
following the same category.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.360
That's why we make
music together.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.140
INTERVIEWER: Thanks so much.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.014
That's a nice answer.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.130
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Hi Benny.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.200
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.610
Such a pleasure to have
you here, at Google.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.554
I have to say, I love dancing,
and some of your songs

00:19:06.554 --> 00:19:07.970
are my favorite
songs to dance to.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:08.510
BENNY DAYAL: Thank you.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.240
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: In
fact some of his songs

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.980
are my favorite songs to
listen to when I work out.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.520
But let me tell you
the only song that

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.019
can make me run eight miles on
a treadmill, because as soon

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:20.810
as I have a playlist
and I've had them for,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.268
I think a year and a half, but
[INAUDIBLE] is my permanent.

00:19:23.268 --> 00:19:24.860
Other songs have come and gone.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.770
And as soon as that song
comes on, I am on fire.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:33.054
And the other songs like that,
[INAUDIBLE] huge fan, my dad

00:19:33.054 --> 00:19:34.220
is a huge fan of yours, too.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:34.930
BENNY DAYAL: Thank you.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.846
Thank you so much, please
give him my regards.

00:19:36.846 --> 00:19:39.210
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah I
told my dad that I meet Benny

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.460
and he was like, oh
my god, say hi to him.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.946
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:44.946 --> 00:19:46.095
BENNY DAYAL: Thank you.

00:19:46.095 --> 00:19:48.470
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Thank you,
Benny, you have made my day.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.560
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Hi, Benny.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.400
How are you?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.370
I think one of your songs
that I've always loved

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:10.193
is [INAUDIBLE] when
you sung it years ago.

00:20:10.193 --> 00:20:11.390
When we were school.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.390
BENNY DAYAL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.770
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.432
BENNY DAYAL: You're [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:13.432 --> 00:20:14.348
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yes,

00:20:14.348 --> 00:20:16.501
BENNY DAYAL: Wow,
[INAUDIBLE] school.

00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:18.250
You know, I'm just
starting to realize it.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.990
I'm so different [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.660
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I think
I couldn't recognize it.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.910
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.612
I was thinking, like, the smile
is, very, very recognizable.

00:20:25.612 --> 00:20:27.320
And then I was like,
is this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.590
LIke, it's been running
in the back of my head.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.290
[INAUDIBLE] is my [? junior. ?]
We danced and sang and competed

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.790
and everything I
should [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.224
What a small world.

00:20:36.224 --> 00:20:37.724
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
I don't work here.

00:20:37.724 --> 00:20:39.910
This is my friend and my
husband also works here.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:40.300
BENNY DAYAL: Oh, wow.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:40.870
Nice meeting you.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.203
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: --I found
out that you're coming here.

00:20:48.292 --> 00:20:50.500
INTERVIEWER: Any questions
from the audience since we

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.750
can take one from [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.910
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.160
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.142
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
questions [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:10.142 --> 00:21:11.350
INTERVIEWER: OK, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.386
BENNY DAYAL:
[INAUDIBLE] can I give?

00:21:18.386 --> 00:21:19.385
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:22.329 --> 00:21:23.995
BENNY DAYAL: We're
going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:33.240
AUDIENCE: So I've seen
[INAUDIBLE] seen you perform

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:33.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:39.100
BENNY DAYAL: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I saw
you dancing [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.890
So is that really [INAUDIBLE]
so much effort, right?

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.240
Like, a lot of people just
can't sing on the stage.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.710
You are dancing, right?

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.440
And [INAUDIBLE] effortless.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.895
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:55.895 --> 00:21:57.144
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, I am, I am.

00:21:57.144 --> 00:21:57.968
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:57.968 --> 00:21:59.218
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] dancing.

00:21:59.218 --> 00:22:02.950
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
east of [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:03.830
videos again.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.920
Your "Bang Bang" [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.800
So, [INAUDIBLE] dance
moves [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.449
BENNY DAYAL: Actually,
I was [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:13.449 --> 00:22:16.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.150
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, I'm a
trained dancer, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:22.787 --> 00:22:24.120
That's my classmate from school.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.860
So, thank you for coming.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.350
And yeah, so, yeah, I--
actually, in school,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:37.050
everybody knew me as a
dancer, not as a singer,

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.810
except for [INAUDIBLE] parents.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.670
AUDIENCE: You will
sing [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.700
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, and I used to
sing a lot of [INAUDIBLE] music

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.980
when I was in school.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.630
So yeah, that's
what [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.810
But then dancing,
yeah, I actually

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.832
wanted to inculcate that
into me, into my career.

00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:55.540
And it happened, as
I started performing,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.590
everybody was like,
[INAUDIBLE], whoa, OK, fine.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.250
So-- but then that's exactly
what I wanted to happen.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.950
I wanted that impact on people.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:07.230
And now slowly, it's growing
in the eyes of the people

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.920
and the audience and the fans.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.486
Everybody gets to
see what I'm doing.

00:23:12.486 --> 00:23:14.414
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
question [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:14.414 --> 00:23:16.342
you can dance and sing.

00:23:16.342 --> 00:23:19.244
Like, most of the singers in
Bollywood, they just sing.

00:23:19.244 --> 00:23:20.650
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.650
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.020
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, I
actually don't use much

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.690
of my [INAUDIBLE] performing.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.680
You know, it's now
there in the system.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.609
It's like muscle memory.

00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:39.150
It's like you waking
up and you don't

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.381
forget to brush your teeth.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.410
INTERVIEWER: We've got one
question for [INAUDIBLE] pass

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.320
on the mic, [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.700
Actually, this
girl's [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.616
in school. [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.420
AUDIENCE: And [? Mike ?] must
know that we did that as well.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.945
As I understand it, you went
to school in the Middle East.

00:24:00.945 --> 00:24:03.860
I also did go to school there.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:10.545
But my question is, how did that
help you increase your talent

00:24:10.545 --> 00:24:11.590
or hone your talent?

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.570
Does it-- you think it is
people from the Middle East

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.250
who grew up first
generation, do they

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.860
have-- I know another
friend of mine

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.310
also is in the
Bollywood industry

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.310
from [INAUDIBLE] school.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:25.422
But what do you think of the--
does it help you or doesn't it?

00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:27.380
BENNY DAYAL: Well, my
teachers were from there.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.692
My dance teachers were from
[INAUDIBLE], music teachers

00:24:29.692 --> 00:24:30.400
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.992
So what I learned are from
my teachers and my teachers

00:24:33.992 --> 00:24:35.170
[? would read. ?]

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.610
So I think [INAUDIBLE]
has nothing to do with it.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.420
It's what the teachers
will teach you

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.170
what you have to know.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:47.240
And I must say, [INAUDIBLE]
the school that we were in

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.410
was also like [INAUDIBLE]
we were pretty competitive

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.430
and it really brought
the best out of us.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.280
Like, if you see
[INAUDIBLE] was--

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.000
he [? talked ?] the
[INAUDIBLE] in science.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.570
And he knew [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.730
Like, no, Joseph [INAUDIBLE]
so if you look at [? Nichol, ?]

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.370
[? Nichol ?] was not
just an academic person.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.370
He was into
declamation, elocution.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.850
He was into quizzing.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.380
He was into [? mind ?] mental
quiz and he used to do music.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.150
He was in drama.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.180
He went to school
[? band ?] drama.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.920
And he was also into sports.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.990
He used to play cricket.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.260
He used to have me on
[? his ?] cricket team.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.587
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:30.587 --> 00:25:32.045
BENNY DAYAL: But
what I'm saying is

00:25:32.045 --> 00:25:33.730
that he was the head
boy of our school

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.310
and he also-- he was
actually the example

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.080
of a student being the
head boy and academically

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.130
doing extremely well.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.380
It was-- no, I'm so proud of my
school and my [INAUDIBLE] mates

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.850
and my juniors and everybody.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.760
So we were a pretty
competitive school,

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.010
and you know-- [? and ?]
actually made us effortlessly

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:53.610
to be cool.

00:25:57.377 --> 00:25:58.210
No, I'm just joking.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.900
I'm just joking.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.685
INTERVIEWER: Is
there [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:03.665
AUDIENCE: So I'm just
asking [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.006
BENNY DAYAL: Yes, so we have
[INAUDIBLE] great teachers

00:26:18.006 --> 00:26:21.497
who-- not only in school, but
in extracurricular activities

00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:22.330
and stuff like that.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:29.140
So it was good guidance
and really amazing time.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.440
That's exactly why probably.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.520
But yeah, we have to work hard.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.040
This industry is not--
it's sort of the joke.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.380
You have to get on
top of your game

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.105
and you have to really be
focused on what you do and try

00:26:44.105 --> 00:26:45.850
and be an innovator.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.759
I think innovation is the
key to success always.

00:26:49.759 --> 00:26:51.050
INTERVIEWER: Asking [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.387
BENNY DAYAL: I'm a [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:55.387 --> 00:26:56.970
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]
[? senior. ?]

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.610
BENNY DAYAL: [INAUDIBLE]
both fans of [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.960
is a great singer.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.110
And if you like
[INAUDIBLE] sing,

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.740
I have a small story
about that [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.680
that is [INAUDIBLE] recorded
my voice for a [? database ?]

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.720
in the studio while he was
working with [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.570
And I [INAUDIBLE]
won't forget it.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:21.730
He's a great guy and I wish
all amazing things for him.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.580
INTERVIEWER: He's
a very humble guy.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.455
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:27.670
OK, so we're going
to talk about us now.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.340
So, Google, what
are your thoughts?

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.260
What's Google done for
you, for the industry,

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.970
and-- so I live
in San Francisco.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.656
And you look like you could
totally fit into San Francisco.

00:27:39.656 --> 00:27:40.530
BENNY DAYAL: I agree.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so what do
you think about San Francisco?

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.521
What have you seen?

00:27:43.521 --> 00:27:44.640
What have you done?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.170
So we're going to
talk about us now.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.404
BENNY DAYAL: I came
yesterday afternoon,

00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:48.530
so I haven't done much.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.050
I've only slept and woken up.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.960
So-- and of course, we have
a beautiful class conference

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.830
for our event that's happening
tomorrow at the Jubilee Center.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:02.580
But you know, Google
helps me in so many ways.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.030
I just can't tell you how much.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.880
And even tracing down
some people's names

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.650
and looking at history of
music, history of movies,

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.350
that's the feel that
I live and breathe.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.820
So Google has always
been a huge instrument

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.410
to figuring out a lot
of things that we need

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.180
to-- especially as musicians.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.660
And we need new equipment
and lots of things

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.020
and Google has been
so, so instrumental

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.150
in giving us-- paving
this and figuring out

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.610
[INAUDIBLE] things for
ourselves in music especially.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:43.140
So whatever Google does,
I think it's fabulous

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.490
and I think Google
as a word, you just

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.290
can't use it as anything else.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.370
It has become--
Google is Google.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.205
And [INAUDIBLE] after
Google, I think nothing.

00:28:53.205 --> 00:28:55.020
Nothing after Google.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.620
Yeah, Google is
going to be forever.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.620
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.690
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that you were rejected

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.680
many times by music directors.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.185
So how did you [? face ?]
that rejection?

00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:09.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.920
BENNY DAYAL: See, that's
exactly what, you know?

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.110
It's really brought
out the best in me.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.406
Somehow, I think it triggered
some nerve in me that just

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:20.049
made me want to do it more.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.090
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.123
BENNY DAYAL: I'm going
[INAUDIBLE] singer. [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:27.123 --> 00:29:29.340
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.550
So I'm guessing you may have
[INAUDIBLE] actually looked

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.230
at them again.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.492
So how did you overcome
any resentment?

00:29:36.492 --> 00:29:37.575
BENNY DAYAL: I don't know.

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:43.114
I think when I met them, I had
a lot of hair and now I don't.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:46.325
And so, yeah, so I
think that probably they

00:29:46.325 --> 00:29:47.720
would have forgotten.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.310
I don't know.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.640
It's just-- everybody moves on.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.100
And I think that's
the best thing

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.060
is just don't hold grudges.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.820
And I did go back
to [INAUDIBLE] and I

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.510
did sing some beautiful
songs for that composer.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.625
So that's that and
we'll leave it at that.

00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:06.808
AUDIENCE: Awesome
thank you so much.

00:30:06.808 --> 00:30:14.580
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE] Now,
guys, our program [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.252
is a very lucky [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:17.252 --> 00:30:23.095
We would like to talk about this
concern of [INAUDIBLE] and you

00:30:23.095 --> 00:30:24.750
guys should definitely
attend that.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.330
It was [INAUDIBLE] will be
[INAUDIBLE] perform [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.499
performance [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:29.499 --> 00:30:30.790
Great performance, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.650
So I would let
[INAUDIBLE] call someone

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.251
to announce about
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:35.251 --> 00:30:36.750
and when it's
[? going to ?] happen.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:37.250
So--

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:37.916
BENNY DAYAL: OK.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:45.480
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Hi, guys I'm
with Gig Gurus, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.220
And we are very, very lucky and
privileged to be hosting Benny

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.795
here in the Bay Area.

00:30:50.795 --> 00:30:53.830
We're doing a concert tomorrow
at this wonderful venue called

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.720
the Jubilee Center, it's
the first time there's ever

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.080
been a Bollywood concert.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.360
And they also-- the venue
yesterday, they said

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.960
it's perfect acoustically.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.110
It's meant for this
kind of a concert.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.310
Right, guys?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.690
Yep, so it's going to
be a beautiful concert.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:15.480
You heard Benny D here, but you
would see the [? functuation ?]

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.640
in motion tomorrow.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.000
So we really urge you
to get your tickets.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.890
We have a special
offer for Googlers.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.900
Especially [? Yanit ?]
spoken to me

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.320
before we have a special code.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.190
Google, if you use it, you
get a special discount.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.340
I think [? Yanit ?] has
already propagated that.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.300
So please do come
to the concert.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.150
We'd love to see you all there
and help get the word out.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.880
You heard [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.880
You should see him move, dance,
and we're like really, really

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.270
excited to see him out there.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.420
And it's all for
a good cause too.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.690
We're giving back
to a few charities

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.520
here in the Bay Area, three
beneficiary organizations.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.520
So please do join us tomorrow.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.270

00:32:04.665 --> 00:32:05.540
INTERVIEWER: Awesome.

00:32:08.491 --> 00:32:09.490
So, thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.570
Would you like to say
a few words in the end?

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.570
Or--

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.290
BENNY DAYAL: Yeah, thank you.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.500
Thank you so much for
taking out your time.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.045
I'm sure you all have
a lot of work to do.

00:32:20.045 --> 00:32:22.230
And you guys are smiling
I'm sure [? I'm ?] very

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.910
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.950
I'm sure you're all
very happy to work here.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:27.470
Thank you.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.219
Thank you so much.

00:32:28.219 --> 00:32:29.350
It really means a lot.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.110
Thank you to Ahmed.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.490
Ahmed, thank you so
much for having us over.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.360
You've been very,
very kind to us.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.080
And thank you all for
taking of your time

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.150
and coming and talking to me.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.230
I'm really, really
thrilled and really

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.730
happy to be here in the Bay
Area and looking forward

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.920
to all of you coming
for my concert tomorrow

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.730
because this is what
I want to say also.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.910
This is my first ever solo
concert in the United States

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.080
of America.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.575
So [INAUDIBLE] and
I will [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:01.575 --> 00:33:05.220
seeing some of the
most amazing composers

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.777
that I've worked with
when I come here.

00:33:08.777 --> 00:33:10.860
But today, I am so thankful
to all those composers

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.810
for giving me such a
beautiful body of work.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.280
And then I can showcase
my own concert.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.290
So it will be really
special if all of you

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.690
come and you tell your
friends about this.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.930
That's all I'm going to say.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:28.370
And thank you, thank you,
thank you a million times,

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.860
more than any YouTube hits.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.300
But thank you guys so much.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.980
It's been really
special and God has

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.590
been very kind to all of us.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.030
And that's about it.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:42.530
Thank you.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.230
INTERVIEWER: That
is all [INAUDIBLE].
