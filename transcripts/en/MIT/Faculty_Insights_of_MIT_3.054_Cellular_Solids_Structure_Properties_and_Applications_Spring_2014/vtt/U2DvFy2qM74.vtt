00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.570
PROFESSOR: So there's a
lot of images in the class,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.600
partly because we're
studying these materials

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.670
and you can see just with the
ones sitting in front of me,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.990
they have this porous,
cellular structure.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.300
So I show lots of
images of materials.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.479
We also look at how the
images deform under load.

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:25.270
And I think, perhaps,
that's something that

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.920
might be a little unexpected.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.830
So for instance, we have a
stage in the electron microscope

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.410
where we can actually deform
things in the microscope.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.390
And the stage is set up that
it has a load cell on it.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.320
And we could also measure how
much it deforms, the materials.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.830
So we can actually watch the
materials as they're deforming.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.260
So even though the cells
may be 100 micron size,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.225
you can watch how they
deform and how they fail,

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.350
and you're going to learn
a lot about the mechanics

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.390
from these sorts
of observations.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.850
So we have both video of
these deformations and also

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.570
still photography at different
time points that we show.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.660
Another interesting little video
clip that I show in the class

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.920
is we look at the interactions
between biological cells

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.810
and tissue
engineering scaffolds.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.410
So for example,
people who've looked

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.870
at trying to heal, say,
burns in skin where there's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.330
a large area of
skin missing, one

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.000
of the ways that
you can do that is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.120
by using a collagen-based
tissue engineering scaffold.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.830
And when you have
a burn in your skin

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.690
and it just heals the normal way
and you get all the scar tissue

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.530
forming, that scar
tissue is thought

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.150
to form in conjunction
with a process of what's

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.900
called wound contraction.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.050
So cells will actually
migrate into the wound bed

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.800
and actually mechanically
pull the edges of the wound

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.770
together, and that partly closes
the wound and then scar forms

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.270
as well.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.370
And those two
processes are thought

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.560
to be related to each other.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.730
So I've done a collaboration
with Professor Ioannis Yannas

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.880
here at MIT who developed
one of these scaffolds

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.830
for burn patients.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.250
And he and I have been
interested in this wound

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.539
contraction problem.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.300
And it turns out if you just
put fibroblast skin cells

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.820
into a dish of culture medium
with one of these tissue

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.380
engineering scaffolds, they
will contract the scaffold.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.070
And you can use an
optical microscope

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.280
to actually watch
the cells do this.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.880
So you can focus on
an individual cell

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.760
and you can see the
cell elongating.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.180
You can see the scaffold
itself contracting.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.880
And you can see
this whole process.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.660
So this is one of the
little video clips

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.010
that we show in class.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.480
And the students always
find that fascinating.
