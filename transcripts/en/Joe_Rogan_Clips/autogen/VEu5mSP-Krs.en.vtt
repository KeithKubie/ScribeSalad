00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270
already compromised that's why you're
 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.370
already compromised that's why you're
finding in these people that it's not

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380
finding in these people that it's not
 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.559
finding in these people that it's not

those those kinds of I mean it's very

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:07.870
those those kinds of I mean it's very
 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.080
those those kinds of I mean it's very
highly unlikely that all these doctors

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.090
highly unlikely that all these doctors
 

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.390
highly unlikely that all these doctors
are incorrect and are hiding the fact

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400
are incorrect and are hiding the fact
 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.580
are incorrect and are hiding the fact
that a yeah you know and then now the

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:14.590
that a yeah you know and then now the
 

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.909
that a yeah you know and then now the
fact that they've got these HIV

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919
fact that they've got these HIV
 

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:19.980
fact that they've got these HIV
medications so basically they can take

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:19.990
medications so basically they can take
 

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.140
medications so basically they can take
people and make them HIV negative now

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.150
people and make them HIV negative now
 

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.839
people and make them HIV negative now
right like a couple people have tested

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:24.849
right like a couple people have tested
 

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:28.469
right like a couple people have tested
hiv-negative after medications yeah I

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479
