00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.380
We know that quadrilateral ABCD
over here is a parallelogram.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.540
And what I want to
discuss in this video

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.980
is a general way of finding
the area of a parallelogram.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.460
In the last video, we talked
about a particular way

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.569
of finding the
area of a rhombus.

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.610
You could take half the
product of its diagonals.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.610
And a rhombus is
a parallelogram.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.389
But you can't just
generally take

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.680
half the product of the
diagonals of any parallelogram.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.070
It has to be a rhombus.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.520
And now we're just going to
talk about parallelograms.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.690
So what do we know
about parallelograms?

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.150
Well, we know the opposite
sides are parallel.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.350
So that side is
parallel to that side,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.630
and this side is
parallel to this side.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.200
And we also know that
opposite sides are congruent.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.490
So this length is
equal to this length,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.050
and this length is equal
to this length over here.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.190
Now, if we draw a diagonal--
I'll draw a diagonal AC--

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.940
we can split our parallelogram
into two triangles.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.610
And we've proven
this multiple times.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.230
These two triangles
are congruent.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.100
But we can do it in a
pretty straightforward way.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.240
We can look.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.730
Obviously, AD is equal to BC.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.510
We have DC is equal to AB.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.150
And then both of these
triangles share this third side

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.220
right over here.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.450
They both share AC.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.320
So we can say triangle-- let me
write this in yellow-- we could

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.830
say triangle ADC is
congruent to triangle-- let

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.580
me get this right.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.590
So it's going to be
congruent to triangle--

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.040
so I said A, D, C. So I went
along this double magenta

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.040
slash first, then the
pink, and then I went D,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.310
and then I went the last one.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.075
So I'm going to say CBA.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.950
Because I went the double
magenta, then pink,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.840
then the last one.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.500
So CBA, triangle CBA.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.220
And this is by side,
side, side congruency.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.400
All three sides, they have
three corresponding sides

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.340
that are congruent
to each other.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.620
So the triangles are
congruent to each other.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.270
And what that tells us is
that the areas of these two

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.300
triangles are going
to be the same.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.960
So if I want to find the area of
ABCD, the whole parallelogram,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.920
it's going to be equal
to the area of triangle--

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.530
let me just write it here--
it's equal to the area of ADC

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.790
plus the area of CBA.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.140
But the area of CBA is just the
same thing as the area of ADC

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.140
because they are congruent,
by side, side, side.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.980
So this is just going to be two
times the area of triangle ADC.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.760
Which is convenient
for us, because we

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.110
know how to find the
areas of triangles.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.430
Area of triangles is literally
just 1/2 times base times

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.280
height.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.440
So it's 1/2 times base times
height of this triangle.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.170
And we are given
the base of ADC.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.000
It is this length
right over here.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.052
It is DC.

00:02:55.052 --> 00:02:57.831
You could view it as the base
of the entire parallelogram.

00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:59.580
And if we wanted to
figure out the height,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.860
we could draw an
altitude down like this.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.320
So this is perpendicular.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.340
We could call that the
height right over there.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.620
So if you want the total
area of parallelogram ABCD,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.330
it is equal to two times one
half times base times height.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.285
Well, two times one
half is just one.

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:23.290
And so you're just left
with base times height.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.610
So we can call this b.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.880
So it's just b times this height
over here, base times height.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.900
So that's a neat result.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.340
And you might have guessed
that this would be the case.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.590
But if you want to find the
area of any parallelogram,

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.460
and if you can figure
out the height,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.550
it is literally you just
take one of the bases,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.862
because both bases are going
to be the-- opposite sides are

00:03:43.862 --> 00:03:46.320
equal, so it could have been
either that side or that side,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.370
times the height.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.369
So that's one way you
could have found the area.

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:50.589
Or you could have multiplied.

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:53.130
The other way to think about it
is you could have multiplied.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.004
So if I were to turn
this parallelogram over,

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.050
it would look
something like this.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.420
It would look
something like this.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.970
So if I were to
rotate it like that,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.750
and stand it on this side,
so this would be point--

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.027
let me draw the points--
this would be point A.

00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:11.610
Let me make sure I'm
doing this right.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.800
Yeah.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.175
This would be
point A. This would

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:15.490
be point D. This
would be point C.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.990
And then this would be point B.
You could also do it this way.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.890
You could say it's
1-- sorry, not 1/2.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.130
That would be for a triangle.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.110
The area of this would
be base times height.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.710
So you could say
it's h times DC.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.900
So you could say
this is going to be

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.991
equal to h times the length DC.

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:35.990
That's one way to do it.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.760
That's this base
times this height.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:46.520
Or you could say it's
equal to AD times,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.620
I'll call this altitude right
here, I'll call this height 2.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.550
Times h2.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.330
Maybe I'll call this h1.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.330
h1, h2.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.450
So you could take this
base times this height,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.910
or you could take
this base times

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.210
this height right over here.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.590
This is h2.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.474
Either way.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.640
So if someone were to give
you a parallelogram, just

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.580
to make things clear,
obviously, you'd

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.530
have to be have some way to be
able to figure out the height.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.260
So if someone were to give
you a parallelogram like this,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.145
they would tell you
this is a parallelogram.

00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:22.520
If they were to tell you that
this length right over here

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.090
is 5, and if they were to tell
you that this distance is 6,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.600
then the area of
this parallelogram

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.339
would literally be 5 times 6.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:33.380
I drew the altitude outside
of the parallelogram.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.296
I could have drawn it
right over here as well.

00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:36.670
That would also be 6.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.360
So the area of this
parallelogram would be 30.
