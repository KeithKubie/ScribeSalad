00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.210
 In this video we will try to do 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.245
 rational function graph. 

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:08.760
 A rational function is simply a function that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.420
 there are expressions in the numerator and the denominator. 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 There is a multi-faceted numerator. Let's see we have x ^ 2, 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.600
 and one more in the denominator, 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.460
 x ^ 2-16. 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.090
 It is clear that we can make the chart by simply finding it 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.560
 several points and join them. 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.710
 That would be the special graphics calculator. 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 But we want before we try with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.880
 specific points, first to understand 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.820
 the main structure of this chart. 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.370
 We want to find out what happens when x happens 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.880
 very, very large, or a lot 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.980
 negative, negative. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.240
 If we look different, I want to know 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.210
 what happens when the magnitude of x or the absolute value of x 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.050
 it becomes really great 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.760
 the infinity approaches. 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.900
 When the magnitude of x approaches infinity. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.500
 In other words, when we go a long way 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.480
 in the positive or negative direction, 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.430
 what will happen to the value of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.020
 this feature? 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.210
 Let's get the calculator out. 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.470
 We will not use his graphics yet, he will only 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.720
 try some values. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.810
 What happens when x is equal to 10? 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.880
 Will be the same as when x is -10, 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.220
 because, picking up a square -10, 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.230
 we'll get 100, just like 10. 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.700
 Similarly, -10 per square will give us 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.320
 same as plus 10. 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.695
 So it does not matter if we move into a very positive one 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.620
 or strongly negative direction, whether we are approaching the positive one 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.430
 or negative infinity, we reach the same thing, 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.340
 because we raise square values. 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.930
 Let's see some specific values. 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.060
 If it takes 10 per square on 10 per square 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.970
 minus 16, I get 1.19. 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.760
 What if x is a little bigger? 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.800
 We saw 10. 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.140
 What will happen when x is 100? 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:16.110
 We have 100 per square minus 16. 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.340
 I'm getting closer to 1. 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.960
 When x was 10, y was 1.19. 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.140
 When x is 100, 100 per square minus 100 per 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.470
 a square minus 16 gives us y = 1.0016. 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.570
 Let's try 1000 now, just to see. 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:42.120
 1000 per square divided by 1000 per square minus 16. 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.100
 We are even closer to 1. 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.390
 So while x increases, 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.900
 y is getting closer to 1. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.830
 That would be true with -10, 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.070
 because -10 per square on -10 per square minus 16 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.040
 will give the same answer. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.490
 Because the negative numbers become positive, 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.700
 when we pick them up in a square. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.330
 Here we will get the same as 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.640
 at 10 per square. 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.350
 Whether x becomes very large or very small, 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.190
 we will approach y = 1. 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.916
 If you want, you can try one million 

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:14.640
 you will get a number that is even closer to 1. 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.870
 So, when the value of x approaches infinity, the absolute value of x 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.400
 or the distance from the coordinate start approaches the infinity, 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.690
 then y is close to 1. 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.940
 Or you can imagine it in another way - the graph of the function 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.700
 will approach the line y = 1. 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.880
 Let me draw the rights y = 1. 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520
 I'll make a broken line because it's not 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.230
 the graph of our function, but the right to which 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.960
 the function is approaching. 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.480
 Here's the graph of y = 1. 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.110
 Here we have the idea of ​​a feature or graph of a function, 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.810
 which comes close to a certain right, but never reaches it. 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.000
 Graphics will increasingly approach those rights, 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.280
 to y = 1 in this direction, 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.430
 but will never reach it. 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.220
 The distance to this y = 1 will tend to 0, 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.900
 but he will never get there. 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.190
 This right to which the chart is approaching, 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.990
 is called asymptote. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.800
 This will become even clearer when 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.030
 I draw the graph of the function itself. 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.950
 We're going to work up here. 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.060
 And since the rights are horizontal, 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.590
 we call it a horizontal asymptote 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.690
 Next to it is the graph when we go far 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.660
 in the positive or negative direction. 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.970
 Let's see other interesting facts about 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.920
 this is the function. 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.000
 He may have the impression, 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.910
 that this is a difference from squares. 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.250
 This is x ^ 2 minus 4 per square. 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:56.590
 So we can present this as x ^ 2 on (x + 4) by (x - 4). 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.870
 What will happen here as x approaches 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.530
 to plus or minus 4? 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.580
 First try with the following values. 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.290
 If x is equal to 4, what will happen? 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.740
 This expression here will 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.900
 is equal to 0. 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.660
 We will divide by 0. 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.050
 But it is not possible! 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.810
 Similarly, if x is minus 4, 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.060
 we will have a division of 0. 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.470
 This expression here will be 0. 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.110
 We can not do that again. 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:37.330
 We can conclude that the function is undefined 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.860
 at x equal to plus or minus 4. 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.930
 x can not accept these values ​​because 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.290
 in both cases we will have a division of 0. 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.430
 What happens when x approaches those values? 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:00.930
 What happens when x approaches -4? 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.430
 Let's try, just like that. 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.060
 What happens when x approaches -4? 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:16.355
 Let's say it's coming from the negative direction. 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.883
 Let's see what the calculator says. 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.020
 Let's say we come from the negative direction. 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.680
 Let's start with -4.1. 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:39.700
 If we have minus 4.1 per square divided by 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:47.770
 -4.1 per square, minus 16, what will we get? 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.540
 We have 20.75 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.960
 So we get this number. 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.290
 Let's see what happens if we get closer 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.495
 to minus 4. 

00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:57.830
 We're even closer to -4. 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.950
 Let's have 4.11 instead of 4.1. 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:15.882
 Here I put 4.01 

00:07:15.892 --> 00:07:17.200
 and see what happens. 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.320
 Now it's 200, that's the values 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.490
 are increased. 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.730
 Now let's try with 4,001. 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.890
 and let's see what happens again. 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.620
 Oops, that's not what I was trying to do. 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.630
 I wanted to do this. 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.670
 So, let's try. 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.985
 Something is not happening to me. 

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:37.840
 Let's see. 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.000
 So instead of the previous 4.01 I want to try 4,001 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.270
 and here it is, minus 4.001. 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.260
 And what happens? 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.800
 It was 2000. 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.780
 The closer we approach -4 in the negative direction, 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.440
 we reach ever larger (even huge) numbers. 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.360
 Try if you want with 4.0000001, 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.190
 we will be getting bigger and bigger chips. 

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.490
 Perhaps it would be something like 20,000. 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.540
 And then, we can put another zero here, and so on. 

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.860
 The closer we go, the bigger 

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.250
 numbers are obtained. 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.850
 We can say that when x is approaching minus 4, 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.950
 y is approaching infinity. 

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.970
 It takes an ever higher value. 

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.650
 But we can never reach the x = 4 itself. 

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.680
 It is indefinite. 

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.440
 He would make our denominator here 0. 

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.570
 We see that x has never been 

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.700
 exactly equal to -4. 

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.150
 Let's see x is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4. 

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.220
 We can never reach just to x = -4. 

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.520
 Let me draw x = -4 as a broken line, 

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.710
 right here. 

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.030
 This is x equal to -4. 

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.290
 We can never reach this line, but as we approach it 

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.430
 on the negative side - we have 4.1, then 4.01, etc., 

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.230
 we are getting higher values. 

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.330
 We know that when we move left and 

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.300
 we reach increasingly high values ​​of x, 

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.530
 y is approaching 1. 

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.120
 You have a general idea of ​​what it will look like 

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:13.920
 this part of the chart. 

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.200
 That part of the chart will 

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.230
 it looks like this. 

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.700
 When x reaches ever more negative values, 

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.980
 y is getting closer to 1, and when x approaches -4 

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.700
 from the negative direction, u is approaching more and more 

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.720
 to infinity. 

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.245
 y is getting bigger and bigger, 

00:09:32.245 --> 00:09:35.280
 let's just say it. 

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.710
 When x is -4, just as at x = 4, 

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.760
 the point on the graph will be undefined. 

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.620
 Let me draw this here. 

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.550
 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:50.936
 right here 

00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:53.280
 x is equal to 4. 

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.820
 And once again, what happens when we approach x = 4, 

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.890
 to say in the positive direction? 

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.000
 What Happens When x Approaches 4 

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.220
 on the positive side? 

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.890
 This is like trying with x = 4,01 or 

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.040
 at 4,001 or at 4,0001 ... 

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.420
 So, we're just coming to 

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.570
 x equal to 4. 

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.260
 These are the same values ​​we have calculated 

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.980
 of the calculator, but with 

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.580
 a reverse sign, right? 

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.440
 And we actually noticed that with this feature, 

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.340
 the negative numbers are raised to a square so 

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.410
 that no matter if we get positive or negative numbers, 

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.620
 the answer will be the same. 

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.930
 This graph is symmetrical. 

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.900
 Having x = -5 is the same, 

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.860
 having x = 5. 

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.010
 x = -10 is the same as 

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.420
 at x = 10. 

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.720
 We will reach the same answer. 

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.465
 If you want, you can test this with your calculator. 

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:46.900
 If you test these values, you will see that when we get closer 

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.330
 up to 4, we get bigger numbers. 

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.190
 Same numbers as here. 

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.820
 Here's the graph - as we approach 4, 

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.300
 we get ever higher values ​​of y. 

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.990
 And here, when x increases, 

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.510
 as we have seen, we have these horizontal asymptotes 

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.650
 y is approaching 1. 

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.750
 And as we have called this horizontal asympto, these 

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.460
 values ​​- you can even see the corresponding vertical lines: 

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.290
 x = -4 and x = 4 - we call this 

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:28.890
 vertical asymptotes. 

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.730
 I will repeat again that these asymptotics are right, 

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.140
 to which the graph of the function is approaching, but never reached. 

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.280
 Here's what's happening here. 

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.680
 We can think of what's happening 

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.600
 with the graph of the function here inside. 

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.450
 There are several ways to imagine this. 

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:49.580
 You can say: What happens when x is approaching 

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.100
 4 from the negative direction? 

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.430
 Let's try this from the negative direction. 

00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:08.370
 What if we take 3.9 per square divided by 3.9 per square minus 16? 

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.010
 We get minus 19.25. 

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.070
 What if we get 3.99? 

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.440
 Let me put another '9' to it 

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.933
 gets even closer to 4, 

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:25.480
 this time we are approaching 4 on the left side. 

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.100
 We put another 9 here. 

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.255
 And we have an even more negative number. 

00:12:31.255 --> 00:12:34.220
 Let's just make one more attempt. 

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.400
 With a number even closer than the previous one. 

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.610
 Let's be 3,999. 

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:45.925
 Even closer to 4. 

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.860
 It is becoming more and more negative. 

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.930
 The same would be true with a minus 3.9. 

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.380
 -3,99 or -3,999 because when we raise a square, 

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.540
 positive and negative values ​​give the same result. 

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.660
 Less than 1 per square is plus 1. 

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:07.835
 When we get closer to 4 (we take 3.9, 3.99) we get 

00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:10.760
 we get ever more negative numbers. 

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.040
 We clone to minus infinity. 

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.380
 Let me draw this here. 

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.390
 Just do not touch the asymptote. When we are coming from 

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.440
 this direction, our values ​​are getting smaller 

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.250
 and the graph is something like that. 

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.430
 As we approach the left, we get 

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.040
 ever smaller numbers. 

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.840
 The same will happen as we approach 

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.220
 to -4 right, right? 

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.210
 When we have 3.9, 3.99, 3.999, the values 

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.970
 we are falling. 

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.800
 The graphics will look like this. 

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.950
 And saga, when we have an idea of ​​what the graph looks like, 

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.530
 it is appropriate to put it 

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.150
 several specific points. 

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.190
 The easiest thing is - what do we have when x is equal to 0? 

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.570
 We have 0 per square on 0 minus 16. 

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.100
 When x is equal to 0, we will have 0 

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.430
 on minus 16, which is 0. 

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.300
 So, the point (0; 0) lies on the curve. 

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.900
 We can try with other things, but the common one 

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.170
 shape of our chart 

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.975
 it will be here. 

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.360
 You can add more points if you are interested 

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.180
 what will the curve between these points, 

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.120
 but we already have the overall structure. 

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.390
 We also found a lot of values ​​using the calculator. 

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.280
 I did all this because I wanted to explain 

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.500
 exactly why values ​​are getting lower. 

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.180
 And thinking about it all makes sense. 

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.830
 As we approach, 

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.200
 say up to 4, 

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.790
 in both directions, it will give us 

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.340
 an ever lesser number, 

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.140
 because this is the difference between x and 4. 

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:52.460
 So, it becomes a lesser number. 

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.100
 Then we take 1 on this, right? 

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.015
 We can see this as a square x on x + 4 

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:02.270
 or 1 on x - 4. 

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.870
 If this gets us less, this whole value 

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.730
 on a very small number is a very large number. 

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.540
 So, as you can imagine, values ​​will increase 

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.010
 and depending on whether they are approaching positive 

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.090
 or negative direction, that is, depending on whether this is a lot 

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.470
 a less negative or very small positive number, 

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.720
 this will turn our mark. 

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.210
 However, in both ways we are getting very big 

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.060
 absolute value in negative direction because 

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.800
 the difference between x and 4 on this side 

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.560
 is negative, is not it? 

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.010
 3.9 minus 4 is -0.1. 

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.980
 Let's take the opposite of what is 10. 

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.640
 So here we get negative numbers. 

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.830
 When we take the opposite, we will get a lot 

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.460
 big negative numbers. 

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.590
 I want you to understand the logic. 

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.070
 Usually the way to draw 

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.940
 This type of graphics is the first you find 

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.480
 horizontal asymptotes. 

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.450
 What happens when the value of x is high 

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.960
 big, so with very positive or 

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.910
 very negative values? 

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.860
 You can try a calculator if you wish. 

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.820
 You will literally get an answer if you try 

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.410
 million or billions. 

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:11.170
 But you can also consider this in the following way - when x 

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.680
 becomes very large, these values ​​are rising 

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.790
 much faster - this article is simple 

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.720
 constant 

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.190
 and it does not matter anymore. 

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.140
 If it's one million and that's one million, 

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.330
 who is interested in this 16? 

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.970
 When x is very large, y is 

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.000
 approximately x per square on x per square. 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.690
 These two articles matter. 

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.880
 You no longer need to think about it 16. 

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.510
 And this is equal to 1 - exactly 

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.360
 like when we used very large numbers. 

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.320
 For similar tasks where you have the same coefficient 

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.740
 equally in numerator and denominator, 

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.660
 look at the coefficient of these members. 

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.470
 In this case, our odds are 1 and 1. 

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.080
 So our horizontal asymptote will be 1 divided by 1, or 

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.380
 y equal to 1. 

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.510
 If it was 2x 2 on (x ^ 2 -16), 

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.859
 our asymptotic would have been y = 2. 

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.930
 We were going to get closer to that right here above. 

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.030
 And if we had -2, our horizontal asymptote 

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.599
 would have been y = -2. 

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.050
 Here's how we find horizontal asymptotes when 

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.190
 we have the same degree in the numerator 

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.115
 and in the denominator. 

00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:22.220
 If the denominator is to a greater extent, 

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.769
 it will grow faster than the numerator 

00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:26.329
 and the asymptote will be 0. 

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.359
 Later I will show you an example. 

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.870
 And, logically, if the numerator is of a higher degree 

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.400
 by the denominator, it will increase much faster 

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.230
 by the denominator, and we will not have any asymptotes. 

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.340
 Value will simply grow or it will happen 

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.020
 increasingly negative. 

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.970
 This is the case with all the many, 

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.300
 which we have seen. 

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.620
 We can also imagine them as 1 

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.070
 In this case we do not have a horizontal asymptote. 

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.520
 And vertical asymptotes are found to be simple 

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.110
 we decompose the denominator 

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.150
 and find out when it would be equal to 0. 

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.870
 These are the points where the graph is undefined. 

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.660
 I'll show you later that there are specials 

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:06.740
 cases where we do not have vertical asymptotes. 

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.950
 But I will not confuse you with that for now 

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.430
 We will see these special cases in some other video. 

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.460
 In general, if we break down the denominator members 

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.430
 they are not shortened by anything from the numerator, then 

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.030
 we're dealing with a vertical asymptote. 

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.800
 If I had x - 4 here above, if my numerator was 

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:29.500
 x ^ 2 on (x - 4), this would be shortened 

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.500
 and the expression would be simplified. 

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.500
 But the expression would remain undetermined for 4 equal to 4 because 

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.700
 we would have 0 in the denominator. 

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.130
 But since (x - 4) is shortened by (x - 4) in the numerator, 

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.300
 we would have a vertical asymptote 

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.890
 We will go back to that some other time. 

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.070
 But that was not the case. 

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.280
 So the basic rule for determining vertical asymptotes is: 

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.960
 decompose the denominator, find out when it is 0, 

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.750
 and if no member is abridged 

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.580
 with no member of the numerator, 

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.020
 these values ​​are our vertical asymptotes. 

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.050
 And to find the behavior of values ​​in 

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.820
 asymptotes, we can try with some points. 

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.180
 We can take some values ​​of x and 

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.600
 to find what y will be. 

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.100
 To make sure our answer is correct, 

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:22.820
 let's make the graph of our rational function. 

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.525
 Let me draw it. 

00:19:24.525 --> 00:19:35.940
 y = x ^ 2 divided by x ^ 2-16. 

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:42.320
 Let's see what happens. 

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.490
 I do not have the set of function values. 

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.150
 Let me write the set of function values. 

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.120
 The minimum value for x, 

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.140
 let's say it is -10. 

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.850
 And the maximum value I want is x = 10. 

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.750
 Scale of x - 1. 

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.750
 I want a minimum value of y to be -10, 

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.900
 and the maximum value of y is 10. 

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.630
 The scale of y is 1. 

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.150
 Let me draw this. 

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.990
 Here. 

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.930
 Look at this. 

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.160
 Just like our drawing. 

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.830
 We have asymptotes - when x becomes very large or very small, 

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.530
 this asymptote is y = 1. 

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.910
 We have a vertical asymptote. 

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.110
 The calculator includes it because it simply links the points, 

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.170
 but the asymptote would not really be 

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.860
 part of the graph. 

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.910
 When we approach 4 of 0, we can say that 

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.560
 we are 'super' negative. 

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.230
 When we reach -4 out of 0, we also become super negative. 

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.220
 Because in both situations when we are approaching 4 

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.910
 on this side, this article will be negative. 

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.150
 When we get close to -4 on this side, this one 

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:51.360
 Article here will be positive, 

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.440
 but this will be negative. 

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.140
 Negatively positive it always gives a negative number. 

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.550
 In both cases, we move to a negative infinity. 

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.270
 And when x approaches infinity, that 

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.220
 here is the asymptote. 

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.960
 I hope you were all interesting.
