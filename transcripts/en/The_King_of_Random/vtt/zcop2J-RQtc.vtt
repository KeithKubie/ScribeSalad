00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
There's an old saying that if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.360
But teach a Man to fish and you fed him for a lifetime

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.340
Hey Guys What's Up welcome back to The King of Random cooking Show Just Kidding you know i can't cook but in this video we're

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.670
gonna try.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.090
The Gates foundation reached Out to us with an opportunity to help Spread Their Mission and message of ending Poverty in all its Forms everywhere

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.010
yes goal Number one no poverty so for this video nate and i are gonna see if we can Make "enough Dough"

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.099
To end hunger Bread dough to be specific

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.479
It's said That Bread is the staff of life and i think it's one of Those Things We Take for Granted Because it's Pretty Much

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.790
Everywhere but If You didn't Have any Fancy Equipment

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.229
Electricity or a proven recipe Could You Still Make Bread if Your life Depended on it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.269
Now My mom Was a Master Bread Maker and i grew Up watching her make Bread with all the right Stuff she had

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.069
Special Ingredients The Bosch Mixer The electric Oven and Honestly It all Seemed Like a Pretty Intimidating

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.469
process to me so today We are doing the

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.079
Opposite we're going back to basics to see Just how simple we can make the process Instead the idea is to take a Handful of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.108
Wheat and make something You can Eat Let's Get Grinding

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830
Tastes like flour

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.580
So quick update Guys at this point i think we gathered together Pretty Much all the materials that we're gonna need i ran down to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.830
The River and Grabbed a Couple Of Smooth River Rocks We Filtered some Water Through The Water filter we made in a previous video and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.479
We Grabbed a Couple of Handfuls of Wheat This Stuff Just came from the local Walmart but if you Really wanted to rough it you

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.758
Could Try Collecting Wild Grains From The side of The Freeway

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.129
We have a Friend That's gonna show you how to do that in a future video

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.180
We Used these Rocks to grind the Wheat Grain into powder and Now theoretically all we

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.499
Have to do is add a Little Bit of Water and We Should, Have the simplest form of Bread Dough we can Make

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.120
I'm really Surprised at How easy that Was and It Really Does Feel like Bread dough

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.580
You can See it's a little more Textured Than Regular Bread dough though and That's Because we Didn't use a flour mill to grind it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.350
and unlike processed flour This Stuff hasn't Been Bleached and Still Got all the Wheat Bran and the wheat germ and everything Else Still in

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.760
It Which maybe Makes It more Healthy i don't know but we're about to find out Because the next step is to cook it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.599
Update we used one of our Survival fire tricks to get a little fire going and then We Built a small cooking surface so we

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.309
Could cook Our Dough We Formed our Dough into a little Ball and a Little Bit of Flatbread and we're cooking them on the rock?

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:03.820
We also Wanted to Try a Little Bit more Direct heat so we Twisted some Branches to let us hold The dough Right Over the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.880
Coals These Things are Toasty and Looking at It It Actually Looks like it's cooked tself Into bread Let's give It a taste

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.380
 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.000
Still Kind of Doughy That Needs more time to cook Let's take a look at Yours

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.810
That Looks Good so how's it taste

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.699
It's definitely edible and It Would be awesome if There Was nothing else to eat but It is Pretty Bland

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.240
So to make It Actually taste Better We Need to add a Few more Ingredients

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.860
Sugar and Nuts Berries Maybe a Little Sea salt

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.959
Like The Stuff we made in a previous video or if you wanted to get really Fancy You could Skim the cream off of Cow's

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.328
Milk and Shake it Into Butter it'S also interesting how dense This bread Is since most of the bread we Eat Today is really light

00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:45.180
And Fluffy oh Squirrel there's a Squirrel over there trying to steal our bread Dough

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.860
Aww cute

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.640
so cute sesame seed bun

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.149
That Looks delicious all of a Sudden Isn't it

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.329
The Reason That Modern-day Breads are Fluffy is Because we Add Baking Powder or Yeast to help the bread rise The active ingredients in baking

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.020
Powder are Actually baking soda and a Mild powdered acid When they combine with Water They have a Slight Reaction That creates Carbon dioxide gas

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.599
and Yeast Does the same Thing Only Their Living bacteria so when they eat the sugars They excrete the carbon dioxide but in both Cases

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.209
Carbon dioxide is being Pumped into the dough

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:45.750
Aerating It and Thus

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.349
Leavening The Bread Now since we Didn't Use any Yeast or baking powder in our bread this Kind Would Be Referred to in the olden

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.800
Days as Unleavened Bread

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.900
Okay so our bread works and to take Things to the next level Why don't we see if we can Have a little fun By

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.900
Building Ourselves a Pizza

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.029
This time we're adding a Pinch of Salt and a Little Bit of Sugar to make It taste a Little Bit Better

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.399
We Just use an old barbecue grill to grill Up some of This Bread we tried a Lot of different Varieties we tried Adding Sugar

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.070
Raisins we Put in some Cranberries sesame Seeds Well the sesame seeds as well Certain open This Thing Up with soo we Got

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.279
These look Beautiful Baked to perfection

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.950
If we Flip This one Over the grill Lines on the back almost make It look like a Grilled panini

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.289
This One Just Has a Little Bit more Salt content Than others This one i Just Added a Bunch of Raisins I add a Little

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.290
Bit of Sugar and Salt as Well It almost Looks like a cookie

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.230
but It is bread and

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.529
This one We Actually Added Some of Our Baking powder too you can see how it's fluffed up it's swelled Up it's got the sesame

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.839
Seed top so we literally Just Made Ourselves a sesame Seed bun

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.419
Which i think we Should Cut open and see how it looks

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.950
Okay Looks like It could have cooked a Little Bit Longer

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.569
This One Here Just has a Lot of Sugar Mixed into It and then i coated the top with a Layer of Sugar to

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.480
Mama's homemade Cranberry Jam Thanks mom

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.910
Look At That That's Gorgeous mm-Hmm we're eating Like Kings Out in the wilderness today, Kings of Random

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.609
Do you see that see the way that Broke open

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:07.698
That's amazing it's good bread, it's good jam. Thanks mom. That cooked really evenly I was surprised since it was fried, but like the insides like,

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.979
nice and cooked all the way through

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.150
These Pieces are made there on the grill and They're gonna take a Few Minutes to cook so while we wait Let's take a Second

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.459
to talk about the gates foundation and Their Mission to end poverty The Gates Foundation is starting a New movement Called The

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.849
Goalkeepers Report Which They hope Inspires a New Generation of Leaders

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:33.079
Goalkeepers Raising Awareness Of progress and Driving Action By Holding Their Leaders accountable the indicator of Poverty Is the proportion of the Population

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.560
Living Below The international Poverty Line Which Is a dollar Ninety per day us in our lifetimes we've already Seen Huge

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.019
Decreases in Poverty Diseases and Child Deaths But even though The World has Been on an incredible path of progress

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.478
future progress Isn'T Necessarily Guaranteed

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:49.259
Ultimately The Goal of The Gates

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:55.639
Foundation is to end poverty in all its Forms Which iS more ambitious Than Simply a Dollar amount That someone can live on the ideal

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:57.639

Don't Know There's pizza sauce on It might Be masking it

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.809
but i think it Does taste Less Lame Than That first Bread we made up

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:27.049
Of Rocks and We Use those to grind wheat into flour

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.089
We Added a Little Bit of Water to that flour to make the simplest form of bread and we cooked That Over a fire and

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:36.559
Then Give It a taste test What we Found as It Actually Turns into bread it Just tastes a Little bit Blend

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.689
So we Added some homemade sea salt that We Got from the ocean in oregon and Played Around With a Few Other ingredients to make

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.619
Sweet Bread Raisin Bread and pizza we did It Guys We Turned Wheat
