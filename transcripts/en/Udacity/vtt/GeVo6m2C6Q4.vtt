00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.060
Until now, what we have seen in this lecture is a quick review of the concepts

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.060
that you are most likely already familiar with. The next lesson will launch into

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.290
the evolution of the operating system's structure.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.700
Before we get into that lesson, if you

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.310
feel you could benefit from reviewing the basic

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.180
concepts of an operating system. I strongly recommend

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.680
that you review the basic subsystems of an operating system. CPU

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.040
scheduling, memory management and the network protocol stack. To help you

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.250
navigate this background material, my tall friend here, Charlie Brubaker has

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.660
produced lecture materials that are available as part of this course offering.
