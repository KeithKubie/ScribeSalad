00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Now I would be remiss in talking about strategic alliances

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.119
not to talk about the greatest strategic alliance ever made,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.380
and that was Steve Jobs at Apple when he built the iPod.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.450
Jobs understood that the iPod hardware was a wonderful device,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.300
but without software, iTunes, it was still just another piece of iron.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.510
But, even when they had the hardware and software ecosystem,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.119
they were still missing the content, the music, that would go on it.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.610
For 100 years, record labels had held that content so tightly,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.350
allowing no one else access,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.860
but there was a moment in time with Napster

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.110
and the record labels feeling threatened

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.690
that Jobs understood there was an opportunity to strike strategic alliances

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900
that no one else had been able to do.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.540
In fact, the rest is history.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.310
The iPod, the iPhone, the resurgence of Apple,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.640
music available to everybody and anybody in their pockets

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.450
to billions of people was, in fact, a strategic alliance.
