00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.670
[ Applause ]

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.390
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Welcome.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.770
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.470
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.740
The Library of Congress is
the world's largest library,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.790
162 million items,
836 miles of shelving.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.790
And it's also the home to
historic recordings and movies.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.610
And the Library of Congress

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.380
for the first time is celebrating
a very interesting era in music.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.240
I happen to live through it.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.460
[ Laughter ]

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.940
And we had a presentation
on fashion in the '70s.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.510
And I kept saying that
is an oxymoron.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.090
[ Laughter ]

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.620
One of the best things though
about living through it

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.680
and reviewing the fashion

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.660
and the recordings though is
we could have crazy fashion

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.790
because we had such great music.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.350
We were all thinner
because we danced all night.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.170
And we really have contributed I
think in our generation and some

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.570
of my colleagues are here
that lived through it too,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.220
to showcasing the range and
diversity of recorded sound.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.960
I'd like to greet live stream
viewers on Facebook and YouTube.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.060
Thank you all for joining us.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.000
And today's symposium explores
the cultural significance

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.750 position:56%
and the legacy of the disco culture.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.350
You'll hear from a range
of distinguished speakers

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.040
from the music world, academia
and broadcast journalism.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.650
We're so thankful to be hosting
this wonderful celebration

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.620
with cultural institutions and
other organizations including The

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.150
Recording Academy, brightest
young things we were back then.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.680
Capital Pride, the DC
Library Association

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.410
and the Silent Dance Society.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.060
This program is made possible by
the support of private donations.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.760
And we invite, and this
is a shameless plug,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.170
we invite you to join us

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.420
at loc.gov/disco to
make a contribution.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.410
We also are asking you to live
tweet during the events using the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.990
hashtag LCDisco.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:05.440
And now, for the first session, we
are truly honored to have a woman

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.160
who helped symbolize
and create something

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.300
that we all know just captures
visually what disco was about.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.550
You've seen Ms. Yolanda Baker on
various news programs recently

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.680
because she is quite a legend.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.330
She is the only remaining maker of
disco balls in the United States

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.020
through the Louisville based
Omega National Products.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.840
She has hand crafted mirror
disco balls for almost 50 years.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.010
I think that deserves a hand.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.430
[ Applause ]

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.330
Have you seen my earrings?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.650
[ Applause ]

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.270
Yolanda's disco balls have been
all over the world including

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.770
at the legendary Club 54 and onset
of the film "Saturday Night Fever"

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.530
which celebrates its 40th
anniversary these years,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.480
and happens to be in the Library of
Congress's National Film Registry.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.480
We are especially appreciative of
her participating in this symposium

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.070
on a day that probably is
very important in the world

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.200
of Louisville, Kentucky
native, the Kentucky Derby.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.080
We are also pleased to have
joining us Toni Lehring

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.170
with the Omega National Products

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.490
where she is the mirror
sales and service manager.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.620
She has worked with
the company since 1994,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.660
and will share some tidbits
with us about the history

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.450
of the mirror disco ball.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.890
And then, Rhona Wolfe Friedman
will moderate our first session.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.240
She is a commissioner on the
District of Columbia Arts--

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.270
Commission on Arts and
Humanities, as well as attorney

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.120

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.610
And in addition to holding
degrees in law and philosophy,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.390
she holds a degree in the
history of decorative arts

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.210

School of Design.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.510
So let's give them a big Library
of Congress disco welcome.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.280

These include disco balls
and antique mirrors.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.350
Thank you again for
being here on derby day.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.440
So we're going to start with a
question for either one of you.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.520
Omega National Products make some
of the best mirrors in the world.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.290 position:56%
Can you please give us a little bit
of an explanation about its origins?

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.590
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: I
can help you with that one.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.890
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Thank you.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.800
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: We've
been making mirror since 1946

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.100
when the company was founded.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.680
And it was made by
hand, handcrafted.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.740 position:56%
And at that time, most mirrors were.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.110
We no longer can use mercury,
but we still have artisans

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.570 position:56%
who can make the handcrafted mirrors
on antique mirror, regular mirror,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.590
the gold vein mirror, all from like
the art deco histories of furniture

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.980
and furnishings and wall coverings.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.690 position:56%
And I think the best thing to say is
that because we make it in America,

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.460
because our company is so family
oriented, we just take great pride

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.490
in our work and our craftsmanship.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.790
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Thank you.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.090
Thank you.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:14.150
Can you explain the tie-in in the
1950s in America to deco furniture

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.240
and mirror and the
desire for everyone

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.300
to have their furnitures mirrored?

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.470
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: Well, as
we talked about this before but,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.940
you know, a lot of the
very wealthy wanted all

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.020
of these replica furniture pieces.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.320
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
That's right.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.390
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: And then
it was just a lot more affordable

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.820
to have it mirrored, rather
than have the solid woods

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.920
and the exotic woods that
came from other countries.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.030
And then of course, we've had some
mirrored furniture, the table tops

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:54.680
and the art deco tables,
occasional tables, I've really--

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.000
I'm trying to think,
oh, I'm so sorry.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.850 position:56%
But, you know, but I think everybody
loves to go into their room

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.290
where it looks expanded and
I think that's what always

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.590
when you have a mirrored room.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.890
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
That's right.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.190
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
And it just sort of--

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.900
the antique mirror sort
of takes away from some

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.170
of that mirrored image and
makes a softer look for people

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.890
and it's just kind of elegant.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.550
And I think it shows a richness.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.850
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Thank you.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.370
Now, let's get a little bit
into disco balls-- can--

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.140
who wants to explain to us
the origin of the disco ball?

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.560
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: No, no.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.090
She knows, believe me.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.820 position:56%
It didn't start in Louisville,
Kentucky, I could tell you all that.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.120
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Right.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.220
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: And I
really wish it did, but it didn't.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.670
And we weren't involved
when it started.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.860
So it started over in Europe.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.680
And, you know, and then it
kind of like, in the '20s,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.190
you can see disco balls in
old photographs of, you know,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.630
[inaudible] and ballrooms and,
you know, kind of incorporating

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:03.040
with the chandeliers and all these
grand ballrooms in Great Britain.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.970
And then of course it came over
into America in the early '20s.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:13.020
But we didn't start actually
manufacturing those until the '60s.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.780
We were making a flexible
wall covering

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.170 position:56%
and then a flexible mirror covering.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.110
And that's what Yolanda does.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.980
And so then a company
approached us and asked us

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:28.560
if we would cover various sizes and
shapes of spheres or unique shapes,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.190
different kinds of substrates.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.070
And that's when we started
making those around 1960.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.430
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
What was the largest size

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.270
of a disco ball you've ever made?

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.460
It's also, what is the
oddest one you've ever made?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.420
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
Well, I did a 10 foot.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.360
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: I'm sorry.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.310
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: I did
a 10-foot ball for Coca-Cola.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.610
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: OK.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.910
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.210
And the oddest thing I
covered would be a saddle.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.100
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
Four foot shoe.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.590
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: And
a four foot shoe, high heel.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.890
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
A four foot pump.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.190
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: High heel.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.490
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
How did you cover a saddle,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.790
did someone actually sit on that?

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.090
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
I think it was

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.140
for a display, you know, in a bar.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.640
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Wow.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.000
Can you talk a little bit about
the origins of the disco ball

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.750
in your company, how you
started getting into making them?

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.260
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: Well, again,
the company that approached us,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.830
and unfortunately I don't have that
information, but they approached us

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.660
because we were making-- taking
two foot by two foot glass sheets.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.960
We would silver them.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.320
We would put a cloth back
and the glass is scored.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.820
And so when we started doing that
for wall coverings like cylinders

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.800
and different curved walls, that's
when the company was approached.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.000
We were making waste baskets,
like we do all accessories,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.730
bathroom accessories, and then
that's when the company came by

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.510
and said, we'd like for
you all to mass produce.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.390
And at that time, there were
three people in the department,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.730
one person covering balls,
one person making the shells,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.690
one person scoring the glass.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.630
And those three people
grew into 28 people

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.950
within about five years
making an average

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.720
of 25 balls per person per day.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.360
So at that time, we really became
the most revered in America

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.610
as far as making disco balls.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.210
And they went global, I
mean, no pun intended.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.990
And if you'll notice,
we make mirrored globes

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.960
because disco balls were
called disco balls until disco.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.210
So, yeah, and we still call
them mirrored globes today.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.340
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Do you
still make furniture well now

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.640 position:56%
and antique mirrors and disco balls?

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.940
What are you doing currently?

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.240
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: Yeah.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.540
We don't make the mirrored
furniture.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.390
We actually make the glass
and mirror and then sell it

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.530
through distribution, sell
it through cabinet companies.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.100
I actually have a disco
ball desk and credenza,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.740
and occasional table in my office.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.660
So I love it so, you know, I said
you all can't throw that away.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.270
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Can you
describe how you make a disco ball?

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.920
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
Well, you have a sphere.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.500
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Of what, made of?

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.800
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
It's aluminum.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.100
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: OK.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.400
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
Aluminum shell.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.810
It's hollow on the inside.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.710
It has a hook on one end
to-- for the hanging.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.680
You take a belly band
is what I call it.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.990
So, a strip of glass and you
put it around the middle.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.200
It's glued on there and you put
glue on the rest of the ball

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.380
and you proceed to go up the bulb.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.520
And it's that simple.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.720
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Simple she says.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.230
And how long does it take you
to make one of these balls?

00:13:47.230 --> 00:14:02.270
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: Let's
see, a 12-inch would probably take

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.340
about 15 minutes, that's
a 12-inch in diameter.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.640
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Wow.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.940
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: Yeah.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.240
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: How--

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.320
what was the longest time it
took you to make one these balls?

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.620
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
The 10 footer was

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.080
like two or three days, yeah.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.380
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Wow.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.680
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: Yeah.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.980
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Wow.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.930
Can you talk a little bit about
the trends in the decorative arts

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:33.080
in the '70s and '80s and how the
balls were involved in culture?

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: I think a lot

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.090
of people here could
probably tell us the same,

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.310
if you can remember
like, I can remember

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.770 position:56%
in the '70s, like you can remember--

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.070
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Yeah.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.190
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: --
we've had customers come

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:55.790
in even before my time
there at the company.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.880
They have covered shoes
with disco ball material.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.180
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Wow.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.480
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
We've had a bikini.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.130
We've had just all kinds
of different shapes.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:10.240
Like, she said, a lot of companies
who wanted to brand their product,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.010
promote their product
and really catch the eye

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.620
of the public to cover it.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.410
And I think after a while, everyone
just thought it was so much fun.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.500
Every time you walk into a ballroom
or, you know, a high school prom,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:32.980
anything that's from that day when
you were having just the best time

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:39.820
with family, friends, everybody
is getting together, dancing,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.070
who doesn't love to
dance, you know, seriously?

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.000
Who doesn't feel happy
when they dance?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.100
And I think that really made a
difference and disco balls kind

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.650
of brought that, that really
wild person out of them and said,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.060
"I'm going to be in hippie right
now and have fun and enjoy myself."

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.360
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
[Inaudible] your skating rinks.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.910
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: And we're
skating rinks, that's right.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.140
Amusement park rides.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.650
I think it's just all a lot of fun
when you think about disco ball.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:19.800
And every time there's one
hanging, somebody wants

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.130
to get underneath in
there and dance.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:26.130
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Was there
one specific movie or a catalyst

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.080
that brought our little
disco ball to stardom?

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.380
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
John Travolta.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.680
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Yes.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.980
Yeah.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.280
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
Staying alive.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.580
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
How did that happen?

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.880
Did you know how that happened?

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.180
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
I do not know.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.480
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: We actually
have a New York representative.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.850
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: OK.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.850
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: And
he promoted our products

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:49.240
like for Studio 54 and for
"Saturday Night Fever".

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.110
We know that "Soul Train",
the disco ball that they had

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.130
at "Soul Train" was shared
with Johnny Carson's studio.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.430
I think that's [inaudible].

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.100
Although I never saw it on
Johnny Carson's show but-- yeah.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:09.660
So I think that that movie, and
then also we have other Vegas,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.130
the show that was a TV show,
we've had a lot of movie

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.000 position:56%
and TV production companies use
disco balls and disco ball material.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.300
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: And
you're the only company now

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.600
that makes disco balls
in the United States?

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.900
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: As far we
know, we've been the only company

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.200
where we're still trying
to find a documentation,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.500
but we know of no other retro
disco ball manufacturer.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.800
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: And
where do companies get disco balls

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.100
if they don't go to your company?

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.400
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
Through distributors.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.700
There's some in Texas
and in New York.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.000
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: I mean
they would go overseas as well?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.300
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.600
The overseas market is that
changed our company a bit.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.900
You know, once the overseas
companies learned how

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.200
to make a disco ball and learned
how to make it more economically

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.500
but not efficiently and they
just sort of swapped quantity

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.800
for quality which is a shame.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.100 position:56%
It helps us in a way because people
keep coming back although I did have

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.400
customer recently that
call in and said,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.700
"I need a new disco ball motor.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.000
I've had my 36-inch
disco ball since 1968."

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.300
He truly said that.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.600
So you know when it's made
by us, it's going to last.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.900
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: You know,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.200
you mentioned disco balls
are hollow, but are there--

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.500 position:56%
so I think of those big disco balls
with these stars coming out of them.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.800
How does that work, you know, when
you have some famous movie stars

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.100
with balls that open up, do you
make them, that open up as well?

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.400
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: No.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.700
No, ma'am.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.000
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
You don't, OK.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.300
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker:
The only thing I remember

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.600
about a star is Madonna.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.900
[ Laughter ]

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.200
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring:
Riding down on it.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.500
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: Yeah.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.800
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: Riding
on that big disco ball that--

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.100
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: It goes
right down on that disco ball.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.400
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Right,
that's what I was thinking of.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.700
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.000
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: And
it didn't break and it just--

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.300
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: No.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.600
I make them good.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.900
[ Laughter ]

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.200
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: Wow.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.500 position:56%
And what makes your balls so unique?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.800
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: I think it's
because it is the retro disco ball.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.100
It is that traditional disco ball.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.320
You have production companies
for movies and Vegas.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.200 position:56%
They have their own production
companies that have made disco balls

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.690
with video screens now and
light shooting out of it.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.470
We don't make that
kind of disco ball.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.490
We make the traditional,
original retro disco ball.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.460
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman: And
who is ordering disco balls now?

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.530
&gt;&gt; Toni Grady Lehring: Well,
we have, believe it or not,

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.070
restaurants, Kane's
Restaurant is one of those.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.070
Again, we sell through distribution
so we don't always know exactly

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.090
where our disco balls go.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:54.380
We did open up some sales when
NBC had, you know, came in

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.920
and interviewed us just because
there was such a strong interest

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.300
and Yolanda has really
gained global attention

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.460
because everyone just loves her
story that she's for longevity,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.170
the fact that she just
loves what she's doing.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.360
And believe me, you cannot
imagine how fast she works.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.100
You can't imagine how
tedious they can be.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.090
She cuts each-- because we make
those cloth sheets and she kind

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.650
of cuts all those little
facets and she puts them

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.420
on the globe and they're beautiful.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.130
We have colored globes,
we have custom made globes

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.520
that have sandblasted
company names on them.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.550
It's really tremendous
what she does.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.490
And then hang on big hooks and
she has to get underneath of them.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.260
She's really quite the
[inaudible] person.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.560
&gt;&gt; Yolanda Ayers Baker: Thank you.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.360

for a while in the '60s,

and when dancing with partners

the elegance of that and then all

What I wanted to express
particular pleasure

up that theme and reflect some

through her track "Hold Up"

on her fascinating visual album
Lemonade released about a year ago,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.060
Beyonce emerges from a scene in
which she appears to be floating

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.600
or suffocating perhaps under water,
under the claustrophobic weight

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.410
of a kind of betrayal
and hopelessness.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.290
She intones with a stark voiceover.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.480
"I tried to change,
close my mouth more."

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.590
We hear the weird sounds
of audio reverse

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:03.940
and reverb accompanying this
kind of confessional manifesto.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:10.160
Is it a baptism, is it a
drowning, death, rebirth?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.740
Perhaps it's death because she
proclaims I swallowed a sword.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.800
But then also immediately she
says, "I confessed my sins

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.160
and was baptized in a river."

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.350
As the story of the song shifts
from narration into music,

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.080
two golden doors open,
perhaps a modern temple

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.420
or even a state institution
like this one.

And she enters the music video
as a singer, not as a narrator.

Water no longer drowning her breaks

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.470

like a rebirth.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:32.460
high art works, films, literature
such as Julie Dash's cult classic

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.760
"Daughters of the Dust" in 1992.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.870
It indexes so much
of a bigger world.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.140
Even that Roberto Cavalli
dress tells a story

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.850
because it is not just a dress,
it is a reference to the figure

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.680
of Oshun, the Yoruba
goddess of female sensuality,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.040
love and fertility,
known as the mother

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.330
of the sweet waters in Nigeria.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.250
Not only do we find that
reference in the dress but also

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:04.650
in her recent appearance as a
pregnant woman at the Grammies.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:09.680
What the dress signifies is the
flowing water following the great

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.890
goddess of Oshun.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.100
Of course Oshun marks a
real place in the world.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.550 position:56%
And here I want to show you just the
Shrine of Oshun in Southwest Nigeria

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.120
in the Osogbo region in the
Osun State that's on the left

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.490
where she's depicted as a mermaid.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.000
On the right, we have Cuban
believers who participated

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.370
in the procession of
Our Lady of Charity,

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.920
depicted here as the Oshun goddess
in the Yoruba religion in Havana.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.810
This was to celebrate her 400th
anniversary of her apparition.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:45.020
The Yoruba deity of course is known
to heal the sick, to cheer the sad,

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.650
to bring music and song and dance,

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.490
as well as bring fertility
and prosperity.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:53.800
She is the protector of the
poor, the mother of all orphans.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.440
But why is Beyonce conjuring
the deity so vividly?

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.540
It is clear that Beyonce brings
aspects of Oshun's legacy right

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.430
down to her own living legacy.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:08.380
I mean just in 19-- in 2015,
she donated seven million

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.860
for the Knowles-Temenos
Place Apartments,

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.460
a kind of homeless shelter in
Houston, which provides meals,

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.760
job readiness, training,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.990
HIV screenings case
management and so on.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.500
And then just last month, Beyonce
initiated a new scholarship program

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.010
for young women studying
creative arts, music,

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.660
film and African-American studies.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.670
These are called the
formation scholars.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.420
But I want to draw
attention to something else

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.320 position:56%
because there's more going on than
just these real world interventions.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.700
As Amy Yeboah, who teaches Africana
Studies at Howard University says

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.850
in this quote, "Beyonce takes the
power of woman spirituality deeper

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.790
into African spirituality.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.980
We see this in the
first of two baptisms

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.500
and her emergence as an orisha."

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.280
What's interesting about this is
that she focuses on the inmate

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.190
as being able to tell a story.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.410
This is visual storytelling.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:05.080
Instead of looking at the lyrics,
we're looking at the imagery.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.280 position:56%
The power of the imagery to narrate
a scene, images one might say speak.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.210
And they speak in ways that is
not fully capturable in words.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.690
What I want to show today is that
it is not just images that speak

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.950 position:56%
but also sounds, sounds and rhythms.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:22.800
They speak.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.530
As a South African, I want
to draw particular attention

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:30.070 position:56%
to Beyonce's ongoing perception with
African music, with African rhythms,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.560
African ideas and cosmologies.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.340
These index a much
larger history and take us

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.790
into the global framework
for her music.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:43.710
But let's go back a few years
to that moment in the middle

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.260
of the Obama years where in some
sense Beyonce was still rising

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.650
dramatically in her stature.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.850
It was just before she became
the go-to artist for everything,

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:54.640
ranging from the Super Bowl to
the singer of the national anthem

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.360
at the presidential inauguration.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.610
And here, I want to just
play a song from that period,

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:05.220 position:56%
just a short fragment from the
beginning to remind us of that time.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.520
So--

00:32:10.510 --> 00:33:30.120
[ Music ]

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.730
OK, I'll stop the song there

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.630
at this quite striking
image to which I'll return.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.360
We're in 2011.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.530
The song is called "Run the World
Girls" at 2011 from the album 4.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.530
Musically speaking, we
can talk about a kind

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.490
of electro funk group
perhaps, drawing elements

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:51.950
of contemporary R&amp;B, electron
soul and elements of neo disco.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.960
The meaning of the song is what's
perhaps least argued about.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.790
It is a message according
to the official account

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.970
of promoting female empowerment.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.650 position:56%
In Beyonce's words, I tried to write
songs that will bring out the best

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.250
in all of us and keep
us close together.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.810
I think about saying the
things that women want to say

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.120
but sometimes are not
confident enough to say.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.710 position:56%
I'm going to continue to write those
songs that give women strength.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.420 position:56%
And all the way across from
Billboard to Pitchfork which is sort

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.620
of on the opposite ends of the
spectrum of the music bloggery,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:26.060
there's a basic agreement that
this is about female empowerment.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.190
It also was the song that
woke up the final mission

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.850
of the US space shuttle Atlantis

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.310 position:56%
where the female mission
specialist Sandra Magnus was onboard

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:38.450
and it initiated a period even
in places like where I work,

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.310 position:56%
in universities, of people beginning

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.230
to study this phenomenon
called Beyonce.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:48.240
Kevin Allred at Rutgers University
had a syllabus that connected her

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.500 position:56%
to a kind of black feminist optic,
a messenger for social change by way

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.030
of Bell Hooks, Alice Walker,

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.040
Sojourner Truth, and
Beyonce Knowles.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.400
So, the message of the
song seems quite clear,

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.160
but let's go to the music.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.570
What's going on in the music?

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.450
And here, I want to just draw
attention to the fact that a couple

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:11.060
of days ago, I gave in a talk about
the way in which American music

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.510
from punk and soul-- funk and
soul to Motown disco and so

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.600
on is often derived in large
measure from African music,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.500
both by way of African-American
music and also particularly by way

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.200
of the Afro-Caribbean influence.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.120
And today, I want to
tell that kind of story

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.830
which we might call a biography
of musical fragments and patterns

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.530
or what my colleague [inaudible]
and I would call the social life

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.000
of a sound by looking at some of
the details of Beyonce's song.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.510
Let's start with that
syncopated bell pattern that--

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.140
[ Tapping ]

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.420
OK, where does that come from?

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.850
It's a kind of a block party
invitation, a summons to come

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.390
to an event and then it has
that strange synthesized vocoder

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.330
like cartoon voice above it,
kind of Mickey Mousing it.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:05.760
And as the music enters, it
sort of erupts into a kind

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.070
of supreme being energized
by the rhythm.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.530
Beyonce is suddenly
is alive and almost

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:15.680
in pantheistic manner also
drawing on a standard cabaret move.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.020
But the track itself comes from
Major Lazer's track "Pon de Floor"

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.540
from an album called Guns
Don't Kill People, Lazers Do.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.000
Major Lazer was working

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.410
in a Jamaican dance hall
tradition at this point.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:36.240
He's a white DJ from Florida by the
name of Wesley Pence and he is--

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.550
he was first-- sort of became
more popularized on mainstream,

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:43.230
one might say, when he wrote Paper
Planes for MIA which was that--

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.730
this kind of soundtrack
to "Slumdog Millionaire".

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.170
At any rate, this had been
circulating quite widely in Jamaica

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:55.430
in 2009 and 2010 before
Beyonce decided to use it

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.330
as the central track for
"Girls Run the World".

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.930
So it is already, as I say,
widely circling, circulating.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.720
Let me give you some example
of how it was circulating.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.510
Here is Busy Signals' rendition or
version of it called [inaudible].

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:31.360
[ Music ]

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.740
OK, I'm sorry to cut it
off like that but we need

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.240
to try cover a bit more
ground than one once do.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.530
But this is directly related
to or the typical sound

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.740 position:56%
of Jamaican dab and dancehall music.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.390
What is sometimes called versioning

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:50.580
or what my colleague Michael
Veal calls the aesthetics

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.500
of accumulation or
the rhythm method.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.750
In this way there's a kind
of audio MIMO [phonetic],

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.510
a dance track that circulates
amongst different DJs and producers

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.970 position:56%
and they repurpose that in different
context and toast over it or wrap

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.760
over it in different ways.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.780
The tradition of repurposing
existing technology,

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.640
whether it's the turntable in
hip hop or mixing discs and so

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.420 position:56%
on had a long legacy also in Jamaica
and is part of the dancehall scene.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.250
I want to, however, push that even
further to 19th century Surinam.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.520
Because if we listen closely
to the track, it was also--

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.250
had a very powerful
snare drum influence

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.900
and that snare drum influence
was probably mediated

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.890
by a DJ called Afrojack who was
the co-producer on the track

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:40.560
and he was drawing on a regional
dance style from Surinam.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.750
In Surinam, this particular
dance style known as Kaseko

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.310
or Kaseko is played at
45 beats per minute.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.540
In other words, just a little bit
faster than Jamaican dancehall

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.970
and itself draws on the tradition,

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.790
the kind of calypso-like style
inflected with marching rhythms

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.690
from the colonial time in Surinam.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:04.410
This is interesting because during
this time you have black bands

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:09.220 position:56%
playing in military-- black
performers playing in military bands

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.860
as part of the colonial regime
but they shift the cadences

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.820
of that European canon in a way to
reflect their own musicalization.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.560
That's where the syncopations
come in,

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.780
the creolization we might call it.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.620
Here is a typical track
of this babbling music.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:27.360
Babbling is the sort of DJ version
of this older calypso Kaseko style,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.510
and this is DJ Chuckie, probably
one of the most prominent DJs.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:50.730
[ Music ]

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.720
Now, let's go to Johannesburg
in South Africa.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.240
Here, I'm going to
show you a short clip

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.800
of a dance troupe called Real
Actions, part of what is known

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.450
as the pantsula scene
in South Africa.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:05.040
In this case this is probably
our most important pantsula group

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.340
at the moment.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.640
I'll tell you more about them.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.440
Let's watch how they move.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:22.030
[ Drumbeat ]

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.040
[ Whistling ]

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:30.580
OK. As you see, this is quite
virtuosic, low stepping but quick,

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.700
low to the ground kind of urban
street culture that has its origins

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.340
in South African townships and
draws heavily from the mbaqanga

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.110
and marabi musical traditions.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.480
Quick darting steps,
geometric lines,

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.800
uneven rhythmic quality and so on.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.460
The word pantsula itself actually
means to waddle like a duck.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.590
And if you try to move like a
duck you will find yourself moving

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.510 position:56%
like a pantsula, a sort of
flat-footed we might say African tap

00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.770
and glide style often
with the buttocks out.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:05.250 position:56%
Other dance moves often also follow
the sort of metaphors of daily life.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:10.440 position:56%
There's one called [inaudible] which
means like putting butter on bread.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:16.030
Now, Beyonce's choreography by
Frank Gatson officially drew

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.360
on this pantsula tradition.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.030
But she actually didn't work
with Real Actions, instead,

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.240
she went across the
border to Mozambique

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.390
to another troupe called Tofo Tofo.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:28.050
Tofo Tofo means or tofo
means shaking the body.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:32.000
This is another derivation of
what Real Actions are doing,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.120
and in some ways looked
down upon by Real Actions

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.320
as being derivative itself of
like the real pantsula back home.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.730
Here is the connection between what
Beyonce found on a YouTube clip,

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.320
the Tofo Tofo performance and
then the relationship that took--

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.510
takes to the choreography
in the video.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:56.240
[ Music ]

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.350
[Background Music] This is actually
a slightly different reference,

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:03.510
but we will get to the one
related to Tofo Tofo in a minute.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:43:00.240
[ Music ]

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.750
OK. I'm, again, cutting
it a little short.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.030
One can go into this
in much more detail.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.880
But I would just want to draw
your attention to one small detail

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.790
of the dance in that
that in pantsula dancing,

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.680
there's many different styles.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.210
And some are called western style,

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.990
the slow poison, there's
[inaudible].

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:19.870
And what they're doing is
dancing a little bit more

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:21.910
of the [inaudible] style,
which means your arms are kind

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:26.140
of wrapped quite tightly around
the torso while the feet do a lot

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.440
of moving.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.450
It was this that was tricky
for Frank Gatson to work with.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.910
And Beyonce had the singers
actually flown out to LA

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.820
to choreograph the official dancers
because they couldn't quite get

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.540
that relaxed feeling together.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:44.520
Of course, Real Actions were
not that happy about this.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.310
They thought that Tofo Tofo had

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:48.820
in some sense brought
their culture down.

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.890
That this was not the
original pantsula,

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.910
that they humiliated
us, I'm quoting.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.810
Well, at the same time they did
express a certain kind of pride

00:43:55.810 --> 00:44:00.280
in the active recognition from
someone as great as Beyonce.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.470 position:56%
But, now, I just want to briefly
make one more detour through Africa,

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.280 position:56%
and that is, what about the imagery?

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.940
What about those visuals, the
bull, the hyena, and the lion?

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.500
Where did they come from?

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:15.120
Particularly this quite striking
scene from Tbilisi on the sign

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.380
which is unfortunately
hidden behind the chain

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.690
in her right hand is the sign
to Tbilisi which is the capital

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:25.170 position:56%
of Georgia which at that time was
not uncontroversial because it was--

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:27.110
the Israelis had just
closed down the embassy

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.780
in that region and so on.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.500
But these hyenas on the
chain, these are interesting.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.390
What do they call up?

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.100
One might say that there's like
sort of exoticized invocations

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.930
of advertising for, you know,

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:43.500
colonial European tourism
back in the days of Rudisha.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.490
And all more positively,
one might say, you know,

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:50.060 position:56%
maybe it's because hyenas themselves
are deeply matriarchal animals.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.970
Here is what Kevin
Richardson, a conservationist

00:44:51.970 --> 00:45:06.320
in South Africa has
to say about them.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:18.390
&gt;&gt; Well, hyenas are
really interesting animals

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:28.190
because unlike lions they do
have a restrict hierarchy,

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.020
completely misunderstood,
where everyone thinks

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.800
that they are just smelly and
scoundrels and scavengers.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.100
They do not smell.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.400
They're not [inaudible].

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.700
They just think [inaudible]
is in there.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.140
Lowest ranking female ranks higher

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.760
than the highest ranking
male, if that make sense.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.460
&gt;&gt; But the true reference for these
images is actually the artistic

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:54.080
photojournalism of Pieter Hugo,
another South African photographer

00:45:54.080 --> 00:46:00.410
who has a particular interest in
photographing marginalized peoples

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.970
around the world, such
as blind people, albinos,

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.800
AIDS victims in their
coffins and so on.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.410
This is edgy photography.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:12.900
And in fact Beyonce is conjuring
that imagery quite strikingly

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:18.260
in Hugo's hyena and
other men portraits.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:23.750 position:56%
The Gadawan Kura, whom you see here,
itinerant minstrels in Nigeria,

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:28.810
in Abuja, who perform with pet
hyenas and other wild animals,

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:33.250
baboons, snakes, and so
on to entertain crowds,

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.880
to make music with them,
a kind of miniature circus

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.910
and sell traditional medicines.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.920
Here are a few more of
these striking images.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.330
Most interesting about them is

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:47.210
that in South Africa there's been
a long kind of genealogy or history

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:52.400
of critical realism in South
African documentary photography

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.120
that dates back to
the Bang Bang Club

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.780
as they were known photographers
who were deeply involved

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:05.380
with the anti-apartheid
struggle and would go

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.250
into dangerous regions
and take photographs.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.550
Some got shot.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:17.470
Others such as Kevin Carter
actually committed suicide in 1994

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.790
when he won a Pulitzer
Prize for taking an image

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.630
of a starving Ethiopian child
with a circling vulture.

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:29.320
He found himself also
facing a lot of controversy,

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.740
a few months later he was dead.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:39.340
In Hugo's words, what he's trying
to do is problematize the very way

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.310
in which one captures images.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:45.040
He says, I am other generation
that approaches photography

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.140
with a keen awareness
of the problems inherent

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.790
in pointing the camera at anything.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:52.680
And just to be clear, a
year before the release

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.430
of "Girls Run the World", there
was an exhibition called Permanent

00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:01.630
Error, 2009 to 2010, which was
driving home the darkest side

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.730
of his portraiture and looking at a
place called Agbogbloshie and Ghana

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.510
where he was looking at
the way in which digitalia,

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:09.970
our digital debris
circulates in the world.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:15.350
One of the deep sadnesses of the
history of digital life spans is

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.910
that they begin Africa through
extraction of cassiterite

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.870
and columbite-tantalite in
the Congo and so on often

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:26.240
under severe conditions and
then find their way back

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.470
when we dump our waste
back in Africa.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.880
And here you see the
Agbogbloshie toxic waste dump site

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:36.150 position:56%
where people are trying to extract a
living out of this misguided policy

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.450
of shipping millions of tons

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:38.750
of obsolete materials
in that direction.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.050 position:56%
Pieter Hugo's response when he was--

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.350
when it was raised that this was
what Beyonce was referencing said,

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.650
you know, he was not sure if
it fitted really into the song

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:43.950
but that he did feel that perhaps
the hyena men might be looking

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.450
for compensation for some of
their efforts in that production.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:46.980
I want to make one final
point before closing for today

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.280 position:56%
because it's a purely musical point.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.680
We spoke about a little bit about
the way in which the snare drums

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.980
that have been brought

calypso style, Kaseko and so on.

Afro-Caribbean world.

Where did that come from?

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.080
And I wanted to draw
attention these clave patterns

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.380
that are being drawn on,

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.680

if I would have put a beat

associated with this
on a clave pattern,

its origins, which is in Africa.

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:50.140

little bit different.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.590 position:56%
that that clave pattern is embedded.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:15.880
One way in which we find a
transformation taking place is

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.290
that instead of hearing that in
ternary time, as said we hear it

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:23.470 position:56%
in binary time, but what is striking
about the African version is

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:27.420
that you can hear that
pattern in any of many ways.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.730
So if I play you that pattern
again, I'm going to beat

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:33.510
out different "drumbeats"
against it.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.580
OK. What's interesting about it is
that it's organized in such a way,

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.640
for those of you that can
read [inaudible] theory,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.750
that it can entrain
our bodies in any

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.810
of many different time
signatures at the same time.

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:18.160
The structure of it is long, long,
short, long, long, long, short.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.370
A little bit like the structure
of the white notes on a piano

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:25.670
where you have a tone, tone, half
tone, tone, tone, tone, half tone.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.360
And it is that ambiguity, that
possibility for entraining the body

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.400
in many different ways that is
in some sense lost when it moves

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.560
over into the Afro-Caribbean
and become something

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.990
that is a little more shoe
horned into binary time.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:44.900 position:56%
It is that small loss that I want to
register when we look at more depth

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:49.490
into what these-- what's at stake
globally into all these musics

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:53.010

sometimes to some sad places

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:57.010
such as the toxic waste
dumpsite in Agbogbloshie and also

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.640
into a time signature
that it's a little less

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.460
than what it was in its origin.

I'm a photographer.

you for opening up the Library

kind of craziness.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.050
It's refreshing I think.

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:34.570
I want to just talk about my
experience with the disco culture.

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:43.610
I photographed disco
from 1977 to 1979.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:47.240
And I was thrown into this culture.

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.500
I'll give you a little
background about myself.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.980
I was born in the '50s.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:56.570
I was one of the Woodstock
generation.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:00.800
The first big cultural phenomenon
that I remember as a kid was

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.670
when The Beatles came over to
America on the Ed Sullivan Show.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:09.420
And that for me kind
of changed everything.

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.990
I became a musician.

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:14.240
I got a set of Ludwig
Drums and I played

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.210
in a rock band in high school.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:25.440
And I guess my culture as a young
man was kind of the hippie culture.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.270
Although I wasn't a
full fledged hippie

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:32.110
but that was kind of
where I came from.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:35.360
So we were, you know, antiwar.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:42.720
We were mostly white,
middle class, long haired,

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.500
suburban, most-- a lot of us.

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:54.370
I got tear gassed in the mall like
right down the street here in 1970

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.500
when I was protesting the war.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.100
Anyway, after I got out of college,

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.300
I decided to become a photographer
and this is in the '70s.

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:11.280
And the first place that would hire
me I guess was the Village Voice

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.580
in New York City.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:16.990
And this was in about 1976.

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:23.290
And so I was photographing
a lot of street photography

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.660 position:56%
and portraiture, that kind of thing.

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:31.380
And one night, I was asked to--
I was assigned to go to Studio 54

00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:38.210
to photograph an awards
presentation for Lillian Carter,

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:40.810
who is Jimmy Carter,
the president's mother.

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:44.410
She was being awarded
a humanitarian award.

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:48.910
And I had never been to Studio
54 before and I had no--

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:50.720
kind of no interest in going.

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:56.500
I had a curiosity but I was
not a big fan of disco music.

00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:00.230
And at that time, my rock station

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:05.310
in New York overnight turned
from rock to all disco.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:09.850
And a lot of people were
a little bit confused

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.020
and not happy with that.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:16.400
So I was well aware of the
fact that disco was happening.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.690
And I saw "Saturday Night
Fever" which came out 1977.

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:24.470
And so it was a phenomenon
that was occurring.

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:29.590
And I consider my self
a photojournalist,

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:35.470
a portrait photographer and a
bit of a cultural anthropologist.

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:40.260
I like to get involved in
different cultures and look at them

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:45.890
and photograph them and disco
certainly was its own culture.

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:50.950
So anyway, I was sent to Studio 54

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:54.950
and this is what it looked
like from the outside.

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.090
It was a very difficult
place to get into.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:58:58.770
It opened up in '77.

00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:02.910
And there was always a-- they
started the velvet rope policy

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:09.370
where people would stand outside
and be chosen, you know, based on--

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:13.410
I'm not exactly sure what but
I know a few were a celebrity

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:16.170
who had a good chance
of getting in but not--

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.130
you didn't always get in
but you had a good chance.

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:24.340
So this is what I saw the
first night that I got there.

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:30.870
And when I walked inside,
this is what I encountered.

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:34.780
And I had never seen
anything like this before.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.420
I was just, you know,
shooting on the street

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.320
or if I was shooting a portrait,

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.670
I would have the person
pretty much all to myself.

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:46.870
And so this was, you know, the--

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:51.980
The word paparazzi was kind
of a new word back in 1977.

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.150
And, you know, here they are.

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:56.190
They're just like on
top of each other.

00:59:56.190 --> 01:00:02.770
And to me as a photographer,
this was more interesting a shot

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:05.070
than what they were shooting.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.050
But that's what they were shooting.

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:12.080
So that's Lillian Carter and--
sitting next to Andy Warhol.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.240 position:56%
And that's the shot that the Village
Voice sent me to get which I got.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:25.640
And then I decided that after the
event was over that I would stay

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:32.190
because I didn't know if I
could ever get back in again.

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:35.880
So, I bought 10 rolls of
film from a photographer

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.860
who is leaving, from
one of those guys.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:45.860
And I basically hung out in
the shadows up in the balcony

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:52.110 position:56%
so I didn't get kick out, and waited
for the regular crowd to come in.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.130
They put all the tables
away and cleaned up

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:59.500
and then the regular crowd came in.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:04.370
And this is really one of the
very first pictures that I took

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:08.550
that night in '77, this
was in December of '77.

01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:14.230
Studio 54 had opened I think
about a month or two before that.

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:21.000
Studio 54 was actually opened
from '77 to '79 which is like--

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.360
it was like two and a half
years something like that.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.940
When I tell people that,
they can't believe it

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.890
because they think it was
opened for like 10 years.

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:32.300
But it was a very, very short
period of time when it was owned

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.090
by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:40.290
who were the original
creators of Studio 54.

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:43.770
So this is the first
picture that I really took

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.730
after I took the shot
for the Village Voice.

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:50.610
And as I was taking this
picture, I think I --

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.170
this might be the only
real frame that I got.

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:56.470
I got a couple of pictures of them
from the back and then I asked them

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:59.620
if I could shoot them and
then I shot this and then went

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.920
on to shoot something else.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.840
But it really stuck in my
mind because it reminded me

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.470
of a prewar Berlin Cabaret.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:12.760
And I started to think about
that and I remember, you know,

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.210
seeing the movie "Cabaret" and
just, you know, the whole sort

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:25.320 position:56%
of gender-bending undertone, sort
of gay undertone and sadomasochistic

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.970
and just a lot of things
sort of popped into my mind

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.370
when I photographed this couple.

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:34.460
And I started looking around.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.770
This was later that night.

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:37.520
And I just started to have--

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.080
see these images all around me

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:47.690
of this prewar Berlin
Cabaret sort of thing.

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.630
This was a group that
was-- they would--

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:53.820
they came in altogether and they--
through the course of the night,

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.220
they would dance together, the
guys would dance with the guys,

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.160
sometimes the two guys
would sandwich the girl

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.630
on the dance floor.

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:06.300
I didn't know who was who
or what was what with them,

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.740
but they were like this group that
hang out together and they were

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.000
in this own little bubble.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.370
And I just kept an eye out on them
and when they got on the couch

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:18.480
like this that was across the floor

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.430
and I just thought that's
really an interesting picture.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:27.210
So I sort of like hoped I could
get across the floor with my camera

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:30.560
without them moving, you know,
without them getting up and leaving

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.390
which I did and I walked
over and I snapped a couple

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:35.510
of shots and that was it.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:39.800
And people asked me
if this was posed?

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.780
And it was not posed at all.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.850
It was-- They were
posing, but not for me.

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:47.220
I mean they were posing
before I got there.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:51.110
And it's like-- almost like
they felt like as I watched them

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:56.050
that night that they were sort
of the stars of the evening.

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:59.870
And they had this, you
know, aura about them.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:04.220 position:56%
And they were in this little bubble.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:08.730
So, I chose at the very beginning
when I went to Studio 54 not

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:12.830
to photograph celebrities, it
was like an early decision.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:17.240
And the reason I did that
was a couple of reasons.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.880
First of all, everybody was
shooting the celebrities

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.050 position:56%
and that was what photographers
were doing at places like Studio 54.

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:30.390
And they were all kind
of getting the same shot.

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:35.260
So I thought, you know, if
I want to shoot a celebrity,

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:40.160
I want them like in my studio with
my lighting and I want to talk

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.550
to them and, you know, interact
and get a picture, you know,

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:50.620
get something that I want to get
and not just sort of snap a picture

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.320
of them sitting on a couch.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.620
So, I decided that I didn't
want to shoot celebrities.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.980
But I also thought that
what was more interesting

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:04.460 position:56%
than the celebrities were like the
people who went there and the people

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.640
who like live the disco life.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:12.470
And I started to see things also.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:16.600
This looks like a transgender woman
with like a sort of a straight--

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.020
Wall Street banger type guy.

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.050
And I started to realize that were
something really interesting going

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:26.720
on at the disco.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.320
I wasn't exactly sure what it was,
it wasn't crystal clear in my mind,

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.820
but I felt like there's
something really interesting here

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.300
from a photographic
point of view and just

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.160
from a cultural point of view.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.360
And what it was, was it was this
freedom of expression, it was this,

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.500
you know, openness, acceptance,

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:52.030
inclusion that I'd
never seen before.

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:56.680
And what was happening
was-- move on.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.940
What was happening is during
the '60s and early '70s,

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.400 position:56%
there was the women's movement,
there was the civil rights movement,

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.400
there was post-Stonewall, you
know, there was the LGBT movement.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.520
And all of these movements
sort of came together

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.870
at the same time disco happened.

01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:20.510
And the disco was a place for all
of these different movements to go

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:26.550
and have what one writer
described as a victory dance.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:33.130
So, they were all there in unison
having their victory dance.

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:37.340
And I'd never seen anything
like this, you know.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.710
You know, again coming from
the Woodstock generation.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:44.590
And if you go back and take a
look at the movie "Woodstock",

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:49.270 position:56%
you can probably count on one hand
how many African Americans there are

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:50.570
in the audience.

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:56.380 position:56%
They're all mostly white, long
haired, you know, middle class kids.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:01.430
Most of the entertainers were
African American or, you know,

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:07.090 position:56%
Hispanic, but the audience itself
was not like this kind of inclusion.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:13.340
You can see that many transgenders
in the "Woodstock" movie, you know.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.900
So, this was all completely
new to me.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:22.850
It was just-- I was just--
My eyes were, you know,

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.910
bugging out of my head
by what I was seeing.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:34.890
It just seemed like a place
of freedom of expression and,

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:37.470
you know, be who you want to be.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:52.640
And it was young, old and this was
a particular interesting character

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.550
name Rollerena.

01:07:54.550 --> 01:08:01.070
And Rollerena had this gown like
it is, you know, and the glasses

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:06.500
and the hat and this magic
wand and roller skates.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:11.270
And he was a fixture
in Greenwich Village.

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:15.850
You would see him all the time, you
know, out roller skating around,

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:18.540
and he would bless
you with his wand.

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:23.580
And he was a fixture
at most of the--

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:28.100
like Xenon, was one of the
big discos, and Studio 54.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:35.220
This is Disco Sally who was
I believe in her mid 70s.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.160
She was a lawyer and her husband
was a lawyer and her husband died

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.850
and she was left alone and
heartbroken and never been

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.820
to a disco, but some
friend said, come on out,

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.220
let's go, you know, to Studio 54.

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.290
And she went and she
actually loved it

01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:57.600
and she became a regular
at Studio 54 and Xenon.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:04.750 position:56%
People used-- Usually young African
Americans or Hispanic muscular guys,

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:08.100
young guys would-- she'd
wrapped her legs around them

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.510
and they would spin her around.

01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:16.290
[ Laughter ]

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:20.650
Again this is-- you know, really
just freedom of expression

01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:25.080
and a safe place to
be and a safe haven.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:29.990
This is a contact sheet,
and I don't know how--

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:31.290
I can't really see you people

01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:35.500
but I don't know how many people
know what a contact sheet is.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.010
Yeah? Good.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:38.630
[ Applause ]

01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:40.820
That's heartening to know.

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:46.120
But when I started shooting,
that's what we had to deal with.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:53.450
We-- I would go out at night with
my Canon F-1 and Vivitar 273 flash

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:57.770
and I would shoot with Tri-X
film which was the fastest film

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:01.210
of its day, it was 400 ASA.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:05.770 position:56%
And I needed fast film because these
clubs were dark, like I'm looking

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:09.630
out here now, this was-- some
clubs were as dark as this

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:12.790
but there'll be flashing
lights so I would have a moment

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:16.370
to focus my camera when
a light flashed on.

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:18.980
But it was a really
difficult shooting situation

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.490
that took me a long
time to figure out.

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:26.570
But-- So what I did was when
I was seriously shooting a lot

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:31.560
for this project, I would go
out sometimes at about four

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.730
in the morning and I come back and
I take my 10, 15 rolls of film,

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:41.040
I put them on my table and I go
to sleep and I had an assistant

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.110
that would come in about 10 o'clock
in the morning and develop the film

01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:52.240
and hang it up to dry and I would
rise at about four in the afternoon

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.630
and have a really strong
cup of coffee or two and sit

01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:02.470
and I'd make a contact sheet and
I'll sit and look at it and I'd see

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:04.590
if I got anything the night before.

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:07.240
Because, you know, it's not like
being able to shoot and look

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.370
at the back of your camera and say,
oh yeah, that's good, you know.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.700
You had to wait and look
at the contact sheet.

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:18.000
So that was the process that
I went through to shoot.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.150
And, you know, honestly,
I don't miss it.

01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:24.280
[ Laughter ]

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.180
Much easier to shoot digitally.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.610
Another thing at the disco

01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:35.360
in this particular time
period was the evolution

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.110
of the technology of
the sound system.

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:42.910
You know, if you remember
or you won't remember this,

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:49.250 position:56%
but when The Beatles played at Shea
Stadium, the sound that they played,

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:51.100
the speakers that they played

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:54.500
through were the little
blow horns that, you know,

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.980
they would announce the
next, you know, batter,

01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:00.620
that was the technology of the day.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.460
Well, this was, you
know, now 10 years later

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:08.280
and the speaker system was
incredible and, you know,

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.190
the mixing devices and the
amplifiers were very high tech.

01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:20.290
This is a-- This is really the only
female DJ that I've photographed

01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:23.900
or found in New York
City during that period.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:29.220 position:56%
And I'm not saying there weren't
others that I didn't find but at one

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.430
of the major discos,
this is the only one,

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:34.420
this was the place called Sybil's.

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.910
It's pretty much a men's
club and I think it still is

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:44.000
to some extent today although
I've met some amazing female DJs

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.700
in the last few years.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.830
So, it's-- you know, they're
kind of breaking through.

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:55.850
This is a-- These are the
speakers, I mean, they're huge.

01:12:55.850 --> 01:13:02.590
And like this is-- this would be
a one sort of set of speakers here

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:06.770
and in some of the clubs they would
just have these speakers lining

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.840
the wall.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:15.250
So, when they played, you know,
that-- you know, the disco beat,

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:20.260
the base especially, it would
really rock your insides.

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:24.220
And you would like get
a physical high just--

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.380
even if you had done no drugs
and walked in off the street,

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.490
just if you were standing
in that room for a while,

01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:33.000
you would actually-- your insides
sort to shake and, you know,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.750
you would get high
just for being there.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:40.440
So, you add the drugs and the
alcohol to that and, you know,

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.210
it was a pretty amazing scene.

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:55.940
So, after Studio 54, I decided that
this is interesting and I wanted

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.070
to see what else was going on.

01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:00.970
And this-- again, this is '77, '78.

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:06.930 position:56%
I want to see what else was going on
in Manhattan and the five boroughs.

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:11.790
So, I went to-- this
is 2001 Odyssey where

01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:14.380
"Saturday Night Fever" was filmed.

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.490
And it wasn't exactly the most--
it was in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:22.190
and it wasn't exactly like
the upscale Manhattan disco,

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:25.740
it was kind of like a local disco.

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:31.030
This is the floor that
was in the movie.

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:33.920
It was actually built
by Robert Stigwood

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.840
and is-- his production people.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:42.230
But it stayed in 2001
Odyssey after they left.

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:45.830
And when the building was
torn down some time later,

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:49.550
some private collector
bought this floor.

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:52.740
And I don't know where
it is but somewhere in--

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:58.900
probably in California, in LA, in
somebody's basement is this floor

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.620
and he has parties on
Saturday night [laughs].

01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:11.550
This was really one of the
most famous clubs of its time.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:15.010
I don't know if all of
you know of it, yeah?

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.720
[ Applause ]

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.670
This was an amazing, amazing
club and it's-- I think it--

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:24.590
you know, those who knew
about it then were all over it

01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:29.310
but people are just beginning to
find out about Paradise Garage.

01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:32.360
And it had a couple of
things going forward.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:36.630
It was a, you know, members club.

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:42.180
They didn't serve alcohol,
they serve juice and fruit

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:46.460
but people brought their own
poppers, you know, amyl nitrate

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:50.310
and alcohol and grass and,
you know, there was plenty

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:53.300
to get stoned on when
you were there.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.510
But the great thing about
this club is this guy.

01:15:57.510 --> 01:16:00.840
[ Applause ]

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.190
Larry Levan.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:04.950
And there's not-- I don't have
enough time to really talk

01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:09.290
about Larry Levan, it's a whole,
you know, lecture in itself

01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:16.070
because this guy is-- this guy
really created modern DJing

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:17.380
in a lot of ways.

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:22.580
And I've spoken to a lot of
DJs today and everybody looks

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:27.360
at Larry Levan as being pretty
much the major innovator

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.820
of a lot of different styles.

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:33.810
And he played every kind
of music that he wanted to.

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:36.620
You know, most of the clubs,
they were handed music

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:39.270
by the record companies and
said, you now, here's the great,

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:41.130
hot one to play, you know.

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:44.890
Larry Levan would look at it and
go, I'll listen to it, you know.

01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:47.510
But he would play rock and
roll, he would play rhythm

01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:50.010
and blues, you know, Motown.

01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:51.380
Pretty much played everything.

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.320
I wasn't there that night
but I heard one night,

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.950
he really liked the Pat Benatar
sone, Love is a Battlefield.

01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:00.510
I don't know if you know that song.

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:04.350
But he really liked that song so he
played it like 10 times in a row.

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.680
[ Laughter ]

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.870
You know, because he
really liked it.

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:13.920
And he had a way of really
hypnotizing his audience.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.220
They loved him.

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:20.430
They used to call his
playing a Saturday mass,

01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:21.730
they go for Saturday mass.

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:26.200
It would start at Saturday and
ended like way late Sunday.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:31.430
So, these volumes that had
been written about Larry Levan,

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:35.030
well worth reading about.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:40.080
This is what the dance floor
looked like at Paradise Garage,

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.530
mostly Hispanic and
African American.

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:48.600
Although the thing about
these clubs is that, you know,

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:53.010
if a white person walked in there,
if a transgender woman walked

01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:56.610
in there, if-- you know,
anybody walked in there,

01:17:56.610 --> 01:18:01.000
it wouldn't have been a problem
but most clubs had their sort

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:07.590
of like group but it had that
inclusiveness to it, you know.

01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:10.920
This was another one of my
most favorite clubs that a lot

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.440
of people never heard of.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.650
It's called GG's Barnum Room.

01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:21.720
And it used to be the Peppermint
Lounge where the twists started.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.210
And after the Peppermint
Lounge closed,

01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:28.310
it turned into GG's Barnum Room
which was a transgender men

01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.290
and women's haven basically.

01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:32.300
It was like their club.

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.610
And they had a net
over the dance floor

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.930
and they had the disco
bats performing.

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:40.860
It was a mixed crowd.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:47.280
It was, you know, all
kinds of people went there.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.580
Yeah, there is too.

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:58.540
And this is a picture that sort
of become famous from my book.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.880
It's-- This is a transgender--

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:05.220
pre-op transgender named Eva
who I actually saw so many times

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.760
when I went there, that
finally we sat down

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.120
and actually had a
long conversation.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.650
It was very interesting.

01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:16.630
So, you know, a middle class
Jewish boy like myself, sitting,

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:20.920
talking to a transgender-- pre-op
transgender woman at a club

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.420
like this, it was just, you know,
it was an amazing experience.

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.790
And, you know, I just
learned a lot just

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:30.940
by doing this, it opened
my mind a lot.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:39.020
It became a place where if you're
an out-of-towner, you would stop

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.750
and go to GG's Barnum Room.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:45.010
Another club named Crisco Disco.

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:46.700
[ Laughter ]

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:53.470 position:56%
Pretty much a gay club but again
became so popular that it became one

01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:57.330
of those, you know, let's stop off
at Crisco Disco before we go home,

01:19:57.330 --> 01:19:59.090
you know, at four in the morning.

01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:03.260
And that Crisco can was the
DJ booth in the back there.

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:06.120
Another club-- I wanted
to hit all of these clubs.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:11.360
So another club is the Mudd
Club, a little applause.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.810
This was considered an anti-disco.

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.980
They didn't like Studio
54, you know.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.800
They were political.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:23.190
They didn't like the commercialism.

01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:26.080
But it became very, very
popular and they ended up having

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:31.960
like a velvet rope outside
after awhile too, so.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:36.200
This is a famous bathroom
at the Mudd Club.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.780
And I won't go into the
stories but just trust me,

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:41.080
it was a famous bathroom.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:48.940 position:56%
This is a place called Hurrah's,
which is another kind of anti-disco.

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:52.260
Also I went to Roller
Disco which was big.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.720
And Roller Disco was
a place of sweat

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.690
and competition and a lot of fun.

01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:01.240
And if you were a good skater,
you know, you put on your skates

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:06.650
and you head out for the Empire
Disco in Brooklyn and, you know,

01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:08.860
show everybody your moves.

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.950
And again, it didn't
matter if you were white,

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.230
African American, whatever,
you know.

01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:20.270
It was, you know, it was a
competition and it was fun.

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:23.040 position:56%
I was a little nervous going here
to tell you the truth because it was

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.470
in a part of Brooklyn
that I didn't know

01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:27.200
and it was mostly African American.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:33.620
But the minute I walked in, I was
completely at ease and at home.

01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:38.200
There we go.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:43.270
So, a couple of things
happened in like 1979

01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:47.000
that changed the disco scene.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.180
And I sort of say sometimes
that it ended disco

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.850
but that's not exactly true.

01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:57.340
And there's a writer, Tim Lawrence,
who wrote a book about "Life

01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:04.010
and Death on the New York Dance
Floor" about disco from the '80s

01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:07.160
to I think '80 to '83 and
he describes, you know,

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.150
the fact that it did keep
going and it was still creative

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:11.450
and it was still happening.

01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:17.490
But the disco that I knew and
the disco that I experienced was

01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:22.120
in my opinion over
in like 1979, 1980.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.520
The first thing that happened
was Studio 54, the famous coke,

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:31.830
spoon and moon, they were
closed down by the IRS.

01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:35.890
And what happened was Steve Rubell

01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:40.740
and Ian Schrager were skimming the
cash registers and taking the money

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:44.610
and putting it in the
ceiling panels of the office.

01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:46.510
You know, they'd come
down every couple hours

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:47.930
and take the cash out of drawers.

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:53.840
And Steve Rubell who wasn't
always the most sober person,

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.300
every time I saw him, he
go, "Who are you again?"

01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:01.550
You know, and I met
him all the time.

01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:03.090
"Bill Bernstein from the Voice."

01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:04.490
"Oh, yeah, yeah."

01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:08.210
And so, anyway, so Steve Rubell
one night was being interviewed

01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:11.420
and they-- and he said, "You know,

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:17.700
if the IRS knew how much money we
really made, they'd shut us down."

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:23.470
And so guess what happened
about two days later?

01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:28.860
And they went to jail and
that place was shut down.

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:31.710
It opened up under some new
ownership but, you know,

01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:34.010
to me it was never the same.

01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:41.030
There was a cultural backlash
against disco music, disco culture,

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:45.200
the rock and rollers
wanted their music back.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.310
They got sick of disco music.

01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:56.580
And there was a racial overtone to
it that-- you know, is, you know,

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.490
is pretty much clearly there.

01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:04.950
But it was-- there was a racial--
yeah, there was a racial overtone.

01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:14.500
But it-- disco became unpopular
and it became sort of a dirty word.

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.930
So that happened.

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:23.170
And then in, I believe it was 1981,

01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:27.380
the "New York Times"
published an article saying

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:33.570
that there was an AIDS epidemic
and that it was spreading.

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:36.160
And everybody knew
something was going on.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.570
They called it the gay cancer.

01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:43.300
But they officially
declared it an epidemic.

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:46.960
And so what happened was
people didn't know anything

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.530
when AIDS was first announced.

01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:53.600
And so they were afraid that
if you're talking to somebody

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.890
and they accidentally like spit
a little and it goes in your eye,

01:24:57.890 --> 01:25:01.400
you could get AIDS or if they were
sweating and you touched them,

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.140
you could get AIDS or
if you shook their hand.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.940
So, nobody knew anything.

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:08.410
It was just-- There
was no information.

01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:11.980
And Ronald Reagan came
into power at that point.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:14.640
And he didn't want to deal with
AIDS for the first two years

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.900
of his office, his administration.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:24.430
So, it just really
affected the whole scene.

01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:29.310 position:56%
And those three things in my opinion
really accounted for, you know,

01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:36.360
shutting down or changing I
should say the whole disco world

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.530
that I knew.

01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:44.250
Real quickly, what happened
was these pictures ended

01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:50.860
up in a box somewhere and they ran
in the Village Voice once in awhile

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.540
but basically I just
put them away like 1979.

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:59.010
And in about 2003, I got a call
from a guy named David Hill

01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:00.600
in London who's a music producer.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.630
And he said, "Did you do
these pictures of disco?"

01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:04.930
And I said, "Yeah."

01:26:04.930 --> 01:26:07.750
And he said, "Well, there's a
renewed interest in this period.

01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:10.290
Would you like to do
a coffee table book?"

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:13.260
So I said, "Yeah, absolutely."

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:17.190
And so he found a publisher,
Reel Art Press in London

01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:20.060
and Tony Nourmand, the
publisher, and David

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.340
and I started putting
this book together.

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:27.110
And I was-- this was 2015.

01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:32.350
I realized as we were doing this
that it became crystal clear to me,

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:37.640
you know, what I had here
because in 2015 the equal marriage

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.320
amendment passed.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.450
The flag-- The confederate
flag came down in the south,

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:50.340
transgenders were allowed
in the military.

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:54.360
It's like there was this sea
change during that year of sort

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.550
of cultural awareness and
acceptance and inclusion.

01:26:59.550 --> 01:27:04.300
And I thought to myself, like
what I captured here was really

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.660
like the beginning, you know.

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:11.230
Like it was like a small
microcosm of the world

01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:14.140
that we're just beginning
to see today.

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.710
And I sort of feel that, you know,
in cultural movements like this

01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:24.110
that you take two steps
forward and one step backward.

01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:27.620
And I think we might be taking
a step backward right now a

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.230
little bit.

01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:31.440
[ Applause ]

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.240
But I believe in my
heart that inclusion

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:41.510
and acceptance is a natural way
of being, as a human being, and--

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:47.530
[ Applause ]

01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:50.570
And I think we're going to move
forward in our culture again.

01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:52.080
So thank you very much.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.880
I appreciate it.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:28:01.210
[ Applause ]

01:28:01.210 --> 01:28:02.510
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Hello folks.

01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:09.520
Hi, my name is Alice Echols.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.750
I teach at the University
of Southern California.

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:16.390
And I wrote a book back in
2010 called the "Hot Stuff,

01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:19.380
Disco and the Remaking
of American Culture".

01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:25.820
And I first of all want to thank
the incredibly competent staff here

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.120
at the Library of Congress.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.740
They've just been terrific.

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:36.080
I would like to linger for
a moment on what I consider

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.420
to be the irony of this event.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:44.190
An event that really
frankly seemed highly--

01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:46.300
would have seemed highly unlikely

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:50.530
until I think just even
about 10 years ago.

01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:52.400
I mean, the idea that the Library

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.510
of Congress would be staging
this event, unthinkable.

01:28:56.510 --> 01:29:03.190
[ Applause ]

01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:07.990
You see for those of you who
were too young to remember this,

01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:12.570
disco really was not meant to be
the subject of books and films

01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.850
and conferences where
participants would grapple

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.680
with its meaning and its effects.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:24.320
You know, disco was supposed to
have been buried some 36 years ago.

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.280
And it's actually true that
by 1981, all across America,

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.910
radio stations were
ditching disco in favor

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:36.020
of really anything
else, any other format.

01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:41.200
In very many places across the
country, actual disco started

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:46.560
to shut down, to be
replaced by anything else.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.130
In 1981, the Grammy Awards dropped.

01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:52.270
It short lived disco category

01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:56.670
after having grudgingly
just established it.

01:29:56.670 --> 01:30:00.920
Gloria Gaynor's "I Will
Survive" remains the only record

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.740
to have been awarded the best
disco recording which had won

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:09.050
in 1980, and that was that.

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:11.810
Record labels also
went about shutting

01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:15.700
down their disco divisions
if they had once.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:19.980
And soon the record jackets of
those club singles that your DJ,

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:24.330
if you went to a disco, that
your DJ played changed as well

01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:25.810
and I remember this very clearly

01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:29.530
because I was a DJ in
Ann Arbor, Michigan.

01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.290

So, gone were the drawings
of platform shoes

01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:41.360 position:56%
and all those other signifiers of
disco and instead they were replaced

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:46.580
by graphics that were supposed
to conjure up new wave.

01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:50.730
And really so complete was disco's
banishment from the mainstream

01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.350
that it had to be re-branded

01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:58.310
and henceforth it became
known as dance music.

01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:02.980
But a funny thing happened on
the way to the musical graveyard.

01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:06.800
Disco, well disco persisted,
that's--

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:11.510

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:19.180
Yes, this new dance music
employed some of it,

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:23.560
a less predictable beat
than the 4/4 thump.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.360
But it sounded an awful
lot like disco.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.310
Some of the biggest artist of
the 1980s, Madonna, Prince,

01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:34.630
Michael Jackson, cut disco tracks.

01:31:34.630 --> 01:31:38.740
Even if their record companies
studiously avoided ever calling

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.540
it disco.

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:43.710
And fast forward to today,
and you tell me that Lorde's

01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:48.870
"Green Light" doesn't bear
a distinct depth to disco.

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:52.800
So, you know, disco
continues to exact its revenge

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:57.810
through contemporary music
and through events like this.

01:31:57.810 --> 01:32:04.040 position:56%
Now today, I want to focus on some
of the cultural work that disco did.

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:07.230 position:56%
But before I get into the specifics,
I want to note that there is

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:10.630
in fact a paradox that I
think is at the heart of disco

01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:14.010
and that paradox is this, disco

01:32:14.010 --> 01:32:17.870
in its classical period
was lyrically very slight.

01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:21.210
You know, even partisans
of disco could not argue

01:32:21.210 --> 01:32:25.000
that its lyrics were
especially meaningful, you know.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.520
"Get Down Tonight", "Boogie Down",

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:33.970
and yet disco packed real
cultural and social wallop.

01:32:33.970 --> 01:32:36.270
That's the paradox.

01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:41.340
That it did to me suggest
that sometimes music

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:46.580
that isn't explicitly political,
music that might even strike some

01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:52.320
as trite, can nevertheless
do political work,

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.640
take for example Sister
Sledge's "We Are Family".

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.950
A track that ignited dance
floors, believe me, it was the song

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:03.430 position:56%
that could always, was guaranteed to
get people out in the dance floor.

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:07.720
But it also was the song that
kept Nelson Mandela going

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:11.040
when he was in prison.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:15.730
Now, I'm not knocking songs such
as "Ohio" by Crosby, Stills,

01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:18.620
Nash &amp; Young or Public
Enemy's "Black Steel".

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:23.000
But I am saying that a song
need not be overtly political

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:28.580
to get people feeling, moving,
and even thinking differently.

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:32.690
And I think what disco offers
us is a case study of the ways

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:37.820
that music can be usefully
understood as a social process.

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:43.410
Through it, we learn in fact how
to experience our own feelings,

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:48.430
our own desires, and
sometimes even our own bodies.

01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:52.820 position:56%
And this is why when thinking about
music, it's important to acknowledge

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:57.390
that music not only reflects what's
happening politically, culturally

01:33:57.390 --> 01:34:01.100 position:56%
and socially, it also enacts change.

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:06.880
And speaking of change, I want
to turn to this first slide.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:14.510 position:56%
Here, I have quoted Nona Hendryx who
was the song writer and, yes, Nona--

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.750
-- who was a member of Patti
Labelle and the Bluebelles

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:25.940
and was the person within that
group who was perhaps most strongly

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:30.140
in favor of converting that group,
transforming it into Labelle

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:33.940
which recorded the 1974
hit "Lady Marmalade".

01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:38.830
And here she is talking about
the group's transformation

01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:44.780
from a conventional girl group into
something far less conventional,

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.930
much more chaotic and
wild and in archaic.

01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:51.010
But I think that the same
could be said about the ways

01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:53.670
that disco affected
particular populations

01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:55.400
of listeners and dancers.

the Village People.

and quite so predictable.

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.280
Now, I focused here on these
slides on disco artists

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.990
who are indeed really
more unconventional.

01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:42.610
But it's important to acknowledge
that, you know, a lot of critics

01:37:42.610 --> 01:37:46.540
and listeners thought that
disco was regressive actually.

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:51.140
I mean, disco was attacked for both
being too gay and too straight,

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:56.310
too black and too white, over-sexed
and asexual, leisure class

01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:58.060
and leisure suited working class

01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:01.450
as in Tony Manero of
Saturday Night Fever.

01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:04.980 position:56%
And so disco for the person who's
trying to understand and makes sense

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:08.610
of it, it represented anything
but a stable signifier.

01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:11.490
It was really a moving target.

01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:14.460
Now, how can that be?

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.760
How was that possible?

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.510
Well, in my book "Hot Stuff"

01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:20.150
which I called hot stuff
for several reasons.

01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:22.150
One of which was that
there were these two sort

01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:24.720
of bookend disco songs,
one by the Stones

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.490
and the other by Donna Summer.

01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:29.440
But I also called it hot
stuff because I wanted

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.450
to explore disco's hotness.

01:38:31.450 --> 01:38:34.210
It's up ending of America's
racial rules

01:38:34.210 --> 01:38:37.050
and gender and sexual conventions.

01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:40.390
And in the book, I argue that
disco broaden the contours,

01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:42.840
the contours of identity
in three areas.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.370
First of all, disco
evolved out of the work

01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:50.840
of African American musicians and
producers who were experimenting

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:54.610
with lavish, sophisticated
arrangements that broke

01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:59.020
in some cases with some of
the conventions of soul music.

01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:02.570
So much so that some
critics and listeners thought

01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:07.580
that disco didn't sound
recognizably soulful or even black.

01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:12.750 position:56%
Secondly, male homosexuality shifted
with disco and the disco years came

01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:15.310
and became newly visible largely

01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:18.870
through the dissemination
of disco culture.

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:21.600 position:56%
Their self-presentation also shifted

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.100
as a effeminacy and
this is a key point.

01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:29.320
Effeminacy begins to give away more
fully to a macho style recognizable

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:33.740
to anyone who was ever
glitz, the Village People.

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:35.840
And here's the third
thing that shifted.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.110
Feminism's critic, because remember
the 1970s is also the decade

01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:41.790
of second-wave feminism.

01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:47.630
Feminism's critic of 3-minute sex,
heterosexual sex, I shouldn't have

01:39:47.630 --> 01:39:51.160
to explain that, but
feminism's critic

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.910
of 3-minute sex founds its
voice in disco, displayed itself

01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:58.890
out in especially important ways
with black female performers

01:39:58.890 --> 01:40:03.650
who broke with really longstanding
representational strategies

01:40:03.650 --> 01:40:06.400
that were rooted in respectability.

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:10.710
I mean, long before Madonna put
on those breastplates, you know,

01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:16.230 position:56%
this had already been done in
Labelle by Sarah Dash in the center.

01:40:16.230 --> 01:40:19.860
Think of-- When you're
thinking about representations

01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:24.870
of respectability and a kind of
obsession with respectability

01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:28.520
which is entirely understandable
given our country's history,

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.170
nonetheless, think of Motown
and think of the girl groups

01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:33.590
in their gowns and
their white gloves.

01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:37.050
And so, when I think about
disco, one of the things

01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:40.750
that I think is important
about it is that the only way

01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:46.120
that you can make sense of how we
get from Diana Ross in the 1960s

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:48.330
to Lil' Kim in the '90s is

01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:52.480
to take onboard how disco
validated female desire.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.290
Perhaps most famously with Donna
Summer's "Love to Love You Baby".

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:03.870
I don't know what all that
noise is that's our there.

01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:07.670
OK. So these changes that I've
outlined we're experienced

01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:11.390
as liberating by some but
they were also controversial.

01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:17.800
Was disco a repudiation of
racial profiling of sorts

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:21.720
or was it turning R&amp;B music beige?

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:24.460
Was it transmogrifying it into,

01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.950
as one critic put it, a
mush of vacuous Muzak.

01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:32.360
And what about the new "Gay Macho"?

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.140
Was it best understood as
a parody or as a mimicking

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:41.910
of conventional heterosexual
masculinity?

01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:45.680
Was it liberating in its rejection
of the age-old association

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.790
of homosexuality with
effeminacy or was it regressive

01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:53.290
and it's stigmatizing of sissiness?

01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:54.850
And what about women?

01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:59.290
Disco filled the air with what one
singer called "Women's Love Rights"

01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:03.660
but this happened in a context in
which the social and legal policy

01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:06.500
that would ensure a
more level playing field

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:12.130
for women lagged way behind
the sexual revolution.

01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:16.020 position:56%
Indeed, disco's promotion of
greater sexual expressiveness seemed

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:19.660
to some to-- seemed to
some people to run the risk

01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:23.570
of exacerbating women's
sexual vulnerability.

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:25.440
And certainly, it has to be said

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:29.690
that disco would not really I think
proved to be anymore conducive

01:42:29.690 --> 01:42:32.420
to the empowerment
of female performers

01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.690
than any other pop music genre.

01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:38.240
And here I'm talking about
the working conditions.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.190
So I said I wanted to talk
in more specific terms

01:42:41.190 --> 01:42:44.180
about the cultural work
performed by disco.

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:46.100
And I want to now turn
to the relationship

01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:49.630
of gay men in particular to disco.

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:54.080
Even before disco became
disco, gay male sociability

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.900
and subjectivity were beginning
to shift as queer night life began

01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:02.750
to register the reverberations
of the 1960s.

01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:06.750
These reverberations first
registered above ground,

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:09.110
in funky bars rather

01:43:09.110 --> 01:43:13.890
than in exclusive unmarked
clubs visible only by the lines

01:43:13.890 --> 01:43:16.960
of people cued outside
in front of them.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.530
Indeed, the bar where these
reverberations were perhaps most

01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:25.390
keenly felt was a sleazy
Mafia-run dive

01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:29.040
in New York City called
the Stonewall Inn,

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:35.110 position:56%
the site of the famous Stonewall
rebellion of June 1969 which is said

01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:39.910
by many and its many, many
historians would agree

01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:44.370
that it get started the gay
liberation movement in America.

01:43:44.370 --> 01:43:50.430
Now, scholars have puzzled
over the Stonewall uprising.

01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:53.850
That it happened when it
did, and that it seemed

01:43:53.850 --> 01:43:57.120
to trigger this big movement.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.680
Some historians have argued that
by the time of the rebellion,

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.940
there was already what was
called the Homophile Movement

01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:11.140
that had been active for almost
two decades with Frank Kameny

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:15.680
who was a DC activist being
a leading figure in it.

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.240
And research has shown that
indeed sexual minorities had taken

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:24.900
to the streets before
Stonewall in one case in LA

01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:28.030
at a bar not far from where I live.

01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:31.040
Others have argued that if
gays and lesbians were open

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:35.630
to movement making in '69, it was
because of their participation

01:44:35.630 --> 01:44:39.170
in bar culture which
had for decades put them

01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:42.080
on the front lines of
everyday resistance.

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.720
Now, I want to make a different
but related argument and it's

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:49.470
that what went on outside the
Stonewall and on those June nights,

01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:55.600
some 48 years ago, built on change
is already underway inside the

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.680
Stonewall Inn.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:04.010
Now, the Stonewall was a gay
dancing bar which as late as 1969,

01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:08.520
that is at the height of the
'60s, was unusual in New York.

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.840
Most of the city's gay male bars
did not permit dancing while the

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.880
Stonewall actually
had two dance floors.

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.670 position:56%
Testimonies from Stonewall regulars
suggest that the bar's dance floors,

01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:24.630
particularly the room in the
back which was frequented

01:45:24.630 --> 01:45:28.590
by African American and
Puerto Ricans street kids,

01:45:28.590 --> 01:45:32.870
undermined the sexual
indirection and repression

01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:38.490 position:56%
that characterized most other-- that
characterized most other gay bars.

01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:43.490
In that room, in that back room,
Judy Garland, was all ready passe,

01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:47.350
she was already a thing of
the past, as soul music blared

01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:52.080
on their jukebox and the
dancing there was not today.

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.620
One of the many young street queens
who frequented the Stonewall argued

01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:57.420
that the culture that existed

01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:02.940
in the back room fostered the
articulation of gay desire.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:06.820 position:56%
He said at other gay bars, you know,
you could look across the room,

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:09.260
you could see a sexy
guy, you could fantasize

01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:12.750
about getting involved but,
you know, you couldn't go

01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:15.480
over and ask him to dance.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.370
Another regular at the
bar credits the Stonewall

01:46:18.370 --> 01:46:21.520
with making him confront
his own sexual uptightness

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:23.560
and internalize homophobia.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:28.200
So the Stonewall was itself
a site of transformation,

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.500
one that was forging
a stronger connection

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:34.520
between going out and coming out.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:38.900
It was also forging a relationship
between commercialized leisure

01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:42.700
and gay, what would become
gay liberation, an association

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:45.490
that disco would build upon.

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.620
Now, by the time music
writer, Vince Aletti,

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:54.250
wrote about what he
called party music.

01:46:54.250 --> 01:46:58.330
Party music and discotheque
rock in the fall of '73

01:46:58.330 --> 01:47:01.190
in Rolling Stone magazine,
gay men had been dancing

01:47:01.190 --> 01:47:03.310
in discos for three years.

01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:05.730
It would take another year before

01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:10.520
"Billboard Magazine" began
keeping track of hot dance clubs

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:13.040
as it called, cuts
as they called it.

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.950
And two more before the majors
began to take the music seriously.

01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:22.690
When one considers the context
in which gay disco took shape,

01:47:22.690 --> 01:47:25.920
one in which dancing had been
restricted, had been surveilled,

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:29.630
had really been illicit, you
now it's nearly impossible

01:47:29.630 --> 01:47:33.450
to disaggregate dancing
from politics.

01:47:33.450 --> 01:47:35.620
Even if there had been no instances

01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:39.020
of DJ's leading dancers off the
dance floor and into the streets

01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:42.110
to protest, and this by
the way actually happened

01:47:42.110 --> 01:47:45.240
in 1971 in New York City.

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.360
Dancing still constituted an act of
defiance for gay men and lesbians.

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:56.000
Now, gay disco amplify the
shift towards greater sexual

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.200
straightforwardness which
intend to-- with gay liberation,

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.300
would change bar culture radically.

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:08.350 position:56%
It would also change gay sociability
and gay male subjectivity.

01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:11.440
How they understood
themselves as they shift away

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:15.910
from effeminacy to
macho accelerated.

01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:19.200
How did disco participate
in the shift?

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:22.070
Well, first, nonstop music.

01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:25.340
In a disco, silence
was not tolerated

01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:29.590
which was why disco featured those
very clever segues that fooled you

01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:34.770
into thinking that you were dancing
to the last song, not the new one.

01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:39.280
Seamless music signaled I
think a break with the past,

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.020
a break with those nights when
a flashlight or a red light

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:47.920 position:56%
and the police brought the music and
the dancing to a very abrupt halt.

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.200
The volume and the
sheer relentlessness

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:55.090
of this music obliterated
shyness and inhibitions

01:48:55.090 --> 01:48:56.880
and a good disco sound system

01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.110
which emphasized the music's
thunderous base was like,

01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:05.040
as one person put it,
an audio orgasmatron.

01:49:06.130 --> 01:49:10.070
And the sweatbox conditions of
many discos ushered in the era

01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:13.240
of nautilus with the
result that gay men--

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:16.740
gay men began fashioning their
bodies into what our critic,

01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:20.040
Douglas Crimp, called
dancing machines.

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:26.020
The owner of one of Manhattan's
trendiest gay bars was himself gay

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.610
and a gym enthusiast.

01:49:27.610 --> 01:49:30.480
And he claims, although I don't
think he's entirely right,

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:36.080
to have engineered the practice of
dancing bare-chested and I quote,

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.350
"There was no AC and I make
sure the windows were closed

01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:40.650
so it would heat up.

01:49:40.650 --> 01:49:43.500
They had to take off their shirts."

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.980
[ Laughter ]

01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:50.870
Now, this practice of dancing
half naked quickly spread.

01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:56.470
OK. So this buff body, it was
about style but it was critical

01:49:56.470 --> 01:50:00.220
to the reconfiguring of
gay identity and desire.

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:03.890
Before gay men had been,
as one person put it,

01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:08.320
gay clubber Mel Cheren, hunters
after the same prey rather

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:12.310 position:56%
than allies or perspective partners.

01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:15.560
Now gay men,, rather
than heterosexual men,

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:21.800
became the embodiment of
covetable, desirable masculinity,

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.120
and the fantasized object
of desire for one another.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:31.400
"We're brothers," was the feeling
recalled novelist, Edmund White,

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.250
"We're the men we've
been looking for."

01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:36.100
"We're the men we've
been looking for."

01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:40.160
Not the trade that
might beat you up.

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.150
Now, I think the macho turn
is one of the most significant

01:50:44.150 --> 01:50:47.980
and least studied shifts in
20th century gay history.

01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:54.460
In his novel, "Faggots",
Larry Kramer or the--

01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:58.560
this is his novel but the narrator,
and it e ponders the possibility

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.950
that the macho look has
taken hold because it's a way

01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:03.440
of hiding or homogenizing.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.620
On the other hand,
it also occurs to him

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:08.570
that maybe it's a send
up and a turn on.

01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:12.970
And I would argue, "Gay Macho"
operated in multiple registers

01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:16.680
with its meaning shifted,
shifting according to context.

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:20.960
The author of a very wonderful
blog, New York City not Kansas,

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.560
concedes the "Gay Macho" could
be silly in it of itself.

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:29.250
But he argues that as a consequence
of this shift, gay men seemed

01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:32.410
to behave more decently
toward each other.

01:51:32.410 --> 01:51:36.040
Now that what he identified
and I'm quoting as effeminacy

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:40.310 position:56%
and corrosive bitchiness, end
quote, which had been so much a part

01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:43.160
of Camp sensibility were waning.

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:46.720
Others agree and point to macho
was liberating for the way

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.950
that it challenged this
automatic association

01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:53.090
of homosexuality with effeminacy.

01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:56.910
But macho had its critics,
even at the time a number

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:59.570
of gay writers questioned
whether the normalization

01:51:59.570 --> 01:52:02.360
of homosexuality was being achieved

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:06.400
through the continued
stigmatization of effeminacy.

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:10.540
Edmund White warned our old
fears of sissiness still

01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:16.480 position:56%
with us though messed by what he
called the new macho fascism are now

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:23.580
located quarantine through our
persecution of the transvestite.

01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:27.130
So if homosexuality was
destigmatized in these years

01:52:27.130 --> 01:52:30.550
to some extent, it was at
the expense some would argue

01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:34.140
of effeminacy which was
this about to such an extent

01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:38.510
that the drag queens who are
on the front lines that June

01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:42.930
at the Stonewall were relegated to
the far margins of the movement,

01:52:42.930 --> 01:52:48.820
and even Sylvester when he would go
to a gay club with sometimes face,

01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:50.120
when they didn't know him,

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.960
harassment for the
way that he looked.

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:55.690
The macho turn did prove daunting

01:52:55.690 --> 01:52:58.880
to effeminate gay men
particularly drag queens

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:02.330
who in the post-Stonewall
'70s found themselves shoved

01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:06.800
to the very sidelines of gay
life, even gays camp style.

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:09.830
The identification with
tragic-doomed women

01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:13.840
like Judy Garland, the
obsession with Broadway musicals

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.360
which suggested as literary
critic, D.A. Miller,

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.650
argues that transcendence
lay in the strength

01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:25.110
to endure a depressive status quo

01:53:25.110 --> 01:53:27.580
that no longer had
the same resonance.

01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:34.460
Now the gay masculinity no longer
signaled failed masculinity.

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:40.470
In this ship's sideline, as I said,
whole categories of gay existence

01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:46.070
as many people came to seem
antique in this new word.

01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:50.530
It's worth noting that this macho
turn was completely unanticipated

01:53:50.530 --> 01:53:57.160
by gay liberationists who thought
that the future was androgyny.

01:53:59.070 --> 01:54:02.370
Dennis Altman, a prominent
gay writer and activist said,

01:54:02.370 --> 01:54:05.830
"Our biggest failure was an
inability to foresee the extent

01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:09.880
of which a new gay culture
would emerge that would build

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:13.510
on existing male, female
differences."

01:54:14.690 --> 01:54:20.140 position:56%
Another unanticipated result of
disco has to do with class and race.

01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:24.020
Now, no doubt, subcultures
tend toward the tribal.

01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:28.440
And the culture of gay
disco was no exception.

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:33.400 position:56%
I think scholars in general had been
far too ready to buy into the idea

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.710 position:56%
that gay disco constituted
entirely the sort of democratic Eden

01:54:38.710 --> 01:54:45.960
but it is clear that, to me at
least, that A-list gay discos,

01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:49.880
those that required a good
amount of money to join,

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.430
had a problematic effect.

01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:58.500
I mean, it could be very difficult

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:01.580
to get pass the doorman
in certain clubs.

01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:06.130
For instance, close to
impossible if you were a woman,

01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:09.140
even Bette Midler was stood
high to membership at one

01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:12.800
of the most prominent
gay clubs in New York.

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:17.070
Throughout the '70s and beyond,
gay newspapers were often filled

01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:21.940
with stories of discrimination
at discos.

01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:26.860
So, you know, at the same
time that there was the sense

01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:33.500 position:56%
of brotherly love as I've indicated,
it had a distinct downturn

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:39.270 position:56%
which was the pull towards a
greater class and racial homogeneity

01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:43.700 position:56%
which in tandem with gentrification,
something you guys know a lot

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:47.260 position:56%
about here in DC, made for gay clubs

01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:52.200
that were increasingly segmented
along class and race lines.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.990
So, the racial and class
crossings that for--

01:55:55.990 --> 01:56:01.610
had for so long characterized
gay communities and bracket this,

01:56:01.610 --> 01:56:03.550
read George Chauncey's
"Gay New York"

01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:07.170
if doub it, that began to fade.

01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:10.950
Something else I think that gay
liberation has didn't get quite

01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:15.710
right was the relationship of
new gay communities to commerce.

01:56:15.710 --> 01:56:19.050
As it happened, the beneficiary
of gay liberations cry

01:56:19.050 --> 01:56:23.650
out of the closets and into streets
was not so much gay liberation

01:56:23.650 --> 01:56:25.530
and the movement around it.

01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:28.910
It was the discos and
bathhouses that emerged

01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:36.290
that really became the
kind of glue for community.

01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:41.170
Now, despite discos,
that possible downside,

01:56:41.170 --> 01:56:44.890
again that could be debated, the
commercialism of disco culture.

01:56:44.890 --> 01:56:48.010
It was nonetheless
through disco that gay men

01:56:48.010 --> 01:56:51.780
of the '70s charted a course
that really permitted them

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:54.520
to feel sexually legible
to each other,

01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:56.690
to reject the prevailing
construction

01:56:56.690 --> 01:56:58.390
of gay masculinity as defective.

01:56:58.390 --> 01:57:01.690
It was on the disco dance
floor, surging with energy

01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:04.060
of so many bodies becoming one.

01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:08.130
The gay men created an alternate
sexual subjectivity in them,

01:57:08.130 --> 01:57:11.540
powerful feeling of solidarity.

01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:15.800
This makes-- This-- What I'm going
to say might seem counterintuitive

01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:18.070
but the hedonistic promiscuity

01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:21.890
which certainly characterized
gay disco seems

01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:26.250
to have actually enabled
communal aspiration

01:57:26.250 --> 01:57:30.280
as Michael Warner has argued
rather than impeding it.

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.610
One sees this in the
years when gay men began

01:57:33.610 --> 01:57:36.130
to fall sick and die of AIDS.

01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:40.160
Those dance floor communities that
have been building for years became

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.460
for many gay men with HIV
their real support community.

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:47.010
And I'm going to end here.

01:57:47.010 --> 01:57:48.810
Thank you.

01:57:48.810 --> 01:58:05.430
[ Applause ]

01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:07.600
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Hi everyone.

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.900
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] Hello.

01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:11.150
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: I hope
everyone is getting excited

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:12.450
for the rest of today.

01:58:12.450 --> 01:58:14.790
There's a lot of awesome
stuff going on.

01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:18.160
And we really appreciate your being
here throughout this symposium

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.800
for Bibliodiscotheque.

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.100
My name is Nicholas Brown.

01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:22.770
I'm one of the producers
of the series.

01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:25.510
I work in the music
division here at the Library.

01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:30.800 position:56%
I come from a conductor, French
horn player, singer, music colleges,

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:33.580 position:56%
arts administrator kind of pedigree.

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:37.400
And a-- And so with great pleasure
that we are all gathering here

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:40.280
on stage to a bit of a discussion

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:43.300
and then open it up
for your questions.

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:47.460
And we of course have Martin
and Alice and Bill back on stage

01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:50.120
who have given us some wonderful
lectures this afternoon.

01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:53.000
Giving a really-- a range of
the different elements that go

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.730
into dance culture from
the disco area and also

01:58:56.730 --> 01:58:58.880
in a more contemporary settings.

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:04.190
So, I'd like to just
start by asking you.

01:59:04.190 --> 01:59:09.080
Where is disco now compared
to where it was 10 years ago

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:11.590
in terms of cultural memory?

01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:13.610
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: In
terms of cultural memory?

01:59:13.610 --> 01:59:16.740
Oh, I think everything has changed.

01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:20.290
I mean, one of the things
that I was very struck

01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:25.540
by when I first began writing about
disco, I think it was in 1994,

01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:28.380
I published an article
in the "LA Weekly".

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.690
And, oh my goodness,
some of the letters

01:59:32.690 --> 01:59:36.810
to the editor were so vicious.

01:59:36.810 --> 01:59:41.140
I was shocked and I was
used to disco haters.

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.140
I mean, disco although
I was a DJ in Ann Arbor.

01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:47.180
Ann Arbor was a punk town,
it wasn't a disco town,

01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:52.360
and those lines were very much
strong in the 1970s and '80s.

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:55.910
When my book came out in 2010,

01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:59.190
it was an entirely different
environment because young people,

01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:03.040
for the most part they don't
know about discophobia.

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.820
They don't know about the time

02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:08.040
when disco had been the
biggest cultural joke

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.890
of the 20th century, right?

02:00:09.890 --> 02:00:13.040
So I think everything has
shifted and of course,

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:15.750
disco permeates popular music.

02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:21.130
I mean, there's disco-- as I
was saying, disco never died.

02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:26.160
So I think it's-- you know, I
think it's entirely different now.

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:30.010
To answer you fully would be
take much-- too much time.

02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:34.770
But I think it is true that
in some sense the culture wars

02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:39.840
in the US people usually
focus on abortion,

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.000
what's say affirmative action.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.370
But I think the ERA,
the 1970s and beyond,

02:00:45.370 --> 02:00:50.040
I think that disco was very much
a part of those culture wars.

02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:51.870
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Martin, could
you share us some of the sort

02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:54.190
of more international
perspective on American disco

02:00:54.190 --> 02:00:57.120
and then the divergence with other
countries kind of disco cultures

02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.760
and how they're similar
or how they're different.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:01.060
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yeah.

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:03.560
And especially in relation
to the contemporary question,

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:05.840
because I think a strong
point you make is

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:09.410
that even though the semiotics
around disco change and then partly

02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:14.320 position:56%
out of perhaps some embarrassment
about its, you know, apparently sort

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.910
of [inaudible] character and so on.

02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:19.930 position:56%
And then these associations with,
you know, gay subcultures and so on,

02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:25.450
which help to marginalize
it as a kind of movement.

02:01:25.450 --> 02:01:28.360
But then that becomes
sort of transforming

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.360
into the more palatable
kind of dance music.

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.150
Now we can't even imagine
the last 30,

02:01:33.150 --> 02:01:37.560
40 years without dance music
being front and center.

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.730
Whether it's, you know-- whether
that's a trance music, house music,

02:01:41.730 --> 02:01:44.570
however this is all be-- you
know, garage music and on and on,

02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:46.770
the genre is proliferate
in some sense.

02:01:46.770 --> 02:01:49.000
But it was disco in
some ways that provided

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.580
that foundational moment
for all of that.

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:55.190
And in the-- just of the
folks that I mentioned

02:01:55.190 --> 02:01:59.060
in my presentation thinking
of-- I might have lost sound.

02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.360
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:01.660
It's--

02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:02.960
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.260
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger:
Did I lose sound?

02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:05.930
But the folks that I
mentioned in my presentation

02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:09.170
such as the kwaito music
in South Africa today,

02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:13.260
which is really something as oppose
to party kind of music that is run

02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:15.160
on automated digital machinery,

02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:17.380
which I think is a very
important kind of the disco

02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:20.160
by the way is the technologies
that came

02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:22.290
into the mainstream at that point.

02:02:22.290 --> 02:02:26.450
The TR33 drum machine for example,
right, as being somehow a place

02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:31.240
in which you could now organize
rhythms using a different way

02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:32.640
of interfacing with your machines.

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:36.410
It was no longer that embodied
kind of work being done usually

02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:38.800
by a white male heterosexual
drummer with all

02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.420
of that expressive apparatus.

02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:46.930
Now you had a drum machine in South
Africa that's kwaito music is one

02:02:46.930 --> 02:02:49.970
of the first music to which
you can now purely dance

02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:52.370
like those consular we're doing

02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:55.490
and the music auto-generates
in some ways.

02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:59.070
And it's been, you know,
sort of feedback loop

02:02:59.070 --> 02:03:01.990
between continents produce
that, so it's a house music

02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:03.830
but slowed down this time.

02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:06.560
And, you know, it's understood
to be a kind of slowed

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:09.600
down garage house music
that is itself ricocheting

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:12.640
with American elements and
then being re-Africanized

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:14.610
and re-Creolized in
these other spaces.

02:03:14.610 --> 02:03:15.910
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: The only thing

02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:18.640
that I would add is the
early disco however--

02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:23.450 position:56%
although, disco was always attacked
as plastic music for plastic people.

02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:27.020
I mean, that was one of the
criticisms that was made.

02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:32.060
I mean early disco did not use
synthesizers or drum machines.

02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:33.910
That does develop.

02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:37.250
But in the early years,
it wasn't a feature of it.

02:03:37.250 --> 02:03:40.350
They used full orchestras.

02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:45.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Question for Bill
is how has kind of the disco era

02:03:45.090 --> 02:03:51.370 position:56%
and the disco culture differentiated
in how it is portrayed and still

02:03:51.370 --> 02:03:54.120
and moving images since the era,
like has there been an evolution

02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.820
in terms of like how the film 54
was, you know, portraying Studio 54

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:00.810
in the culture or other, you know,

02:04:00.810 --> 02:04:04.510
the marketing for the peer
disco CDs from the '90s.

02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:05.810
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:07.190
Well, I haven't seen
the movie before.

02:04:07.190 --> 02:04:11.670
But there's a TV show
called "The Get Down",

02:04:11.670 --> 02:04:16.390
which is a disco, you
know, based show.

02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:19.100
And I watched about
two or three episodes

02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:20.800
and I basically couldn't
watch it anymore.

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.350
I mean, it just so-- it's so
packaged for commercial TV and,

02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:31.720
you know, it's-- you know,
it had some of the elements

02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:33.930
of the disco that I remember.

02:04:33.930 --> 02:04:42.790
But it was, you know, that
particular time was so unique and,

02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:46.680
you know, like I said before, you
know, there were so many factors

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:51.930
that contributed to that, you
know, perfect storm that, you know,

02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:55.330
you can't really-- they can't
do that again for example.

02:04:55.330 --> 02:04:59.240
I mean, you couldn't create a
disco again just because those--

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:00.960
it's a different time, you know.

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:06.250
And it's usually different,
you know, people are different.

02:05:06.250 --> 02:05:09.760
So I haven't seen anything
like currently, you know,

02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:16.080
that really captures the essence
of what I saw during that period.

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.380
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:20.840
And one question for all of you
which is going to be very thematic

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:26.250 position:56%
to the Library of Congress, of
course, and I'm a librarian too, so.

02:05:26.250 --> 02:05:30.520
What is the role of Library's
archives and museums in terms

02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:34.070
of providing access to the research
that can happen and discovery

02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:38.350
that can happen about an era or
a musical movement such as disco?

02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:42.790
And is there a significance
that, you know,

02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:44.450
the Library of Congress
is programming disco,

02:05:44.450 --> 02:05:49.390 position:56%
does that do something for the study
of disco or is it more important

02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:53.310
that local public libraries are
doing something related to it.

02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:54.610
I don't know.

02:05:54.610 --> 02:05:57.000
Just like to open the floor
on that kind of topic.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.840
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Well, I would love
to have it happening at all levels.

02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:03.100
I think it's wonderful
that the Library

02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.060
of Congress has put this event on.

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:06.790
I just think it's terrific.

02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:12.410
But I mean I know in my own
research what was really important

02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:21.100 position:56%
to me was going to England actually,
and using some libraries in England

02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:26.820
where I was able to look at the
music press because the music press

02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:33.560
in Britain actually was much more
sympathetic to this new sound than,

02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:36.920
let's say Rolling Stone or some
of the American music press.

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:42.150
So just in my own research
it was really important.

02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:43.450
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yeah.

02:06:43.450 --> 02:06:44.750
I mean, it's fascinating.

02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:46.490
I haven't-- I don't do an
archival work in disco.

02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:51.930
But from-- you know, from the
project I've alluded to you today

02:06:51.930 --> 02:06:55.260
in my presentation, I'm
looking at the global biography

02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:57.860
of rhythmic sounds and so on.

02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:02.920
And particularly emanating from
Africa and then taking up residency

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:07.120
within dance musical forms in the
west and also right across through

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:08.420
at your classically music forms.

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:11.030
So that's broadly speaking
where my project is.

02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:14.820
To find out anything about how
this actually happens historically,

02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:18.870
I have been utterly dependent on
libraries, mainly in Europe as well

02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:23.440
but also here that, you
know, indicate what kinds

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:27.170
of contact was there, what were
the ethnographic transcriptions,

02:07:27.170 --> 02:07:29.730
when did, who travel where,
what letters were written

02:07:29.730 --> 02:07:32.270
between an ethnographer
or between a composer

02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:36.020
and say an African
ethnographer and so on?

02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:39.050
And then movement of tape and
cassette and vinyl, and computers,

02:07:39.050 --> 02:07:41.990
all of this media that
carry imprints

02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:43.290
of what might have happened.

02:07:43.290 --> 02:07:45.710
I mean, Alice is a
historian which is, you know,

02:07:45.710 --> 02:07:47.730
so she'll know the
truth [inaudible].

02:07:47.730 --> 02:07:51.180
But reconstructing
history is a no mean feat.

02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:55.490
It gets forgotten even if
it is assumed by some of us

02:07:55.490 --> 02:07:58.400
that have lived through certain
periods, it really leaves--

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:00.890
it needs to leave traces
and documents.

02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:04.410
And I think libraries are
essential even if they don't seem

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:07.880
like very populated spaces, it
takes that special researcher

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:14.590
to really bring it back to us
libraries have been essential.

02:08:14.590 --> 02:08:16.870
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: The only
thing I can comment on that is

02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:22.430
that there was an article in
German Rolling Stone in November

02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:26.610
and I had it translated
by my German friend.

02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:30.240
And they used pictures from
my book to illustrate it.

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:37.550
And the writer described how
back in the early Nazi days,

02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:44.190
there was a kind of what was
the disco of today in the sense

02:08:44.190 --> 02:08:50.560
that the youth who were
maybe politically apathetical

02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:55.710
or apolitical, you know,
they would meet sort

02:08:55.710 --> 02:08:59.670 position:56%
of underground and they would dance.

02:08:59.670 --> 02:09:03.040
And it was kind of a
rebellion sort of thing.

02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:06.580
But they would do that and they
would talk a little bit about,

02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:08.970
you know, what we're going
to do in the politics

02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:10.270
and things that were going on.

02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:14.840
But it's really like a
celebration of just being not part

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:16.280
of what was happening in the world.

02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:19.110
It was like a, you
know, a private event.

02:09:19.110 --> 02:09:24.160
So he was trying to sort
of trace back, you know,

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:31.650
what happened in New York to
that early, you know, 1939 era.

02:09:31.650 --> 02:09:34.960
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: And I would
say also just to add this.

02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:38.350
I mean since the early
adapters of disco music,

02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:42.650
we're a marginalized group.

02:09:42.650 --> 02:09:47.270
It's especially important
that we have documentation

02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:51.090
and it makes it especially
difficult too.

02:09:51.090 --> 02:09:53.360
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: So how
would you document your DJ sets

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.640 position:56%
if you were to do it all over again?

02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:57.590
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: That
would be easy actually.

02:09:57.590 --> 02:09:58.890
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Yeah?

02:09:58.890 --> 02:10:00.190
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:10:00.190 --> 02:10:01.490
Very easy.

02:10:01.490 --> 02:10:02.790
It's not difficult.

02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:04.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Do you use like
some cloud or that type of thing?

02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:05.390
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Well no,
I mean I don't myself.

02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:06.690
Believe me, I hardly have the time.

02:10:06.690 --> 02:10:11.450
But I have some of those
sets that are written down.

02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:15.730
And I had beats per
minute charts, you know.

02:10:15.730 --> 02:10:18.440
And so I didn't do this
for a very long time.

02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:20.160
It was only for a few years.

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.300
And so I have a pretty good
sense of what I would segue.

02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:24.550
And then I also practiced a lot.

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:28.510
And because I was not a
natural born mixer, all right.

02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:31.340
So making that segue
from one song to the next

02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:33.910
which in those years were
so critical, you know.

02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:35.990
You really had to do it seamlessly.

02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:40.450
You know, I practice a lot and
I would make tapes for friends.

02:10:40.450 --> 02:10:42.060
And so I still have
some of those tapes.

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:45.050
So I have a pretty good
sense of what I was doing.

02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:46.350
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Cool.

02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:49.000
And with your photography, how
do you archive it for yourself

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.450
or do you even-- well you
have to do that because

02:10:52.450 --> 02:10:55.020
or else you're not going to
be disseminating it, right?

02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:56.320
You have to have it
organized in such--

02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:57.620
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:58.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Were you
thinking about it in this--

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:00.750
the archival sense of long
term where it's going to go

02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:02.960
or is it just the working
kind of archive?

02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:04.310
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Well
it's a body of work

02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:08.310
that is you know, now
complete obviously.

02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:12.630
And you know the book that I--
that was produced, the "Disco,

02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:16.470
The Bill Bernstein Photographs"
is a volume of that work.

02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:20.660
And I was trying to cover as much

02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:24.520
as we could in, you
know, a short space.

02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:29.490
I have 4, 500 rolls of film that
I shot during that time period.

02:11:29.490 --> 02:11:32.880
And there's probably two or three
other volumes that could be--

02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:34.510
might have produced from there.

02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:38.710
But-- And they would have different
feelings to them, you know,

02:11:38.710 --> 02:11:42.290
different you know, covering
different subject matter.

02:11:42.290 --> 02:11:48.580
But it's all just-- you know,
on my computer at this point

02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:54.710 position:56%
and I do get requests from different
people for different purposes,

02:11:54.710 --> 02:12:00.800
you know, articles, and pieces--
do you have a picture of the club,

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:02.420
you know, that kind of thing.

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:07.990
So you know, it's just
sitting there at this point.

02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:09.290
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Cool.

02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:10.960
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: I
wanted to just add something

02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:13.590 position:56%
since we're talking about
documentation and archives and so on

02:12:13.590 --> 02:12:19.590
and the challenge that the
archive presents and non archive.

02:12:19.590 --> 02:12:22.450
Just to amplify your point in
relation to some of the work

02:12:22.450 --> 02:12:25.740
that I'm doing which is not
just marginalized communities

02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.040
but to some extent you know,

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.520
in geographically remote spaces
sometimes involving musical

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.500
traditions that are withering
and don't have a record.

02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:38.290
It doesn't have a history of for
example documentation by notation

02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:41.570
but other modes of transmission
and that are not the same,

02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:43.350
sometimes more effective
than notation.

02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:44.930
This isn't saying notation
is better.

02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:46.350
It's just a different
kind of document

02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:49.160
that survives a few
more days of time.

02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:56.050
But that challenge is, you
know, another layer particularly

02:12:56.050 --> 02:12:57.910
if you're trying to
access deep history.

02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:59.990
So if for example with the--

02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:02.040
with some of the patterns
that I was tracing,

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.910
if you look at the Wikipedia
page or the blogosphere

02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:08.500
or the mainstream media
or the big media,

02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:12.500
I call it the mainstream is gone
become a strange word to use now.

02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:17.220
But the way in which the stories
of these big songs is narrated is,

02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:19.100
you know, full of information.

02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:21.160
I mean you know, so we've
experienced ourselves

02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.330
as being an information
age cornucopia all over.

02:13:24.330 --> 02:13:28.130
And yet there's a primitive path
making of redundancy and it's kind

02:13:28.130 --> 02:13:32.730
of got a short-term memory,
often 15 years or so.

02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:35.860 position:56%
So on the Beyonce page for
example, you won't be able to find--

02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:39.600
or on the fan generated
Wikipedia page for that song.

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:42.340
You won't be able to
find that many references

02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:44.900
that go beyond DJ-- Major Lazer.

02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:48.530
After that, you have to
start to do additional work

02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:50.850
and you can't just enter
it on the Wikipedia page

02:13:50.850 --> 02:13:53.150
because it will throw you off
unless of course you're a scholar

02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:54.540
and you take the time to.

02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:55.860
You know, it's got its rules.

02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:59.080
And then you particularly
cannot get all the way to Africa

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.980
because at this point, most of that
information is just not known even

02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:06.240
by the protagonists
producing the music.

02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:08.700
And so you have a really
deep challenge, you know.

02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:13.280
This-- The other day I was talking
in this institution about some

02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.580
of these in relation

02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:17.070
to the mathematics
practices in Southern Africa.

02:14:17.070 --> 02:14:21.180
Many of which were wiped
out as they happened.

02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:23.790
So to keep your authority
say when you were drawing

02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:29.690
up too soon idiographs in Angola,
you would after the lesson wipe

02:14:29.690 --> 02:14:31.870
out the record so that you could
keep sustain your authority.

02:14:31.870 --> 02:14:34.980
In the west we have copyright
to sustain that copyright.

02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:36.830
Emerging at the time
the paper emerges.

02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:39.990
So different rules of the
game across the globe means

02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:43.240
that the challenges of the
archive are, you know, are real.

02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:49.200
And as we move into a globally
are aware the copyright regime is

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:50.700
in some sense the dominant one,

02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:53.350
we need to do some serious
reconstructing works

02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:56.960
and so we're already dependent
on again the archives.

02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:58.910
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: That gave
me a perfect segue there.

02:14:58.910 --> 02:15:02.330 position:56%
The Library of Congress is of course
the home of the US Copyright office

02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:05.360
and so many of our popular
music holdings are a result

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:07.910
of the copyright registration
process where we

02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:11.780
for example have the copyright
deposit of "I Will Survive"

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:16.490
or other things like that, and
going back to the late 1870s.

02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:22.000
In your unique kind of professional
worlds, at least in relation

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.980
to each other, what is the
important role of copyright

02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:32.050 position:56%
and how does it differ perhaps based
on the mediums that you're seeking.

02:15:32.050 --> 02:15:34.120
So like Alice if you're
sampling at--

02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:36.560
sorry to go back to the DJ
thing, but if you're sampling

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.730
as a DJ how cognizant are you of
the copyright situation for that

02:15:40.730 --> 02:15:45.380
or for Bill when you were managing
your collection of photographs,

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:49.500
are you very flexible with fair
use for academic institutions

02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:53.270
or is it something that you really
stay close to and then for Martin,

02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:57.820
where do maybe you pay some
barriers with copyright

02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:59.620
for your own scholarship.

02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:00.920
You don't have to answer those.

02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:03.880
You can just kind of jump
on copyright, wherever.

02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:09.570
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Well copyright's
really important for photography.

02:16:09.570 --> 02:16:10.870
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:15.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: And even
copyright, it doesn't protect people

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:17.730
from using my images, you know,
especially with the internet.

02:16:17.730 --> 02:16:19.620
I mean that's the big
problem for me.

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:23.240
All the images that I
have in this body of work

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:27.510
for disco are copyrighted
through the Library of Congress.

02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:30.390
But I also have the software
program that shows me

02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:32.690
who in the world is using images.

02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:36.330
And it's astonishing
like all over the world.

02:16:36.330 --> 02:16:39.460
You know, announcing some
club opening, there'll be one

02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:43.420
of my pictures, you know,
like Larry Levan you know.

02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:48.010
So you know, there's not
much that I can do about it.

02:16:48.010 --> 02:16:49.820 position:56%
The way I see it, if it's being used

02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:55.850
for a real commercial money making
usage, then I can actually go

02:16:55.850 --> 02:16:59.200
after them you know, and you
know, let them know that they--

02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.190
you have to take it down or
they have to pay me something.

02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:07.790
But copyrighting, I know that
there's been some changes in terms

02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:10.090 position:56%
of photographic copyrighting lately.

02:17:10.090 --> 02:17:16.190 position:56%
And I'm not really up on it but I
know it's become much more difficult

02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:19.960
and it's become much different--
you know, harder for photographers.

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:25.600
And I would like to see
that sort of eased down.

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:26.900
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Sure.

02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:28.200
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.120
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Well you know
copyright, I mean it's been decades

02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:36.290
since I was DJing, you know,
so I mean I guess that--

02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:40.710 position:56%
you know, I've had problems when
I've been writing books whether it's

02:17:40.710 --> 02:17:48.550
about Janis Joplin or about disco,
getting the ability to quote lyrics

02:17:48.550 --> 02:17:53.170
and obviously, you know, in today's
world, you cannot quote very much.

02:17:53.170 --> 02:17:55.300
And that's kind of a drag.

02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:59.230
On the other hand, you know as
somebody who writes, you know,

02:17:59.230 --> 02:18:01.690
it pains me when I
go online and I see

02:18:01.690 --> 02:18:05.170
that somebody has downloaded
my whole book, you know,

02:18:05.170 --> 02:18:07.970
whether it's the Janis book or the
disco book or another book and it's

02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:10.270
like wow, can't we do
anything about this?

02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:13.910
Well maybe for a week but you
know, it will come back up.

02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:15.210
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:18:15.210 --> 02:18:19.120
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: So
copyright, you know.

02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:21.480
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yeah,

02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:24.280
I'm going to switch the question a
little bit to the content of some

02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:27.240
of the work rather than the
problems I've encountered

02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:29.420
which are similar to
both of you really.

02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:31.710
And I think that this is
one of the central issues

02:18:31.710 --> 02:18:37.140
of our time is we have a kind of
microeconomy, which is deeply sort

02:18:37.140 --> 02:18:41.680
of fueled by new technologies
and music exacerbated

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.870
by what one might call the
MP3 effect after Napster,

02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:49.990 position:56%
which means the genie of the
commodity form got out of the bottle

02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:51.840
in some ways and became free.

02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:56.770 position:56%
And we have a paradoxically now in a
period of time where the commodity,

02:18:56.770 --> 02:19:01.920
the debased rational segmented
musical sounds are in a sense free

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:05.000
and it's the concepts that
have become very expensive.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.080
So it's a little-- everything is
gone experiential, so you know,

02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:12.940
a huge increase in prices in
music concept watching and so on--

02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:14.900
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Because that's how
artists can make their money now.

02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:16.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: That's right.

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:17.500
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: It's the only
way we can make the money.

02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:18.800
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherziner: So we
have this inverted relations

02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:21.900
and in a way, we can send back to
the 18th century because in a sort

02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:24.110
of pre-copyright age,
where now you have

02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:26.280
to become the troubadour
in the street again.

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:27.790
And this is a fascinating problem.

02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:31.160
Now if you take something like
again the work that I presented,

02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:33.690
there's a number of serious
copyright issues that emerge.

02:19:33.690 --> 02:19:38.290 position:56%
And that that is you know-- and many
artists being used along the way,

02:19:38.290 --> 02:19:41.300
its' a corporate collaborative
endeavor which is standard practice

02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:43.260
in the industry, you know.

02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:47.470
And yet, very often the
authors are not the ones

02:19:47.470 --> 02:19:51.880
that are necessarily properly
monetized in that arrangement.

02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:57.420
So you have, you know, Tofo Tofo
or you have in a sense, Peter Hugo,

02:19:57.420 --> 02:19:59.960
a photographer, had to make
an appearance in this work,

02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:04.600
very important one or you
know, Messina in "Formation"

02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:06.330
or Big Freedia and so on.

02:20:06.330 --> 02:20:11.660
Well Messina, who most people
are less aware of as a, you know,

02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:14.680
queer transfigure from New Orleans.

02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:17.790
So again, Beyonce doing this
amazing social work in a way

02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:20.460
by drawing attention to
these intense and beautiful

02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:23.890
and powerful subcultures
from footwork to balance.

02:20:23.890 --> 02:20:30.010
But at the same time the sample
of the voice is left unmonetized

02:20:30.010 --> 02:20:32.110
and so you have this sort of
deference but at the same time,

02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:35.540
the political economy undercuts
a little bit or cuts very much

02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:38.500
against the grain of the
deeper message of those songs.

02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:43.020
So Diplo for example in song
that I presented was paid

02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:45.540
as a creditors as the cowriter.

02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:47.590
But Diplo didn't start there

02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:50.090
and that's why I was giving
you the [inaudible] layers.

02:20:50.090 --> 02:20:55.420
And the irony is that everybody
that was not the artist got a piece

02:20:55.420 --> 02:21:00.370
of the pie but the true artists
at the source if you like

02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:02.120
and there's always a
source behind the source

02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:04.630
but if we can push it
always a little further,

02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:05.930
doesn't get monetized.

02:21:05.930 --> 02:21:09.640
So this respect for, you
know, the proper demands

02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:18.500
of the author concept is very often
in a crisis today and we feel it.

02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:22.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: The copyright
office has put together a really fun

02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:24.740
thing, which is a webpage dedicated

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:28.500
to exploring copyright
through disco.

02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:31.280
And it's that copyright.gov/disco.

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:33.020
I think it's pretty awesome.

02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:37.940
And you can explore the catalog
copyright.gov to, you know,

02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:39.660
see what types of registrations
came in,

02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:41.970
see that Gloria Gayner did
not write "I Will Survive"

02:21:41.970 --> 02:21:43.970
and that kind of business.

02:21:43.970 --> 02:21:47.660
And tonight if you're coming to the
event, you'll have the opportunity

02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:51.500
to get a very quick and fun
introduction to copyright at one

02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:53.500
of the photo booths, which
is going to be really cool.

02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:55.960
So you get a printout of your photo
and there's this little folder

02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:58.320
that tells you the basics
about the copyright process

02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:03.560
and how important it is to
creators in the hope of, you know,

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:06.350
making us all more
aware of that process.

02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:08.300
So before we open up to Q&amp;A,

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.020
I'd like to ask you all one more
question and it might be one

02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:15.090
of those annoying questions but
where do you see disco's reception

02:22:15.090 --> 02:22:20.510
in 10 years compared to
where we're at right now?

02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:23.500
[ Laughter ]

02:22:27.370 --> 02:22:30.310
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Well I think, you
know, certainly one of the things

02:22:30.310 --> 02:22:33.510
that I found fascinating about
what's happened, you know,

02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:36.250
you started this out by talking
about the cultural memory

02:22:36.250 --> 02:22:41.900
around disco and I think that
certainly one of the things

02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:44.900
that I was struck by as I was
writing my book was the extent

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:50.150
of which disco which again had
been treated as a kind of joke

02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:55.750
in its time had become for
both queer artists and artists

02:22:55.750 --> 02:22:59.020
who are some-- in some
respects allies, all right.

02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:03.670
I mean, I think of everybody from
the Pet Shop Boys to Lady Gaga

02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:10.910
and beyond, that disco had
become understood not as a kind

02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:17.970
of regressive political and musical
move but rather as transgressive

02:23:17.970 --> 02:23:23.320
because of its associations with
gay liberation and this real break

02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:27.800
with the past, past of repression.

02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:32.520
It's very-- I think it's very
hard to know what the future is

02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:38.660
and how disco is going to be
understood 10 years down the line.

02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:45.270
But I do think that probably this
vilification and demeanization

02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:49.660
of disco is probably behind us.

02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:50.960
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:55.180
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: I think that--
I don't know that you know,

02:23:55.180 --> 02:24:00.690
the perception of disco from that
era is ever going to really change.

02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:03.680 position:56%
I think it is what it is but I think

02:24:03.680 --> 02:24:06.860
that the music itself
has evolved certainly.

02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:11.150
I mean after New York, it went
to Chicago and became house music

02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:18.640
and went to Detroit, you know,
it's EDM and I think what happened

02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:25.380
in my case was in early
2000, this record producer

02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:30.730
who produces you know, what's
contemporary, you know,

02:24:30.730 --> 02:24:35.780
EDM music all the sudden
these younger people realize

02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:39.120
that like wait a minute, this
comes from disco, you know.

02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:46.010
So think that there's a new
respect for disco in a sense

02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:49.690
as being the source of
a lot of the, you know,

02:24:49.690 --> 02:24:52.170
new music that's out there today.

02:24:52.170 --> 02:24:58.460
And yeah, I think that's changed
a little bit of the, you know,

02:24:58.460 --> 02:25:04.950
the feeling of, you know, the kind
of silliness we miss of what we,

02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:07.380
you know, think of
as disco back then.

02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:08.790
But I think it's evolved.

02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:12.260
I think it's just evolved--
evolution.

02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:13.560
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Martin
do you have any thoughts?

02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:16.540
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: I mean,
aside from the recurring kind

02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:20.790
of retro tropes, right, you
know, the ever reappearing Abba

02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:22.400
or something like that,
you know the--

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:25.210
in fact, Jaron Lanier
speaks about music history

02:25:25.210 --> 02:25:29.180 position:56%
as having becoming retro, retro,
retro, that it's all just looks back

02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:33.470
and picks up pieces and he
is not excited about that.

02:25:33.470 --> 02:25:35.490
He thinks it's, you know,
eating on the seed stock

02:25:35.490 --> 02:25:37.930
of culture and so on, a debate.

02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:43.780
But, I think, I would take the line
that has been suggested by both

02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:45.080
of the previous speakers.

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:49.550
In the following sense that I think
in some sense, disco kind of want

02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:51.920
out in the way that, you know,
it emerged and flourished

02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:53.840
into these multiple dance forms.

02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:57.520
And if we look at the musical
techniques used, like the shaping

02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:00.610
and shifting of time,
the flattening of all--

02:26:00.610 --> 02:26:04.360
of harmonic space is such that you

02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:07.200
in some sense undercut
the functional principle

02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:10.390
of chords moving in
traditional ways.

02:26:10.390 --> 02:26:13.260
And I think, Donna Summer,
right, the extended space,

02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:16.980
the sidling up effect of that what
was once a high hat in between

02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:20.130
and the offbeat that then
became a gigantic synth.

02:26:20.130 --> 02:26:22.820
That then became a
dominant sound of, you know,

02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:28.120
mainstream dance music, as
well as EDM and IDM and all

02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:29.420
of these other offshoots.

02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:31.380
So, I think, in terms
of the grammar,

02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:34.220
we actually find that's
a pivotal moment

02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:38.480
that in some sense one could
argue, generated an after life

02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:39.780
that is much bigger than it.

02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:42.140
And in some ways the
question of its pre--

02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:49.310
of its focal point as a historical,
you know, emanating moment,

02:26:49.310 --> 02:26:52.790
I think, is on to contest.

02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:54.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Excellent.

02:26:54.090 --> 02:26:55.390
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:26:55.390 --> 02:26:58.670
I mean, I think it really did shift
pop music, musical architecture

02:26:58.670 --> 02:27:00.800
and in very important ways.

02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:05.060
And I suspect it's going to
continue to have an influence.

02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:09.800
There is nothing to indicate
that this changing anytime soon.

02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:11.100
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Fascinating.

02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:17.430
Well, the time is here for you
to ask the experts, so to speak.

02:27:17.430 --> 02:27:21.150
There are microphones at the
front of the aisle in either side.

02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:23.540
If you wouldn't mind just
walking up to the microphone

02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:25.520
and sharing your question.

02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:26.990
And as soon of you-- as you--

02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:29.220
as soon as you have asked your
question, you're free to return

02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:32.340
to your seat and we'll get
the next people queued up.

02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:33.640
Sir?

02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:34.940
&gt;&gt; Hi. I have a question for Bill.

02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:36.240
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:38.080
&gt;&gt; I first saw the body of
work you were sharing here

02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:41.820
at a different institution in
New York at the Museum of Sex

02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:43.820
where it had been installed
in a separate room

02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.480
with a bar and everything.

02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.520
Could you talk a little bit about
how that show came about and what--

02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:54.530
kind of what the purpose
of that was or?

02:27:54.530 --> 02:27:55.830
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:27:55.830 --> 02:28:04.070
Sure. There is-- I guess,
about a year ago I got a call--

02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:08.660
I live in New York, from the
curator at the Museum of Sex

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:11.350
on 5th Avenue and 27th Street.

02:28:11.350 --> 02:28:17.700
And they were looking for
something to cover the disco era.

02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:20.970
And they came across my book.

02:28:20.970 --> 02:28:23.680
And the thing that liked
about my book was the fact

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:27.330
that they didn't want
to focus on celebrities,

02:28:27.330 --> 02:28:29.930
they wanted to focus more
on the culture of disco.

02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:32.650
And that's basically
what my book does.

02:28:32.650 --> 02:28:36.870
So, at first they asked me if they
could use one of my pictures just

02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:41.330
as an ad in the subway,
as a subway ad.

02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:44.650 position:56%
And do some discussion of, you know,

02:28:44.650 --> 02:28:47.500
at some point turning
this into an exhibition.

02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:51.090
So, they ran the subway ad, and
then we had later discussions

02:28:51.090 --> 02:28:54.510
and we talked about
what we would do.

02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:58.940
And my general idea was
that it would be great

02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:05.030
if you could create a space,
which they had actually,

02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:12.350
where you could walk in off the
street in 2017 back to 1997 and be

02:29:12.350 --> 02:29:17.020
in the-- have a feeling
of a disco in that time.

02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:21.000
And so that was kind of where
the starting point of it all.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:28.330 position:56%
And so, they did a terrific job
creating the lighting and, you know,

02:29:28.330 --> 02:29:30.300
they basically reworked
the entire room.

02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:33.920
There is a bar there and they
do serve a drinks from the era,

02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:36.820
like long island tea, you know.

02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:40.640
And at like 1970s prices
too which is--

02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:42.350
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Oh, wow.

02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:45.060
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: And the
exhibit is for free too.

02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:48.080
So, it's-- you know, I always
tell people it's a good excuse

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:51.430
to go the Museum of Sex.

02:29:51.430 --> 02:29:55.690 position:56%
Most people don't really want to go,
but, you know, and you-- it's free.

02:29:55.690 --> 02:30:03.370
And they picked out a selection
of my images that really describe

02:30:03.370 --> 02:30:07.040
about six or seven different clubs.

02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:10.530
And they also added some
pictures that aren't in the book

02:30:10.530 --> 02:30:12.520
because of the sexual
nature of them.

02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:15.260
Because I really wanted to
describe that part of it

02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:17.250
because it's a museum of sex.

02:30:17.250 --> 02:30:21.180
And the literature really
describes each one of the clubs,

02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:24.850
and how it started and who
started it, and who went there.

02:30:24.850 --> 02:30:30.800
And, you know, it's just
become very popular.

02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:34.170
It was supposed to go-- it was
supposed to be up until February,

02:30:34.170 --> 02:30:37.170
and then they decide to extend
it to the end of the year.

02:30:37.170 --> 02:30:42.300
So, if anyone is in New York,
it's really a fun a thing to do.

02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:43.600
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Yeah.

02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:45.590
Great. Sir.

02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:46.890
&gt;&gt; Hi. Hello.

02:30:46.890 --> 02:30:48.190
Thank you for being here.

02:30:48.190 --> 02:30:51.560 position:56%
My question, obviously disco is
important and that's why we're here.

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:57.600
I feel like one of the main themes
that's coming out of this is that,

02:30:57.600 --> 02:31:01.960
disco created this inclusion
and empowerment vibe,

02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:03.550
and that's what made it important.

02:31:03.550 --> 02:31:05.470
At least what's one
of the core of it.

02:31:05.470 --> 02:31:09.190
But then that also lends itself
easily to commodification, right?

02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:12.660
I-- This is more of an
open ended question, but,

02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:15.030
commodification is I think one

02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:18.640
of the things behind
backlash against disco.

02:31:18.640 --> 02:31:22.750
And I wondered the panelists
thoughts on this paradox

02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:28.410
between inclusion empowerment
and yet easy commodification.

02:31:28.410 --> 02:31:31.650
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: So, I think you
were asking about commodification.

02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:35.120
And I think you were suggesting
that commodification was one

02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:40.600
of the reasons that disco became
sort of the whipping boy, right?

02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:45.570
I think it's really interesting
because I think it is true

02:31:45.570 --> 02:31:51.480 position:56%
as I was saying that certainly
people who were in the gay movement,

02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:57.920 position:56%
political movement assumed that, you
now, it would be community centers,

02:31:57.920 --> 02:32:02.990
gay community centers, and
gay community dances held

02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:07.320
in those centers, and the
activities out of those centers

02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:12.910
that would really become
the glue for gay men

02:32:12.910 --> 02:32:14.360
and for their communities.

02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:16.330
And as I said, in fact, it turned

02:32:16.330 --> 02:32:19.450
out to be the bathhouses
and the discos.

02:32:19.450 --> 02:32:25.450
And Dennis Altman, the-- one of the
gay activists whose work I cited

02:32:25.450 --> 02:32:30.590
in my talk said that he found
it both ironic and disappointing

02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:35.670
that as gay men, and I think
he meant also lesbians,

02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:39.200
became freer as he put
it in their sexuality.

02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:43.400
They also became, and again
to quote him, more reliant,

02:32:43.400 --> 02:32:46.540
more reliant on business
institutions.

02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:48.830
And I think that that's true.

02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:52.950
On the other hand, you
have another gay writer,

02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:57.810
this person from Britain, Richard
Dyer, a cultural study scholar,

02:32:57.810 --> 02:33:04.540 position:56%
who as early as 1979 was making the
argument that in some circumstances,

02:33:04.540 --> 02:33:07.990
capitalist cultural production
which at a certain point

02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:11.930
in time disco became can
produce really unlikely

02:33:11.930 --> 02:33:13.780
and even transgressive results.

02:33:13.780 --> 02:33:18.480
So, you know, scholars
debate commodification.

02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:22.090
And they've been doing
it for decades.

02:33:22.090 --> 02:33:26.610
They've been doing it about the
1920s, you know, because it turns

02:33:26.610 --> 02:33:30.310
out that a lot of more recent
scholarship would suggest that,

02:33:30.310 --> 02:33:31.610
you know, there was a lot wrong

02:33:31.610 --> 02:33:35.660
in the 1920s including
the income inequality,

02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:37.760
which we know a little about today.

02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:41.200
And because we have exceeded it.

02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:45.180
But it's certainly true that for
people of color and for women and,

02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:49.800
again, people who in some respects
were on the margins culturally,

02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:54.210
that commodification whether
it was happening in the movies

02:33:54.210 --> 02:33:58.200
or in the spread of
movies, or in the spread

02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:01.020
of department stores could have,

02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:03.670
and I know this again they
seem counterintuitive.

02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:07.450
But it could be used in
ways that were understood

02:34:07.450 --> 02:34:09.660
to be liberatory to those groups.

02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:12.890
So, a lot of scholarship
really debating this.

02:34:12.890 --> 02:34:16.030
It's a very good question.

02:34:16.030 --> 02:34:17.330
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yeah.

02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:22.400
And also, I think-- I just want to
make two sort of additional points

02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:26.050
about that, the one is that
I'm not sure that all forms

02:34:26.050 --> 02:34:29.000
of commodification sort
of are, in some sense,

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.200
at war with some social project.

02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:32.500
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:33.880
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: In fact,
when it comes to, I think, I mean,

02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:35.740
I'm speculating a little bit,

02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:39.770
but the sort of gay
liberation more or less.

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:43.290
I think it's deeply
mired in social sort of--

02:34:43.290 --> 02:34:48.390
and cultural icons and symbols
that are mobilized on television

02:34:48.390 --> 02:34:52.120 position:56%
and then later online and so on,
you know, "Modern Family" and so on.

02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:53.760
And that played a rule.

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:55.340
It wasn't just on the picket fence.

02:34:55.340 --> 02:34:57.390
It wasn't just act up, you know?

02:34:57.390 --> 02:35:01.280
Picketing Al Gore, it was
also in some sense happening

02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:03.350
in a so-called commodified space.

02:35:03.350 --> 02:35:06.070
So I think these things
are antithetical.

02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:08.500
That said, I think in
the history of music,

02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:12.700
the role of automated
technologies, has put, you know,

02:35:12.700 --> 02:35:14.850
increasing numbers of
people out of work.

02:35:14.850 --> 02:35:17.010
So we have the story of
automation, you know,

02:35:17.010 --> 02:35:20.580
Tesla barely hires an employer
and so on, it's not [inaudible].

02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:23.340
Actually music is in
substance the vanguard of this.

02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:29.190
And so back to the TR 808, which
in the context of, you know,

02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:33.790
house music, became initially just
the way of amping up the party

02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:35.730
or the turntable, the
Panasonic, right?

02:35:35.730 --> 02:35:40.610 position:56%
It's such an important technological
device for early hip hop

02:35:40.610 --> 02:35:43.830
and became spaces that a little bit
like yours are sonic geographies

02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:47.790
where people galvanize in ways that
were deeply, deeply indifferent

02:35:47.790 --> 02:35:51.110
to the commodity form, and yet,
tethered to the technologies

02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:53.720
that were going to, in the
future, put people out of work.

02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:56.890
I think it's a tricky question
and not something we want

02:35:56.890 --> 02:36:00.100
to be easy and dualistic about.

02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:05.470
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: I would also add
that, you know, one of the reasons

02:36:05.470 --> 02:36:10.070
that so many rock and rollers
resented disco of course is

02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:15.680
that very many of their
clubs and bars were turned

02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:18.930
into discos and they had no work.

02:36:18.930 --> 02:36:23.770
And that was a real complaint
and an understandable grievance.

02:36:23.770 --> 02:36:25.210
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:28.470
&gt;&gt; I'm up here in the back.

02:36:28.470 --> 02:36:31.730
Way up in the back
because I can't get

02:36:31.730 --> 02:36:34.140
down to the microphone down there.

02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:39.560
My question is for Alice and I
wanted to ask about the phenomena

02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:46.670
of Grace Jones and the gay
community during the disco era

02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:50.980
and if you have any comments about
that, particularly in reference

02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:57.190
to the Paradise Garage which was a
big meeting place during the disco

02:36:57.190 --> 02:37:00.800
era, that Grace Jones
was practically royalty.

02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:02.100
Thank you.

02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:03.400
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:07.050
I mean, Grace Jones obviously
a very, very important figure.

02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:10.050
She turned up at Studio 54, too.

02:37:10.050 --> 02:37:11.350
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:37:11.350 --> 02:37:16.430
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: But the
Garage was certainly one

02:37:16.430 --> 02:37:23.640
of the most important discos in
New York City and it was important

02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:28.920
because it resisted quite
deliberately that sort

02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:35.210
of homogenization and exclude-- you
know, in the kind of exclusionism

02:37:35.210 --> 02:37:38.860
that existed in some discos.

02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:40.160
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:43.750
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: And you
know, again, the people who--

02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:47.630
and Mel Cheren was one of those
people, who was somebody I cited

02:37:47.630 --> 02:37:53.570
in my talk, were quite deliberate
in trying to make a space

02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:56.990
that really truly was inclusive

02:37:56.990 --> 02:38:01.620
and I think Grace Jones was
a really important figure

02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:06.550
because whatever her own sexual
desires, wherever they went,

02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:08.130
I don't know anything about.

02:38:08.130 --> 02:38:11.050
But she was certainly somebody who,

02:38:11.050 --> 02:38:16.490
in the way that she
presented, presented as queer.

02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:19.850
And so she was-- she
could be understood.

02:38:19.850 --> 02:38:22.800
She should be understood,
I think, as an ally.

02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:25.660
So I think she was a
very important figure.

02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:30.920
Again, as I think the women
of Labelle were, as well.

02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:36.740
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to make a comment
and to add on to some of the stuff

02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:39.800
that you guys have been talking
about, and one of them is

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.060
that the disco era that
music has been recycled

02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:44.360
over and over and over again.

02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:48.140
And then one of the other things is
that the musicians from that time,

02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:50.320
they are still out
there and touring.

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.130
And that's one of the
things I think we need

02:38:52.130 --> 02:38:54.710
to make sure we don't forget,
the Gloria Gaynors, you know,

02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:57.540
the Bee Gees were doing something
before, you know, the Bee Gees,

02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:59.200
some of the brothers started dying.

02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:03.490
And some of the other musicians
from that time are still touring,

02:39:03.490 --> 02:39:07.160
which is very important so
that that music still is alive

02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:12.050
and then even piggybacking on that
is like you were saying the DJs

02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:16.290
and some of the young rappers
and some of the musicians

02:39:16.290 --> 02:39:20.050
of today are sampling
tremendously from that era.

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:22.790
So, I-- to comment on
what you were saying is

02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:24.090
where is that music going to be.

02:39:24.090 --> 02:39:25.390
I don't think it's
ever going to die.

02:39:25.390 --> 02:39:26.690
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:27.990
I agree.

02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:29.290
&gt;&gt; Because it's always
going to be recycled.

02:39:29.290 --> 02:39:32.010
Someone is always going to be doing
a '70s theme party, that still goes

02:39:32.010 --> 02:39:34.360
on in tremendous amounts, you know.

02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:36.820
So it's always that easy
go-to for one thing,

02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:38.130
if you wanted to do a theme party.

02:39:38.130 --> 02:39:40.570
So I think it's going to be around.

02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:44.360
It's just going to maybe
change in some instances,

02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.820
but it's always going to
be the core '70s music,

02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.710
that core disco is
always going to be there

02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:52.680
in whatever iteration is
going to be in the future.

02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:53.980
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:55.280
Thank you.

02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:56.580
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Absolutely true.

02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:59.680 position:56%
And in terms of rap, I mean, really
so much of the rhythmic architecture

02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:05.500
of early rap was derived
from Chic's "Good Times",

02:40:05.500 --> 02:40:08.650
which of course was the sample used

02:40:08.650 --> 02:40:15.000
in the first big crossover rap
record by Grandmaster Flash, so--

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:18.560
or by the Sugarhill
Gang, I stand corrected.

02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:23.060
So, it's absolutely true,
that sort of inescapable.

02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:24.360
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: Yeah.

02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:27.360
&gt;&gt; Also now rappers too would
going-- going out on tour, so--

02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:31.750
and it would not come in on
[inaudible] because that's kind

02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:37.420
of reserved in that formula
too is producing even more, so.

02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:38.720
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yes.

02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:40.020
Exactly. Exactly.

02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:41.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:42.620
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: OK.

02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:45.340
&gt;&gt; My question is, having lived
through all that music and all

02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:48.510
of it is really about the
beat that distinguishes it.

02:40:48.510 --> 02:40:51.460
And this is what-- why it's
great for me to come to this

02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:53.360
because to me, when I
was living through it,

02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:55.180
it was all merging into one.

02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:59.240
I was going to, you know, one
time hearing Earth, Wind and Fire,

02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.780
the next day I'd go
parliafunkedelic,

02:41:02.780 --> 02:41:06.330
and so the distinction
between the disco, I--

02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:09.610
until I came here and got a--
you know, I knew who I liked.

02:41:09.610 --> 02:41:14.020
I see Nona Hendryx
and all of them and--

02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:18.250
but I didn't see that clear
distinction at all of sort of merge

02:41:18.250 --> 02:41:21.140
and that's why I kind of
agree-- I agree with her too,

02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:23.470
that I don't think
it will ever go away.

02:41:23.470 --> 02:41:28.500
I just think it kind of
evolves, as you said, but what--

02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:30.520
you have mentioned a little
bit, but what is this?

02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:35.290
Is it the base, but I hear the
base and everything, but that's me.

02:41:35.290 --> 02:41:40.000
So what would you say is
specifically the beat and disco

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:45.350
that distinguishes it from
funkadelics or anybody else?

02:41:45.350 --> 02:41:47.210
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Well,
that's a great question.

02:41:47.210 --> 02:41:49.110
I mean, what, what really--

02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:50.410
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:41:50.410 --> 02:41:51.710
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: -- is disco?

02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:55.100
I think that the 4/4 thump
was pretty important.

02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:57.530
But that was derived from Motown.

02:41:57.530 --> 02:41:58.830
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:41:58.830 --> 02:42:00.130
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: And--

02:42:00.130 --> 02:42:01.430
&gt;&gt; And see that's why--

02:42:01.430 --> 02:42:02.730
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: -- I mean--

02:42:02.730 --> 02:42:04.030
&gt;&gt; I don't hear it.

02:42:04.030 --> 02:42:05.330
I hear-- I see the
different singers,

02:42:05.330 --> 02:42:06.630
but I'm not-- I'm trying to--

02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:08.970
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: But I think
that there are some distinctions.

02:42:08.970 --> 02:42:12.210
And again, these really
derived from the music

02:42:12.210 --> 02:42:13.800 position:56%
that was coming out of Philadelphia.

02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:15.100
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

02:42:15.100 --> 02:42:16.590
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Philadelphia
International Records,

02:42:16.590 --> 02:42:19.180
PIR, Gamble and Huff.

02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:20.480
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:21.860
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: And they
were creating soul music

02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:24.930
that was washer, it was silkier.

02:42:24.930 --> 02:42:27.400
There were different
instruments being used.

02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:31.850
More, you know, instead of
a trombone, they would use

02:42:31.850 --> 02:42:33.350
like the flugelhorn or something.

02:42:33.350 --> 02:42:37.930 position:56%
And I think would use different,
different sounds and they were going

02:42:37.930 --> 02:42:40.990
for a more deliberately
sophisticated sound.

02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:44.840
And so that was why I was
saying that, in some sense,

02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.840
you can understand what they
were doing as an active rebellion

02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.730
against the notion that soul music
had to sound a particular way.

02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:56.190
One of my favorite quotes is
from Mary Wilson of the Supremes

02:42:56.190 --> 02:43:00.380
from her memoir, in which she
said, you know, I was constantly

02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:03.180
and the Supremes were
always being criticized

02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.830
for not being soulful enough,
but why is it that I have

02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:08.630
to sound like a Aretha Franklin?

02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:12.430
No knock against Aretha,
love her, but come on,

02:43:12.430 --> 02:43:15.200 position:56%
why can't there be diversity, right?

02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:22.690
But I think that disco did sort of
amplify Motown music in the sense

02:43:22.690 --> 02:43:28.510
that Motown too was
deliberately working to try to get

02:43:28.510 --> 02:43:32.320
out of what had once been
called the Chitlin Circuit.

02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:33.620
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:35.740
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: And to really
sell to white Americans,

02:43:35.740 --> 02:43:39.580
but not in a way that-- in my view,

02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:42.610
not in a way that compromised
that music.

02:43:42.610 --> 02:43:45.250
That music was soulful.

02:43:45.250 --> 02:43:48.960
Motown music was soulful
and disco music was soulful.

02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:50.260
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:52.330
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: But I think
it is very, very difficult.

02:43:52.330 --> 02:43:55.910
I mean, to try to actually,
what was disco?

02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:57.740
What is disco?

02:43:57.740 --> 02:44:01.950
And one of the things that,
that I argue in Hot Stuff,

02:44:01.950 --> 02:44:05.530
is that it's curious to me
the extent of which we try

02:44:05.530 --> 02:44:10.500
to create this very narrow
sort of categories for disco

02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:14.060
and what constitutes disco, when
that's not true for rock music.

02:44:14.060 --> 02:44:15.360
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:16.660
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: You know, you say,

02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:19.540
punk rock is considered
rock music, right?

02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:23.740
You could say blues
rock is country rock.

02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:25.440
But it's considered rock.

02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:28.810
I mean, nobody is trying
to cordon it off and put it

02:44:28.810 --> 02:44:32.650
in its own little box,
whereas with disco,

02:44:32.650 --> 02:44:37.900
it's assumed that for instance,
David Bowie's fame wasn't disco,

02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:41.630
but at the time, it was
heard and discussed as disco.

02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:47.210
What about PIL's "Fodderstompf",
which played at Studio 54?

02:44:47.210 --> 02:44:50.630
That was John Lydon's second
group after the Sex Pistols.

02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:52.730
In my mind, that was disco.

02:44:52.730 --> 02:44:54.910
Blondie was-- A lot
of Blondie was disco.

02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:57.350
Madonna was disco.

02:44:57.350 --> 02:45:00.750
Lorde's as I said, "Green
Light" sounds a disco to me.

02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:03.040
So, I take the expansive view.

02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:04.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

02:45:04.350 --> 02:45:05.650
Thank you.

02:45:05.650 --> 02:45:06.950
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: To
the question of the beat

02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:12.040
in Alice's question, I mean, the
answer was basically covering,

02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:14.500
but there's one thing maybe
I would want to just pull out

02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:17.510
and draw some attention to
about how the beat is organized.

02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:21.010
And I think this prominence
again of the open high hat

02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:22.680
in between the dominant beat.

02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:23.980
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Yeah.

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:25.280
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: So that
when you tuned in to a song

02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:28.210
that doesn't have that many
chord changes, it starts to take

02:45:28.210 --> 02:45:33.080
on a certain kind of hypnotic
character, that [beatboxes],

02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:36.730
that it almost, you can't quite
tell if it's speeding up or slowing

02:45:36.730 --> 02:45:39.110
down against the main beat,
has sort of accelerating,

02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:41.960
decelerating effect
within that environment.

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:45.040
And that becomes, I think, a
dominant feature of how a beat--

02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:46.550
how the beat, if that's--

02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:48.650
just technically about how
the beat gets organized.

02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:51.680
And then that gets pulled out
in a very sort of prominent way,

02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:54.500
almost a muscular insistence
on an alternative.

02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:57.280
One might even want to make some
sort of more speculative case

02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:00.350
about how that relates
to subcultures and so on.

02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:05.120
I mean, if we think of Chaka
Khan like in 1974, you know,

02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:08.040
"Tell Me Something Good",
that's an absolute on-off,

02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:10.420
that is like taking
funk to a new level.

02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:13.640
And through this insistent--
insistence on the off beat,

02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:17.230
the in between beat, so
that we have these moments

02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:21.200
that give us definitive, how should
we say, syntax for disco, right.

02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:24.040
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Written now
by Stevie Wonder, wasn't it?

02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: I'm not sure.

02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:26.640
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: I think so.

02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:29.430
And the thing that's interesting
about Chaka Khan's group then,

02:46:29.430 --> 02:46:34.220
Rufus was that they did not define
themselves according to genre.

02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:37.770
They prided themselves
on being genre-less.

02:46:37.770 --> 02:46:40.620
I mean, they developed some
strange name for what they did.

02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:42.570
But they saw themselves
as being right

02:46:42.570 --> 02:46:44.790
at the intersection
of funk and rock.

02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:46.240
Fascinating.

02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:47.540
&gt;&gt; Martin Scherzinger: Yeah.

02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:48.840
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: As did Labelle.

02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:50.140
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Time
for one last question.

02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:56.110
&gt;&gt; Sandy: I wanted
also to make a comment.

02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:58.320
When [inaudible] became
rock and roll,

02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:01.850
it was the advent of the guitar.

02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:03.650
The guitar's footprint.

02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:09.930
And that you would-- could clearly
say when Bob Dylan went electric,

02:47:09.930 --> 02:47:14.670
that was a huge movement.

02:47:14.670 --> 02:47:17.980
Did anything in disco reach that?

02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:21.010
Bo Diddley had his own beat.

02:47:21.010 --> 02:47:24.710
And I don't think it was
the artists who were trying

02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:28.660
to define themselves, it
was the radio stations.

02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:35.090
Radio stations decided what they
were going to play and if the--

02:47:35.090 --> 02:47:41.320
and as disco was in its hay day,
the Eagles were still being played

02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:46.470
on other radio stations,
selling trillions of records.

02:47:46.470 --> 02:47:50.420
So it-- it's the marketplace
and it's

02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:53.970
where you get broadcast
in the marketplace.

02:47:53.970 --> 02:48:01.630
Someone-- DJ might say,
I don't want to play PIL.

02:48:01.630 --> 02:48:03.400
Now, things have changed.

02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:07.590
Now we're in a modern world where
people can download and stream

02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:09.960
and do whatever they wanted to do.

02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:13.870
But until that happened,
people were prisoners

02:48:13.870 --> 02:48:16.380
of a certain radio station.

02:48:16.380 --> 02:48:19.140
And what was there,
what they were playing.

02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:20.440
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: OK.

02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.740
I'm going to take issue
with you a bit.

02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:23.040
[ Laughter ]

02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:25.250
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: We can
handle it, don't worry.

02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:26.550
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: Because
here's the thing.

02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:29.100
You know, people were
always saying about disco.

02:48:29.100 --> 02:48:32.600 position:56%
It was something that was
basically cooked up in the back room

02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:34.830
by all these major
label guys, right?

02:48:34.830 --> 02:48:36.130
&gt;&gt; Sandy: No.

02:48:36.130 --> 02:48:37.430
I worked at Atlantic Records.

02:48:37.430 --> 02:48:38.730
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: OK.

02:48:38.730 --> 02:48:42.810
&gt;&gt; Sandy: I was director of
publicity of all of that.

02:48:42.810 --> 02:48:44.920
And it was money.

02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:48.980
People were in it for the
money, what's hot, what's new?

02:48:48.980 --> 02:48:50.280
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: But
people are always--

02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:53.160
I mean, the idea that
music exists outside

02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:56.640
of the commercial is
a delusion, I think.

02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:03.100 position:56%
But let's talk about the very early
days of the music that became disco.

02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:11.870
You know, the first big disco hit
was Barry White's Love Unlimited

02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:15.610
Orchestra, "Love's Theme", 1973.

02:49:15.610 --> 02:49:18.390
Radio did not break that song.

02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:23.680 position:56%
In fact, his label was completely
uninterested in promoting that song.

02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:27.890
What happened was two very
enterprising DJs were visiting

02:49:27.890 --> 02:49:35.690
somebody at Barry White's label and
there was a dead album box, right,

02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:38.870
they these bins of dead albums,
albums they weren't going

02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:41.210
to promote that were going nowhere.

02:49:41.210 --> 02:49:45.820
And these DJs spied Barry
White's album there.

02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:47.120
&gt;&gt; Sandy: And broke it.

02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:48.500
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: And they
played it in the clubs

02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:55.080
and it was the first time that a
single had been broken in the clubs

02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:59.010
and then it went to radio.

02:49:59.010 --> 02:50:01.050
&gt;&gt; Sandy: I [inaudible]
sing first time.

02:50:01.050 --> 02:50:04.920
And because you claimed
that something is a first--

02:50:04.920 --> 02:50:08.050
a disco record, they
have been arguing

02:50:08.050 --> 02:50:11.160
for 50 years what is the
first rock and roll record?

02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:12.460
&gt;&gt; Alice Echols: No, no,

02:50:12.460 --> 02:50:13.760
I'm not saying it was
the first disco record,

02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:18.180
I'm saying it's the first disco
record to become a huge hit.

02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:19.480
And the point here is--

02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:22.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandy: I'd have to see the
documentation but I wanted to take--

02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:23.890
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: So,
you can buy her book.

02:50:23.890 --> 02:50:25.190
&gt;&gt; Sandy: Right.

02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:26.490
Right. I wanted to
take another point

02:50:26.490 --> 02:50:28.200
with you which is you have said.

02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:29.500
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown:
Sandy, I'm so sorry.

02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:31.610
Sandy we don't have time because we
have-- we have to go to Gloria now.

02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:32.910
&gt;&gt; Sandy: OK.

02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:34.210
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: I'm sorry.

02:50:34.210 --> 02:50:35.510
We're done.

02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:37.660
So as you can tell, disco
is an important topic

02:50:37.660 --> 02:50:39.360
that deserve scholarly attention.

02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:40.660
&gt;&gt; Bill Bernstein: It's funny.

02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:44.120
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: So this is a
whole body of work just craving

02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:45.980
to be unearthed, I think.

02:50:45.980 --> 02:50:49.200
And these are some of the
pioneers in doing that work.

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.650
But seriously, if you're out
here and you're a grad student

02:50:51.650 --> 02:50:56.470 position:56%
or an undergrad even and you want to
do a cool paper, come to the Library

02:50:56.470 --> 02:50:59.490
of Congress and research primary
sources having to do with disco.

02:50:59.490 --> 02:51:01.140
Who were the people
writing the songs

02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:02.440
and sending them in for copyright?

02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:04.290
Who was making money off
of them versus the people

02:51:04.290 --> 02:51:06.140
who actually did the creative work?

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:08.670
Who is ripping off Bill's photos

02:51:08.670 --> 02:51:12.710
or how is Bill working
to protect his photos?

02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:17.510
There is so much cool stuff in this
area of study and it kind of for me

02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:21.900
as musicology type as well,
is indicative of the way

02:51:21.900 --> 02:51:25.640
that popular musical
genres are becoming more

02:51:25.640 --> 02:51:28.310
of the hot thing in scholarship.

02:51:28.310 --> 02:51:31.670
You know, there's only so
much that we can do with--

02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:34.010
well, no, I'm not going to say
that because I'll get in trouble.

02:51:34.010 --> 02:51:35.310
[ Laughter ]

02:51:35.310 --> 02:51:37.560
You can study Bach
for eternity, right?

02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:41.340
However, there's a lot of other
musical genres that need that kind

02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:43.520
of attention, that kind of
discourse so that we find

02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:47.720
out what was really going on
because like with disco, OK,

02:51:47.720 --> 02:51:49.970
I grew up with disco,
I heard it, you know,

02:51:49.970 --> 02:51:53.120
from my parents listening
to their records.

02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:56.420
And then I got the pure disco CD
from my BMG Music subscription

02:51:56.420 --> 02:52:00.200
because I'm not old or young
enough, however you want to put it.

02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:01.780
And I have one and two.

02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:05.950
And then, you know, you get
a certain perception of it

02:52:05.950 --> 02:52:07.830
from what you grow up with
and what's in the media,

02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:10.410
just like we're talking
about the commodity business.

02:52:10.410 --> 02:52:13.700
But that's not necessarily
all of what was going on

02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:15.840
and Bill's book sheds light on that

02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:18.000
in a very visual way,
which is fantastic.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:24.210
And then if you want to go back
and see for example the film "54",

02:52:24.210 --> 02:52:29.800
you can compare that to what the
actual primary source document

02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:32.800
reveals as there's a
lot of fun stuff to do.

02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:37.430
And even if you're not a researcher
,just come and hang out and explore

02:52:37.430 --> 02:52:39.920
because that's honestly
what we're here for.

02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:43.480
OK? We're for all people regardless
of your interests, professional,

02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:45.560
academic, if you're a
high school student,

02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:48.860
if you're at home trolling Twitter,

02:52:48.860 --> 02:52:51.060
you will find cool primary
sources having to do with disco

02:52:51.060 --> 02:52:54.360
from the Library of
Congress, who knew?

02:52:54.360 --> 02:52:58.240
So a bit of logistics before we
switch over to the next thing

02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:00.970
and I-- we do have a
giant surprise for you.

02:53:00.970 --> 02:53:02.910
So you need to stay in your seats.

02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:04.210
Nobody run away.

02:53:04.210 --> 02:53:06.510
Thank You Martin, Alice and Bill.

02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:31.010
Welcome everyone to Library
of Congress Bibliodiscotheque.

02:53:31.010 --> 02:53:33.900
My name is Nicholas Brown and I'm

of Congress' Music Division.

02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:38.270
The Library of Congress is the
largest library in the world

02:53:38.270 --> 02:53:40.960
and within that, we have the
largest music library in the world,

02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:45.380 position:56%

02:53:48.970 --> 02:53:51.510
up for those viewers all
over the world, please?

02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:57.210
[ Applause and Cheering ]

02:53:57.210 --> 02:54:00.410
Library of Congress
Bibliodiscotheque is a month long

02:54:00.410 --> 02:54:05.590 position:56%
look at disco, music, dance, fashion
and culture, where it came from

02:54:05.590 --> 02:54:09.810
and how does it influence
popular culture since the 1970s.

02:54:09.810 --> 02:54:12.860
These programs have been made
possible through partnerships

02:54:12.860 --> 02:54:14.830
with the host of cultural
institutions

02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:17.390
and organizations both
based here in DC

02:54:17.390 --> 02:54:20.290
and that are nationally recognized.

02:54:20.290 --> 02:54:23.660
Including the Recording
Academy, Brightest Young Things,

02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:27.690
Capital Pride, the District of
Columbia Library Association

02:54:27.690 --> 02:54:30.780
and the Silent Dance Society.

02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:34.390
This program specifically is made
possible at the Library of Congress

02:54:34.390 --> 02:54:37.520
by the generosity and
support of private donations.

02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:39.760
If you would like to see more
programs like this happen

02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:44.510
in the future, we invite
you to visit loc.gov/disco.

02:54:44.510 --> 02:54:47.120
Yes, we made that theme
just for today.

02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:50.840
To make a contribution of
an amount of your choosing.

02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:54.840
Throughout the special events
coming up for the rest of the day,

02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:58.590
we invite you to live tweet
using the hashtag, LC disco.

02:54:58.590 --> 02:55:06.250 position:56%
You are also invited to tag
@librarycongress and @libnofcongress

02:55:06.250 --> 02:55:10.620
which is Dr. Hayden's
Twitter account.

02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:13.890
Now if you thought
Bibliodiscoteque was awesome,

02:55:13.890 --> 02:55:15.780
we have some other really
amazing things coming

02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:17.920
up for you in the next few weeks.

02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:21.910
We have a new pop up exhibit
series beginning in June

02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:23.210
with an exhibit called "Pride

02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:28.290 position:56%
in the Library" featuring LGBTQ
collection items and also references

02:55:28.290 --> 02:55:31.730
to LGBTQ communities
in the US and abroad.

02:55:31.730 --> 02:55:37.040
And then the following week, also
in June, we are opening up Library

02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:40.420
of Awesome, which is actually the
title and it's pretty awesome.

02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:44.400
And it is happening at the
same time as Awesome Con

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:45.720
and the library is
going to be bringing

02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:48.920
out its unparalleled
comic book collections.

02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:51.450
This is first editions
of things like Superman,

02:55:51.450 --> 02:55:53.380
all the Marvel, that kind of stuff.

02:55:53.380 --> 02:55:56.870

And here at the Library of Congress,

&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: OK.

02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.510
Here's the pitiful part, we've
been practicing that for weeks.

02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:34.320
[ Laughter ]

02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:37.080
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We really have.

02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:39.000
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Welcome
everyone to disco week

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:40.870
at the Library of Congress.

02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:44.860
Thank you Nicholas Brown
for all your hard work.

02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:48.510
Yeah, Nick you deserve
some applause.

02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:55.680
[inaudible] Holly Selassie,
Angela Newburn

02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:58.270
and Clay Pensic [assumed spelling],
thank you for all the work

02:57:58.270 --> 02:58:00.510
that you've done to
make this possible.

02:58:00.510 --> 02:58:05.550
[ Applause ]

02:58:05.550 --> 02:58:08.830
So Dr. Hayden, we're both
products of the '70s.

02:58:08.830 --> 02:58:11.690
We started out as librarians
in the '70s

02:58:11.690 --> 02:58:15.110
and still here and alive and well.

02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:16.880
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We
went to library school

02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:20.580
in the '70s and we made it through.

02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:21.880
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: We did.

02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:24.500
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And Robert started
in a lustrous career at the Library

02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:28.440
of Congress and I went to
teach in public libraries

02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:33.350
and here we are 40 something
years later together as partners.

02:58:33.350 --> 02:58:35.150
So we thank you.

02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:40.790
[ Applause ]

02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:44.770
Now, we also were talking
about '70s fashion

02:58:44.770 --> 02:58:47.510
and you'll notice what
we are wearing.

02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:50.040
[ Laughter ]

02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:51.590
This is as far as we can go now.

02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:52.890
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Yes.

02:58:52.890 --> 02:58:54.190
[ Laughter ]

02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:55.990
But wait until tonight,
has she got an outfit.

02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:59.680
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And let's just
say there is going to be more hair.

02:58:59.680 --> 02:59:01.010
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Yeah.

02:59:01.010 --> 02:59:02.310
[ Cheering and Applause ]

02:59:02.310 --> 02:59:03.630
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I
couldn't grow it back then.

02:59:03.630 --> 02:59:06.230
By the time I grew it,
the '70s were over.

02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:08.260
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Yes.

02:59:08.260 --> 02:59:11.570
&gt;&gt; Carla Harden: What we're saying
is that the fashion in the '70s

02:59:11.570 --> 02:59:16.860
when we looked back at some of
the photos and we said, oh my god.

02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:18.160
&gt;&gt;Robert Newlen: Yeah, right.

02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:21.700
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's an
oxymoron, fashion in the '70s.

02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:28.640
However, you could excuse the
fashion because of the music.

02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:29.940
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: It's true.

02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:35.050
And tell me what was your
favorite disco song of the era?

02:59:35.050 --> 02:59:36.770
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The one
that still faze with me

02:59:36.770 --> 02:59:41.440 position:56%
and that's why they were playing it
when we came out is "We Are Family".

02:59:41.440 --> 02:59:46.080
It symbolizes so much in terms
of their all kinds of families

02:59:46.080 --> 02:59:48.050
and it brings everybody together.

02:59:48.050 --> 02:59:53.060
And so I was really pleased to
select it this year to be put

02:59:53.060 --> 02:59:56.510
into the national registry now.

02:59:56.510 --> 03:00:02.000
[ Applause ]

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:05.190
Now, we should know before
I got here, Robert was part

03:00:05.190 --> 03:00:11.560 position:56%
of the selection process and he got
to select, your favorite disco song?

03:00:11.560 --> 03:00:15.510
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Three
guesses, "I Will Survive".

03:00:15.510 --> 03:00:22.470
[ Applause ]

03:00:22.470 --> 03:00:29.150
So one of the exciting things is
that we can place wonderful songs

03:00:29.150 --> 03:00:35.300
that have a great legacy like this
on the National Recording Registry.

03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:39.450
And it's something that you
can contribute too as well,

03:00:39.450 --> 03:00:42.750
all you have to do is go
to our website, loc.gov

03:00:42.750 --> 03:00:46.880
and search recording registry
and you can make suggestions too

03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:50.920
for what you would like
to see on that registry.

03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:52.220
So--

03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:55.620
&gt;&gt;Carla Hayden: Think about
it because it's not just songs

03:00:55.620 --> 03:00:57.780
that maybe were the top 20.

03:00:57.780 --> 03:01:00.370
They are songs that
resonate with you.

03:01:00.370 --> 03:01:05.350 position:56%
And we want to also use the registry
to introduce people to music

03:01:05.350 --> 03:01:09.580
and significant works
of art and just culture.

03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:13.930
So think of any song, or any
recording that you would like us

03:01:13.930 --> 03:01:16.630
to consider and we'd
love to have it.

03:01:16.630 --> 03:01:18.890
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: And think
about today as being a window

03:01:18.890 --> 03:01:23.030
into the entire music collection
of the Library of Congress.

03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:27.640
It's an amazing, amazing
collection and so much

03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:30.030
of this is accessible
through our website.

03:01:30.030 --> 03:01:32.860
So I hope you'll take the
opportunity to explore it.

03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:36.210
&gt;&gt;Carla Hayden: So speaking
of "I Will Survive",

03:01:36.210 --> 03:01:41.830
the reason why we are really here
today is because of the music

03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:46.510
and the persona really of
the legendary, Gloria Gaynor.

03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:52.460
[ Applause and Cheering ]

03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:54.080
We want to talk about her song,

03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:56.060
I feel like we're at
the Academy Awards.

03:01:56.060 --> 03:01:57.410
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: I do, I do.

03:01:57.410 --> 03:02:03.150
Well, as we said, her hit song
"I Will Survive" was inducted

03:02:03.150 --> 03:02:07.930 position:56%
into the Library of Congress
National Recording Registry in 2016.

03:02:07.930 --> 03:02:13.940
Hey, just like us, her
legendary career spans 40 years.

03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:15.240
And--

03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:16.540
&gt;&gt;Carla Hayden: She looks better.

03:02:16.540 --> 03:02:17.960
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Yes, well,
I have to say that too.

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:20.170
And has never lost steam.

03:02:20.170 --> 03:02:23.930
We just had the privilege of
being backstage with Ms. Gaynor

03:02:23.930 --> 03:02:27.120
and we were showing her some
treasures from our collection.

03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:31.010
We were showing here the original
manuscript from Porgy and Bes

03:02:31.010 --> 03:02:35.390
and she impromptu started
singing "Summer Time".

03:02:35.390 --> 03:02:38.890
And it was quite a moment.

03:02:38.890 --> 03:02:43.770
&gt;&gt;Carla Hayden: And she then
looked at the score and this is

03:02:43.770 --> 03:02:48.970
in George Gershwin's hand, these
are with his notes and everything

03:02:48.970 --> 03:02:52.580
to what she said one of
my favorite songs, My--

03:02:52.580 --> 03:02:53.930
"Our Love is Here to Stay".

03:02:53.930 --> 03:02:55.230
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Yeah.

03:02:55.230 --> 03:02:56.530
&gt;&gt;Carla Hayden: And then
started to hum that.

03:02:56.530 --> 03:02:58.840
Well, I must say, Robert
had a moment.

03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:00.140
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Yeah.

03:03:00.140 --> 03:03:01.440

&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: I
was her [inaudible].

03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:06.760
I admit. It was really wonderful.

03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:09.270
And one the things
that she'll be talking

03:03:09.270 --> 03:03:12.900
about today is her second
book, "We Will Survive,

03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:18.040
True Stories of Encouragement,
Inspiration and the Power of Song".

03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:22.020
&gt;&gt;Carla Hayden: And joining her
on stage to discuss her book

03:03:22.020 --> 03:03:26.350 position:56%
and her career is a person you
invite into your home every morning.

03:03:26.350 --> 03:03:31.180
I know my mother does and there
are very few things that you can do

03:03:31.180 --> 03:03:35.660
to sometimes either
impress your parents

03:03:35.660 --> 03:03:38.420
or to show them their
efforts were worth it.

03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:44.900
I was able to let her stand by
and meet the co-anchor of ABC's

03:03:44.900 --> 03:03:48.530
"Good Morning America", the
Emmy Award winning journalist

03:03:48.530 --> 03:03:51.510

dig this jacket out the back

of my closet but, you know,
I'm a child of the '70s,

03:04:44.180 --> 03:04:45.870
honey, I'm a child proud of it.

03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:55.030
I'm telling you, you have just
inspired me and countless others

03:04:55.030 --> 03:04:58.160
and I've been looking forward to
just sitting and chatting with you

03:04:58.160 --> 03:05:00.970
and letting people to get
to know even more about you.

03:05:00.970 --> 03:05:04.680
Now, music was a part of
your home from the beginning.

03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:05.980
You grew up with music.

03:05:05.980 --> 03:05:07.280
Tell us about that.

03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:08.580
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Grew
up with music,

03:05:08.580 --> 03:05:12.510
my mother sang not professionally
but she had a wonderful voice

03:05:12.510 --> 03:05:16.600
and of course, my estimation, it
was a beautiful voice in the world

03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:18.950
and my father sang as well,

03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:22.060
but my father did sing
professionally for a time.

03:05:22.060 --> 03:05:26.500
As a matter of fact, he
was the opening act for--

03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:29.730
an act back then called
Stepin Fetchit.

03:05:29.730 --> 03:05:31.030
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: What
was that again?

03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:32.950
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Stepin Fetchit.

03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:36.610
And he plays ukulele and sang.

03:05:36.610 --> 03:05:39.050
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: And your
brothers, weren't they in a gospel?

03:05:39.050 --> 03:05:41.040
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: My
brothers all sang.

03:05:41.040 --> 03:05:42.360
They were not in a gospel group.

03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:45.430
They had-- They formed
a group of their own.

03:05:45.430 --> 03:05:46.850
It was just in the neighborhood.

03:05:46.850 --> 03:05:48.670
They didn't do anything
professionally.

03:05:48.670 --> 03:05:51.820
But they would sing on the
street corners and in front

03:05:51.820 --> 03:05:53.980
of the house and where they could.

03:05:53.980 --> 03:05:58.650
When I was growing up in the
neighborhood where I grew up,

03:05:58.650 --> 03:06:03.050 position:56%
these little bands would collect on
the street corners during the summer

03:06:03.050 --> 03:06:07.420
and they would just start playing
conga drums and bongo drums

03:06:07.420 --> 03:06:12.470
and singing and dancing and as I
grew up and became a teenager going

03:06:12.470 --> 03:06:16.070
to high school, traveling a bit
from my home to go to school,

03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:20.220
I was very sad in that the
whole world wasn't like that.

03:06:20.220 --> 03:06:21.740
I thought that happened everywhere.

03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:24.140
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Isn't that
amazing, when you grow up,

03:06:24.140 --> 03:06:25.950
what you see you feel but that's--

03:06:25.950 --> 03:06:27.250
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: That's the world.

03:06:27.250 --> 03:06:28.550

so you feel that that's the world.

03:06:29.850 --> 03:06:31.150
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Right, exactly.

03:06:31.150 --> 03:06:32.450
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Yeah.

03:06:32.450 --> 03:06:33.750
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: When
did you realize

03:06:33.750 --> 03:06:36.550
that the disco was going
to be its own genre?

03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:37.850
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: I realized

03:06:37.850 --> 03:06:42.030
that while I was still singing
rhythm and blues and jazz.

03:06:42.030 --> 03:06:47.040
I was performing up and down
the east coast and a lot

03:06:47.040 --> 03:06:51.000
in New York City and in cabarets.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:54.330
And they'd-- suddenly
the disco music,

03:06:54.330 --> 03:06:56.340
this dance music started coming out

03:06:56.340 --> 03:07:01.900
and Barry White really was
probably the first one.

03:07:01.900 --> 03:07:03.200
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Barry White.

03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:04.500
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: He's
called Barry White.

03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:05.800
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Barry White, yes.

03:07:05.800 --> 03:07:07.100
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Barry White.

03:07:07.100 --> 03:07:08.400
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:09.700
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: He was
called the king of disco.

03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:13.830
And so, they were in
the clubs that I was--

03:07:13.830 --> 03:07:17.930
in the cabaret clubs
that I was working in.

03:07:17.930 --> 03:07:23.290 position:56%
They started to move chairs and make
dance floors and they would have --

03:07:23.290 --> 03:07:27.030
there would variably be a closet
that they would take the--

03:07:27.030 --> 03:07:29.970
open the door, cut the
top half of it off.

03:07:29.970 --> 03:07:34.850
Put a plank like this across that
bottom half of it and that was

03:07:34.850 --> 03:07:40.090
where the DJ's turntable set
and there was your discotheque.

03:07:40.090 --> 03:07:41.780
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Just like that?

03:07:41.780 --> 03:07:43.080
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Just like that.

03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:45.090
And so then someone got
the bright idea of starting

03:07:45.090 --> 03:07:48.760
to build discotheque from the
ground up to build establishments

03:07:48.760 --> 03:07:52.970
that were specifically for people
who wanted to come in and dance.

03:07:52.970 --> 03:07:54.270
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yes.

03:07:54.270 --> 03:07:55.570
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: And, yeah.

03:07:55.570 --> 03:07:56.870
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: And hear music--

03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:58.170
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: That's
when I realize,

03:07:58.170 --> 03:07:59.470
OK, this is going to happen.

03:07:59.470 --> 03:08:03.120
And this is a market that doesn't
have any music at the moment,

03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:10.260
has very little music that is
specific to this style of party.

03:08:10.260 --> 03:08:12.210
And so, I think I'm
going to supply them.

03:08:12.210 --> 03:08:13.880
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yes
you did, yes you did.

03:08:13.880 --> 03:08:16.130
You most certainly did, and
we're glad that you did.

03:08:16.130 --> 03:08:17.430
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Feel a need.

03:08:17.430 --> 03:08:18.730
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah, feel a--

03:08:18.730 --> 03:08:20.030

03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:21.330
[inaudible].

03:08:21.330 --> 03:08:24.300
How did you go about
"I Will Survive",

03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:26.100
creating that, writing that.

03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:27.950
When did you become a part
of the creative process?

03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:29.510
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: I
didn't write it at all.

03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:32.110
I had-- I don't know
if you know the story.

03:08:32.110 --> 03:08:36.320
I've been in-- performing
in New York and so,

03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:40.760
back was over monitor during
a performance jump back up,

03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:44.380
finish my show, went out
to breakfast and went home,

03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:48.470
went to bed, woke the next morning
paralyzed from the waist down.

03:08:48.470 --> 03:08:54.560
And-- But I was only paralyzed
for that period of time

03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:57.390
and until a while after
I got to the hospital.

03:08:57.390 --> 03:08:59.720
Whatever they did to work on
me, they relieve the nerves

03:08:59.720 --> 03:09:01.560
and the paralysis was gone.

03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:02.860
I don't remember any of it.

03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:05.070
The first thing I remember
is saying,

03:09:05.070 --> 03:09:06.870
"Did they serve the lunch yet?"

03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:10.020
[ Laughter ]

03:09:10.020 --> 03:09:11.880
But I was in the hospital.

03:09:11.880 --> 03:09:16.700
So, March until July because they
were trying everything they could.

03:09:16.700 --> 03:09:21.900
It was traction and had to
have a spinal tap, scary.

03:09:21.900 --> 03:09:24.670
There was no such thing as an MRI
then, so they were really trying

03:09:24.670 --> 03:09:27.910
to found out exactly what was
going wrong and what they could do

03:09:27.910 --> 03:09:32.920
so they ended up giving me surgery
on my spine having a fusion,

03:09:32.920 --> 03:09:37.420
spinal fusion, bone graft from
my hips and all of that and so,

03:09:37.420 --> 03:09:41.190
when I came-- while I was in the
hospital, I was like, OK, so,

03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:44.070
what do you mean by this?

03:09:44.070 --> 03:09:45.370
What are we going to do?

03:09:45.370 --> 03:09:47.740
Because the record company had
told me they were not going

03:09:47.740 --> 03:09:49.480
to renew my contract.

03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:52.610
People were going around the record
company saying the queen is dead

03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:55.190
and so, I was really,
really praying.

03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:57.050
I hadn't prayed for a long time.

03:09:57.050 --> 03:09:59.200
You do some dance.

03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:03.690
And so, I was like, you
know, praying, got a Bible

03:10:03.690 --> 03:10:05.950 position:56%
and started reading and all of this,

03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:08.220
and I left the hospital quite
confident that God was going

03:10:08.220 --> 03:10:10.900
to do something I didn't know what.

03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:12.600
While I was at home,
not long after--

03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:13.900
a few weeks after I was home,

03:10:13.900 --> 03:10:16.540
the record company sent me a
letter saying they were not going

03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:20.580
to end my contract and they
wanted me to go out to California

03:10:20.580 --> 03:10:24.270
to record a song that the record
company president has chosen.

03:10:24.270 --> 03:10:28.620
When I got out there, I talked
to the producers and I wanted

03:10:28.620 --> 03:10:29.920
to know what was the B side.

03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:31.220
Remember the B side?

03:10:31.220 --> 03:10:32.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah, I know that.

03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:33.820
You remember that?

03:10:33.820 --> 03:10:35.120
How many of you all
remember the B side ?

03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:36.420
Yes. Yes.

03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:39.510
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: If you didn't
clap, ask the person next to you.

03:10:39.510 --> 03:10:43.180
[ Laughter ]

03:10:43.180 --> 03:10:47.030
So, the B side was
called "Substitute".

03:10:47.030 --> 03:10:49.890
So, I asked them what is
going to be the A side?

03:10:49.890 --> 03:10:51.580
I mean, the A side was
"Substitute" so I asked them,

03:10:51.580 --> 03:10:52.910
what's going to be the B side?

03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:55.950
And they said, well, what
kind of songs do you like?

03:10:55.950 --> 03:10:58.330
And I said, well, I like
songs that are meaningful,

03:10:58.330 --> 03:11:02.800
that touch people's hearts,
that have good melodies,

03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:04.890
people can sing along, you know.

03:11:04.890 --> 03:11:06.190
So they said, you know what,

03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:07.490
we think you're the
one we've been waiting

03:11:07.490 --> 03:11:10.980
for to record this song
we wrote two years ago.

03:11:10.980 --> 03:11:12.490
So, they held "I Will Survive"

03:11:12.490 --> 03:11:14.820
for two years waiting
for the right person.

03:11:14.820 --> 03:11:17.510
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: And you
were the right person.

03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:22.540
[ Cheering and Applause ]

03:11:22.540 --> 03:11:26.130
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: And I just
looked up and said, thank you.

03:11:26.130 --> 03:11:27.970
Because when I read the lyrics,

03:11:27.970 --> 03:11:32.050
I realized that this was a timeless
lyric and I said to them, I said,

03:11:32.050 --> 03:11:33.350
this is a timeless lyric?

03:11:33.350 --> 03:11:34.650
What are you, stupid?

03:11:34.650 --> 03:11:36.680
You're going to put
this on the B side?

03:11:36.680 --> 03:11:38.390
And they said, well, maybe
if they give us a chance--

03:11:38.390 --> 03:11:41.710
so it has got anything to do with
me, it will get a chance now.

03:11:41.710 --> 03:11:44.660
Because as I said, it's a timeless
note everyone is going to be--

03:11:44.660 --> 03:11:45.960
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: And you knew it.

03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:47.260
You knew it.

03:11:47.260 --> 03:11:48.560
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: I knew
it when I read the lyrics

03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:51.310
because I'm standing there
relating to this song--

03:11:51.310 --> 03:11:52.610
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Back brace.

03:11:52.610 --> 03:11:53.910

in a back brace.

03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:55.210
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:11:55.210 --> 03:11:56.510
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: The fact
that my mother had passed--

03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:58.670
I mean, it's like nine years
since my mother passed away

03:11:58.670 --> 03:12:01.990
but that was something I
never thought I'd survive.

03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:03.290
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: I know that.

03:12:03.290 --> 03:12:05.030
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: And I was
still suffering from that.

03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:07.180
Those of you who have lost
your parents, you know,

03:12:07.180 --> 03:12:10.600
no matter how many years
ago, you're still suffering.

03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:12.800
And so, yeah.

03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:14.370
I thought anybody was going to be--

03:12:14.370 --> 03:12:16.090
everybody is going to
be-- relate to this.

03:12:16.090 --> 03:12:18.260
And so, you know, time
has proved me right.

03:12:18.260 --> 03:12:19.910
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: So, when
you stepped on this stage

03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:23.240
and you sang that, what was
the response from the audience

03:12:23.240 --> 03:12:24.630 position:56%
and when it was played on the radio?

03:12:24.630 --> 03:12:26.540
What was-- How did it
resonate with people?

03:12:26.540 --> 03:12:28.570
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Well, first,
let me tell you that when we--

03:12:28.570 --> 03:12:32.300
when I got to the song in my hands
and took it to the record company

03:12:32.300 --> 03:12:34.970
to say, this should be the A side.

03:12:34.970 --> 03:12:36.270
You need to promote this.

03:12:36.270 --> 03:12:38.440
They wouldn't even listen to it.

03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:40.900
So, we-- because the president
had chosen another song,

03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:42.780
but I don't want to go
against his choices.

03:12:42.780 --> 03:12:46.110
So, we went to Studio 54.

03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:47.410
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Oh yeah.

03:12:47.410 --> 03:12:48.710
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Gave
it to the DJ there.

03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:51.550
He played it and the
audience immediately loved it.

03:12:51.550 --> 03:12:55.510
I said, OK, I know I am right
because the New York audiences are

03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:58.920
so jaded, they'll immediately
love anything.

03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:00.220
And if they-- yeah.

03:13:00.220 --> 03:13:01.520
I am- -yeah.

03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:02.820
This is right.

03:13:02.820 --> 03:13:04.170
So, we gave him a stack of them.

03:13:04.170 --> 03:13:08.030
He gave them to his friends around
New York and they began to play it.

03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:12.380
People getting it requested on
radio because they want to hear it

03:13:12.380 --> 03:13:13.850
on their way home, they
want to hear it on the way

03:13:13.850 --> 03:13:17.170
to work and the rest is history.

03:13:17.170 --> 03:13:21.030
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah, what
was your experience, 1970s,

03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:26.510
this music is bringing people
from diverse communities together

03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:30.220
but they have a voice, what
was that experience like?

03:13:30.220 --> 03:13:34.900
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: It
was a discovery for me.

03:13:34.900 --> 03:13:42.100 position:56%
I discovered that there was one
music, the only music in the history

03:13:42.100 --> 03:13:46.340
of music, ever to bring together
people from on to the dance floor,

03:13:46.340 --> 03:13:51.210
people from every nationality,
race, creed, color and age group.

03:13:51.210 --> 03:13:54.600
And that was amazing to me and
I was in the forefront of that.

03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:57.890
And so, I felt really privileged.

03:13:57.890 --> 03:13:59.490
I felt really great about it,

03:13:59.490 --> 03:14:02.070
especially since it is a
music that is so uplifting.

03:14:02.070 --> 03:14:03.370
So, encouraging.

03:14:03.370 --> 03:14:05.350
So, you didn't bring people
together to moan together.

03:14:05.350 --> 03:14:06.650
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Right,
right, right, right.

03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:07.950
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: You
know what I'm saying?

03:14:07.950 --> 03:14:10.970
You didn't bring people together
to cry, you know, to complain.

03:14:10.970 --> 03:14:13.880
You brought people together
to uplift and encourage

03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:19.700
and inspire one another and this
is why I've done a website called,

03:14:19.700 --> 03:14:21.000
iwillsurvive.org.

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:25.310
Please go to it because it is a
community for that very purpose.

03:14:25.310 --> 03:14:29.060
Where people come together and
tell one and tell the stories,

03:14:29.060 --> 03:14:30.530
uplift and encourage one another.

03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:36.270
It's a charity-based website
on which you can purchase.

03:14:36.270 --> 03:14:37.570
We love to purchase, yeah, yeah?

03:14:37.570 --> 03:14:43.190
And at the same time, support a
charity of your choice and some

03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:49.810
of the charities are represented--
maybe I don't know if they're here,

03:14:49.810 --> 03:14:54.560
but they're going to be here.

03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:57.480
Yeah, they are.

03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:03.870
There's BCRF, there's Thrive, there
is Dan and Ron's animal rescue,

03:15:03.870 --> 03:15:08.090
there's Taps for the soldiers.

03:15:08.090 --> 03:15:09.680
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: For the veterans?

03:15:09.680 --> 03:15:13.120
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: For the veterans
a number are gone, please go on

03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:14.920
and see all of these charities

03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:19.880
that you can support while you're
encouraging at lifting one another.

03:15:19.880 --> 03:15:23.210
Join this community
because it's really great.

03:15:23.210 --> 03:15:24.870
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Because
when you say, I will survive,

03:15:24.870 --> 03:15:28.190
everybody can take it
personally and use it differently.

03:15:28.190 --> 03:15:29.490
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Absolutely.

03:15:29.490 --> 03:15:30.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: It means something
different for everyone, doesn't it?

03:15:30.790 --> 03:15:32.090
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Yes.

03:15:32.090 --> 03:15:33.390
Yes.

03:15:33.390 --> 03:15:34.690
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:15:34.690 --> 03:15:35.990
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: It
does mean something.

03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:37.290
It can be applied to so--

03:15:37.290 --> 03:15:38.590
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:15:38.590 --> 03:15:39.890
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: -- many
different areas of your life,

03:15:39.890 --> 03:15:42.090
so many different things, all of
which, any of which might be things

03:15:42.090 --> 03:15:47.730
that you are feeling
is insurmountable and

03:15:47.730 --> 03:15:49.560
yet hoping you'll survive.

03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:53.770
And that way, we can relate to one
another because of those things.

03:15:53.770 --> 03:15:55.070
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:57.170
I can relate when you were
talking about my mom and daddy,

03:15:57.170 --> 03:16:00.660
they are cheering us on right
now from their heavenly balcony.

03:16:00.660 --> 03:16:03.600
And I thought like you, I am not--

03:16:03.600 --> 03:16:07.400 position:56%
how am I going to survive without
Col. Lawrence and Lucimarian Roberts

03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:09.970
and then going through
health crisis in that.

03:16:09.970 --> 03:16:11.270
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Of course.

03:16:11.270 --> 03:16:13.190
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: And so I
understand and so many people,

03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:15.540
who are there-- who are fellow
thrivers here who have been

03:16:15.540 --> 03:16:20.270
through something and it's
gotten-- that's been your anthem.

03:16:20.270 --> 03:16:23.010
And to know that it's here
in the-- so again I sit up,

03:16:23.010 --> 03:16:25.660
Library of Congress and we
heard earlier, you know?

03:16:25.660 --> 03:16:27.710
You know, oh come on now.

03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:37.780
Come on! What that means--

03:16:37.780 --> 03:16:39.390
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: My friends
would tell you this is not normal

03:16:39.390 --> 03:16:41.010
for me to be speechless.

03:16:41.010 --> 03:16:42.320
[ Laughter ]

03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:43.880
But it does.

03:16:43.880 --> 03:16:49.690
It's overwhelming to know
that someone who started

03:16:49.690 --> 03:16:55.010
from such humble beginnings
that I can say that, you know,

03:16:55.010 --> 03:16:57.720
I'm now going to be
history, you know?

03:16:57.720 --> 03:17:02.640
People will come for years
to come and be inspired

03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:05.280
by something that I've done.

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:09.870
Something that I've been a
part of and it's such an honor.

03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:15.090
It's such an unbelievable honor to
be here, to be sitting before you,

03:17:15.090 --> 03:17:19.800
to be a part of the Library
of Congress, to be inducted

03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:21.100
into the Library of Congress,

03:17:21.100 --> 03:17:26.270
to be a part of American
history, it is wonderful.

03:17:26.270 --> 03:17:31.580
And it's not only wonderful
because for me but I'm hoping

03:17:31.580 --> 03:17:35.440
that it's wonderful for so many
other people who started like me.

03:17:35.440 --> 03:17:36.740
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Right.

03:17:36.740 --> 03:17:38.910
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Who are
starting out even now, like me,

03:17:38.910 --> 03:17:43.360
to know what heights you can
reach simply by the gifts, talents

03:17:43.360 --> 03:17:45.490
and abilities that God
has placed in you--

03:17:45.490 --> 03:17:46.790
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Amen.

03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:48.090
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: And
we all have them.

03:17:48.090 --> 03:17:50.290
We all have them.

03:17:50.290 --> 03:17:52.090
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yes, I love that.

03:17:52.090 --> 03:17:55.080
[ Applause ]

03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:59.410
And, you know Gloria, as you became
emotional when you were looking

03:17:59.410 --> 03:18:01.750
at the pieces of Mozart
and other pieces

03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:03.480
that they shared with you today.

03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:04.780
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Yes.

03:18:04.780 --> 03:18:06.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: They're going to--

03:18:06.080 --> 03:18:08.260
years from now, there's going to
be somebody like yourself coming in

03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:14.120
and they're going to see your music
and see, "I Will Survive" in that.

03:18:14.120 --> 03:18:17.970
And just talk about how
you became emotional

03:18:17.970 --> 03:18:20.880
when seeing the great
recordings that are here

03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:26.110
and the great archives
that are here.

03:18:26.110 --> 03:18:32.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: I looked at that
music and realize that I was being--

03:18:32.060 --> 03:18:39.350
having the privilege of being
transported back in time.

03:18:39.350 --> 03:18:42.550
You know, we don't really
need a time machine.

03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:51.760
To be transported back in time just
to experience and gain the rich--

03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:56.210
be benefit by the rich
legacy that other artists

03:18:56.210 --> 03:18:58.990
and other people have
left from their art,

03:18:58.990 --> 03:19:01.610
from their talents,
and their abilities.

03:19:01.610 --> 03:19:07.670 position:56%
This is what this place is all about
and what an honor to stand there

03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:15.700
and see that and be a part of it
and to experience it and to know

03:19:15.700 --> 03:19:18.360
that it is still available
to me now.

03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:22.750
That someone had the forethought
to preserve these wonderful things.

03:19:22.750 --> 03:19:24.050
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Right.

03:19:24.050 --> 03:19:25.860
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: That I can
benefit from them, I can see them,

03:19:25.860 --> 03:19:29.630
that I can experience
them that it's--

03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:32.290
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Can you
express the importance of it

03:19:32.290 --> 03:19:35.230
for not only you, the general
public that can come here

03:19:35.230 --> 03:19:37.500
and witness this and see it?

03:19:37.500 --> 03:19:44.000 position:56%
And they'll also know that disco,
the culture, the fashion, all of it,

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:48.360
you know, is part of this
and you brought this here.

03:19:49.410 --> 03:19:55.780
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: It's important
to-- for self-discovery.

03:19:55.780 --> 03:20:01.840
It's important to recognize, as I
said earlier, that you can do this.

03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:03.730
Anybody can do this.

03:20:03.730 --> 03:20:09.040
Just hone in on what you have
or who you are and be recognized

03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:14.480
as I've often said recently,
you are a designer's original.

03:20:14.480 --> 03:20:15.780
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:20:15.780 --> 03:20:18.700
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Every single one
of us is a designer's original.

03:20:18.700 --> 03:20:23.140
Every single one of us has been
given something to contribute

03:20:23.140 --> 03:20:29.190
to the betterment, to the
welfare, to the progress,

03:20:29.190 --> 03:20:32.730
to the pleasure of mankind.

03:20:32.730 --> 03:20:37.290
And if we hone in on what that
is, not try to be someone else,

03:20:37.290 --> 03:20:39.720
not to try to have
mire other people,

03:20:39.720 --> 03:20:43.840
but recognize that you have
something too to contribute.

03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:48.340
Recognize what that is and be about
finding out what your purpose is

03:20:48.340 --> 03:20:53.290
and bringing that purpose
to the pot, so to speak.

03:20:53.290 --> 03:20:59.530
It's a wonderful thing because
that's what we're all meant to do

03:20:59.530 --> 03:21:02.140
and deep down inside
somewhere, that's what each

03:21:02.140 --> 03:21:03.440
and every one of us wants to do.

03:21:03.440 --> 03:21:04.740
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:21:04.740 --> 03:21:07.780
And we have great guardians
here, the people, the staff--

03:21:07.780 --> 03:21:09.080
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Yes.

03:21:09.080 --> 03:21:10.380
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: -- at
the Library of Congress.

03:21:10.380 --> 03:21:11.680
Don't we?

03:21:11.680 --> 03:21:12.980
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: We do.

03:21:12.980 --> 03:21:14.280
They are a special people.

03:21:14.280 --> 03:21:15.580
This is what they bring.

03:21:15.580 --> 03:21:19.490
This is their particular
talent, their particular ability

03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:23.780
to preserve what we've done.

03:21:23.780 --> 03:21:29.380
Everything that is being preserved
here is showing off their talent,

03:21:29.380 --> 03:21:38.880
their abilities, their desire to
be a part of humankind, to add to,

03:21:38.880 --> 03:21:41.770
to contribute to humankind.

03:21:41.770 --> 03:21:43.070
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Yeah.

03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:46.270
Their passion is-- Their passion
and compassion is unparalleled.

03:21:46.270 --> 03:21:47.570
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Is amazing.

03:21:47.570 --> 03:21:49.380
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: And now "I Will
Survive" is going to be among them.

03:21:49.380 --> 03:21:51.390
I know that you performed

03:21:51.390 --> 03:21:55.020
for the 30th Anniversary,
Michael Jackson Concert.

03:21:55.020 --> 03:21:56.430
Thriller is also here.

03:21:56.430 --> 03:21:57.730
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Yes, yes.

03:21:57.730 --> 03:21:59.030
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: OK.

03:21:59.030 --> 03:22:00.330
So, yeah, "Thriller" is also here.

03:22:00.330 --> 03:22:01.630
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: It's wonderful.

03:22:01.630 --> 03:22:02.930
[ Applause ]

03:22:02.930 --> 03:22:04.230
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: The album, great.

03:22:04.230 --> 03:22:05.530
I know a little bit about that.

03:22:05.530 --> 03:22:06.830 position:56%
That did bring-- this is to bring me
back, you're just bringing me back

03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:08.350
to my great college days.

03:22:08.350 --> 03:22:12.070
What was it like to
perform for Michael Jackson

03:22:12.070 --> 03:22:14.780 position:56%
and not many people got to know him?

03:22:14.780 --> 03:22:19.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: It was wonderful
to perform for someone that I called

03:22:19.270 --> 03:22:22.250
and believed to be the
consummate survivor.

03:22:22.250 --> 03:22:25.670
He survived so many different
things throughout his life.

03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:29.360
And to stand there onstage
and perform for him was--

03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:33.630
and that to have him sitting in
the audience applauding and smiling

03:22:33.630 --> 03:22:36.680
and all of that was
absolutely wonderful.

03:22:36.680 --> 03:22:41.510
I became 295.5% grade A ham.

03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:44.480
[ Laughter ]

03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:48.860
Because I had to my best for
the best and it was wonderful.

03:22:48.860 --> 03:22:51.180
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Give me some
back stories of some other songs.

03:22:51.180 --> 03:22:54.650
"I Never Can Say Goodbye",
"I Am What I Am".

03:22:54.650 --> 03:22:58.100
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: "I Am What I Am"
was brought to me by my producer.

03:22:58.100 --> 03:23:05.370
He had been to the play
[inaudible] and heard the song,

03:23:05.370 --> 03:23:07.620
right sitting in his
seat, watching the play,

03:23:07.620 --> 03:23:11.730
he decided he make a great disco
song, came up with the arrangement,

03:23:11.730 --> 03:23:16.410
called me the next day and had me
come over to his studio and listen

03:23:16.410 --> 03:23:18.520
to what his idea for the song.

03:23:18.520 --> 03:23:19.820
I was like, great.

03:23:19.820 --> 03:23:21.460
This is a great idea.

03:23:21.460 --> 03:23:25.950
Was very, very happy to do that
and I was thinking of as we--

03:23:25.950 --> 03:23:27.810
I was going through the
lyrics, I was thinking

03:23:27.810 --> 03:23:33.100 position:56%
of all the different things that
all the different reasons why people

03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:35.530
need to say, I am what I am.

03:23:35.530 --> 03:23:37.610
Like I said, I'm a
designer's original.

03:23:37.610 --> 03:23:41.290
I am not any more, any less
than you or anybody else.

03:23:41.290 --> 03:23:45.870
And because of who I am and what I
am and how I look and what I wear

03:23:45.870 --> 03:23:48.940
and what I think and how I
feel and all that, any of that,

03:23:48.940 --> 03:23:53.850
make me anything less than anybody
else and, yeah, I am what I am.

03:23:53.850 --> 03:23:55.150
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: I am what I am.

03:23:55.150 --> 03:23:58.570
And it's-- everyone
wants to feel inclusive

03:23:58.570 --> 03:24:00.870
that you're part of something.

03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:04.880
And that's what "I Am
What I Am" and other songs

03:24:04.880 --> 03:24:06.760
that you have brought to us.

03:24:06.760 --> 03:24:11.160
Do you think that's part of the
message, about being inclusive?

03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:12.460
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Yes, I really do.

03:24:12.460 --> 03:24:17.560
Because I think that's
why disco music is

03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:20.300
so popular because it is inclusive.

03:24:20.300 --> 03:24:23.660
It is inclusive, like I said every
nationality, race, creed, color,

03:24:23.660 --> 03:24:27.090
age group, everything, everybody,
is included in this music,

03:24:27.090 --> 03:24:31.090 position:56%
come together and let's be a family.

03:24:31.090 --> 03:24:35.520
And if you wouldn't mind, if you
wouldn't mind, I have something

03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:37.420
that I think I'd like to say--

03:24:37.420 --> 03:24:38.720
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: Please.

03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:40.020
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: --
and it fits right here.

03:24:40.020 --> 03:24:43.380 position:56%
I'm going to-- if you don't mind,
walk over to the podium and do this.

03:24:43.380 --> 03:24:45.510
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: You're Gloria
Gaynor, you do what you want.

03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:49.580
[ Laughter and Applause ]

03:24:49.580 --> 03:24:52.670
Is it not?

03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:53.970
It's all good.

03:24:53.970 --> 03:24:55.270
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Bear me with me.

03:24:55.270 --> 03:24:56.570
Bear with me as I do this.

03:24:56.570 --> 03:24:57.870
Do these work?

03:24:57.870 --> 03:24:59.170
Are these working?

03:24:59.170 --> 03:25:00.470
Are these working?

03:25:00.470 --> 03:25:01.770
Wonderful, wonderful.

03:25:01.770 --> 03:25:08.070
OK. Survive is defined as to
remain alive, to sustain oneself,

03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:12.420
pull through, hold on or out,
to keep body and mind together.

03:25:12.420 --> 03:25:16.450
In 1978, I recorded the
song "I Will Survive".

03:25:16.450 --> 03:25:18.660
Since then until millions
of men, women,

03:25:18.660 --> 03:25:21.100
and children as you know
have adopted this song

03:25:21.100 --> 03:25:23.890
as their mantra including myself.

03:25:23.890 --> 03:25:26.840
But through the years, I've come to
realize that while we were singing

03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:29.660
"I Will Survive" with our
mouths what we were hoping

03:25:29.660 --> 03:25:34.260
in our hearts is that,
I'm going to thrive.

03:25:34.260 --> 03:25:38.360
Thrive is defined as to continue to
live in spite of danger, hardship,

03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:42.400
and to manage to keep going
in difficult circumstances.

03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:44.860
Everyone goes through
difficult situations

03:25:44.860 --> 03:25:46.180
and circumstances in their lives.

03:25:46.180 --> 03:25:50.850 position:56%
And we need to recognize that and be
aware of other people's struggles,

03:25:50.850 --> 03:25:53.880
and be willing to help
when and where we can.

03:25:53.880 --> 03:25:57.610
If we don't care about others,
we cannot expect anyone to care

03:25:57.610 --> 03:26:01.580
about us, and none
of us will survive.

03:26:01.580 --> 03:26:04.380
If one group begins to
perpetuate inhumane acts

03:26:04.380 --> 03:26:07.340
against another while
everyone else simply stands by

03:26:07.340 --> 03:26:11.160
and ignores what's happening,
it provides impetuous

03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:15.400
for other selfish individuals
and groups to do the same,

03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:19.640
until such acts become
commonplace and seemingly normal.

03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:23.640
The atrocities of the
death camps of Auschwitz,

03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:27.210
the slavery of the confederate
states of the United States,

03:26:27.210 --> 03:26:31.650
South Africa as apartheid, the
slavery of the confederate states

03:26:31.650 --> 03:26:34.930
of the United States, South Africa.

03:26:34.930 --> 03:26:36.790
South Africa as apartheid.

03:26:36.790 --> 03:26:41.930
The ethnic cleansing of the Bosnian
War, all went on far too long.

03:26:41.930 --> 03:26:45.480
And those that manage to survive
it not do so without the help

03:26:45.480 --> 03:26:47.530
of concerned and caring others.

03:26:47.530 --> 03:26:54.140
Any of it can happen
again anywhere at anytime.

03:26:54.140 --> 03:26:58.170
As the adage goes, the only thing
necessary for evil to prevail is

03:26:58.170 --> 03:27:00.430
for good men to do nothing.

03:27:00.430 --> 03:27:06.290
So, it is up to each of one of us
to read about, know the stories,

03:27:06.290 --> 03:27:10.130 position:56%
relate, tell and discuss the stories
with others to keep them fresh

03:27:10.130 --> 03:27:14.170
in our minds because if we don't
care about all persons and watch

03:27:14.170 --> 03:27:19.550
out for each other, evil will
prevail, and no one is exempt.

03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:26.020
This United States of America
used to stand for under the banner

03:27:26.020 --> 03:27:33.330 position:56%
of one nation under God, indivisible
with liberty and justice for all.

03:27:33.330 --> 03:27:36.990
Part of that liberty and
justice means that if--

03:27:36.990 --> 03:27:40.700
what I believe to be truth is
different from what you believe

03:27:40.700 --> 03:27:44.910
to be truth, we can and do
share what we each believe

03:27:44.910 --> 03:27:47.280
without reproach from one another.

03:27:47.280 --> 03:27:51.540 position:56%
It means that we are able to
disagree without being disagreeable.

03:27:51.540 --> 03:27:56.370
It means we share our beliefs with
one another without condemnation.

03:27:56.370 --> 03:28:00.270
It means we speak the truth
to one another in love.

03:28:00.270 --> 03:28:03.710
It means that we respect
one another enough

03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:06.890
to examine what the others
believe to be the truth,

03:28:06.890 --> 03:28:11.610
to find what truth we might be able
to accept in what they are saying.

03:28:11.610 --> 03:28:16.250
It means that if we are sure
that what we believe is true,

03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:19.870
we show no hostility,
disdain, arrogance

03:28:19.870 --> 03:28:23.630
or anger toward anyone
else's point of view.

03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:28.300
We show no hostility, we have no
problem with or fear of listening

03:28:28.300 --> 03:28:30.180
to what someone else has to say

03:28:30.180 --> 03:28:33.670
because we are confident
in our own beliefs.

03:28:33.670 --> 03:28:37.020
If I had a diamond and someone
else had a cubic zirconia.

03:28:37.020 --> 03:28:43.020
And they felt that that diamond,
that cubic zirconia was just

03:28:43.020 --> 03:28:47.530
as valuable as my diamond, I
wouldn't be angry with them.

03:28:47.530 --> 03:28:51.690
I would try to share with them
what I know to be the difference

03:28:51.690 --> 03:28:54.460
and the benefit of the
diamond and what it has,

03:28:54.460 --> 03:28:56.690
the benefit that it has
over the cubic zirconia.

03:28:56.690 --> 03:29:00.440
If they refuse to listen and never
believe me, I will simple hope

03:29:00.440 --> 03:29:04.660
and pray someone else could and
would one day be able to explain it

03:29:04.660 --> 03:29:07.080
to them in a way they
could receive it.

03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:10.960
If that never happened, that person
will simply lose out when they get

03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:14.040
to retirement age and I
would be very sorry for them.

03:29:14.040 --> 03:29:17.270
But I would have done
all that I could to help.

03:29:17.270 --> 03:29:22.030
This attitude in way of dealing
with others is the only way to live

03:29:22.030 --> 03:29:27.820
in peace and harmony with others
of differing ideals and ideologies.

03:29:27.820 --> 03:29:30.210
Because of the popularity
of "I Will Survive",

03:29:30.210 --> 03:29:34.020
my name has become synonymous
with the word survive.

03:29:34.020 --> 03:29:38.180 position:56%
That has caused me to take a greater
interest in survival, what it means

03:29:38.180 --> 03:29:40.210
and what it takes to survive.

03:29:40.210 --> 03:29:48.300
Of course getting on in age, I have
to admit adds a little to that.

03:29:48.300 --> 03:29:51.410
Among the many things that
extensive travel has done for me is

03:29:51.410 --> 03:29:55.200
that it has convinced me of
something I already suspected,

03:29:55.200 --> 03:29:59.170
that I live in the greatest
country in the world.

03:29:59.170 --> 03:30:04.700
I have often quipped that
I am 295.5% American.

03:30:04.700 --> 03:30:06.530
We sing "God Bless America".

03:30:06.530 --> 03:30:10.690
Well, because what I have seen
and experienced in my travels,

03:30:10.690 --> 03:30:13.630
I can tell you God
has blessed America.

03:30:13.630 --> 03:30:17.830
My travels have also made
me cognizant of the fact

03:30:17.830 --> 03:30:21.210
that we are the babies or at
least the teenagers of the world.

03:30:21.210 --> 03:30:25.120
And yet we are pretty
much running things.

03:30:25.120 --> 03:30:28.250
America has become a
teenager rock star.

03:30:28.250 --> 03:30:34.400 position:56%
I learned that people of other
nations have loved and respected us.

03:30:34.400 --> 03:30:36.370
They have sought to emulate us.

03:30:36.370 --> 03:30:39.530
They have copied everything from
our politics, desire for person

03:30:39.530 --> 03:30:43.710
of freedom and tolerance to our bad
habits of cigarette smoking strange

03:30:43.710 --> 03:30:48.270
and ever changing fashion sense.

03:30:48.270 --> 03:30:50.000
And I'll bet eating habits.

03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:55.920
I call McDonald's our American
ambassador because it's everywhere.

03:30:55.920 --> 03:30:58.880
I also find that we have the
best junk food in the world.

03:30:58.880 --> 03:31:00.760
Happened to love that.

03:31:00.760 --> 03:31:03.480
Fortunately or unfortunately
depending on your point view,

03:31:03.480 --> 03:31:05.800
we are the richest
country in the world.

03:31:05.800 --> 03:31:08.020
Why? We have become

03:31:08.020 --> 03:31:12.560
like international rock stars
unfortunately in every way.

03:31:12.560 --> 03:31:17.140
We seemed to be so wrapped up and
impressed with our fame and fortune

03:31:17.140 --> 03:31:19.040
that we have begun to
believe our own hype.

03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:23.500 position:56%
Once the very important things began
to go sour, we just seem to focus

03:31:23.500 --> 03:31:24.840
on what was still going good.

03:31:24.840 --> 03:31:29.750
And as much as possible
smooth over the bad publicity

03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:32.090
like the teenage rock star.

03:31:32.090 --> 03:31:35.530
It seemed to me we didn't try
to analyze too closely any ills.

03:31:35.530 --> 03:31:37.460
We just decided to
downplay the cause

03:31:37.460 --> 03:31:41.320
of any problems and
treat the symptoms.

03:31:41.320 --> 03:31:43.420
I'm really not a political person.

03:31:43.420 --> 03:31:46.960
So, I'm not about to
really become political.

03:31:46.960 --> 03:31:51.450 position:56%
But I'd say it's the best-- it's a
safe bet that a lot needs to change.

03:31:51.450 --> 03:31:53.800
For one thing, we have
become a nation

03:31:53.800 --> 03:31:55.910
that is obsessed with
treating symptoms.

03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:57.790
I have said to my friends,

03:31:57.790 --> 03:32:01.530
we here in America have got the
remedies for whatever ills you.

03:32:01.530 --> 03:32:05.030
If you have a pain in your
body, we can give you something

03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:06.450
that will get rid of that pain.

03:32:06.450 --> 03:32:07.750
Now, in the process your arms

03:32:07.750 --> 03:32:11.680
and legs might fall off,
with the side effects.

03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:14.270
But the pain will probably
go with it.

03:32:14.270 --> 03:32:20.750
We have got to become
concerned with treating the core

03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:23.170
and causes of our problems.

03:32:23.170 --> 03:32:25.640
We've got to get back to absolutes.

03:32:25.640 --> 03:32:28.650
Without absolutes, we will parish.

03:32:28.650 --> 03:32:31.070
We know right from wrong-- sorry.

03:32:31.070 --> 03:32:34.720
We know right from wrong,
we know good from evil,

03:32:34.720 --> 03:32:37.690
we know how to cure the
ills of this nation.

03:32:37.690 --> 03:32:42.960
We've got to change this
infection of greed and selfishness

03:32:42.960 --> 03:32:44.730
that has consumed this nation.

03:32:44.730 --> 03:32:47.790
It has to start with you.

03:32:47.790 --> 03:32:55.290 position:56%
With you, the individual, you must
become, I must become the instrument

03:32:55.290 --> 03:32:57.010
in the hands of our savior.

03:32:57.010 --> 03:32:58.710
Our savior is righteousness.

03:32:58.710 --> 03:33:00.930
Our savior is unselfishness.

03:33:00.930 --> 03:33:03.580
Our savior is grace
and mercy for those

03:33:03.580 --> 03:33:05.570
who are less fortunate than we are.

03:33:05.570 --> 03:33:07.920
Our savior is concerned for them.

03:33:07.920 --> 03:33:12.020
Our savior is recognizing
that we are a family and just

03:33:12.020 --> 03:33:13.760
as with your blood families,

03:33:13.760 --> 03:33:16.820
there are those we
don't particularly like.

03:33:16.820 --> 03:33:21.810
But in selfness and righteousness
say, that if we are to survive

03:33:21.810 --> 03:33:24.060
as a family, as a nation,

03:33:24.060 --> 03:33:27.660
we must all have the
opportunities to survive.

03:33:27.660 --> 03:33:31.120
When you deprive or trampled
down the rights or opportunities

03:33:31.120 --> 03:33:33.450
for another person to
use their gifts, talents,

03:33:33.450 --> 03:33:38.970
and abilities to prosper, to reach
his or her greatest potential

03:33:38.970 --> 03:33:43.250
or highest level of productivity,
you deprive yourself of whatever

03:33:43.250 --> 03:33:47.550
that person might have been
able or willing to contribute

03:33:47.550 --> 03:33:49.400
to the betterment of mankind.

03:33:49.400 --> 03:33:56.310
It really amounts to cutting off
your own nose despite your face.

03:33:56.310 --> 03:34:00.650
The Bible says, we have
the inherent ability

03:34:00.650 --> 03:34:03.210
to hide iniquity in our own hearts.

03:34:03.210 --> 03:34:04.880
We must understand
that when we do that,

03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:08.410
we make our hearts the
breeding ground for sin.

03:34:08.410 --> 03:34:10.740
Now, that's an old fashion word.

03:34:10.740 --> 03:34:18.670
One that we really hear because
we are ashamed to say it,

03:34:18.670 --> 03:34:24.570
although most-- many of us are
not ashamed to do what it means.

03:34:24.570 --> 03:34:26.690
The Bible also says that
you shall know the truth

03:34:26.690 --> 03:34:28.350
and the truth will set you free.

03:34:28.350 --> 03:34:31.370
What we need to recognize in
those passages is that the truth

03:34:31.370 --> 03:34:34.030
that you walk in will set you free.

03:34:34.030 --> 03:34:37.090
In other words, you need to do
what you know to be right in order

03:34:37.090 --> 03:34:39.550
for what you know to set you free.

03:34:39.550 --> 03:34:42.570
It's as if we've all been put in
prison by ignorance, arrogance,

03:34:42.570 --> 03:34:44.410
and selfishness and greed.

03:34:44.410 --> 03:34:47.040
And in order to get
out, we must pay bail.

03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:49.810
Our bail is truth.

03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:53.260
It has been paid because
we know the truth.

03:34:53.260 --> 03:34:54.810
We are free.

03:34:54.810 --> 03:35:00.920
But we insist on staying in jail
and not walking in our freedom.

03:35:00.920 --> 03:35:08.860
Why? Very simply and very sadly
because everyone is doing it.

03:35:08.860 --> 03:35:13.580
No one seems to have the
courage to say this is wrong,

03:35:13.580 --> 03:35:15.450
this is counterproductive.

03:35:15.450 --> 03:35:17.730
This is not in our best
interest in the long one.

03:35:17.730 --> 03:35:20.860
No one is willing to recognize
the fact that if we stay

03:35:20.860 --> 03:35:23.120
on this path, we will perish.

03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:24.420
We know the truth.

03:35:24.420 --> 03:35:26.540
So we're not the blind
leading the blind.

03:35:26.540 --> 03:35:30.950
So, when did everyone is
doing it become the criteria

03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:32.370
for our behavior.

03:35:32.370 --> 03:35:33.760
Are we all followers?

03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:35.060
Are there no leaders among us?

03:35:35.060 --> 03:35:39.880
Are we all sheep just following
some unwary leader to slaughter?

03:35:39.880 --> 03:35:41.750
The big difference
between us and sheep is

03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:44.320
that we get to choose our leaders.

03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:48.830
And to avoid anarchy, we must
follow those we choose to lead us.

03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:50.990
But what criteria are we,

03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:55.150
each individual using
to choose our leaders?

03:35:55.150 --> 03:35:59.100
And are our leaders concerned with
or using our needs and desires

03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:03.230 position:56%
to make their choices to create laws
that are in the best interest of us

03:36:03.230 --> 03:36:06.740
who chose them or even in
their own best interest?

03:36:06.740 --> 03:36:12.360
Are we also bogged down in what's
good for me, what feels good to me,

03:36:12.360 --> 03:36:18.380
that selfishness and greed had
become the creed of both choosers

03:36:18.380 --> 03:36:22.220
and the chosen, both the
voters and the electors?

03:36:22.220 --> 03:36:23.520
The elected.

03:36:23.520 --> 03:36:26.970
Have we forgotten that we
are one nation under God

03:36:26.970 --> 03:36:30.300
or is that no longer really true?

03:36:30.300 --> 03:36:32.030 position:56%
Because we stop saying it in schools

03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:34.230
and other government-run
establishments out loud

03:36:34.230 --> 03:36:37.450
in public places, have we truly
stopped saying it, believing it,

03:36:37.450 --> 03:36:39.830
or even wanting it in our hearts?

03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:43.750
Our we truly so wrapped up in
ourselves that we are willing

03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:47.880 position:56%
to reject the only one who knows and
wants what's best for each of us?

03:36:47.880 --> 03:36:50.750
And the only one who is
capable of working things

03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:54.450
out in way that we all win.

03:36:54.450 --> 03:36:55.880
I know some of you
are probably thinking,

03:36:55.880 --> 03:36:58.170
I didn't come here for a sermon.

03:36:58.170 --> 03:37:03.980
Well, when I decided to speak,
I didn't intend to give one.

03:37:03.980 --> 03:37:06.900 position:56%
However, I did want to say things
that would be meaningful and helpful

03:37:06.900 --> 03:37:10.170
and would call us all
to responsibility.

03:37:10.170 --> 03:37:15.570
This is an idea whose
time has come, again.

03:37:15.570 --> 03:37:18.540
The next crop of leaders of this
nation whether in government

03:37:18.540 --> 03:37:21.340
and the industry, in
corporate America or in homes,

03:37:21.340 --> 03:37:25.310
is going to have the responsibility
if joining the incumbent leaders

03:37:25.310 --> 03:37:31.040 position:56%
in helping this nation fall or rise,
fail or prosper, die or survive.

03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:34.640 position:56%
We can either survive intentionally
together or we can perish by default

03:37:34.640 --> 03:37:37.770
because not enough of us
care enough about anyone else

03:37:37.770 --> 03:37:41.310
to strengthen the foundation
of this nation together.

03:37:41.310 --> 03:37:44.330
Everyone knows you
must care, take care of

03:37:44.330 --> 03:37:47.000
and keep strong the foundation.

03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:50.440 position:56%
The working class is the foundation.

03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:53.370
Those who have risen up and
become wealthy have done

03:37:53.370 --> 03:37:56.930
so because we have a
strong working class.

03:37:56.930 --> 03:38:00.210
We stand on their shoulders.

03:38:00.210 --> 03:38:02.690
Has no one noticed
that from the creation

03:38:02.690 --> 03:38:05.670
of this nation we have prospered,
progressed and become stronger

03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:08.690
as a nation as we acknowledge
and champion what's right

03:38:08.690 --> 03:38:11.350
for those too weak to
fight for themselves?

03:38:11.350 --> 03:38:14.160
Has no one noticed that the
nation prospered and became strong

03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:17.050
as the working class became
stronger and more prosperous

03:38:17.050 --> 03:38:21.050
as the downtrodden and victims
of discrimination became fewer

03:38:21.050 --> 03:38:25.970
and as basic righteous
ethics remained our credo.

03:38:25.970 --> 03:38:29.410
This is no coincidence.

03:38:29.410 --> 03:38:33.110
Have we all been lured into a false
sense of security only to be awaken

03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:35.750
by threats from the outside?

03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:38.450
Well, to quote a famous cartoonist,

03:38:38.450 --> 03:38:42.430
"We've seen the enemy
and they is us."

03:38:42.430 --> 03:38:44.850
Another wise man is quoted
as answering the question,

03:38:44.850 --> 03:38:47.430
what's wrong with the world?

03:38:47.430 --> 03:38:52.280
I am. If you will study the lessons
of such books as "Seven Habits

03:38:52.280 --> 03:38:54.240
of Highly Successful
People" and the "Road

03:38:54.240 --> 03:38:56.730
to Character" you will
learn the characteristics

03:38:56.730 --> 03:38:59.600
and ethics necessary
for sustainable success.

03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:02.340
You will learn that it is
dangerous and you are doomed

03:39:02.340 --> 03:39:05.480
to eventual failure if you
allow your gifts, talents,

03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:08.250 position:56%
and abilities to take you to a place

03:39:08.250 --> 03:39:11.790
where your character
cannot sustain you.

03:39:11.790 --> 03:39:16.110
This applies to a nation
as well as an individual.

03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:20.910
It is equally dangerous because
it is arrogant and a flaw

03:39:20.910 --> 03:39:24.840
in one's character to think that
you can sustain success built

03:39:24.840 --> 03:39:27.480
on good character even
though you allow

03:39:27.480 --> 03:39:30.360
that good character to deteriorate.

03:39:30.360 --> 03:39:32.980
That is what this nation has done.

03:39:32.980 --> 03:39:38.310 position:56%
The truth is, if you cannot honestly
say that you have done all you can

03:39:38.310 --> 03:39:43.980
to fix what's wrong, you cannot
honestly say it's not my fault.

03:39:43.980 --> 03:39:50.120
I'm not naive enough or
idealistic enough to think

03:39:50.120 --> 03:39:55.050 position:56%
that this can happen quickly or even
within the next generation or two.

03:39:55.050 --> 03:39:59.770
We need radical change, and radical
change always calls for revolution.

03:39:59.770 --> 03:40:02.290
It will be an arduous task.

03:40:02.290 --> 03:40:04.910 position:56%
Because while it can be a peaceful--

03:40:04.910 --> 03:40:07.220
while it must be a
peaceful revelation starting

03:40:07.220 --> 03:40:11.960
at each individual heart, it must
be spread throughout the nation,

03:40:11.960 --> 03:40:15.570
not necessarily to all but
to a large enough majority

03:40:15.570 --> 03:40:17.560
to bring that radical change.

03:40:17.560 --> 03:40:21.710
Therefore, it will be met with
opposition from those who are

03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:26.370
so limited in foresight, that
they prefer the status quo.

03:40:26.370 --> 03:40:30.680
But every journey begins with
one step and this is the journey

03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:35.130
that must begin, the
nation is broken.

03:40:35.130 --> 03:40:40.360
And as a great-- And as greater
task as it is, as unfair as it is,

03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:44.220
as young people say,
it is what it is.

03:40:44.220 --> 03:40:48.210
And it is our daunting
task to fix it.

03:40:48.210 --> 03:40:51.310
The good news is we can.

03:40:51.310 --> 03:40:54.380
Call me an optimist,
but I believe we can.

03:40:54.380 --> 03:40:59.080 position:56%
But only if enough of us are willing
to take the bull by the horns,

03:40:59.080 --> 03:41:03.500
tighten our own belts, refuse to
be self-indulgent, refuse to walk

03:41:03.500 --> 03:41:06.770
in ignorance or arrogance and
recognize that like it or not,

03:41:06.770 --> 03:41:11.560
we are a family and you
are your brother's keeper.

03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:18.700
If we are true to and persistent
about these things, I promise you,

03:41:18.700 --> 03:41:23.510
as a people, as a nation,
we will survive.

03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:37.040

that I want to say to folks.

Didn't tell me what it was.

03:42:12.610 --> 03:42:15.230

that she was going to share

to speak what's in your heart.

Where did this come from?

03:42:36.520 --> 03:42:38.460
Because as you said, you're
not a political person

03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:43.300
and it shouldn't been seen that
if you talk about the challenges

03:42:43.300 --> 03:42:46.540
that we're facing, that it's all of
a sudden you're right, left, this,

&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Right.

03:42:50.330 --> 03:42:54.160
&gt;&gt; Robin Roberts: What was it
that led you to say those words?

03:42:54.160 --> 03:42:58.490
&gt;&gt; Gloria Gaynor: Well,
the truth is I--

03:42:58.490 --> 03:43:01.640
this is part of a speech
that I had--

03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:05.160
I was going to give in a college.

03:43:05.160 --> 03:43:09.550
And when I-- they asked me for
the speech so that they could look

03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:16.580
at it, they cut it down and
cut out 90% of what's in here.

03:43:16.580 --> 03:43:21.360
But I felt that it
needed to be said.

03:43:21.360 --> 03:43:24.750
It was on my heart and
where it came from.

03:43:24.750 --> 03:43:28.800
Well, when I was called to speak
to these young people who are

03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:35.310
to be our next crop of leaders,
I went into my prayer closet,

03:43:35.310 --> 03:43:38.240
literally, went into my
prayer closet and sat down.

03:43:38.240 --> 03:43:41.740
And I said, Lord, I don't
know what to say to them.

03:43:41.740 --> 03:43:46.440
I need you to tell me what to say.

03:43:46.440 --> 03:43:50.160
And I felt this almost like
gurgling up in my spirit

03:43:50.160 --> 03:43:54.780
and I grabbed my cellphone, my
iPhone and I put it on dictate

03:43:54.780 --> 03:43:57.010
and I begin to say--
there goes an iPhone.

I didn't call you.

And I begin to say what
I heard in my heart.

And that's what-- I didn't
change, I didn't fix it,

03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:08.710
I did nothing, that's it.
