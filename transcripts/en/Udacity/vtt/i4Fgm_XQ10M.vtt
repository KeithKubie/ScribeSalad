00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One last thing I'd like to talk about is the fact that

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the Datastore is sharded in some way

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and replicated.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Google doesn't really share details

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of how this is implemented

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
at a very low level,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but a lot of the constraints that we'll be dealing with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
imply that the database is both sharded and replicated.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So there are some really nice properties here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
One is that you are not going to have to think about scaling--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
too much.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Your queries will generally be quick

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because they have to be simple.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And we might have to think about consistency,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is why I talked a little bit about

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
replication lag so much before in an Intro Class.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Because things are sharded and sometimes

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
your data changes and updates

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
take time to propagate through the system,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we're going to actually have to acknowledge the fact that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we're in a big database system

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and things may not always be consistent in all cases.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's easy to work around these cases, but

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
it is something you have to do consciously.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's do a quick quiz.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Do you understand everything there is to know

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
about the App Engine Datastore?
