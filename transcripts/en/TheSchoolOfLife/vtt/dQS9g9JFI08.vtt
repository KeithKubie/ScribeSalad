00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.220
Love is our highest value, what we all crave
and what we believe makes us fundamentally

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:14.080
human, but it is also the source of considerable
anxiety. Chiefly, we worry whether we are

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.980
entirely normal because it frequently feels
as if we are not experiencing love the way

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.500
we should be. Society is subtly highly prescriptive
in this regard. It suggests that to be a decent

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.369
person, we should all be within sexual relationships
and furthermore, that within these, we should

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.790
‘love’ in a very particular way: we should
be constantly thrilled by our partner’s

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.750
presence, we should long to see them after
every absence, we should crave to hold them

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.289
in our arms, to kiss and be kissed by them
and – most of all – want to have sex with

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.960
them every day or so. In other words, we should
follow the script of Romantic ecstasy throughout

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.050
our lives. This is beautiful in theory and
hugely punitive in practice. If we’re going

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.210
to define love like this and peg the idea
of normality accordingly, then most of us

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.210
will have to admit to ourselves (with considerable
embarrassment) that we don’t know much about

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.870
love – and therefore don’t qualify as
decent, sane, or normal people. We’ve created

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.950
a cult of love radically out of line with
most of our real experiences of relationships.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.140
This is where the Ancient Greeks can help.
They realised early on that there are many

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.290
kinds of love, each with their respective
virtues and seasons – and that a good society

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.160
requires us to append a correct vocabulary
to these different states of the heart, lending

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.560
each one legitimacy in the process. The Greeks
anointed the powerful physical feelings we

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.031
often experience at the start of a relationship
with the word ‘eros’ (ἔρως) . But

00:01:55.031 --> 00:02:00.810
they knew that love is not necessarily over
when this sexual intensity wanes, as it almost

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.160
always does after a year or so in a relationship.
Our feelings can then evolve into another

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.999
sort of love they captured with the word ‘philia’
(φιλία) normally translated as ‘friendship’

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:18.450
though the Greek word is far warmer, more
loyal and more touching than its English counterpart;

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.989
one might be willing to die for ‘philia’.
Aristotle recommended that we outgrow eros

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.290
in youth, and then base our relationships
– especially our marriages – on a philosophy

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.311
of philia. The word adds an important nuance
to our understanding of a viable union. It

00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:40.639
allows us to see that we may still love even
when we are in a phase that our own, more

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:49.389
one-sided vocabulary fails to value. The Greeks
had a third word for love: agape (ἀγάπη).

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:54.219
This can be best translated as a charitable
love. It’s what we might feel towards someone

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:59.000
who has behaved rather badly or come to grief
through flaws of character – but for whom

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.450
we still feel compassion. It’s what a God
might feel for his or her people, or what

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.510
an audience might feel for a tragic character
in a play. It’s the kind of love that we

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.400
experience in relation to someone’s weakness
rather than their strength. It reminds us

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.069
that love isn’t just about admiration for
virtues, it’s also about sympathy and generosity

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.540
towards what is fragile and imperfect in us.
Having these three words to hand – eros,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.890
philia and agape – powerfully extends our
sense of what love really is. The Ancient

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:43.280
Greeks were wise in dividing the blinding
monolith of love into its constituent parts.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.639
Under their tutelage, we can see that we probably
have far more love in our lives than our current

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.920
vocabulary knows how to recognise.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.160
