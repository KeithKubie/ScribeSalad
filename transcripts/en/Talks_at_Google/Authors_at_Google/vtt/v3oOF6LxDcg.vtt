ADAM LEONARD: All right,
welcome everyone.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.600
My name is Adam Leonard.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.640
I'm with Google's People
Development department and I'm

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.590
happy to introduce and to
welcome Jake Breeden today to

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.530
introduce and to talk
about his new book,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.620
"Tipping Sacred Cows--

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.750
Kick the Bad Work Habits that
Masquerade as Virtues."

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.380
So Jake teaches as part of the
faculty, global faculty, for

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.790
Duke Corporate Education, which
is one of the world's

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.080
top-ranked providers of custom
corporate education.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.550
And it's taken him around the
world, over 27 countries,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.930
consulting with numerous

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110
corporations, including Google.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.500
So he did work coaching and
challenging leaders as part of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.280
Google's Business Academy.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.470
And so I'm particularly
interested in Jake's talk

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.930
today because one of things he's
going to do in tipping

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.100
these sacred cows is, challenge
many of the things

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.599
that we hold to be important
around here-- collaboration,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.810
creativity.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.010
And we're also, in my experience
so far, we're good

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.470
at holding ambiguity.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.900
And so I think I'm welcoming
Jake's challenge to see, what

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.320
are the other side of some
of these things that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.830
we hold to be sacred?

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.050
So welcome, Jake.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.930
JAKE BREEDEN: Thank you.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.820
JAKE BREEDEN: Thank you.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.720
When you're young, you probably
preferred simple

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.470
flavors, simple textures.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.200
You know, lemonade, rice.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.920
Simple tastes, simple flavors
when you were young, perhaps.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.090
Candy, cola.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.120
And as you've gotten a little
bit older, you've begun to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.910
crave more complex flavors.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.060
The seemingly paradoxical
flavors of like a briny caviar

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.480
that's also savory, or a dark
chocolate that's bittersweet,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.620
or a wine for some of you, like
an earthy Bordeaux wine.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.699
More complex flavors.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.970
In the same way that our mouths
crave more complex

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.540
tastes as we age, our minds
crave more complex ideas.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.950
Young minds crave
simple ideas.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.200
They crave ideas, but putting
things into buckets and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.060
understanding where the
pieces fit, what piece

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.730
fits in what bucket.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.490
And as our minds mature, we
begin to crave more ideas in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.190
the same way that are mouths
crave more complex tastes.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.880
And a complex idea that leaders,
especially crave, and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.085
especially successful leaders
crave, are paradoxical ideas.

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:54.540
There's a pretty striking piece
of research that looked

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.590
at folks along a broad set of
companies, a broad set of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.540
industries, a broad set of
countries, and said, what

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.400
separates people who stay in
the middle management level

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.440
from folks to move
up to the top?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.950
That was the research question
that they asked.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.580
And there are many answers, but
somewhat surprisingly, the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.640
thing that stood out was the
preference for paradox.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.500
That the most successful leaders
have brains that don't

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.740
just deal well with paradoxical
ideas, but crave

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.260
them in the same way that
our palates might

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.860
crave a complex taste.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.790
I want to share with you today
three paradoxes, and I'll

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.120
present three paradoxes for
your consideration.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.790
These are the three--

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.720
first, that to have more
excellence, you must have less

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.170
excellence.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.840
And in particular, to have more
excellence in the things

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.310
that matter most, you must have
less excellence where it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.050
doesn't matter as much.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.060
Being purposeful about the way
you think about standards.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.080
Second, that to have more
collaboration, you must have

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.460
less collaboration.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.530
And what I mean is, to have more
collaboration where it

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.670
counts, where it leads to the
things that you need more of,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.660
the kind of innovation that you
need more of, for example,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.269
the business results that you
need more of, you actually

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.620
need less collaboration in other
areas, in other places.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.630
And we'll talk about the
problem of too much

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.750
collaboration.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.980
And we'll talk in particular
about the way that virtue like

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.040
collaboration tends
to act as a mask.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.300
It prevents us from seeing
what's really going on, which

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.190
we're excusing away
bad behavior.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.430
We say, hey I'm collaborating,
I'm playing well with others,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.680
I'm doing what at what
I should be doing.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.290
When actually, it's masking
some bad behavior.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.010
In this particular case
of collaboration, not

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.520
collaborating with the kinds
of folks who could be more

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.250
productive for you.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.620
And the third paradox we'll
look at is that to be more

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.720
creative, you must
be less creative.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.050
And in particular, we'll talk
about the way that needless

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:10.040
creativity, narcissistic
creativity, saps energy from

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.890
the pragmatic creativity that
you actually need to get

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.130
things done.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.780
So there's this interplay
between the good excellence

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.780
and the bad excellence, the good
collaboration and the bad

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.050
collaboration, and the good
creativity and the bad

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.900
creativity.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.120
That's how we'll spend about
the next 25 minutes, and in

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.320
each of them I'll do a bit of
setup and I'll get you talking

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.560
with somebody next to you to
see if you can uncover some

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.070
times where you've fallen into
the trap of the bad.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.110
And then I'll have a bit of Q&amp;A
and I'll leave you with

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.550
one last thought, and sign a
few books, and all of this

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.020
will be done by, let's say,
five minutes to two.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.630
Ready to go?

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.860
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.420
JAKE BREEDEN: All right, let's
start with excellence.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.090
So I'm going to give you a
piece of data and then

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.290
together, let's make some
meaning from the data.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.500
And then let's see if we can
go from the meaning to a

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.800
recommendation.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.240
So here's the data.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.730
There's a woman named Emerald
Archer who did her Ph.D. at UC

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.020
Santa Barbara in political
psychology.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.400
She studied female Marines at
Camp Pendleton, a Marine base

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.970
outside of San Diego.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.720
And she was interested in one
question, which is, why do

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.790
female Marines under perform
their male companions, their

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.720
male colleagues, their male
peers, on the rifle range?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.080
Right?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.640
So she studies performance of
Marines on the rifle range

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.490
looking at performance
by gender to try

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.990
to answer this question.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.600
What is it?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.920
And she did the following
test.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.250
Her hypothesis was that when the
female Marines were primed

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.540
to think of the test as a test
of gender, they would perform

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.100
worse than if they didn't
think of it as a test of

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.770
gender, that if gender
didn't matter.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.320
And so what she would do is, she
would, in one condition,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.550
she would prime the female
Marines before they would go

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.580
to the rifle range and
shoot at, by the

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.670
way, 500 meters, right?

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.250
So this is incredibly long
distance when they're shooting

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.020
on the rifle range at
Camp Pendleton.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.350
And in one condition, she would
prime the women, the

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.460
Marines, to say, there's a lot
of research that says women,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.370
here's the data, women tend to
under perform, at sort of 85%,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.330
shoot at about 85% the success
rate of their male colleagues.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.380
This is a test of that.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.820
Let's see how we do.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.240
And then the other group, she
had only women, but she didn't

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.960
tell them that this was a
test of a gender at all.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.930
She just, it was made to seem
as if it's random, that it

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.915
just happened to be four women
there shooting at a range,

00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:49.410
there are no men around
and there was no

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.760
priming around gender.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.610
And in fact, when there was no
priming and when there was

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.190
only women there, they shot at
exactly the same level as men.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.080
Much higher than they had
been shooting before.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.960
So she presents her research,
and it's quite clear that when

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.850
primed to think of the test
as a test of gender, they

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.080
underperformed the other
scenario, when they weren't

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.260
primed to think of it
as a test of gender.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.730
So that's the data.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.660
What do you think is
going on there?

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.690
What's your interpretation
of that?

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.870
AUDIENCE: So when you're
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.785
that a certain condition is met,
like you're more likely

00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:33.870
to extreme that position because
maybe you're not

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.360
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.640
JAKE BREEDEN: Self-fulfilling
prophecy, essentially.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.020
So OK, any other ideas?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.150
Self-fulfilling prophecy, one.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:42.770
What else?

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.780
Same data, any other ways
to interpret the data?

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.750
Yep?

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.680
AUDIENCE: You could be worried
that you're getting measured

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.660
on other variables, and so their
focus, like, the idea

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.630
that they're focusing a little
bit less on like, actual

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.990
shoot, like, shooting the rifle
because they're focusing

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.586
on excellence in other
areas, I presume?

00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:02.500
JAKE BREEDEN: Oh,
I see, I see.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.940
So this would be the
psychological concept there is

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.800
crowding out.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.040
So they're focused on these
other areas, these other

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.700
variables, that actually don't
help the performance in the

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.770
tested condition, right?

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.680
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.620
JAKE BREEDEN: So I'll share with
you Emerald's point of

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.000
view, what she says, and this
is one of these things where

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.240
nobody knows what the
real answer is.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.700
We know what the data is.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.630
When you go to interpretation,
this is a matter of theory and

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.410
interpretation.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.810
But I'll tell you hers.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.160
So Emerald, again,
Emerald Archer

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.790
studying at UC Santa Barbara.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.210
I interviewed her
about this test.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.940
It turns out, she grew up
outside of Camp Pendleton as a

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.460
little girl.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.220
Her father was a contractor
and he worked building the

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.420
barracks on the Marine base.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.550
And he would often have Marines
over for picnics.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.980
And so she said, typically on a
Saturday or Sunday we might

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.630
have several Marines grilling
out, having a picnic.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.780
And she said at a young age, she
says, this is her talking,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.840
I noticed the following
thing--

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.240
that the women would sort
of take care of

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.460
things at this picnic.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.240
They would pick up after the
guys, they would get the beers

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.540
or clean up.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.110
And she said as a young woman,
as a young girl, this seemed

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.750
ridiculous to me.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.580
And she said, I even noticed
that when the women outranked

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.860
the guys, that gender ended up
being a greater predictor of

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.060
the sort of social subservience
than rank.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.770
So you would literally have
higher ranking Marines sort of

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.890
taking care of things.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.320
So she became, at a young age,
you can picture this young

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.440
woman, she's focused on that, so
she dedicates her career to

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.020
trying to understand this, and
it becomes the focus of or a

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.510
Ph.D. dissertation.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.460
Here's Emerald's, Emerald's
thought is that it's

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.800
essentially along the lines of
the crowding out, that the

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.710
cognitive load, the
cognitive load of

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.470
worrying about this category.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.890
In this case, women, the
cognitive load of worrying

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:06.930
about this category, robs the
Marines of the cognitive

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.490
attention they need to give
to this act of shooting.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.350
And this falls more broadly
under an area called

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.260
stereotype threat, and it's been
shown, for example, with

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.450
student athletes.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:23.070
You go to universities and you
get a set of student athletes

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.640
and you prime them to think
of themselves primarily as

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.930
student athletes and says it's
shown that student athletes

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.090
tend to under perform their
colleagues who aren't student

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.630
athletes on standardized
tests.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.520
Now take a standardized test.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.340
And sure enough, the sort of the
notion of, I want to prove

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.870
it, ends up being paramount.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.070
And by the way, the anecdotes
supported the notion when she

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.890
would interview the female
Marines who were engaged in

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.070
these tests in which they'd been
primed, they would say

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.430
things like, I was going
to make sure.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.680
I was going to make sure that
this false stereotype, that we

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.020
can't shoot as well as
a man, was disproven.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.570
And this was one woman in the
study, she went on to say, but

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.300
unfortunately, I did
the opposite.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.020
Unfortunately, I did
the opposite.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.210
And unfortunately, I did the
opposite, is kind of the theme

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.320
to the study, to the book.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.140
Unfortunately, I did
the opposite.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.460
It's the undead unintended
consequence.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:23.120
So we're still in excellence,
this first paradox, and the

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:29.980
punch line is, to get to an
excellent destination,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.700
sometimes you have to take a
meandering path and lower the

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.410
stakes, lower the standards.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.920
So think about this now, think
about yourself, think about

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.940
perfectionism.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.880
Think about times when
you're working

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.120
hard to prove something.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.090
This is when it's especially
dangerous, when you need to

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.870
prove a point to yourself
or to someone else.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.480
Maybe it's part of a class
that you belong that's is

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.670
perceived to not to
be as strong.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.650
It's shown, we have this insight
that the cognitive

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.990
load, it simply becomes
overbearing, your need to

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.160
prove that you can do
this thing well.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.270
And unfortunately, the opposite,
but you end up

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.010
proving the opposite true,
unfortunately.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:20.680
Before I get you to talk to a
neighbor on, about how, what

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.570
are you trying to prove, and to
whom, and how does it get

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.980
in your way of performance, I
want to give you a glimmer of

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.050
hope, of light, an example,
a success story.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:35.370
A success story of this, what I
would propose, is a healthy

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.580
use of excellence, a healthy
use of high standards.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.100
And it's in your neighborhood,
in your neck of

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.020
the words with Pixar.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.555
So raise your hand if you saw
the movie, "Aladdin." Did

00:13:47.555 --> 00:13:49.360
anybody see the movie,
"Aladdin?" Not a Pixar film.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.120
Look around.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.020
Most of you saw "Aladdin." raise
your hand if you saw,

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.100
not the first sequel to
"Aladdin", but the second

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.520
sequel to "Aladdin." It was
called "Aladdin King of

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.660
Thieves." Raise your hand if
you saw "Aladdin King of

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.140
Thieves." OK one person, two
people saw "Aladdin King of

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.830
Thieves."

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.170
All right, now the next piece of
data here, raise your hand

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.660
if you saw the movie,
"Toy Story."

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.190
OK, pretty much everybody.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.160
Now, but here's the, this is the
money question, raise your

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.650
hand if you saw "Toy Story 3."
OK, also, like about 60% of

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.010
the people.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.850
So what I would want to shine
a spotlight is, if we were

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.310
doing bar charts here, the drop
off between "Aladdin" and

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.730
"Aladdin King of Thieves"
was from here to there.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.180
The drop off between "Toy Story"
and "Toy Story 3" was

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.680
here to there a little bit.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.870
Actually, "Toy Story 3" sold
more, did more at the box

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.280
office than "Toy Story." "Toy
Story 3" is the most

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:46.190
successful Pixar film to date
commercially and arguably,

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.570
critically, because it was
nominated for Best Picture.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.870
Not just Best Animated,
but Best Picture.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.290
So here's the point.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.060
Pixar has an attitude that says,
even our sequels, we

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.790
will reject the old Disney
approach of,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.640
let's sweat the asset.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.250
Meaning, we invested a lot in
"Lion King", we invested a lot

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.360
in "Aladdin", now let's invest
much, much less.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.850
We'll go direct to video and
what we're just going to get

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.650
returns off of the second
sequel, the third sequel We'll

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.240
invest a little bit, but
we'll make a little bit

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.030
more and it's OK.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.380
Pixar rejects that.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.050
Pixar says, everything we do
is going to be excellent.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.730
Every single thing we do is
going to be excellent.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.387
Doesn't sound like the notion
of being at a rifle range,

00:15:27.387 --> 00:15:28.690
saying, it must be excellent.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.760
Here's the difference--

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.530
the habit they have every
single day is, you share

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.480
incomplete work.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.510
Imagine you're an animator.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.270
You're 23 years old, you get
your dream job working at

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.580
Pixar as an animator and it's
4 o'clock on your first day

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.810
and you gather around and,
OK, let's share what you

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.300
worked on so far.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.970
And you're going to be asked
to share with somebody who

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.720
just won the Oscar for Best
Animated Feature last year.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.760
It could be intimidating.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.610
And the first day, it
is intimidating.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.050
But here's what the leaders
do, they build a habit of

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.070
sharing incomplete work.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.860
So it takes the sting of shame
out of in-completion.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.950
It takes the sting of shame
out of rough progress.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.180
They get more rough drafts,
rougher rough drafts, more

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.260
progress, more willingness to
just put your stuff out there,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.470
put yourself out there.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.180
They lower the stakes instead
of raising the stakes and

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.520
saying, this must be good.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.640
They lower the stakes and they
say, let's just get more and

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.190
more drafts, more reps, more
versions out of this thing.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.730
Let's create a culture
where it's a habit,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.760
it's not a big deal.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.630
You just share your stuff.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.770
That's just what we do.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.780
And as a result, they have a
better shot, no guarantee,

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.530
there's no guarantees in
anything artistic like trying

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.280
to make a successful film.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.710
No guarantees the same process
that they used in "Toy Story

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.490
3", they used in "Brave"
to less success.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.460
It still made money, but not at
the level of "Toy Story 3",

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.840
but what it does is, it
increases the chances that

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.880
you'll achieve excellence
in the end.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.530
So here's what I want
you to do now.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.040
I'm going to ask you, I'm going
to invite you, to talk

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.830
to one person in
the room here.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.470
So find a group, so group two,
maybe groups of three, and

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.890
just have this chat.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.079
When do we ever here, fall into
the trap of unhealthy

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:13.800
excellence, of high standards
that don't help?

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.274
Is my question clear?

00:17:15.274 --> 00:17:15.730
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.310
JAKE BREEDEN: OK, so just for
three, four minutes, have a

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.795
chat with somebody near you.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.130
I'm curious if anyone would be
willing to just share the

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.315
example they talked about?

00:17:39.315 --> 00:17:42.140
Not required at all, but
just the opportunity.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.722
Anyone willing to share?

00:17:44.722 --> 00:17:48.089
AUDIENCE: It's not my experience
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:49.051
I'm a researcher.

00:17:49.051 --> 00:17:50.494
JAKE BREEDEN: OK.

00:17:50.494 --> 00:17:53.380
AUDIENCE: But there was, at the
beginning, when I started

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.710
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:55.920
JAKE BREEDEN: Not here,
but some other place?

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.220
AUDIENCE: Not here.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.080
JAKE BREEDEN: OK.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
anxiety of having the research

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.800
report perfect.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.640
All the data, all the
recommendations, all the new

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.110
designs, all the proposals.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.620
Everything [INAUDIBLE] right.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.279
right And then, you know, when
I decided to drop that and

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:14.655
say, no, what I care about, the
product, I care out the

00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:16.635
PMs, I care about [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:19.610
and I don't care about having an
amazing report [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.350
Academic research, you know.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.160
JAKE BREEDEN: So helping the
PMs move things forward?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.170
JAKE BREEDEN: That's
what mattered?

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.650
JAKE BREEDEN: The perfection of
the report didn't matter.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.040
The report was there to help
the PMs move things forward

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.130
along the development process.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.560
So this is a great example of a
punchline, before I move on,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.930
here here's the punchline, you
may need to do less than

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:48.090
excellent work in order to
do an excellent job.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.660
I want everybody in this room
to think about doing an

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.970
excellent job, and everyone
to think about doing

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.730
an excellent job.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.020
And in order to do an excellent
job, in, for

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.220
example, moving things along
with the PMs, to do an

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.030
excellent job at that, you may
need to permit yourself to do

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.990
a little bit less than excellent
work, and that can

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.830
be really, really hard.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.370
What I'm asking you to do
though, is to have the sort of

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.350
intellectual sophistication and
the maturity to decouple

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.740
the work from the job.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.630
And importantly, and here's the
real psychological punch,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.140
to decouple the work
from yourself.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.900
To say, this is my
work, not me.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.050
I'm an excellent human being,
and as an excellent human

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.350
being, it may be that I
need to produce less

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.190
than excellent work.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.390
So we all are constantly on
that journey of decoupling

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.470
ourselves from our work.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.390
The second paradox--

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.720
in order to have more
collaboration, you need to

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.370
have less collaboration.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.430
And in particular, in order to
have the kind of collaboration

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.810
that helps, you need to
collaborate less.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.170
Some of the research that I did
for this book, and here's

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.630
is an anecdote, talked to
somebody who worked at a big

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.970
company who is a senior
director.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.170
Senior director at a big
company and he said, I

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.050
surveyed everybody on my team
and I got the average of the

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.310
following variable--

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:13.860
number of hours per week spent
in standing meetings,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.450
regularly recurring meetings,
meetings that you know, on

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.650
Sunday night, you know your
week has these meetings in

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.630
them already.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:26.190
And the number for people
on his team was 22.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.390
I'm not sure what it would be
for you, if that would be

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.240
higher or low for you,
for 22 hours.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.190
Here's a here's the
problem, though.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:39.310
These 22 hours of standing
meeting, they were mostly, I

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.190
mean, by definition, by being
the standing, regularly

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.050
recurring, were with people
who they knew.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.160
With friends, you might say.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.950
People in the inner circle.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.590
That's collaboration.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.940
We want to celebrate
collaboration.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.910
Collaboration is a virtue.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.830
Work more with others.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.750
Play well with others.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:04.270
Except when your collaboration
muscle is exerted in spending

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.020
more time with the people you
work with and who think

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.710
similarly to you, it ends up
giving less space and time for

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.540
the more helpful collaboration
across boundaries, across

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.270
borders, to people who think
differently than you.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.850
And it turns out that the
animating force behind this,

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.550
the driving force behind this,
is that it just feels good to

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.550
be around people who
think like us.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.770
It just, it's so soothing.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.630
It's like a nice, warm, cuddly
blanket to be surrounded by

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.880
like minded people.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.070
It's just this safe, snuggly
environment to say, yes, I

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.240
don't even have to try.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.240
I can just say, this
is what I think.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.250
Oh, you think that, too?

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.610
Oh, yes, this feels so good.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.000
We all think the same thing.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.090
You're not a bad person.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.200
You are a person if you
behave in that way.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.470
You are a human being.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.520
We are social.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.510
We are a social species and we
tend to cluster and clump in

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.790
these like groups.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.280
So here's the big point.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.070
What's preventing you from
collaborating is

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.440
collaboration.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.220
It's not individual.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.870
It's often presented as, stop
being such a Lone Ranger.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.950
You're not in the
Lone Star state,

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:12.930
don't be the Lone Ranger.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.480
Don't be just an individual,
rugged cowboy.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.800
You need to spend more time
working with others.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.640
Actually, that's not
the dynamic.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.800
If you look at the research,
what's soaking up the time

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.260
that could be spent in
collaborating with other

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.050
folks, what's soaking up the
time is collaborating with

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.180
people like you.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.770
And so there's a simple
punchline, which is, in your

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.440
collaboration, you
should do less

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.500
spinning and more hopping.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.210
And spinning is just more
meetings with the people who

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.660
you work with, who
are on your team.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.250
And more hopping across
other teams.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.220
A.G. Lafley, very successful CEO
of Procter &amp; Gamble, one

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.190
of the things he did when it got
to the top is he said, we

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.390
are constantly internally
looking at process, talking

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.320
about process, designing
process, to look the process,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.680
and evaluating things in a very
process-friendly way.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.810
And as we're doing that, we're
looking at each other and our

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.030
backside is facing
the customer.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.030
When our backside is facing
the customer, when all our

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:18.230
stuff is internal, intrinsic,
we're not getting enough real

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.620
life hard data from
the real world.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.830
There's a phenomenon, if you
look across species, called

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.660
the bait ball.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.020
So fish school together when
faced with a predator.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:38.350
Gazelles form a herd when
faced with a predator.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:44.310
We human beings can also cluster
together and clump

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.940
together because
it feels safe.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.820
Too often, we collaborate to
hide, not to accomplish.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.510
So my suggestion is that we sort
of divert some of that

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.630
energy from collaborating with
like minded people to

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.470
collaborating across.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.090
With that, I'm reading
your body language.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.975
Did you did you disagree with
something that I said?

00:24:04.975 --> 00:24:06.250
AUDIENCE: Me?

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:06.510
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.040
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.340
JAKE BREEDEN: No?

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.510
OK all right, maybe you--

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.330
AUDIENCE: I was just
thinking about it.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:09.900
JAKE BREEDEN: OK.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.010
Because I love disagreement.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.390
I mean, that's one of the things
I'm a big advocate, one

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:17.150
of the things, the hero of the
book is challenge and push

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.470
back, and so some--

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.520
let me make that explicit.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.930
We've been together now 25
minutes, we're good friends.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.100
So push back a challenge
at any point.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.040
SAM: Are you say you
need to do both?

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.350
JAKE BREEDEN: There we
go, there's Sam.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.840
So Sam says, are you saying
you need to do both?

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.340
SAM: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] facing
the customer as far as facing

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.340
internally.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.870
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah, what I'm
saying, to be clear, is do

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.500
less of the thing where you're
collaborating more with people

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.540
like you and more of the thing
where you're collaborating

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.170
with people less like you.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.730
And the less like you, use your
own judgment as to what

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.340
that means in your particular
context.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.170
I am not a zealot.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.360
One point of "Tipping Sacred
Cows" is anti-zealotry, right?

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.920
So I'm not a zealot saying you
can go all the way to one.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.930
I am saying, right now, the
balance is a little bit out of

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.290
kilter, is my suggestion.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.770
So do you think, does that
happen here, the notion of

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.740
collaborating within your
group, perhaps to the

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.770
detriment of collaborating
across groups?

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.380
Spinning instead of hopping?

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.500
Some people are nodding
their heads, yes.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.830
What are some successful
ways to avoid that?

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.100
Has any of you seen that?

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.555
Yes?

00:25:31.555 --> 00:25:34.465
AUDIENCE: On my team we've
done collaborative OKRs.

00:25:34.465 --> 00:25:37.350
So you have to have an OKR
that's based on someone else's

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.580
team and that person on that
team has to have the same one

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.120
as you so that you work
on it together.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.360
That tries to keep
you outside.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.470
You still work [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.750
media team to get the work done,
but it just gives you

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.266
kind of a goal to work for
somebody on a different team

00:25:49.266 --> 00:25:51.880
with a different perspective on
a project or a topic or a

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.003
solution that kind of
just gets you out of

00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:54.820
your comfort zone.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.800
JAKE BREEDEN: OK.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.920
I think that's good.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.720
That's a good example.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.870
It parallels the Pixar example
of a purposeful attempt.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.530
That is one of the primary
things that I advocate, is a

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.950
little bit more purpose.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.090
If you just go with the tide,
you will end up collaborating

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.090
with people like you
and in a way that's

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.460
perhaps more helpful.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.480
Have purpose and intent
to say I they need to

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.540
reach across borders.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.660
Were you going to
say something?

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.053
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:20.053 --> 00:26:20.840
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.494
Make standing meetings
literally standing.

00:26:23.494 --> 00:26:23.976
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:24.458
AUDIENCE: No.

00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:26.270
AUDIENCE: Because that naturally
limits the amount of

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.880
time you spend doing it.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.220
JAKE BREEDEN: Yes, put the
physiology on your side.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.790
And often, when you're sitting
down, the physiology

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.560
is not on your side.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.350
So there may be like, a little
part of your brain, the

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.150
unhealthy part of your brain,
that says, come up with excuse

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.000
to stay in this comfy
chair longer.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.900
And that part of your brain,
well I have another point I'd

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.370
like to suggest.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.920
That's not healthy,
helpful behavior.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.760
One last thing about
collaboration.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.090
Talk to me about
brainstorming.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:58.440
I'm interested, is brainstorming
good?

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.360
AUDIENCE: To a point.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.100
JAKE BREEDEN: Brainstorming
is good to a point?

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.280
Is brainstorming bad?

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.400
Raise your hand if you think
brainstorming is a bad idea,

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.800
proven to be unhelpful.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.150
Looks like one person.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.026
Tell me more about your
point of view.

00:27:15.026 --> 00:27:16.018
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:16.018 --> 00:27:20.978
and like you said, a lot of
findings that brainstorming,

00:27:20.978 --> 00:27:26.930
you tend to revisit the same
points and clump your

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.371
because everyone
is saying, yes.

00:27:32.371 --> 00:27:32.840
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.180
So let me be clear about
my point of view.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.000
And it is based on some of the
findings that you talk about.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.140
There's a woman at Berkeley
who's done

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.960
a lot of this research.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.540
Brainstorming is bad.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.010
It destroys value, it
doesn't add value.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.470
Now, brainstorming is good
at the following thing.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.110
It's good at, it's fun.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.730
It's good at, as a kind
of team builder.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.000
It's cheaper than going go
kart racing and can make

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.680
people feel good, like, yea,
let's just come up with a

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.950
bunch of ideas together.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.950
And it feels good.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.520
So it's good for that, but
it's not good for work in

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.480
terms of, you don't produce
better ideas by brainstorming.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:18.190
And in particular, so this is a
surprise to some of you, the

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.180
research is so clear, yet the
myth still persists that

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.870
brainstorming adds value.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.200
I mean, it's really, it's 50
years old, the research that

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.530
shows that brainstorming
is bad.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.420
So let me be clear, in a
research-based way, what do I

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.530
mean by brainstorming?

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.290
I mean getting a bunch of people
in a room and saying,

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.980
what do you think we do
about this problem?

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.540
What's your idea?

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.370
What's your suggestion?

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:46.380
It turns out that that's a less
utility in that approach

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.800
than having individual people
separately, on their own,

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.780
quietly write down and come
up with a list of ideas.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:58.510
You end up with fewer ideas
and lower quality of ideas

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.830
when you get people together.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.830
And let's just get our heads
together on this one because

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:07.640
there's this myth that just,
more is better than less, we

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.570
need more people in there and
let's brainstorm ideas.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.920
And just, the research
doesn't bear it out.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.770
The woman's name at Berkeley,
her last name is Nemeth, so

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:21.490
some of you are interested
this, it's N-E-M-E-T-H.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.590
N-E-M-E-T-H. Charlan,
C-H-A-R-L-A-N

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.850
is the first name.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.130
So if you were to just search
for Nemeth you could see that.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.090
There's another particular thing
within brainstorming

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:40.380
that is unhelpful, and it's a
myth, and that's the notion

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.850
that you shouldn't criticize
other ideas.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.270
You know, this is a magic room,
this is a brainstorm,

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.300
we're just going to put
ideas on the table.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:52.060
Again, that's really good for
maximizing likeability, but

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.970
it's not good for maximizing
productivity,

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.010
for getting the ideas.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.430
And I would say to leaders, a
lot of the work that I do is

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:02.080
with leaders, it's a leader's
job to make it safe for people

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.800
to criticize each
other's ideas.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.740
If you have a situation where
we must just say nice things

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.680
about each other's ideas, you
have an absence of leadership.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.360
Because that's an absence of the
kind of rigor that's going

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.580
to lead to good work and good
thinking if you're not able to

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.570
actually have an environment
where people can criticize

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.620
each other's ideas.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.670
So individually, be individually
strong,

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.180
collaborate reluctantly,
and collaborate

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.170
towards some purpose.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:32.240
Bring in other people's ideas
and then beat the heck out of

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.040
each other's ideas.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.290
And this only works, though,
in an environment where you

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.950
trust each other and you're
OK criticizing

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.750
each other's ideas.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.750
So that's the second.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.790
I'll go with the third and final
before Q&amp;A, then I'll do

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.760
one last thing after Q&amp;A,
then book signing.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.090
So the third is creativity.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.120
So to get more creativity,
you need less creativity.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.410
And in particular, to get the
kind of creativity that is

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.460
pragmatic and useful, you need
less of the kind of creativity

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.820
that is, and I'm going to
be very specific here,

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.980
narcissistic.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.390
Creativity is an excuse, often,
to hide narcissism.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:15.180
So we as individuals want
to put our finger

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.060
prints on the world.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.220
And this drive is often
counterproductive.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.840
The drive to put our finger
prints on the world is

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.830
counterproductive.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.620
We want to create something new
because it feels good and

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.580
we're driven to make our
mark and to leave

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.770
our mark on the world.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.800
And in some cases, the
particular part of the world

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.290
doesn't need that mark.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.690
Now I'm not suggesting that
people not pursue their

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:45.730
passion when it comes to art, or
make your mark on the world

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.850
in that way.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.940
What I'm saying is, again, have
the intellectual rigor,

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.670
the sophistication, the
maturity, to decouple that

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.460
from what is needed in this
particular work project and

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.910
say, actually in this case, what
we need is the same thing

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.120
we've always done.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.740
Even though that doesn't feel
as gratifying to my ego,

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.480
that's what the work needs, is
for us to simply repeat what

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.690
we've done before.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:10.530
Innovate when you need to,
not when you want to.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.580
So here's a quick example of
some narcissistic creativity,

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.040
and it was done in Silicon
Valley in this neck of the

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:23.940
words in 1996 by me.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.410
So here's my narcissistic
creativity as a young kid.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:33.580
I was, would be 24
in 1996, and I'm

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.940
working for this company.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.910
In 1996 they had the, Vivo
had the first compression

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:50.420
algorithms to digitize video.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.890
It was based on the work of
Doctor Stefan Eriksson did at

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.930
the Royal Institute
of Technology

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.440
in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.270
So Dr. Stefan Eriksson had many
of the first patents in

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:06.350
the compression of video
and into digital code.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.500
And he started out in the early
'90s by trying to turn

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.690
his research into video
conferencing.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.530
That wasn't going
along so well.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.610
In the meantime, he's seeing
companies like Netscape

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.100
getting funded at these huge
valuations and he's saying,

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.100
look, at I've got this
great product.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.770
I want to become
a web company.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:27.020
So I was part of the team to
help him market that and

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.800
publicize that and say,
Vivo is a web company.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.710
And what we did in spring of
1996, we want to something

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.040
called Spring Internet World.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.570
Anybody who was around back in
the early sort of, right as

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.110
the bubble's starting to
get inflated, in '96.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:50.350
Spring Internet World, we said,
we're going to take it

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.420
to Spring Internet World and
tell the world about your

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.250
ability to put video over the
web, which this is in the days

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.930
of 28.8 modem, so it's very
primitive technology.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.200
But he could do it, just barely,
could get video over

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.699
28.8 bandwidth, narrow
band, into the home.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:13.370
So, and he didn't have much at
all, but he was running out of

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.179
money, so we go to Spring
Internet World and when we see

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.500
this logo, I don't know about
you, a but when I saw this

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.560
logo in particular, I didn't
just see Vivo.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.630
I, being a very creative
boy, I saw Vivo man.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.482
So we are going, because, I
mean, I thought like, the O is

00:34:31.482 --> 00:34:35.530
like a mouth and the Vs are like
eyes and the I is kind of

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.150
a nose, like a little bit,
do you see his little

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.560
anthropomorphic?

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.179
Look, I'm telling you, this
is a bad idea, right?

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.590
The whole point is,
it's a bad idea.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.219
But man, I wanted to help.

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:50.780
So I sold Dr. Stefan Eriksson
on, we need, at Spring

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.730
Internet World, we don't need
to just have a booth.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.239
We need to have Vivo Man.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.830
And we need to have Vivo Man
like, walking around the trade

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:02.170
show getting people to go to the
booth-- this is the world

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.600
a little bit in 1996--

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.380
and saying, look at
the first ever

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.840
video compression algorithm.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.230
So this is Vivo Man.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.270
And he's a very nice Swedish
scientist and he said, OK,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.040
fine, do it.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.750
So I'm in Boston and
he's in Cambridge.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:22.210
I'm in Boston and we designed
this thing, we staff an actor

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:26.990
out here, somebody from San
Jose State, I think, who's

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.470
going to be the actor who's
going to walk around.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.130
And we had this costume made
with purple Spandex, costume

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.670
to fit the purple logo, and
we booked the actor.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.720
When we got out here, it turns
out the actor, you know, we

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.850
built the suit for someone very
tall and broad shoulders,

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.850
like a superhero, right?

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.540
But the actor, there was some
miscommunication and the

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.520
implementation of the idea
didn't go so well, and indeed,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.710
the actor was not shaped
in the way.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.240
I don't have a picture of it,
but this is just from a quick

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.900
search if you want
to get a sense.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.140
This is sort of the, that
was basically--

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.480
that gives you a sense of what
we were dealing with.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.010
So this was the picture of Vivo
Man, this is actually

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.702
what happened, and then so we
get our Vivo Man in there, and

00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:12.310
I'm red-faced with
embarrassment,

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.600
it's not going well.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.020
As we get Vivo Man there, and
we're told, as we get him onto

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.460
the show floor, this very
serious woman stops me and she

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.580
says, do you have a character
appearance license?

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.570
Because there's a $10,000
character appearance fee.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.290
And we did not, and I did
not know about that.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:40.610
So I had to escort Vivo Man
out to the bus stop where

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.620
people were dropping off the
attendees, because that was

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.910
the best we could do.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.380
So that was, as my 13-year-old
daughter would

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.070
say, that was a fail.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.230
That did not work, having
Vivo Man there.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.990
And it was ridiculous.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.430
It was just one of these things
that was, it's an

00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.920
exaggerated example, right?

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.300
It's an exaggerated example and
I'm making fun of myself.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.100
I think we can all find
examples where we did

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.530
something, you sort of start
falling in love with the idea

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.210
and the idea takes inertia of
its own and it's the coolness

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.420
of the idea and versus
what is needed.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.600
Let me tell you what worked
there, though.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.130
What worked is the simplest,
easiest thing in the world.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:21.550
We, at our little booth
space, we said we will

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.290
be Vivo Video News.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:24.470
And we're going to copy CNN.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.120
Instead of CNN, we're VVN.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.270
And I called myself a senior
producer for VVN.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.030
I contacted people before the
show and said, we want to

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.280
interview you, get your thoughts
on the internet and

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.820
this will be the first ever,
what we call, we hadn't heard

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.150
the word before, maybe it had
been used before, but we said,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.930
this is going to be the
first-ever webcast.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.960
And so we were using this word
webcast in 1996, he's got the

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.470
first compression algorithms.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:52.470
We interviewed people for VVN
and they'd come to the booth.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.130
And the whole goal of this was
to get an infusion of funding

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.560
so that the company could live
and potentially be acquired.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.780
And there was a company called
Real Audio at the time that

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.600
later became Real Networks that
did, that weekend, an

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.880
infusion of capital and
then acquired Vivo.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.860
And that's how Real entered
the video space is by

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.410
acquiring this, and it was Dr.
Stefan Eriksson's algorithms.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.080
Here's the point.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.480
Copying CNN was the
right thing to do.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.050
It was a simple idea, like OK,
why don't we cover the event

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.290
using our technology?

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:25.200
Duh!

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.310
There's no, like, you don't
get an award for being so

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:29.310
super creative.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.960
It's the most obvious
thing in the world.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.920
Here's who was creative, by the
way, Dr. Stefan Eriksson,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.170
who created the algorithms.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.130
That was creative.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.380
Like that was, the fact that we
were going to come up with

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.940
this nonsense to try to promote
it with some crazy

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.670
character was just silliness.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.120
It was just a waste.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.390
So that's an example of how easy
it is to fall into the

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:51.410
trap of narcissistic creativity
instead of

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.760
creativity that's driven by some
business outcome, which

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.210
is, let's be acquired.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.630
We had, by the way, there's
only, I think, eight people

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.550
who came by our booth to be
interviewed, but all eight, it

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.360
was Microsoft was there, Real
was there, HP was there.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.950
And then some of the old
line VCs, what were

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.500
big VCs back in '96.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.220
But those were the right
eight people.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.590
I mean, we were at a trade
show and Vivo Man, and we

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.580
think it's cool because he's
going to be seen by 20,000

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.270
people, it was those eight
people that mattered.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:26.570
So the punchline about
creativity is, the theme of

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.120
the day, have the intellectual
sophistication, the

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.460
intellectual rigor, and the
maturity to say, creativity in

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.240
and of itself is not good.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.480
But here's more to the point--

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.480
creativity is often a mask.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.090
It's a mask that excuses
narcissism.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.460
Creativity is a mask that
excuses narcissism.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.660
You say, I'm not being
ridiculously narcissistic.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.720
I'm being creative and I'm
told that creativity is a

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.650
value and a virtue.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:53.770
Beware.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:58.820
Be very careful about the
unintended consequences of

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.430
creativity.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:04.050
As I said, I've got one more
thing that I'm going to close

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.650
on, but first.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:10.770
I'd love to hear questions,
comments, push backs?

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.456
Yes, please.

00:40:12.456 --> 00:40:16.893
AUDIENCE: How do you balance the
risk of creativity versus

00:40:16.893 --> 00:40:22.316
[INAUDIBLE] peer syndrome with
the need to sort of be

00:40:22.316 --> 00:40:22.809
disruptive?

00:40:22.809 --> 00:40:24.616
Like, if everyone else in your
industry is approaching the

00:40:24.616 --> 00:40:27.739
same problems with the same old
thing, h do you make sure

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:30.663
that you're not the one who's
left behind and someone else

00:40:30.663 --> 00:40:31.570
finds that new thing?

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:31.740
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.470
So I'm a big fan of disruption
as a process.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.860
And so if you read Clay
Christensen, who wrote "The

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.260
Innovator's Dilemma" and talked
about the innovator's

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.490
dilemma and disruptive
innovation, one of the things

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:49.590
he talks about is, that being
disruptive is a process.

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.760
And you can't guarantee that you
will disrupt an industry,

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.060
but you can increase the chances
that you will disrupt

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.810
an industry by following
a few steps.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:01.690
And so I'm a big believer
in what he did '97 with

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.800
"Innovator's Dilemma" and in
2003 with "Innovator's

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.180
Solution." In "Innovator's
Solution" in particular, he

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.340
talks about, what is the job
to be done by the customer?

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.690
And how am I going to really
understand the job that's

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.600
going to be done?

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.740
And in some cases, that means
excellence can get in the way.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.410
I need to be the good enough
solution on one dimension so

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.590
that I can outperform on
another dimension.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:26.630
I think that kind of rigor is
more helpful than a sort of a

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.530
general permissiveness
about creativity.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:33.820
So that's my answer, is I
would say, you should be

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.960
disruptive and you should zag
when other people are zigging.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.600
And that doesn't
mean, therefore

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.310
let's just be creative.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:42.850
Is that a?

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:44.090
AUDIENCE: No, that
makes sense.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:44.860
JAKE BREEDEN: OK, cool.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.440
That was a good question,
I liked the question.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.520
Come on, give me some
more questions.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.790
And it doesn't have
to be that good.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.550
Let's lower the standards
on questions.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.380
I mean, this is a problem
with excellence.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.650
So the lead off question is this
really smart, informed

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.990
question and so now people are
like, well I'm not going to

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.850
ask anything.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.390
Like, somebody ask
a question--

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:05.570
this is a challenge in the
spirit of how unhelpful high

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.070
standards in excellence
can be.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.820
Somebody answer a question that
you might feel just a

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.050
tinge of shame even in asking.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.320
Like, what you mean by that?

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.990
Or, wait, I don't understand.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.850
Maybe I'm the only one.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.430
Yeah?

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.110
AUDIENCE: This is more
of a comment.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.970
I noticed that when I send a
document to collaborate with

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.715
others, if I intentionally make
it lower quality, I get a

00:42:27.715 --> 00:42:29.200
lot more collaboration.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.850
And when it's, you know, pretty
and has great, table of

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.562
contents and everything there,
I barely get anything.

00:42:37.562 --> 00:42:41.418
So I intentionally always make
sure that whenever I seek

00:42:41.418 --> 00:42:44.792
actual input, just have
placeholders where people can

00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:46.720
fill it in.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.710
And that works.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.870
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah, I love that
I love that approach,

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.970
that idea of, and you
can announce it.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:53.670
You can say.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.820
It's not like you need to be
manipulative in any way to

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.430
say, these are my quick,
rough thoughts.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.690
Your feedback and input
is critical here.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:04.630
Just more reps, more
revisions.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.870
That's a great way to combine
the excellence and the

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.650
collaboration piece.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.860
What else?

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.800
Yes, Sam?

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.970
SAM: Say your manager asking
for excellence.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.582
The whole team member expects it
and it's based on what you

00:43:20.582 --> 00:43:21.750
just told us just [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:22.100
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.870
AUDIENCE: How would you
deal with that?

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.610
JAKE BREEDEN: So what if the
manager's asking for

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:28.650
excellence?

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:32.320
You simply say, I read this book
by Jake Breeden and he --

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.700
no, of course not.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.430
I think it's the point of the
differences between the job

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:39.830
and the work, so this woman who,
she had to leave early,

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:45.510
her point was, her job was to
help PMs move the development

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:48.290
cycle, move products through
the development cycle.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.330
That's her job.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.900
And I would hope that her boss
wants her to do an excellent

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.900
job of that.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.780
And so if her boss is giving
her a hard time about the

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.310
research reports, like wait a
minute, you only have four

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.580
origin citations here, why
don't you, you know, this

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.650
other person had 14 original
citations on the research.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.240
Are you sure you had
enough sources?

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.110
I would want some conversation,
say , help me

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:09.970
understand here.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.890
Let me make sure we're on the
same page about what's the

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.390
job, what are we really
trying to achieve?

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.330
So that you're managing
up, and in fact,

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:18.460
you're leading up.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.680
Because if you do it right,
you're going to help your boss

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.620
expand the thinking.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.360
You have to do it in a way
that's not defensive.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.110
And it could be that your boss
is way ahead of you.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.070
It could be that your boss is
thinking, actually, the job to

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.390
be done is something different
than what you just said.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:33.950
And so then you're having
a good conversation.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.100
But I think this, to me, the
most helpful strategy is the

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.520
difference between the
word job and work.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.340
Just to decouple job from work
and to say, we got to do an

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.760
excellent job.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.030
Boss, I am on board with
excellence when it comes to

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.350
the job we're trying to do.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.620
So big picture here,
what's the job?

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.570
Now, where are some incremental
steps, some

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:58.990
inputs, so to speak, where
actually, I want more lower

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:02.780
quality inputs than just a few
big high quality inputs.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.080
I would have that kind
of conversation.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.100
Yep?

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.632
AUDIENCE: Question around
your comments that

00:45:08.632 --> 00:45:09.640
brainstorming is bad.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.350
JAKE BREEDEN: Yes?

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.630
AUDIENCE: And I'm wondering, in
that research, does it, is

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.480
there any differentiation
between the psychology of

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.350
teams in regard to typology?

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:20.910
So if you have a team of
introverts, say a Myers

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.630
Briggs, then I totally get it.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.580
What if you have a team of
extroverts where actually, the

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.320
way they think is thinking out
loud and bouncing ideas off

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:28.772
each other?

00:45:28.772 --> 00:45:29.224
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah.

00:45:29.224 --> 00:45:32.230
No, this research did test for
that, I mean, it wasn't

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.320
culturally bounded and it wasn't
bounded by personality

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.780
or preference, so, I mean, the
empirical answer that question

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.920
is, that didn't affect it.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.360
But we can go deeper into
looking into this research.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.060
How about, one more?

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.489
AUDIENCE: I think following
up on that, I've seen

00:45:48.489 --> 00:45:51.710
brainstorming happen where it
was very successful, very

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:56.430
productive, when it follows a
strict process that outlines

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.966
exactly what's the goal of
each stage and how to

00:45:58.966 --> 00:46:01.450
structure and capture that
input on all of that.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:06.950
So I'm not sure the research
they referred to was just open

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.690
ended brainstorming that people
do whenever they get

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:14.100
together or brainstorming that
is that company like idio does

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.994
where that's actually their
value and that's how they sell

00:46:17.994 --> 00:46:19.060
themselves.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.770
JAKE BREEDEN: Yeah, well idio in
particular has innovated in

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.650
the way, so the short answer
to your question is yes,

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.790
structure matters.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:29.680
And the big enemy is this kind
of general reflexive notion

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.120
of, what we need is more people,
more ideas, more

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.790
permissiveness about ideas, and
if we just get everybody

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.850
sharing stuff, then we'll
be in a good place.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.420
That's the bogeyman that I
want to take down, right?

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.770
So if you're talking about an
approach where individuals

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.770
have accountability and
responsibility to each come up

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:50.930
with some of their ideas and
then you share, so-called

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:56.100
nominal group technique is one
example of that, then I think,

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.660
I'm hopeful, I'm optimistic, I
think we're on the right page.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.330
This particular research was
really focused on which is

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:05.250
better, if I've got eight
people, do I get them in the

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.730
room trying to come up with the
answer, or do I separate

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.900
these eight people and then
look at what comes out?

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.630
And the answer, over and over
again was, you separate them.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.560
If you talk about technique that
says, well what if we can

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.490
have the best of both
worlds, OK.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.670
Then I'm hopeful.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.450
And I think that hasn't been
tested in the way that the

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:24.900
other part has been.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.300
So I want to end with
one last thing.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.794
May I?

00:47:31.794 --> 00:47:32.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.360
JAKE BREEDEN: Thank you.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.000
Thank you, Sam.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.320
SAM: You're welcome.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.980
JAKE BREEDEN: And the rest of
you, I assume by your silence,

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:45.260
silence is consent, so David
Foster Wallace told a story in

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.370
2008 at a graduation speech
at Kenyon College.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:53.580
Two young fish swimming along,
bobbing in the water, happy as

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:58.250
can be, passed by
and older fish.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:02.365
And the older fish says to the
younger fish, these two

00:48:02.365 --> 00:48:05.320
younger fish, howdy, boys.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.930
And they say back, hello, sir.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:13.480
And the elders fish says, the
water's nice today, isn't it?

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.270
And they said, yeah, yeah.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.580
And then as the old fish passes,
one of the young fish

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:24.530
says to the other young fish,
what the hell is water?

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.580
And the point that David Foster
Wallace was making to

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:33.030
the college graduates was that
you're swimming in water so

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.850
long, you don't even know
what you're swimming in.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:39.840
When you're surrounded by it,
it's so hard to see it and

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.030
examine it critically
from a distance.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.510
And that's the nature sacred
cows, and I would say it's an

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.620
even greater threat for folks
who are experienced

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.190
professionals like yourself.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:55.300
These sacred cows like, what
we need is more creativity

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.470
higher standards, more
collaboration.

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:01.680
When you're swimming in these
things so long, so often, so

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.520
deeply, it's hard to recognize
when they may be backfiring.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.060
So my advice is to just look at
your world with a healthy,

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.920
but a critical distance.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.470
Thank you very much
for your time.

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:22.935
[APPLAUSE]
