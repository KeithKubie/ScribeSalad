00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.670
Oysters make pearls as a defensive response
to foreign objects.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.930
The process begins when some foreign body,
such as sand, a parasite or some other organic

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.900
material, manages to make its way inside the
oyster’s shell and comes in contact with

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.640
the mantle, a layer that protects the oyster’s
internal organs, sometimes even damaging it.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.350
The oyster’s body sees the invading substance
as a potential threat, and in response the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.060
mantle begins to deposit a substance called
nacre, also called mother of pearl, onto it.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.810
This is the same substance that coats the
inner part of the shell.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.829
External damage to the shell itself that results
in damage to the mantle will also trigger

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.249
the same type of response to repair the damage.

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.430
Nacre is composed of calcium carbonate, in
the form of mineral aragonite and calcite,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.840
and the proteins conchin and perlucin which
form a substance known as conchiolin that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.320
more or less functions as the “glue” that
holds the layers together.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.390
While the mineral aragonite has a crystal
structure, the conchiolin is very porous.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.820
These, combined with the slightly translucent
nature of the layers, contribute to the pearl’s

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.560
ultimate shimmery/luminous luster.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.800
Over time, the oyster will apply several layers
of nacre to the foreign body, effectively

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.640
walling it off from the oyster itself and
forming a pearl of some shape, with the shape

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.030
of the invading body being one potential contributing
factor to the ultimate shape of the pearl.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.060
The internal process of pearl creation is
mostly the same whether the pearl was created

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.540
naturally or cultivated.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.510
However, despite generally needing to do an
X-ray test to determine whether a given pearl

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.120
was cultivated or grown naturally (natural
pearls tend to have microscopic cores so only

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.930
show concentric growth rings at the center
vs cultivated ones that show a solid core),

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.700
natural pearls are usually far more expensive
simply because they are more rare, particularly

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.920
the spherical variety so sought after for
making jewelry.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.360
On the cultivated side, pearl farmers allow
baby oysters to grow for two to three years

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.850
in cages suspended in some body of water that
is suitable for keeping the oysters thriving.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.700
Once the baby oysters have reached maturity,
they can then be used for the cultivation

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.989
of pearls.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.849
While there are variations on the specific
methods used, in general with saltwater cultivate

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.910
pearls, pearl farmers (usually) use mother
of pearl nuclei.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.370
These are balls of ground, polished mussel
shell measuring between 2.5 mm and 8 mm in

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.370
diameter.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.879
The choice of nuclei is important not only
to help maximize the probability of getting

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.460
a spherical pearl, but also because the core
material needs to have similar thermal expansion

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.420
properties as the nacre.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.599
If it does not and, say, the core expands
faster when heated (like when a hole is being

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.739
drilled in the pearl to make a bracelet or
necklace) it can ultimately shatter the outer

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.599
layers of nacre coating.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.290
With freshwater shells, beaded nuclei are
not usually used, though there are exceptions

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.859
for both saltwater and freshwater beading
practices.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.279
In both cases, once the oysters are mature
enough, they are removed from the water and

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.239
placed in a dry, shady location for about
a half an hour.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.980
This generally results in the oyster opening
its shell at some point.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.470
Pearl farmers will then place a wedge between
the open shells to keep them that way.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.099
Any oyster that does not open its shell is
placed back into the water and the pearl farmers

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.120
will simply try again later.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.810
Once wedged open, the oysters are transported
to another area where workers may or may not

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.129
need to delicately force the shells apart
a bit more to increase the size of the opening.

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.590
This step must be done carefully because opening
an oyster’s shell too far can kill it.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.529
In beaded shells, workers then carefully make
a tiny, precise incision in the oyster’s

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:04.309
soft body and insert (usually in the gonad)
the prepared nuclei along with a tiny square

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.909
of living mantle tissue harvested from another
oyster.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.029
Typically about one killed oyster can provide
enough mantle for 15 or so implantations,

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:17.610
with the tissue generally staying alive and
functional at secreting nacre for a couple

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.610
hours.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.180
Both the nuclei and prepared mantle tissue
needs to be in contact with one another to

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.300
insure a pearl sack will ultimately form.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.240
In non-beaded shells (usually freshwater),
only the tiny bit of living mantle is inserted.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.150
Another distinction between the two is that,
in the non-beaded pearls, as many as a couple

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.669
dozen pearls can be grown at once in a single
oyster if multiple implantations are put in

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.669
place.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.430
This is why freshwater pearls are generally
much cheaper than saltwater ones, even though

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.860
the desirable attributes of the end product
really don’t differ based on freshwater

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.210
or saltwater with modern techniques.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.110
(Classically, saltwater, beaded pearls tended
to produce a much higher percentage of spherical

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.620
pearls, with freshwater pearls tending to
be more rice shaped, but that isn’t so much

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.990
the case anymore.)

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.180
In both cases, after the implantation is complete,
the wedge is removed and the oyster is placed

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.720
back into water.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.160
Unsurprisingly, the whole process delivers
quite a shock to the oyster.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.949
It takes them as much as six weeks to completely
recover from it, if at all.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.050
After they’ve been given adequate time to
recover, pearl farmers will again remove them

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.030
from the water to make sure they have started
layering nacre on the inserted object.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.350
Those oysters that did not survive the shock
are discarded at this point.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.120
The healthy ones where implantation was successful
continue the process of creating a pearl over

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.120
time, sometimes taking as much as 5-6 years
before the pearl is ready to be harvested,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.360
though pearls with beaded nuclei can generally
be harvested much quicker, even in some cases

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.610
in as little as 6-12 months.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.539
With such a regimented process, you might
think the success rate on cultivated pearls

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.789
is high, but in fact, only about half the
oysters initially seeded will ultimately survive

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.660
and produce pearls.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.139
And of those pearls, only about five percent
will be of high enough quality to meet the

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.360
standards to be further processed for high
end jewelry.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.039
After that, it takes sorting through about
10,000 jewelry grade pearls to find enough

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:36.440
matching ones (in color, shape, luster, and
size) to make a single high end pearl necklace.
