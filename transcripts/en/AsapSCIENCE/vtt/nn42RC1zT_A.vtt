00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.547
Some people are so full of life and and energy,

00:00:02.547 --> 00:00:03.560
but for some reason

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.760
even when you seem to get more than enough sleep,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.000
you're still fighting off yawns and fatigue through the day.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.200
So, why are you always tired?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.940
If you the number of the hours of sleep isn't the problem,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.880
the second most common cause of fatigue

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.680
comes from lack of physical activity and a poor diet.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.480
Study after study finds that adults

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.180
who began light exercise a few times a week reported more energy after six weeks.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.520
People who exercise more regularly also report sleeping better.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.300
Even though studies show that they aren't sleeping any longer.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.380
But if that doesn't help, don't go straight to your cup of joe.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740
While many studies show that coffee is good for your health

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.940
research show that your reliance on it can make you more sleepy.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.400
Caffeine blocks adenosine in your brain

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.020
which normally accumulates through the day

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.680
and makes you sleepy at night.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.420
But consuming coffee or energy drinks less that 6 hours before bed

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.260
can ultimately affect your sleep quality.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.760
As a result people who don't use caffeine

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.720
often report feeling less tired in the morning.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.480
You might consider making sure you're fully hydrated with some water first too.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.760
One study found that a drop of 1.5% in our bodies normal water levels

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.840
can cause difficulty concentrating.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.300
Your blood thickens which slows down nutrients and oxygen

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.180
getting to your muscles and organs.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.440
However a 2% drop is enough to make you feel thirsty

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.560
so while there's no need to gulping down gallons of water.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.080
Staying hydrated throughout the day will certainly help.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.540
Urine should be pale yellow.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.540
Any darker and it's time for some water.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.780
Those glasses of wine or beers before bed

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.720
may also be affecting your day.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.060
Studies have found that after becoming intoxicated

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.140
while test subjects would fall asleep faster

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.600
their quality of sleep was actually much lower,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.280
particularly during the second half of their night sleep.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.440
Ultimately alcohol reduces the amount of REM sleep you get.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.360
And, if you're binge drinking and sleeping in on the weekends

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.180
be aware that a consistent sleep schedule is key.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.180
Try waking up close to your normal time on weekends

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.840
and having short 20 minutes naps in the day.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.640
These will still recharge your body without going into deep sleep

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.060
and making you more tired.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.340
You're also more likely to fall asleep at a correct time on Sunday evening

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.960
making Moday morning easier.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.480
Of course your mental well-being plays a role too.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.540
Anxiety is a big one.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.400
Worrying what people think, always feeling tense about work

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.140
or being overly concerned about every decision

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.020
can be physically exhausting.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.840
And fatigue is one of the main symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.760
Not only that, but anxiety may be affecting your sleep quality.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.060
On another serious end, depression can cause physical, and emotinal fatigue

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.560
which more sleep won't necessarily relieve.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.640
For some it causes insomnia

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.820
or inability to fall asleep in the first place.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.660
Unfortunately there's no quick fix for the 10% of Americans

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.280
who do suffer from depression.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.940
So if you think you may be depressed

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.600
see your physician or psychologist.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.460
Finally, you might also simply be a night owl.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.660
Around 20% of population have genetics

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.760
making them predisposed to staying up late.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.920
But living in our nine-to-five world may make it difficult for you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.180
to get the proper amont of sleep.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.740
In fact, scientists call this phenomenon social jet lag.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.380
Well night owls feel like they're living in the wrong time zone every day.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.640
If nothing seems to help, there may be an underlying medical condition

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.820
causing your fatigue which should be talked about with your physician.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.140
