00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.930
We've got four scenarios
right over here.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.960
In each scenario, we
have a hydroxide anion.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.060
And then, we have
another molecule.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.720
And right over
here, this molecule,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.990
this is a bromomethane.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.960
So it's a bromo group
attached to a carbon.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.620
And this carbon isn't
attached to any other carbons.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.690
It's only attached
to other hydrogens.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.690
So carbon like this we
call a primer-- actually,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.250
not a primer.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.310
We call this a
methylcarbon because it

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.927
is attached to no other carbons.

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:36.760
Now, let's think about
this right over here.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.630
What's the difference between
this scenario and that one?

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.046
We still have our
hydroxide anion.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:41.790
We still have the bromo group.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.180
But now this carbon is
attached to another carbon.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.555
So this right over here
is a primary carbon.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.740
It's attached to
one other carbon.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.380
And I think you
see a pattern here.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.440
What about this one?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.989
Well, this carbon right over
here is a secondary carbon.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.363
It's attached to
2 other carbons.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.590
And then, finally, this
carbon right over here

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.130
is a tertiary carbon.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.875
It's attached to
3 other carbons.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.350
And as we'll see in a
few seconds, the fact

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.850
that it has these other carbons
and that these other carbons

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.810
kind of might block some
or all of the reaction,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.380
it will change what
actually goes on.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.540
So let's go, first, to the
first scenario right over here.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.650
We have a hydroxide anion.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.860
We've already seen
that a hydroxide anion

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.890
is a decent nucleophile.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.870
So this right over
here is a nucleophile.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.400
And bromine is a
decent leaving group.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.720
And so assuming that it's
in a appropriate solution--

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.670
we'll cover that
in future videos--

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.669
you could imagine
that one of these,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.430
if this hydroxide kind of
bumps into this bromomethane

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.970
in just the right way, that
this pair right over here

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.450
could form a bond
with this carbon.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.660
And just as that is happening,
essentially the carbon

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.760
is gaining half of
a bond, which is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.820
kind of the equivalent
of a electron charge.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.920
So then, this bromine could
take away this entire pair.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.840
Instead of just kind of
sharing it and having

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.320
the equivalent of 1 electron
charge from this pair,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.830
it has both of them.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.840
And then, it'll become
the bromide anion.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.560
And we've already
seen that before.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.940
That is an Sn2 reaction.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.015
It's a nucleophilic substitution
where both reactants--

00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:57.950
so the nucleophile and
the leaving group--

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.210
are involved in the
rate-determining step.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.830
And this will actually
be quite fast.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.720
Right over here.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.120
Now, let's look over here.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.090
The only difference--
we already said--

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.759
is the existence of this CH3.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.800
Now, even though we've
drawn it, written it down,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.050
CH3, when it's written down,
doesn't look a lot bigger

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.920
than an H. Remember,
CH3-- I mean,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.100
this is roughly the size of
this thing right over here.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.820
So if we were to actually draw
it out with the hydrogen bonds,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.040
this is quite large.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.670
And remember-- in chemistry
and in organic chemistry--

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.652
we always draw these
neat and clean reactions,

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:40.610
but that's not the way
it happens in real life.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.972
These things are all
bumping in a solution

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.065
and bumping from
every direction.

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:48.040
And depending on how they bump
and their relative energies,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.840
the bonds, the reactions
may or may not happen.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.360
And so in this scenario,
this fairly big part

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.960
of this molecule might
block the approach

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.354
of a hydroxide anion
coming from that direction.

00:04:06.354 --> 00:04:07.770
The good thing
is-- well, I guess,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.764
if you view Sn2
reactions as good--

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:12.180
is that there's still other
directions that it can come in

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.890
from.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:20.769
So you could still
see the Sn2 reaction,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.190
but it's going to
be a bit slower.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.590
So maybe here, we could write
a bit slower, but still fast.

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:42.650
Now, let's think
about this scenario.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.200
And once again, I think you
can see where it's going.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.300
The only difference now is
it's the secondary carbon.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.650
We have these two groups here.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.822
And remember, these are
much larger than the way

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.613
that I've drawn it.

00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:53.030
You have a carbon
attached to 3 hydrogens.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.630
So now we're blocking
from two directions.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.780
So once again, you can still
have your Sn2 reaction,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.805
but it's going to
happen a lot slower.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.800
So now, you're going to
have a slow Sn2 reaction.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.160
And now, finally,
what's happening here?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.430
Well, here, this
entire side is blocked.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.980
You have a CH3, CH3, CH3.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.670
This hydroxide anion isn't
going to be able to get through.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.780
It is being hindered.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.005
So here we have no Sn2.

00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:30.880
Now, you might be saying,
wait, why didn't it

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.960
come from the other end?

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.240
Well, remember Sn2 reactions--
the nucleophile is attacking

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.950
from one side, and
the leaving group

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.450
is leaving from the other.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.740
If the nucleophile were
coming in from here,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.240
the leaving group would have
trouble leaving from there.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.820
It wouldn't work out as well.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.490
Sn2, nucleophile from one side,
leaving group from the other.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.137
Now, the only thing that could
reasonably happen here-- and it

00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:55.720
is reasonable.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.261
And actually, we've
even seen it when

00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:59.790
we looked at Sn1 reactions--
is maybe the leaving

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.200
group leaves first.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.410
And actually, the tertiary
carbon is bad for the Sn2,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.780
but it's good for having
a stable carbocation.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:18.750
If this bromine takes that
pair and becomes bromide,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.950
then this becomes a
carbocation, which

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.790
will be reasonably stable
because that positive charge

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.920
can kind of be spread
amongst its brothers.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.040
And then, at that point, it's
not crazy for a nucleophile.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.610
And you could even have
a weaker nucleophile

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.250
than the hydroxide anion to come
in and actually form a bond.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.170
Now, this general
idea that we're

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.940
talking about in this video--
this idea that a reaction

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.750
happening or not happening
because of three dimensions

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.070
of something hindering
the reaction-- this

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.605
is called steric hindrance.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.290
Steric refers to what's
happening in three dimensions--

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.300
the size and shape of molecules.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.260
Hindrance is that that
three-dimensional size

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.280
and shape is hindering
the reaction.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.950
So the steric hindrance is
greatest right over here,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.876
and it's the least right over
here for the Sn2 reaction.
