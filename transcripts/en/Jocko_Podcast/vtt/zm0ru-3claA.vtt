00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.320
Alright,
the kid's book idea.
Okay.

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.310
So it's called a fish tail.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.500
And what's interesting is,
I hear,

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.070
I heard Joe Rogan mentioned this concept before,

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.860
but I thought of this all on my own note.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.530
And way before this was even before the Joe Rogan podcast even existed,

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.190
I thought of this and wrote this book.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.800
So it's called a fish tail.

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.460
So it's a story about a fish and he's in this school and you know,

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.720
he's just kind of curious,
kind of eccentric,
but you know,
he's,
he's,
he's OIC,

11
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:40.490
he's a fish kind of young.
And then,
um,
one day he's,
you know,
going,

12
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:45.491
looking for food or whatever and he gets this worm floating around,

13
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:48.890
good food,
right?
Warren,
boom.
Get snatched up.
Boom.

14
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:53.300
It's a fishermen caught them flopping around in the boat,
right?

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.100
And you know,
they take a picture of munch and,
um,
they throw it back,
you know,

16
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:01.790
kitchen release situation.
Um,
certainly comes back and,

17
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.210
and you wasn't gone for what,
two minutes maybe.

18
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.430
So he comes back and he's like,
hey guys,
guess what?
I just got yanked,
you know,

19
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:14.090
to the surface,
uh,
over the,
you know,
above the surface and um,

20
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.830
and these like weird beings,
UFO sir.
Right,
right.
So that's the thing.
So,

21
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.550
and he was describing him,
he was like,
there's these weird beings.
They,
they,

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
they didn't need water to breathe.
They had,
you know,

23
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.500
these weird appendages kind of like,
you know,
they just weren't anything like us,

24
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.860
but you know,
I saw their eyes but it,
that was kind of it.
And then these,

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.900
these flashing devices,
you know,

26
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:39.380
went off and then they just put me right back and here looking at my little
scar,

27
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:43.700
I'll even show you.
And they're like,
yeah,
no,
no one believed them.
They were like,

28
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:45.640
oh yeah,
he's just an eccentric fish.
This,
you know,

29
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.530
there's no such thing as that kind of stuff,
you know,
and what,

30
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:51.380
he got a little scar,
we all have scars from fucking whatever.

31
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.240
But meanwhile that really happened.
Right.
So,
and this will,

32
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.400
the parallel there is of course the UFO,

33
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.970
but just because it doesn't happen to everybody doesn't mean that it's not true

34
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:08.830
necessarily.
You know,
so like,
you know,
people claim abductions for whatever.
Um,

35
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.290
it does,
it seems crazy.

36
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.890
And I it straight up don't believe it before for other reasons other than,
um,

37
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.230
you know,
you don't believe what abductions.

38
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.150
I don't think that there alien abductions know the,
the,
the stories of,

39
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.530
um,
alien abductions by these people or whatever that get abducted,

40
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.390
allegedly.
I don't believe like that happened to me.
Okay.

41
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.470
That's something we should talk about on the podcast.
Well,

42
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.850
don't talk about it right now.
What happened?
Here's the,

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.210
I'm just kidding.
Well,
he,
well,
here's the thing though,

44
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.550
when you say I'm not you,
but when someone says,
I got abducted by aliens,

45
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:51.940
let me tell you my account.
Um,

46
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.810
those being abducted by aliens and then whatever their account is,

47
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.400
are two different things no matter what.

48
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.610
So they're basically explaining an experience and then giving a hypothesis of

49
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:07.120
what it was.
Yeah.
And most of the time,
not even a hypothesis,

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.430
they're just saying straight up that that's what it was.
They're putting,

51
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:09.970
you know,
they're,

52
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.090
they're naming that experience in basically verifying it and making it,
um,

53
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.633
like a

54
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.953
<v 1>there,
there,</v>

55
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.100
<v 0>they're basically saying that that's what it was there.</v>

56
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.630
They're defining it or whatever.

57
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.750
So in their soul fuck like it's like goats when people say they see ghost,

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.390
you didn't see,
you don't even know what a ghost is.

59
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.540
People don't know what a ghost is like in the human,
the human race.

60
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.720
Like what's the ghost?
Some will say,
oh,

61
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:41.950
it's someone's spirit from they die and then their spirit goes in like lives on

62
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.600
or whatever.
But why would you think that?

63
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.940
Because movies say that because anyone looking into that can tell you that there

64
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.050
is no evidence of that.
And I'm not saying that's what,
that's not what they are.

65
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.130
I'm not saying that.
But you are,

66
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.040
you're over here making that claim that that's what it is.

67
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.180
And then that's what you saw.

68
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.630
So all of all the explanations of your quote unquote experience,

69
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.930
whether you think you're abducted by aliens or ghost,
whatever.
So I'll be put

70
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.260
your account of the experience and what actually happened.

71
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:13.210
The explanation of that experience are two different things.

72
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.410
So you can't just put an explanation on the experience and all the possible

73
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.090
explanations of your experience.

74
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.360
<v 0>There's literally,
there's infinite,
you lost time,
you got passed out,</v>

76
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:28.960
you woke up in a field with a scar or whatever and you have these weird
memories,

77
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.880
whatever,
not memories.
They're not even memories.

78
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.881
Typically just what really happened that the real explanation for your

79
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:40.120
experience.
There's probably a good million of them,

80
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.610
right?
All the way down to you.

81
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:44.680
Imagine the whole thing all the way down to your lying,

82
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:48.790
all the way down to you're hallucinating all the way down to you are hung over.

83
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:52.020
So your brain did this.
You actually got abducted by aliens.

84
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.950
We'll just call that as one of the million.
You went straight to aliens.

85
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.820
And not only did he go straight to aliens,
there's no evidence for that.

86
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:03.100
There's evidence for people hallucinating.
There's evidence for it.

87
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:04.420
There's evidence for all these other things.

88
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.710
Then you went straight to the one with no evidence for whatever reason,
you know,

89
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.300
and there's reasons for it.
So you can't be mad at the people.

90
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:14.350
But that's why it's hard to believe these things,
you know?

91
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.980
But my little kids book,

92
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.530
it kind of puts a little bit of a,
you know,
like,
not doubt,

93
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:27.670
but kinda like,
but you still can dismiss it,
you know?
Because here's like a,

94
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:31.120
an analogy that could have,
you know,

95
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.200
helped you believe what I'm saying?
It's do this

96
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.560
free fighting back at yon about like maybe two minutes.
I held it in.

97
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.180
I don't want that to be on video.
