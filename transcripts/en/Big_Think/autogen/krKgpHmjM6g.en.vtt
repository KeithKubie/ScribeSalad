what really launched my serious research

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350
what really launched my serious research
 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.560
what really launched my serious research
into network effects and the economics

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570
into network effects and the economics
 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.450
into network effects and the economics
of network effects but some of the work

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
of network effects but some of the work
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.400
of network effects but some of the work
that I was doing in human capital and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
that I was doing in human capital and
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.650
that I was doing in human capital and
the notion that innovation isn't just a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
the notion that innovation isn't just a
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.710
the notion that innovation isn't just a
transaction innovation is an investment

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
transaction innovation is an investment
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.740
transaction innovation is an investment
in the human capital and capabilities

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
in the human capital and capabilities
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.170
in the human capital and capabilities
and competencies and creativity of your

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
and competencies and creativity of your
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.080
and competencies and creativity of your
customers network effects are basically

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
customers network effects are basically
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.939
customers network effects are basically
how customers or users create value for

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
how customers or users create value for
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.749
how customers or users create value for
each other

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
each other
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.049
each other
it's basically an external to the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
it's basically an external to the
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.990
it's basically an external to the
individual user so an example of a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
individual user so an example of a
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.420
individual user so an example of a
network effect would be if you and I had

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
network effect would be if you and I had
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459
network effect would be if you and I had
a phone that would be great for you and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
a phone that would be great for you and
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.590
a phone that would be great for you and
I but a network effect is the more

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
I but a network effect is the more
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.619
I but a network effect is the more
people who use phones the more valuable

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
people who use phones the more valuable
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.709
people who use phones the more valuable
the phone network becomes the more

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
the phone network becomes the more
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.889
the phone network becomes the more
valuable each other become because we

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
valuable each other become because we
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.830
valuable each other become because we
can call more people and more people can

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
can call more people and more people can
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930
can call more people and more people can
call us and heck there may even be the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
call us and heck there may even be the
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.639
call us and heck there may even be the
opportunity to do a conference call

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
opportunity to do a conference call
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529
opportunity to do a conference call
which is another form of network effect

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
which is another form of network effect
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.530
which is another form of network effect
so network effects are basically a way

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
so network effects are basically a way
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.289
so network effects are basically a way
that the more people participate in

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
that the more people participate in
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270
that the more people participate in
using a product or service the more

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
using a product or service the more
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.940
using a product or service the more
valuable it becomes there's no such

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
valuable it becomes there's no such
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.170
valuable it becomes there's no such
thing anymore as a non networked

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180
thing anymore as a non networked
 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.980
thing anymore as a non networked

networks are better than others but we

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
networks are better than others but we
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.450
networks are better than others but we
can absolutely make the case that one of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
can absolutely make the case that one of
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.760
can absolutely make the case that one of

more for themselves they can do more
with us and on our network so in the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
with us and on our network so in the
 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.350
with us and on our network so in the
early days of the telephone all you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360
early days of the telephone all you
 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.600
early days of the telephone all you
could do is talk to someone then you

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610
could do is talk to someone then you
 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.810
could do is talk to someone then you
could do a fax then you could do a

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820
could do a fax then you could do a
 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.060
could do a fax then you could do a
conference call then there were these

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070
conference call then there were these
 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.160
conference call then there were these
things called modems that allowed you to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170
things called modems that allowed you to
 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.940
things called modems that allowed you to
send email you are increasing the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950
send email you are increasing the
 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.310
send email you are increasing the
capability of the customer allowed you

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320
capability of the customer allowed you
 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.710
capability of the customer allowed you
to get more value from the network and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720
to get more value from the network and
 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.199
to get more value from the network and
indeed customers wanted to do so much

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209
indeed customers wanted to do so much
 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.740
indeed customers wanted to do so much
you had to do what

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750
you had to do what
 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.470
you had to do what
to redesign the architectures and the

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480
to redesign the architectures and the
 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.990
to redesign the architectures and the
capabilities of the network so you have

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000
capabilities of the network so you have
 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.570
capabilities of the network so you have
an iterative network development process

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580
an iterative network development process
 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.410
an iterative network development process
here as customer capabilities and

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420
here as customer capabilities and
 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.180
here as customer capabilities and
capacities increase you have to change

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190
capacities increase you have to change
 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.730
capacities increase you have to change
the capabilities and capacities of the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740
the capabilities and capacities of the
 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.360
the capabilities and capacities of the
network and vice versa
