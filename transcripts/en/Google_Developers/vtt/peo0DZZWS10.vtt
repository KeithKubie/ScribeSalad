00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.315
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:29.380
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.229
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.800
And I've been working on the
Web Lab project with these

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.660
guys here, Roger and Mattias.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.080
That's right?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.740
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.180
PAUL KINLAN: Yes!

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.910
I've got it right again.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.850
So guys, do you want to give
yourself a little bit of

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.980
introduction about who
you are, what you do,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.350
where you're from.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.495
ROGER PALA: I'm Roger.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:47.700
I'm from Barcelona.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.050
I'm a creative technologist
at B-Reel.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.650
And I've been the technical
leader of this project.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.523
MATTIAS EKENDAHL:
And I'm Mattias.

00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.730
I'm a creative technologist
as well.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.850
I'm from some Uppsala, a
small city in Sweden.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.269
And I've been working mainly
on the Orchestra.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.170
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.100
So, yes.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.950
Today's talk. at least, Is about
the Universal Orchestra

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.180
Experiment.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.500
For those who don't know about
Web Lab, I'll just give you a

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.570
little bit of a background
to it.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.350
Web Lab is a series of five
real-world Chrome experiments

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.210
based inside the British Science
Museum here in London,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.660
but with a real, solid
internet presence.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.220
So every experiment that you
can interact with at the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.990
museum, you can also interact
with at home online and work

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.100
through your browser.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.320
Now, the really interesting
thing as well, for me at

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.220
least, are the experiences that
you have on your desktop

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.090
machine are really quite similar
to the experiences

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.210
that you have inside
the museum itself.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.580
So that's pretty cool.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.400
The second most important thing
is that everything you

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.880
do inside the museum is recorded
against your own

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.830
unique lab tag, which if you
watch the Lab Tag Explorer

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.440
Hangout that we did earlier
on, you will see that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.890
basically you can go home, put
your camera or put the lab tag

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.407
up in front of your camera,
and then get access to

00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:08.235
everything that you just created
in the museum as well

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:09.449
as online, as well.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.960
So it's a pretty cool
experience, right?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.830
And today is the piece
de resistance.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.890
I don't know whether that's
right or what I'm saying.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.930
It's one of the best things
about the museum, is the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.180
Universal Orchestra Experiment,
which, if we've

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.222
done this right, you'll hear
in the background.

00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:30.230
[TONES PLAY]

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.670
PAUL KINLAN: Playing.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.860
So the Universal Orchestra,
I think it's about eight

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.600
instruments.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.970
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.860
Eight instruments.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.430
PAUL KINLAN: Eight physical,
real instruments.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.720
As you can see in the background
right now, we've

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.130
got drums, marimbas.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.850
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Kalimba.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.690
PAUL KINLAN: Yes, kalim--
there's like all these

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.320
instruments I'd never
heard of, right?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.920
Ever.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.190
They're awesome,
though, right?

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.740
And you can interact
with them either at

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.150
the museum or online.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.066
And you can make a band.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.290
The two join together.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.480
For me, this is the experiment
where both sides kind of come

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.810
together into one
big experience.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.280
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.720
And the thought behind this
is to show real-time

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.770
collaboration and that
the internet is

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.970
facilitating that for you.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.290
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.390
It's pretty cool.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.540
So shall we dive in?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.010
ROGER PALA: Yep.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.190
Let's have a look.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.210
PAUL KINLAN: As with every
Hangout, I normally mention

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.650
how this was made.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.590
I only learned this myself just
recently, and I'm not

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.710
going to tell you.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.970
No, it was--

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.470
was it Swiffy?

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.880
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.975
PAUL KINLAN: It was a Flash
file, Swiffy-ized, which is a

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:34.690
Google Tool on
chrome.google.com, passed

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.580
through that and made in
HTML and JavaScript.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.060
So this is actually really
interesting right now, is we

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.470
have two different modes.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.610
We have the real-time mode,
and we're going

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.760
to go through both.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.840
So this a longer-than-normal
Hangout, essentially.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.590
But we're going to
go through both.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.620
One is the online version, which
I say online, the one

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.142
that interacts with the
real instruments.

00:03:56.142 --> 00:03:58.510
But sometimes those instruments
might be fully

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.950
booked up with people playing
online at the time or inside

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.550
the museum.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.740
And you can get a pure online
virtual experience as well.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.930
We'll dive into the real museum,
the real experience,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.360
the museum experience first.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.240
Now, the really cool thing about
this to me is this is a

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.840
live stream of the
museum, isn't it?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.329
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.930
PAUL KINLAN: It's only
like a couple of

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.910
seconds delayed, is it?

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.700
A few seconds of delay?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.210
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, I think
around here, it might be

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.510
4 or 5 seconds, and then
when you get in

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.600
live, it's 3 seconds.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.940
PAUL KINLAN: So it's
pretty cool, this.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.760
Well, it's buffering
right now, but I'll

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.530
blame YouTube for that.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.160
So we'll jump into
it at least.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.960
So we'll jump in.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.990
Again, this is the live view
of the experiment.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.030
We have our different
instruments.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.280
There is one person playing
at the moment.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.484
Which is a good instrument?

00:04:46.484 --> 00:04:48.670
Should we jump in and play an
instrument straight away?

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.020
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Let's go
for the steel drums.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.550
PAUL KINLAN: Steel drums?

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.430
There we are.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.860
So we'll join in the queue.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.880
So this is the steel
drum playing at the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.240
museum right now.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.825
There is no one in the queue for
this one, so we should be

00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:02.562
able to jump on pretty quick.

00:05:02.562 --> 00:05:04.815
I imagined if we joined
at a busy time, we'd

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:05.895
have a bit of a wait.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:06.220
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.940
And during the opening time of
the museum, four instruments

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.450
are reserved for museum users.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.830
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.210
I mean, that was actually-- when
I took the kids to the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.260
museum, that was a good thing,
is that we could

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.200
actually get on.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.640
I was worried about people
coming online and stealing an

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.550
instrument from me.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.765
But it wasn't like that.

00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:24.340
I got to play it myself.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.590
So let's join the queue.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.210
And then it should-- it says
less than a minute, so we'll

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.290
have a chat for a minute.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.970
Hey, we're done.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.890
So we're in.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.050
We have a minute to respond.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.770
I'm ready.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.900
Let's jump in.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.950
I love how this whole experiment
is like all the

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.040
experiments-- seamless
navigation between the views.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.410
It's pretty cool.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.520
So we've actually got six
different notes that we can

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.690
play on this grid.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.860
If you're familiar with the
MIDI synthesizers and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.210
sequencers and all that
type of stuff, it's a

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.510
similar type of thing.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.200
Should we put some on?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.570
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.820
PAUL KINLAN: Well, should we
have a listen to what's

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.007
playing in the background
first?

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:04.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.170
PAUL KINLAN: Sounds cool.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.590
So what you'll find is as while
we're actually doing

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.370
this, we can't actually hear
what's happening, because

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.740
otherwise, the microphone
audio will be

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.815
a little bit crazy.

00:06:12.815 --> 00:06:16.340
But we have two instruments
left that we can position.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.620
Can you explain to me a little
bit about what's going on, why

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.960
the button kind of glowed and
slowly went out, and wasn't

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.820
there straight away?

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.080
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.410
So normally, when it comes to
real-time collaboration,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.440
people don't see the latency,
which here is 3 seconds, and

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.450
we wanted to show it.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.900
So it's actually, you have done
something, but it hasn't

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.030
happened yet.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.710
So that's what we're showing
off, and that's why the

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.960
physics of the globes
are as they are.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.970
So if you drag one, it will
stop, and you release it, and

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.360
you know it's going
to get there.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.790
But it hasn't yet got there,
so now it has.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.585
PAUL KINLAN: I like that.

00:06:55.585 --> 00:06:55.920
Thank you.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.530
So it's kind of interesting,
because what we're trying to

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.860
show is that actually, there's
up to eight different

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.740
participants, and they're all--
they all need to be

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.755
synchronized to hear the same
piece of music roughly about

00:07:04.755 --> 00:07:05.880
the same time.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.620
Otherwise, it would just be a
terrible music experience, if

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.940
it wasn't playing it out.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.130
So the other video before
was YouTube live.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.200
Is this a YouTube live
video, or is this--

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.500
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.450
This is one with lower latency,
so we're going

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.650
directly to the source and
getting the video from there.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.210
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, pretty cool.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.475
So I pretty much see what's
happening with a minimal delay

00:07:26.475 --> 00:07:26.980
between the two.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.690
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.820
And we wanted to make sure that
the audio was in sync

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.680
with the initials as well, so
that's where the 3-second

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.930
buffering time comes from.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.890
PAUL KINLAN: I realized that.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.100
It feels nice, right?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.860
Well, it feels slower.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.770
Not slow.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.156
It feels gluey.

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:45.580
It's like, oh, you
get it across.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.455
But it feels kind of nice, the
way that you're showing that

00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:49.470
there is latency.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.335
Normally what happens on
the web, it's terrible.

00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:54.442
They use a white screen, or
you'll see things kind of load

00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:55.726
in and all that type of stuff.

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.560
It feels kind of nice, the
way that this is--

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.200
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Or it could
be faked as well, kind of

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.900
showing a delay when
you actually know

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.420
what's going to happen.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.650
But this is what's going on.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.890
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.710
This is pretty cool.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.140
So I mean, this is going
to sound silly, right?

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.230
What is the--

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.130
is this Canvas?

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.190
Just a Canvas thing?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.550
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.413
It's a 2-D Canvas drawing
everything on every frame.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.220
PAUL KINLAN: How are the clients
all synchronized?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.600
I mean, it's pretty hard to
synchronize two people

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.010
together just normally.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.740
I mean, you've got eight people
synchronized now with

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.280
this with a user interface.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.100
Can you explain a little
bit how the actual

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.640
synchronization works?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:39.950
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.560
So everyone gets the time from
the timestamp in the video.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.550
So it doesn't matter what your
clocks say on the system.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.740
It's what the video says the
time is that dictates how it's

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.740
going to be shown.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.230
And then we're using WebSockets
to broadcast all

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.590
the messages to everyone.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:08.230
So here in a matter of
milliseconds, they can see

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.790
what's happening.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.260
PAUL KINLAN: OK, So
something happens,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.540
basically, on the client.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.670
You'll send it to the server
via WebSocket as well.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.140
And then do you have to wait for
it to be synchronized on

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.130
the service before you
then send that back

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:20.950
out to all the clients?

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.790
Is that what you're saying?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.140
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:28.470
So we have the real-time server
that takes care of all

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.500
that synchronization, sends it
to the museum, and gets a

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.520
reply back, I'm going to play
this note at this time, sends

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.280
it out to everyone else.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.460
But before it got the reply
from the museum, it has

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.990
already broadcasted out this
is going to happen.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.020
We just--

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.692
PAUL KINLAN: I got you.

00:09:46.692 --> 00:09:47.600
It sends a confirmation.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.100
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.600
You just don't know the time
when it's going to happen, but

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.440
it's coming.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:51.900
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.160
So I mean, App Engine doesn't
support WebSockets, right?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.210
And you're using WebSockets.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.250
So how did you actually
build that part out?

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.940
Was it like a NoJS server
or something?

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.860
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes,
so we have--

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.500
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, sweet.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.090
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: A NoJS
server, so all

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.840
the JavaScript running.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.710
PAUL KINLAN: Is it
a lot of code?

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.426
I imagine it's not.

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:11.000
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's
not that much.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.530
And we implemented the
WebSockets from scratch, just

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.630
reading the specification
and sending as

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.140
small messages as possible.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.440
And they are around 4 or
5 bytes, every message

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.330
that are sent out.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:25.910
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
small, isn't it?

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.520
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.630
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.080
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And we use App
Engine for the queueing.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.580
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, actually,
we didn't talk about that.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.520
So how does the queueing work?

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.390
Because I can imagine that
there's only four instruments

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.460
that you can play any
one particular time.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.150
If you have a lot of people
visiting the museum, obviously

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.850
they can queue up in
a physical line.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.240
I mean, if you're online,
how does that work?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.690
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: So what we saw
earlier was the little bar

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.610
at the top saying how far you
are into the queue and how

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.950
long you have to wait.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.040
And so people are just queueing
up, and if you're

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.640
queueing, you can say the
virtual experience to interact

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.530
with other while
you're waiting.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.680
PAUL KINLAN: So what type of
technology do you use in the

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.950
back end to actually
manage the queue?

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.490
Is it just you pull
every so often?

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.270
Or is it tasked?

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.740
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, it's
pulling, which App Engine's

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.760
good at doing.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.210
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.580
It's pretty good at scaling
that stuff up.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.500
That's pretty interesting.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.770
So it is literally a first-in,
first-out queue?

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.242
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:11:30.242 --> 00:11:31.186
PAUL KINLAN: You just basically
manage and kind of

00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:32.130
pop it off.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.486
That's pretty cool.

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:38.070
That was actually quicker than
I thought it would be.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.570
Shall we have a look at the
live online experience?

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.990
This is actually pretty
cool as well.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.690
So the thing I like about the
museum one is you literally

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.300
are playing the instruments with
people in the museum, and

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.120
you get the live stream back,
and it's pretty nice.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.300
What should we say about the
Play Online version?

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.730
Why was this created?

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.440
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Just for
more people to play.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.210
We were thinking, if it's a long
queue, then people will

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.860
still want to do something,
and having a virtual one

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.730
enables us to have hundreds of
users at the same time instead

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.930
of just eight.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:14.350
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.760
That's pretty cool.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.885
So let's load the sequencer
and see how it goes.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.500
Fundamentally, this seems like
a relatively similar concept

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.050
between the real physical
machine, the installation

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.560
version, and the actual
online version.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.370
I mean, is it literally
the same code?

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.600
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, for
the display and for the

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.740
interaction between it.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:45.155
But then here we using audio API
to play the samples, which

00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:49.130
are taken from the instruments
in the museum.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.400
PAUL KINLAN: Cool, So
how would you play--

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.246
I mean, I'm just going
to put some stuff.

00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:54.200
Well, there's actually quite
a few people playing now.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.400
So let's play the--

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.390
the--

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.030
thing.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.670
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know
what it's called.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.970
That's pretty cool.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.740
I like that.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.990
It's nice.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.390
So yeah, I mean--

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.330
what was the question?

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.220
Yeah, so how do you
actually play?

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.720
I mean, you said you were
playing the audio back, and

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.390
you presampled the sounds.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.175
The audio tag in most browsers
is known to be very sensitive

00:13:24.175 --> 00:13:24.830
to latency.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.060
I say sensitive.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.830
It's very latent, has
high latency.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.870
I mean, how did you
get around this?

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.470
Because it seems like it's
pretty responsive.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.480
As soon as it says it's going
to play, it plays it.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.030
How did you do that?

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.290
Did you use the audio tag?

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.330
Web Audio?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.290
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: We're using
Web Audio for this one, which

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.630
is perfect for this kind, and
you can just tell it when to

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.960
start playing a sound, and it
plays exactly at that point.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.630
So we have a background loop of
four bars, and then we add

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.000
on on top of that.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.010
And everything stays
synchronized, which would be

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.743
impossible with the audio tag.

00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:03.470
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.550
I imagine as well you don't
think we need an amazing

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.400
amount of --

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.130
like every client to be
amazingly in sequence with

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.770
each of these now, because it's
not playing the physical

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.490
instrument and streaming
it back out.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.180
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: So they're
actually playing.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.990
You don't know if they are at
the same bar as you, but they

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.620
get your changes.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.690
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: This
is pretty cool.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.150
I really like the effect that
when two people are sharing

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:32.390
the same note, essentially, at
the same time, it's get a nice

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:32.820
little animation.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.150
I presume that's just
a normal Canvas

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.170
animation between the two.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:35.580
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.380
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:36.920
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.210
So I mean, you have
this button here

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.940
that says Record Session.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.380
How does that work?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.010
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: So that one,
we are just recording all the

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.310
changes and what's been playing,
and when we play it

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.290
back, we start the same thing.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.880
We start a player in this
interface to show it off.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.430
So it doesn't generate
an audio file.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.600
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so it's
not generating--

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.540
yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.850
So it's not generating a
physical audio file.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.760
It generates like a MIDI file,
essentially, where the notes

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.350
are playing at a particular
time and then you just

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.920
rerecord that.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.890
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.550
PAUL KINLAN: So if I press
Stop, does it cancel it?

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.730
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It
will cancel it.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.360
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, I'll
leave that.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.630
I'll let it go for another
4 seconds then.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.515
This is pretty cool.

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.010
So let's see if this works.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:18.500
Oh, that's nice.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:18.750
Yep.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.000
Save to Lab.

00:15:25.765 --> 00:15:27.015
It's doing its magic.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.750
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Here you go.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.000
PAUL KINLAN: So we can
play it from there.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.710
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: You can see
all the changes happening.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.180
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, that's
really cool.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.766
Oh, that's when I moved
it down as well.

00:15:38.766 --> 00:15:40.710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.830
PAUL KINLAN: That's
really nice.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.280
And that, again, is just the
Canvas animation with Web

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:45.960
Audio playing.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.980
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.720
PAUL KINLAN: So I mean, a lot of
people kind of are worried

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.270
about starting to play with
Web Audio, and you know,

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.890
obviously, it's a
Chrome thing.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.450
Well, it's Chrome and Safari
now, at least, anyway.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.600
I mean, did you have any issues
with Web Audio itself?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.940
It was relatively immature, I
think, when you guys started

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.370
the project.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.130
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, it's
was simply straightforward

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.080
from the beginning.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.400
It's quite an easy thing
to get into.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.730
You have samples that you want
to play, and you can add

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.170
effects, and you don't have
to code that much.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.080
You can just take
the good things

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.570
and connect it together.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.250
ROGER PALA: Less trouble than
the audio tag code.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.580
PAUL KINLAN: Really?

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:25.990
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.890
ROGER PALA: Although it
seems easier to use.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.840
It's not, at the
end of the day.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.250
PAUL KINLAN: Nice.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.630
Yeah, I think that's the first
thing that people naturally

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.660
gravitate towards, is the audio
tag, because you have a

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.300
dot play and dot pause,
essentially, which I always

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.460
thought should've been stopped,
but regardless.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.620
ROGER PALA: Even in looping, for
example, on the audio tags

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.250
is quite tricky.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:45.822
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:16:45.822 --> 00:16:47.060
PAUL KINLAN: Right.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.100
I really liked this.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.590
I didn't actually realize that
you didn't physically record

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.985
the output.

00:16:51.985 --> 00:16:54.670
So you just record the
events, essentially.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.350
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.150
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.400
That's pretty cool.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.090
My big thing about
this, I like the

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.330
collaborative aspect of it.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.079
It's the one thing that
I find that is most

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.329
powerful about the web.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.390
When you're trying to compare
native applications and web

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.300
applications is we tend on the
web to have always been

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.750
building collaborative-based
experiences.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.760
We've found it a lot easier to
do that on native platforms.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.770
I think this one really
kind of shows off a

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.290
lot really cool stuff.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.540
And the fact is, I mean, when
we actually demoed this

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.210
before, we were practicing what
happened, and no one was

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.099
playing at the time.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.410
We were kind of worried.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.860
So we've got quite a few
people now playing from

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.060
Brazil, United States.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.480
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And it's quite
interesting to see where

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.160
people are playing from.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.500
Someone in Mexico sitting
there playing

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.400
the exact same time.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.080
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.810
I wonder if they think
that I'm a

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.550
cool musician or something.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.100
He's really good, this guy.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.100
That's nice.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.780
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And what you
can say about the virtual as

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.760
well, you see the latency
of WebSockets there.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.550
Because in the one in the
museum, it's the delay of the

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.190
video to get that synced.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.910
But for the virtual,
we don't have that.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.270
So you see that when you drag
it, it kind of releases

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.120
directly, and it's been
traveling all the way to--

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.544
I think Las Vegas is where
our server is.

00:18:08.544 --> 00:18:09.040
PAUL KINLAN: Wow.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.420
That's pretty cool.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:09.860
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.380
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty exciting.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.050
PAUL KINLAN: I kind of--

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.120
yeah, I'm just amazed
at the level of

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.940
awesomeness that this--

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.880
I like all the projects.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.900
I think this is my favorite
of the five experiments

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.040
altogether.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.890
I like the fact that you can
just stream it through and see

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.740
what's happening
in the museum.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.450
I remember the other day, I saw
someone actually fixing

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.450
the machine.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.860
I was planning all the Hangouts
and everything, and I

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.400
was like, oh, there's someone
fixing the machine.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.300
And they were just moving stuff
around a little bit, and

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.090
the whole thing was
just a nice--

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.356
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And you can
see people dance around the

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:47.150
instruments.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.060
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.720
Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.380
The other thing is I like the
confluence of YouTube Live to

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.600
actually kind of handle
the scale of it.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.570
Because I can imagine that
there's lots and lots of

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.930
people always on this page.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.540
And then when you get to your
own instrument, well, you know

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.590
that you can deliver a direct
channel to the person then.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.070
You don't need to scale
that out so much.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.646
You need to make sure
it works, right?

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:11.870
But you don't need to check
too much on there.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.140
It's pretty cool.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.050
I like that.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:15.340
It's good.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:15.630
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.835
PAUL KINLAN: Congratulations.

00:19:17.835 --> 00:19:18.280
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Thanks.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.490
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.630
So I think that is the end of
this Hangout, at least.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.535
If you'd like to learn more,
we're going to have some

00:19:24.535 --> 00:19:25.785
articles on HTML5 Rocks.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.760
These guys are going
to produce an

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.080
article on HTML5 Rocks.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.210
If not--

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.892
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:32.892 --> 00:19:34.660
PAUL KINLAN: See, this is--

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.710
so we're going to hopefully
try and do a bit more of a

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.530
technical deep dive.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.800
This is obviously--

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.230
this sits in the middle of the
documentation on the site,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:46.250
which is into how it works
and the kind of very more

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.600
technical information.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.330
We're tried to give you like a
nice little middle ground of

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.960
showing you how the technologies
are used together

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.890
and how the guys built it.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.990
So thank you very much, and
we'll see you soon.
