00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.810
So there's an
amazing documentary

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.240
called "Flight from Death,"
in which an expert introduces

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.985
the concept of terror
management theory.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.200
Now, terror management theory
was coined by Ernest Becker

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.380
to describe the ways in which
the human being responds

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.450
to the unbearable awareness
of the mortal coil,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.430
like the fact that
we know that we

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.450
are born with a death sentence.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.280
And to use our life
with an agitation

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.990
that we have to
respond to in some kind

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.720
of either creative or
destructive capacity.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.520
And that is known as terror
management theory-- how

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.190
we manage the terror of
creation and mortality.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.440
And there's a line in the
film that's really poignant.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.510
One of the guys says
the explicit awareness

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.170
that you're a breathing piece
of defecating meat destined

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.530
to die, and ultimately,
no more significant

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.130
than a lizard or a potato
is not especially uplifting.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.330
And you know, it really
sets up the premise.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.470
It's like what do we do, right?

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.420
We're a creature that can
ponder the infinite, that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.510
can contemplate
infinity, that can

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.610
ponder the origins of the
ten trillion atoms that

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.840
make us a sentient
mind that were cooked

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.640
in the furnaces of stars
billions of years ago,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.074
ultimately-- and
at the same time,

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:52.740
look in the mirror
every day and witness

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830
our own decay over time.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.185
The human situation is absurd.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.640
There's something romantic in
the ways in which we respond

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.860
to this angst in our
poems and in our artistry.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.260
But nonetheless,
there's a sadness

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.640
inherent to just our humanness.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.140
There's a sadness
to that awareness.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.790
