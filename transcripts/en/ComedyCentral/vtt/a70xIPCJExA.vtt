00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.605
Yeah, let's deliberate.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.341 align:start position:0%
All right, uh, so what --
what were they talking about?

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:10.410
[ Laughter ]

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.279
-I didn't catch any of it.
-I missed all of it.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.883 align:end position:100%
I mean, you gotta figure
that guy -- he did it, right?

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.251
-Definitely.
-He burnt the couch.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.285
Without a doubt.

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:22.088 size:66% position:33%
I mean, unless we buy
the conspiracy.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.956 align:start size:97% position:3%
Unless we buy that
someone else did it

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.792 align:start size:94% position:6%
or he set him up.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.859 align:start position:0%
That's just ridiculous.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.828
He said he smoked weed
on the couch.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.596 align:end position:100%
There is a little bit
of truth to, you know,

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.199 align:end position:100%
you did invite the guy over
and get him really high,

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.567 size:63% position:69%
and they guy's like,
you know,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.469 size:59% position:70%
known for doing
that kind of thing,

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:39.172 size:59% position:70%
so in a way,
maybe, kind of...

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.340 align:start size:91% position:9% line:78%
Set him up?

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.340 size:63% position:69%
...like, deserved it
a little bit,

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:42.542 align:start size:56% position:44%
maybe, you know?

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.043 size:75% position:38%
Yeah, but he invited him
over to his house,

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.711 align:start position:0% line:85%
gave him weed to smoke.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.711 align:start size:31% position:69%
I know.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.246 size:59% position:70%
It just all seems
very generous

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.282 align:end position:100%
considering how much they seem
to not like each other.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.383
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.484 size:66% position:33%
I feel like they've
hung out before, too.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:52.819 size:84% position:58%
He wants a whole new couch.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.554 size:63% position:31%
Wait, he wants
a brand-new couch?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.723 size:84% position:58%
That's what he wants, yeah,
and he says it cost $1,600,

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.192 size:84% position:58%
but that was two years ago.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.127 line:83%
There's now way
that thing cost $1,600.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.127 align:start size:34% position:66%
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.763 align:end position:100%
While I take this bong rip,
I'm gonna calculate.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.531
-Depreciation...
-Over the year.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.134
-Two years.
-And there is a --

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.836 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's a formula
for depreciation.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.404
But it's Italian leather.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.106
[ Laughter ]

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.540
Yeah, we're not talking
about just a white couch.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:15.775 size:66% position:33%
Sometimes friendship,
you know...

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:16.943
We're talking about
Italian leather.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
Italian leather takes
precedent over friendship.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.013 line:85%
Mm-hmm.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.013 align:start size:94% position:6%
I get that.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:22.682
-That was the greatest picture.
-Yeah, that was amazing.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.851
I wanna give him the case
just for the picture.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.418
