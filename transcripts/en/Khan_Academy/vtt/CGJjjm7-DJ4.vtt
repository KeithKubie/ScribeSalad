00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.600
All of the reactions we've
looked at so far have been of

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.890
the form lowercase a moles of
the molecule uppercase A, plus

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.190
lowercase b moles of a
molecule uppercase B.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.870
They react to form the product
or the products.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.380
Let's just say they have
a couple of products.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.140
I could have had as many
molecules here as I wanted.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.070
Let's say c moles of the
molecule C plus d moles of the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.480
molecule capital D.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.070
And the idea here is that they
went in one direction.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.090
And if we did a little energy
diagram, just going off of the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.900
kinematics video we just did, if
that's the reaction, or how

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.260
the reaction progresses, you
could imagine that here you

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.100
have it at a higher
energy state.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.640
You have lowercase a moles of
capital A molecule, plus

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.500
lowercase b moles of capital B
molecule, and you have some

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.780
activation energy.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.450
And then you get to a more
stable state or a lower energy

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.650
level here, where it's lowercase
c moles of C

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.300
molecule plus lowercase d moles
of the D moles, and of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.650
course, you had some
activation energy.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.980
It only goes in this
direction.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.550
Once you get here, it's
very hard to go back.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.360
So that if you came back and
looked at this-- if you get

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.625
enough of A and B-- you'll just
be sitting with molecules

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:19.690
of C and D.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.870
It'll only go in
this direction.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.570
But that's not how it
happens in reality.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.180
In reality-- well, it sometimes
happens like this in

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.670
reality where the reaction can
only go in one direction.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.180
But in a lot of cases, the
reaction can actually go in

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.840
both directions.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.440
So we could write, instead of
this one-way reaction, we

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.810
could write a two-way
reaction like this.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.930
And not to confuse you too much,
these are the number of

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.290
moles or the ratios of the
molecules I'm adding up, and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.080
they become relevant
in a second.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.370
So let's say I have lowercase a
moles of this molecule plus

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.480
lowercase b moles of this
molecule, and then they react

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.680
to form lowercase c moles of
this molecule plus lowercase d

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.680
moles of that molecule.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.020
Sometimes the reaction can
go in both directions.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.590
And to do that, to just show an
equilibrium reaction, you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.860
do these arrows that go
in both directions.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610
That means that, hey, some of
this is going to start forming

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.520
into some of this.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.240
But at the same time, some of
this might start forming into

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.080
some of this.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.680
And at some point, I'm going to
be reaching an equilibrium.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.370
When the rate of reaction of
molecules going in that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.120
direction is equal to the number
of molecules going in

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.640
the other direction, then I'm
going to reach some type of

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.890
equilibrium.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.670
Now, why would this happen
as opposed to that?

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.610
And I can think of
one situation.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.880
If we draw this energy
diagram again.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.610
Maybe both of these have similar
or not so different

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.960
energy states.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.930
There could be other reasons,
but this is the one that comes

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.670
to my mind.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.700
Maybe the energy states look
something like this.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.870
On this side, you have the A
plus B, and then you need some

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.870
activation energy.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.890
And then maybe the C plus D,
maybe it's a little bit of a

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.870
lower potential, but it's
not that much lower.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.770
So maybe they're favored to go
in this direction, because

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.880
this is a more stable state.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.650
So this is the A plus B, but
here you have the C plus D.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.010
But it's not ridiculous
to go this way either.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.840
So most of it might go that
way, but some of it

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.890
might go this way.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.510
If some of these molecules just
have the right amount of

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.570
kinetic energy, they can
surmount this activation

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.400
energy and then go backwards
to that side of it.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.090
And the study of this is called
equilibrium, where

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.710
you're looking at the
concentrations of the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.590
different molecules.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.330
And just to compare that to
kinetics, kinetics was how

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.790
fast is this is going
to happen?

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.260
Or what can I do to change the
activation, this hump here?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.860
Equilibrium is studying what
will be the concentrations of

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.650
the different molecules that end
up, once the rate going in

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.290
this direction is equal to the
rate going in that direction.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.200
And I want to be clear.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.460
Equilibrium is where the rate
going in the forward direction

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.470
is equal to the rate going
in the reverse direction.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.530
It doesn't mean that the
concentrations of the two

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.170
things are equal.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.720
You might end up with 25% of
your eventual solution's

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.190
concentration to be A
and B and 75% here.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.450
All we know is that at some
point, you've reached an--

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.760
equilibrium just means that
those concentrations won't

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.290
change anymore.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.590
And just to give you an example
what I mean here, I

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.760
could have written-- let's
see, this is actually the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.720
Haber process.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.520
I could write nitrogen gas
plus 3 hydrogen gases.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.730
These are all in gas form, so
I can put a little g in

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.980
parentheses.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.680
Actually, it's an equilibrium
reaction, and it produces 2

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.000
moles of ammonia.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.220
It's called the Haber process.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.000
We could talk about that
in another video.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.990
So in this case, we could say a
is just 1, this lowercase a.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.040
Capital A is the nitrogen
molecule.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.710
Lowercase b is 3.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.720
Uppercase B is the hydrogen
molecule.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.910
And then lowercase c is the
number of moles of ammonia and

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.230
uppercase C is the ammonia
molecule itself.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.600
I just want you to realize this
is just an abstract way

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.950
of describing a whole
set of equations.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.950
Now, what's interesting in
equilibrium reactions is that

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.760
you can define a
constant called

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.255
the equilibrium constant.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.780
It's defined as the constant
of equilibrium.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.860
Let me switch colors.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.020
I'm using this light
blue too much.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.650
The equilibrium constant is
defined as you take the

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.320
products, or the right-hand
side-- but if it goes in both

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.640
directions, you can obviously
go in either direction.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.790
But let's say that this is the
forward direction going from A

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.990
plus B to C plus D.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.300
So you take the products, you
take the concentration of each

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.820
of the products, and you
multiply them by each other,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.700
and you raise them to the mole
ratios that you're taking.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.600
So in this case, it would be
the concentration of big C

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.050
raised to the lowercase c power
and the concentration of

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.550
big D raised to the
lowercase d power.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.820
And when I say concentration,
they usually-- especially what

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.980
you see in your intro chemistry
classes, the

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.790
concentration is going to be
measured in molarity, which,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.270
just as a review, is
moles per liter.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.650
A couple of videos ago, when I
taught you what molarity was,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.830
I said, you know, moles per
liter--- I don't like it so

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.550
much because the volume of your
fluid or your gas you're

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.870
dealing with is dependent
on temperature.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.450
So I didn't like
using molarity.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.140
But in this case,
it's kind of OK.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.995
Because this equilibrium
constant is also only true for

00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:57.030
a given temperature.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.220
We assume it for a given
temperature, and I'll show you

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.200
how we use it in a second.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.900
But it's defined as the
concentrations of the products

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.270
to the powers.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.843
And also, if I have time,
maybe I'll do

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:08.850
it in the next video.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.370
The intuition why you're
raising it to the power

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.820
divided by the concentrations
of the reactants, or the

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.580
things on the left-hand side of
the equilibrium reaction.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.610
So capital A to the lowercase a
divided by capital B to the

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.920
lowercase B.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.220
And what's interesting about
this, and this is a bit of a

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.640
simplification, because
this doesn't

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.980
apply to all reactions.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.920
But to most things that you're
going to encounter in an intro

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.160
chemistry class, this is true,
that once you establish this

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.580
equilibrium constant for a
certain temperature-- it's

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.090
only true for a certain
temperature-- then you can

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.530
change the concentrations and
then be able to predict what

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.760
the resulting concentrations
are going to be.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.450
Let me give you an example.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.230
So let's say that after you
did this equilibrium

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.770
reaction-- and actually, just
to make things hit home a

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.110
little bit, let me take this
Haber process reaction and

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.090
write it in the same form.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.340
So if I wanted to write the
equilibrium constant for the

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.800
Haber reaction, or if I wanted
to calculate it, I would let

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.990
this reaction go at
some temperature.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.320
So this is only true at-- let's
say we're doing it at 25

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.540
Celsius, which is roughly
room temperature.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.550
So what I would do is I would
take the products.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.790
So the only product
is ammonia, NH3.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.280
I raise it to the power of the
number of moles that's

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.650
produced for every 1 mole
of nitrogen gas

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.030
and 3 moles of hydrogen.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.880
So I raise it to
the power of 2.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.350
So that's what that gets me.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.990
And I divide it by
the reactants.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.400
So 1 mole of nitrogen, so
I would just put the

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.860
concentration of the nitrogen,
plus 3 moles of

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.830
hydrogen-- oh, no, no.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:48.760
I shouldn't write
a plus there.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.890
It's multiplied.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:55.200
So times the hydrogen, and I
raise it to the third power,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.090
because for every 1 mole of
nitrogen, I have 3 moles of

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.780
hydrogen and then 2
moles of ammonia.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.060
And if I were to calculate this,
remember, when I put

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.880
these in brackets, I'm
figuring out the

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.730
concentration.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.430
So I would have to figure
out the moles per liter.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.170
Or sometimes they say, the
molarity of each of these

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.430
things, and it'll get
me some constant.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.630
If I change it, I can go and
calculate the rest, so let me

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.910
just do an example right now.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:29.480
So let's say I have 1 mole of
molecule A plus 2 moles of

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:40.710
molecule B are in equilibrium
with 3 moles of molecule C.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.690
And let's say that once we're
in equilibrium, we go and we

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.820
measure the concentrations,
and we figure out that the

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:55.100
concentration of A is 1
molar, which is equal

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.520
to 1 mole per liter.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.360
That's the concentration of A.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.990
We figure out that once we're
in equilibrium, the

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:17.480
concentration of B is equal
to 3 molar, which

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.680
means 3 moles per liter.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.750
And let's say that once we're
in that equilibrium, the

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:35.100
concentration of C is equal to
point-- well, I don't want to

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.780
do something too-- let's say
it's equal to 1 molar as well.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.740
I should get rid of that point
there, because I don't want to

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.200
say 0.1 molar, so it's
just 1 molar.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.410
So if we wanted to calculate the
equilibrium constant for

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:53.000
this reaction, we just take C,
the concentration of C over

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.770
here, so let's see.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:11:00.970
The equilibrium constant is
equal to the concentration of

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:12.640
C to the third power divided by
the concentration of A to

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.740
the first power-- because
there's only 1 mole of A for

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.480
every 3 of C and 2 of B-- times
the concentration of--

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.640
I'll do it in that color--
B to the third power.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.820
So if we needed to calculate
this, concentration of C is 1

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:35.130
molar, and we're raising it to
the third power, divided by

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.950
concentration of A is 1 molar
times the concentration of B,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.280
which is 3 molars, to
the third power.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:51.300
So this is equal to 1/27.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.940
There's a couple of things
we can think about.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.800
The fact that this is less than
1, what does that mean?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:05.320
Well, that means that our
concentration of our reactants

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.660
is much larger than the
concentration of the products,

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.600
where we view just the products
as whatever's on the

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.050
right-hand side of
the equation.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.490
So once this reaction goes to
equilibrium, we're still left

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.960
with a lot more of
this than this.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.860
And because we're left with
a lot more of that, our

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.870
equilibrium constant is less
than 1, which means that the

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.920
reaction favors this
direction.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.455
It favors the backward
direction.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.250
Think about it.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.720
Because there's more of this,
this must be happening more

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.700
than the left-to-right
reaction.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.100
The left to right might be a
small direction like this,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.900
while more is happening there,
and that's why we're finding

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.650
more reaction here, and that
causes the equilibrium

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.150
constant to be less than 1.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.270
On the other hand, if the
equilibrium constant was

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.470
greater than 1, that means that
this numerator is greater

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.800
than this denominator.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.730
Which would imply that you have
more concentration-- once

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.560
you're in equilibrium, you end
up with a lot more of the

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.530
stuff on the right than you end
up with the stuff on the

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.030
left, so then that means the
reaction would be going in the

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.200
forward direction.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.340
The other interesting thing is
you can then figure out, well,

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.420
what happens if I add another
mole of A to the reaction?

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.370
So let's say I throw some
A into the reaction.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.300
I add some concentration of A.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:37.110
So now my new A is equal to 2.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.070
Let's say my new A
is equal to 2.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:45.170
Let's say my new B, let's say
that I want to-- well,

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.820
actually, we can figure out
the relation between the--

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.760
actually, instead of going into
this situation where I

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.150
change the concentration, let me
do that in the next video,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.550
because I just realized that I'm
running very low on time.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.700
But hopefully, you got a good
sense of what the equilibrium

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.280
constant is all about
and how it's

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.130
measured or how it's defined.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.890
And in the next video, we're
going to talk a little bit

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.070
about how else it
could be useful.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.540
In this video, you just said,
oh, if it's less than 1, that

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.730
means that the backward
reaction is favored.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.090
If it's greater than 1, the
forward reaction is favored.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.110
In the next video, we'll get a
little intuition, hopefully,

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:21.800
on why it is defined this way as
opposed to, say, this way.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.480
My intuition said, hey, why
isn't it three times the

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.620
concentration of C divided by
one times the concentration of

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.810
A plus three times the
concentration of B?

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.510
This might have been more
intuitive to me, but this

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.460
isn't the case.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.140
This is what actually is
constant, regardless of how

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.820
you change the concentrations
of the various reactants.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.880
So maybe we'll talk a little bit
about why this is true and

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.570
not necessarily this.
