00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta.
This is Crash Course Mythology and

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.320
Today we'll be talking about the moment that you've all been waiting for... or perhaps dreading.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.560
That's right Thoth, it's the end of the world.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.320
These days books and movies and video games are big on post-Apocalypse stories

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.720
A  Nuclear Fallout, Zombies, Robot uprisings...

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.600
Nuclear-Powered robot zombie uprisings...

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.100
but before there were post apocalypse stories, there were plain old apocalypse stories.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.180
What's an apocalypse? Well, it's a fancy way of saying "the end of the world," but often with

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.940
a religious connotation. So yes, fair warning, the apocalyptic visions we're discussing

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.220
come from living religious texts, and as usual,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.460
We're not going to touch on their religious significance, but these stories do fit our definition of myth:

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.980
So let's get started, with
all of these endings.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.480
(Theme Music)

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.020
We can find stories of the end of the world in cultures around the globe, and perhaps that's because

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.400
they reflect the uncomfortable fact that for individual people the world does come to an end

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.500
(in a sense)

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.980
When we, you know, die, but apocalypses are about more than any individual death, they're about imagining

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.100
how a supernatural power will eventually end all human life in its entirety.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:45.100
According to our old pal David Leeming:

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.480
This theme of Divine punishment is similar to what we saw in all those flood stories:

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.720
China, Mesopotamia, the Inca Empire...
but there's one significant difference.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.620
Flood stories are about the past,
but Apocalypse stories...

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.220
(apocalypse comes from a greek word for
uncovering, by the w)

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.180
always reveal something yet to come. This makes talking about them a little strange,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.020
because they're old stories rooted in the past, which discuss a distant 'glob only knows when' future.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.680
What we'll see today is the
flood story theme of judgment,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.740
combined with the focus on torment for those
harshly judged, and in many cases

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.300
(just like the flood stories)

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.080
These end of everything tales actually promise a new beginning.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.000
There's more than one tale of apocalypse in the Hebrew Bible foretold by a number of prophets

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.620
in some of these prophecies the end of the world is marked by two events:

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.940
First:

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.480
usually of the natural world, followed by:

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.220
a judgement punishing the enemies of God.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.100
We're going to see these themes repeated,
again and again.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.120
The book of Isaiah describes the promised Destruction:

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.600
The book of Zachariah has a little bit more detail
about how the judgment will work itself out

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.480
"Amid the destruction of the world the people of Jerusalem will be embroiled in a great battle"

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.400
"But the Lord himself will go forth to sway the battle and save his righteous followers"

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.040
and those on the other side of the battle? The 'non-righteous' you might be wondering, well:

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.580
:O

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.000
Anyone who manages to survive the
literal face-melting...

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.860
"The Lord will put a 'great tumult' among them leaving
all the non-believers to...

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.900
...fight each other as the world
burns down around them."

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.940
For the true believers in Yahweh, the prophecy promises

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.860
"safety and survival in the kingdom of God"

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.740
This is an apocalyptic attribute that we're going to see more than once today:

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.200
'if you got faith, you safe'

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.660
For the ancient Persians, or Astrians,
the ultimate deity Ahura Mazda has

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.200
a destructive counterpart in Angra Mainyu or 'Ahriman.'

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.920
In their apocalypse prophecy your fate is tied to which one you follow;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.900
The many followers of Ahriman will be punished while the few faithful to Ahura Mazda will be rewarded

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.820
According to David Leeming:

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.100
Saoshyant, who's referred to as a single figure sometimes, and other times is a group of figures

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.920
is a kind of Messiah who will help remake
the world and redeem worthy Humankind

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.540
in some traditions the Saoshyant is also a product of
a virgin birth, but this story involves...

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.600
bathing in a lake filled with sperm. Lake of sperm aside, maybe you're picking up on some similarities?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.160
There was a great deal of syncretism among the religions of the Eastern Mediterranean

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Which brings us to the Christian apocalypse.
The end of the world is described in the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.360
book of Revelation. It portrays the coming of the kingdom of God to Earth, the raising of the dead and

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.460
the last judgement. We got angels and antichrist, plagues, this end of days has it all come on down...

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.840
to the thought bubble. Amid all the Chaos at the end of days, Saint John Devine described in particular detail

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.900
the alchemical plagues of Seven Angels. He writes:

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.840
The seven angels appear, each holding their own vial of Plague liquid.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.860
One by one they pour them out across the land the first angel pours their vial and

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.400
"There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men...

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.840
...which had the mark of the beast...

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.140
...and upon them which worshiped His image"

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.180
The second angel pours their vial into the sea, which turns into blood.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.220
The third angel pours a vial on the rivers and fountains, which also turn into blood.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.600
The fourth Angel pours their vial into the sun, which flares up and scorches those on the face of the Earth

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.220
Angel five pours a vial on the seat of the beast. This fills their kingdom with darkness, and causes

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.800
their followers to gnaw their own tongues in pain.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.300
The sixth angel pours their vial on the great river Euphrates and,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.780
in kind of a twist the river doesn't turn into blood,
but it does dry up entirely.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.040
The final Angel pours out their liquid into the air which causes

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.540
a great booming voice to come from the temple of heaven saying

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.720
IT

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.460
IS

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.980
DONE

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.240
There's thunder, lightning, and a terrible earthquake,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.820
and all the remaining cities all the
nations of Earth crumble, and fall.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.980
Thank you, thought bubble?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.400
The apocalypse story in Revelation has a lot in common with the older prophecy Told by Zachariah.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.740
Plagues, war, the dissolving of terrestrial nations...
but there's one very significant difference

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.580
which is that Revelation makes frequent
reference to 'The Beast,'

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.640
Saint John has added a villain similar to
what we saw in Zoroastrianism.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.880
Of course, the villain stuff gets complicated because there are actually two beasts...

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.720
And a dragon yes, there is also a dragon

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.680
So I guess that means that there are then three beasts? Also The Dragon is the devil.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.260
The last story of apocalypse that we're going to talk about comes from

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.820
Islam and since Islam is also an Abrahamic tradition, It's unsurprising that there are similarities between

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.070
Jewish Christian and Muslim accounts of the end of the world

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.299
There's a long description of the final judgment in Sura 56 of the Quran

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.540
But there's also interesting additional information;

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.400
recorded in a collection of 'hadith' which are sayings and stories of the life of Mohammad

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.080
It's worth noting that while this is a religious text in Islam,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.940
It's considered a secondary text to the Koran and not all collections of Hadith are equally esteemed.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.180
Muslims have a variety of relationships with the hadith often depending upon their denomination,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.040
and how well sourced a given hadith is. Here at crash course Mythology were interested in stories,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.200
which is why we're drawing on this particular hadith, but if you want to know more you can

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.480
check out the two episodes of crash course world history about Islam that cover this very topic.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.300
When asked about the judgment that's mentioned in the Quran, Mohammad offers further explanation:

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:30.000
He says that at this terrible time people will forsake studying the quran and indulge in Earthly pleasures.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.130
There will be famine and plague in Medina and Mecca earthquakes throughout North Africa

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.709
Thunderstorms in Iran and Turkey,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.360
banditry in Iraq and floods in the far East.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:48.200
As morality decays among all the people the Dajjal or antichrist will appear riding on a donkey and

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.400
Subjecting all the people to his rule. Dajjal's rule, not the donkeys rule. The Dajjal will rule for only 40 days though,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.040
before God sends Jesus and an army of
the Faithful from Heaven.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.020
Jesus will defeat and kill the Dajjal and then rain for 40 years, but each of these years will have

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.500
26 months, so it'll be more like 87 years.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.380
At that point, Jesus will travel to Jerusalem, pray at the dome of the rock,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:19.580
And be taken up to heaven. And this is where things
get intense: Seven days after Jesus ascends

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.120
the monsters Ya'juj and Ma'juj (referred to in the old
and new Testaments as Gog and Magog)

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.260
will escape their bondage and destroy civilization,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.480
then the angel Israphel will blow the horn of judgment,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.760
Mountains will crumble, there will be 40 more years of earthquakes and terrible storms then

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.880
Israphel will sound the horn again, the souls and bodies of the faithful will be reunited,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.980
resurrected and spend the next 40 years praising Allah.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:52.280
After this final 40 year period the trumpet will sound again and Mohammad will return to Earth,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.920
for the day of judgment.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.520
Everyone will have their secret sins measured against their good deeds on the scales of judgment,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.040
the Allah will tip the scales if one of the damned sincerely calls for mercy

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.580
and finally all will walk to cross the bridge into paradise

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:16.200
easy and wide for the righteous while the damned can't help but slip off and fall below into hell

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.790
But even if they do fall into hell,

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.220
If they really have a change of heart along the way they'll be able to scramble out in time.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.389
There's always hope for things to turn around.

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:28.800
So these apocalypse stories feature plagues and natural disasters,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.660
things far beyond mortal control and let's not forget the unnatural disasters,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:39.640
like rivers of molten metal or the Dragons; not nice ones interested in responding or helping with floods either.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.500
And yet, these apocalypse stories mix terror with hope! As in flood myths, apocalypse stories from the

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.620
religious traditions of the Eastern Mediterranean all offer some sense of an everlasting life,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.340
beyond this world. At least, for believers. If they speak to the end of the world they also speak to

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:03.140
the faithful in the present moment, promising great rewards, or amnesty from everlasting torment,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:09.059
if that faith continues. But, let's hope the world is an end too soon at least not before we get to talk about

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Ragnarok!
