00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.580
Okay, Michael. You got the answer?

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think, well I can work

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.100
through it, I don't actually have the number yet.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do that.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.350
&gt;&gt; So, alright, so in a world where.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.570
&gt;&gt; In a world where.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.500
&gt;&gt; Where this is the hypothesis that actually matters. We're saying that X

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.320
comes in, the hypothesis spits that same X out. And then this noise process

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.430
causes it to become a multiple. And the probability of a multiple is this

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.320
one over two to the case. So, the probability that that would happen from

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.580
this hypothesis. for the very first data item. The one to five, would be

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.200
1 32nd. That's the probability that a one would produce a five by this process.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.230
&gt;&gt; Okay. How do you, how'd you figure that out?

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.180
&gt;&gt; Cause the k that we would need

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.490
the multiplier would have to be five. And so

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.890
the probability for that multiplier is exactly one over

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.100
two to the five which is one 30 second.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.780
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.540
&gt;&gt; And so then I would use that same thought

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.670
process on the next one which says that it is doubled and the way that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.150
this particular process would have produced a doubling

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.285
would be if with, with probability a quarter.

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:02.780
&gt;&gt; Uh-hm.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.980
&gt;&gt; And, the next data element would have

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.990
been produced by this process with probability at

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.930
half, because it's k will be 1, and 1 over 2 to the k would be half,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like this.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.580
&gt;&gt; Right? The next one will be an 8th, because its

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.010
tripled,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.483
&gt;&gt; Uh-hm.

00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:21.130
&gt;&gt; And the last one is also a multiplier of 5, just

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.855
like the first one, so that will be one thirty second as well,

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.361
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.130
&gt;&gt; Alright but now we need to assign a probability

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.330
to the whole data set, and because you told me it

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.100
was okay to think about these things happening independently, the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.280
probability that all these things would happen is exactly the product.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.870
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.945
&gt;&gt; So I'll multiply a 32nd and a quarter and

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:45.940
1/2 and an 8th and a 32nd, so that's like a factor of 5 plus 2

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.710
is 7 plus 1 is 8. Plus another

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.738
3 is 11 plus another 5 is 16 and 2^16

00:01:56.738 --> 00:02:01.120
is 65,536. So it should be 1 over, oh you already wrote it. 65,536. Yea that.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.970
&gt;&gt; Yes that's absolutely correct Michael. Well done. Okay so,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.008
that's right, but you did it with a bunch of specific numbers. Is

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.130
there a more generic Is there a general form that we could write down?

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, we're doing something pretty regular

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.060
once I fell into a pattern. So, I took the D,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.230
and divided by X, so D over X tells me

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.950
that the multiplier that was used, so that's like, the K.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.020
&gt;&gt; So. D over x gave you the k.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.330
&gt;&gt; And it was one

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.520
over 2 to the that.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.790
&gt;&gt; Okay, so one over 2 to the that.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.960
&gt;&gt; And it was then the product of, of that quantity for all of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.910
the data elements, so all the i's. So product over all the i's of that.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.060
&gt;&gt; But we have to be careful because If it

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.470
was the case that for any of our xi's the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.970
d wasn't a multiple of it, that can't happen under

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.930
this hypothesis and the whole probability needs to go to zero.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.530
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.400
&gt;&gt; So they all have to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.610
be divisible otherwise all bets are off.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.490
&gt;&gt; Okay, so in other words if d of i mod x of

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.910
i is equal to zero and this formula holds and it's zero otherwise.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.830
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.470
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good. Okay, great Michael. So that's right and that

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.230
was exactly the right way of thinking about it. And now, what we're

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.960
going to do next, is we're going to take what we've just gone through.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.410
This sort of process of thinking about, how to generate data labels. for,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.050
you know, noisy cases and we're going to apply to it what I

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.417
think you will find will be a pretty cool derivation. Sound good?

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:28.368
&gt;&gt; Awesome!

00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:29.589
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
