00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.460
So we went from one-half to 0.5,
just by doing normal division.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.278
1 divided by 2.

00:00:05.278 --> 00:00:08.660
Well, let's see,
two doesn't go into one at all.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.240
Zero times two is zero.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.190
Two goes into ten five times.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.310
Donâ€™t forget the decimal.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.270
Right.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.990
1 divided by 2 is 0.5.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.390
Now, how do we get from 0.5 to 50%?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.148
Well, let's see.

00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:26.068
The reason why 0.5 equals 50% is
because percent means per 100.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:32.438
In fact, cent is a prefix meaning 100,
centuries, 100 years.

00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:35.448
The word cent is one hundred in French.

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:39.288
So percent really means out of 100,
percent.

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:46.877
So what this statement really says,
is that 0.5 equals 50 out of 100.

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:49.257
That's what this symbol means,
out of 100.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:54.249
So what this means is that if you can
write a number as something over 100,

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.328
then that something is your percent,
just like 50 out of 100 is 50%.

00:00:59.328 --> 00:01:02.352
Now a trick is that to convert
from decimals to percents,

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:05.870
we just move the decimal point
two places to the right.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.439
So in the case of 0.5, we move this
decimal place one, two, and actually we

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.048
have to put a zero there, so now instead
the decimal being here, it's over here.

00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:17.688
It's 50%.

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:20.440
And there's a little decimal place
we can think of being there.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.985
Can you practice this by converting
the following numbers from decimals to

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:26.040
percent?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.090
For each of these four numbers, write
the corresponding percentage over here.
