00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.770
If you are familiar

where you can find abundant
North Korean materials.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.200
And here is just a
glimpse of what we have

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.410
in our rich collection.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.760

physical items

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.750
in over 130 vernacular languages
in the Asian Reading Room.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.800
The Asian Reading Room is
just located in the other side

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.450
of the building also

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.360

subcontinent

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.460

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.680
to our Reading Room

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.210

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.510
Thank you.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:41.430
[ Applause ]

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.730
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: Good afternoon.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.660
Welcome. My name is Sonya
Lee, reference specialist

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.060
at the Korean Collection,
Library of Congress.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.660
Once a North Korean
scholar told me

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.740
that I will notice Korean
materials is like a playground.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.220
And today my job is to help
you to figure out how to search

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.260
around in their playground.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.560
And I'll share with you the
North Korean research materials

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.830
at the Library of
Congress and help you

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.240
to figure out how to use it.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.390
But before talk-- oops sorry.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.260
Before start talking about
Koran Collection, let me start

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.970
with the brief summary
of the Korean Collection.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.610
1950, Library start to collect
the Korean Material during the

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.610
Korean War then the Korean unit
was only location among the

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.890
United State government collect
the material about Korea.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.590
So any recast relate
to Korea send

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.920
to the Korean Unit thus
they make a collection

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.130
equally developed.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.110
1955, the libraries start to
use inventory in South Korea

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.230
to systematically and
regularly acquired

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.490
of contemporary publication.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.160
1966, is the important year
for the Korean Collection.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.210
The United States and South
Korean government signed an

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.200
exchanged agreement in
which the Library start

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.520
to acquire the government
publication in different topic

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.580
which makes the collection
give-- has been.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.000
Sorry, has become one
of the most significant

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.260
to strength the Korean
Collection.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.210
Now, our collection
is most extensive

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.180
and comprehensive collection
outside of East Asia.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.900
The Library has extensive
collections

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.220
which include a variety
of materials such as more

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.580
than 10,000 items
and 281 serials

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.960
and newspaper from North Korea.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.690
Let's get to the main
part of the presentation,

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.960
North Korean Collection.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.220
The Library contains one of the
largest North Koreas materials

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.590
in the world especially the
one disappeared during the

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.070
Korean War.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.810
The North Korean materials at
the Library are one of a kind

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.380
which may not be available even
in North Korea, these makes--

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.170
this collection is extremely
rare and significant.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.660
Also the Library provides the
researchers greater access

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.200
to old and new North
Korean materials freely.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.820
Because of these reasons,
there's a high demand

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.610
from researchers for
access to this materials.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.110
When I start working
at the Library,

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.600
I thought it will
be straightforward

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.570
to serve the users with
the North Korean materials,

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.230
but soon I had realized it was
anything but straightforward.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.570
It was quite complex.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.560
So for years since
I start working

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.350
at the Korean Collection, I
have worked on a few data basis

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.090
in order to render better
service to our users

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.610
which include the
Korea Serial Database

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.310
and North Korean Serial
Indexing Database.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.040
First Korean Serial Database,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.610
Korean Serial Database
is a friendly powerful

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.020
reference tool.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.260
It provides the researchers
detailed information

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.980
about reaching diverse serials
at the Korean Collection.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.550
It all start with
the warning query.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.330
[Inaudible] Korean
Serials list please have

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.750
to receive the same
[inaudible] few times.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.540
I knew I had to do
something about it.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.650
Then we use those 10:26 file

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.410
like this image to
serve the users.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.330
It was impossible to
respond to the recast.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.500
So we pull all the Korean
serials at the Library.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.730
Over 7,000 titles and then we
developed the Korean Serial

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.370
Database by reviewing each
title, assign a country code

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.730
and add a subject by the LC--

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.340
phone number and titles
in Korean characters.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.850
Let's look at one example
why Korean Serial Database is

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.600
powerful reference tool.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.230
Chollima this is a frequently
used North Korean serial.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.090
Probably, you know the title.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.000
When you put into record,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.920
LC Subjects heading is
Korea North Periodicals.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.020
As you can see, it
is not talking

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.320
about [inaudible] subject.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.280
This is only say this is
periodical from North Korea.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.720
Korean serial database
enable researchers

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.660
to start using All Field, Korean
field-- Korean title and Title,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.610
Issuing Body, Publisher,
and Newspaper

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.930
and the Subject Heading
which are the value

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.230
to searching the database.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.540
By using Advanced Search,
you can limit the search

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.260
to both Koreas or just
North Korea or South Korea.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.120
Let's just search serials

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.780
and technology published
just from South Korea.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.280
We retrieved the
total 175 result.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.380
And from this list,
let's click one title

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.830
to get to those short lists.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.230
From short list by
clicking the LCCN number

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.970
which is Library
Congress Control Number,

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.660
you can get to the full record.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.250
When you have a full
record, always make sure go

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:26.000
to the bottom to get our
full coding information.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.610
And now you can get all
North Korean serials list

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.700
with just one click
on the browse option

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.870
because if you remember
we review

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:43.940
and assign the country
code for each serial title.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.170
Let's move to the next
part of the presentation.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.180
Briefly, I like to
talk about how

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.220
to search the books
from North Korea.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.050
The Library of Congress
cataloging record contains

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:02.480
approximately 17 million record
representing books and serials

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.720
for cartographic materials,
manuscript so forth.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.280
It include also 3.2
million records

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.250
from our all-year database.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.770
This record mostly books and
procedures and catalogued

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.060
between 1898 and 1980.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.410
We called this record
as a PREMARC record.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.800
Searching the PREMARC record is
much more complex which means

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.760
when you search the books
published before 1980 can be

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.420
challenging including
North Korean materials.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.510
Let's see one example.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.190
[ Foreign Language ]

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.980
How do you search this
book from North Korea?

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.540
Let's check its record first.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.400
This was the original record
which was PREMARC record

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.230
when I found it accidentally.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.100
I could not see any
country code.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.780
There was not much publication
information besides--

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.680
published 1975, and then pnjil.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.690
Definitely there was a typo.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.260
I wonder what was pnjil.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.870
So I went to those
tags locatable

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.260
and manually modified
this record by adding Kn

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.990
for North Korea and then
correct the typo pnjil,

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:31.100
it was ponjil, P-O-N-J-I-L.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.340
And then add a publication
information

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.990
from the book published
in Pyongyang,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.290
Sahoe Kwahak Chulpansa,

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.380
and changed the whole
theme information

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.700
from General Collection
to Asian Collection.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.740
Modify record manually, modify
the PREMARC record manually

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.350
since that's the only
option we have now.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.080
These are some of the common
issues of a PREMARC record.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.540
Many of them doesn't
have a country code

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.280
or no publication
information, not much subject

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.320
and wrong holding
information and wrong spelling

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.900
and then inconsistent
with the spacing practice.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.220
So when you're searching
for the North Korean book

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.440
from the Library of
Congress Online Catalog,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.550
we recommend use these tips to
make a search more efficient.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:27.150
First, use advanced search
and enter your search term

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.570
such as a subject and
leave a Boolean operator &amp;,

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.820
and then put the Pyongyang as
the publication information.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.430
This is very important.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.110
Let's see how it works.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.460
So we like to retrieve
North Korean book

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.900
on politics and government.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.730
Sorry, I have erased
all that already.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:56.240
And then enter North Korea
as a publication information

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.280
because we like to get
a North Korean book

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.590
so it's natural, right?

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.230
Natural reaction, but actually
this is a common mistake

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.720
that user do.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.470
So when we did this search, we
retrieved all these 13 results

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.360
which include those three
films from North Korea,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.500
two films from Japan, four
books from South Korea,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.000
four books from Washington,
D.C. We could not find any book

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.640
from North Korea
from this search.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.160
So at this time, we typed
the politics and government

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:36.140
as a subject and then Pyongyang
as a publication information.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.060
From this search, we
retrieved 275 record

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:50.590
and then we found the book,
books record we are looking for.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.070
So [foreign language].

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.370
So please make sure
add a Pyongyang

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.090
as a publication information.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:05.250
Lastly, North Korea Serial
Indexing Project, NKSIP.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.250
The Asian Division at the
Library of Congress has ruled

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.970
out North Korean serial
database online indexing tool.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.590
The database offers researchers
enhanced access to periodicals

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.100
and articles published
from North Korea.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.790
Currently, there are
34,000 article index

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.350
in 21 North Korean serials.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.850
They are now searchable
for the first time.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.430
In the past, there were
no indexing resources

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.780
at the article level for the
North Korean serials anywhere

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.110
in the world.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.050
So without specific
bibliographic information,

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:50.090
user has to browse
numerous titles and issues

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.930
to find a specific
issues, articles they want.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.590
Access to index to
this historical

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.770
and cultural material offers
insight into the policy,

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.680
economy, political,
social, history, military,

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.860
legal and financial
and government issues

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.840
that affect the contemporary
foreign policy

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.380
and strategy related
to North Korea.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.620
We start this project
with the following goals,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.530
to fill the article level index
for the North Korean serials

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:27.220
in the Library of Congress and
make that index available online

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.800
for researches and scholars.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.250
It is not surprising that
more, more graduate students

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.160
and scholars are taking a
deep interest in North Korea

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.040
because they know they can find
a primary source information

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.730
on Korea-- North Korea at
the Library of Congress.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.870
So let's give you one example.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.300
For example, you are
looking for any article

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.120
or information education
in South Korea,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.780
you go on over any database
like a ProQuest education.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.090
You search the education
in South Korea.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.180
There are over 13,000
search results.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.570
Wait for manual research.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.460
So you can modify your search
or you can use advanced search

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.530
and narrow down the results.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.190
You may find the interesting
article and can request article

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.780
because of citation information.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.540
But for the North
Korean serials,

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.290
that was not the
case in the past.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.490
Now, [inaudible] database
let you study North Korea

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.060
in unusual depths.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.470
Provide the range of benefits,
you can search, browse,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.670
sort and narrow down the result.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.530
Researchers can search
everything in database or limit

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:52.230
to search to article title
or subject or article query,

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.020
publication date and publisher.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.950
All user can also
browse by author,

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.810
by subject and serial titles.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:07.020
Selected article can be
accessed on site at the library.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.980
Subject search, to search by
subject, you may enter any term

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:19.590
or phrase and choose limit
by search or subject.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:25.480
Alternatively, you may
select browse by subject.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.350
We try the subject
search with women

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.250
and we retrieved a
total 1,262 results.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.790
You can sort by title,
name, date for all searches.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.180
Specially dates, sort will be
really helpful in this case

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.240
at dealing with this
manual research.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.810
Let's open the first
article, [foreign language].

00:20:51.810 --> 00:21:00.120
So this record shows title
in Korean Romanized title,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.580
publication information and
publisher and then citation

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.330
which is this article is

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.670
from [foreign language]
published 1949,

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.640
volume 10, page from 96-99.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.200
From this point, you
can request article

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.160
with this citation information.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.390
Browse Authors.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.880
Since we don't know that many
North Korean authors name,

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.610
browse authors can be
very useful which has

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:38.740
over 21,800 names in Korean
and Romanized Korean form.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:46.400
So we retrieved eight
articles on the name of Kim Il.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.620
Kim Il was the one who
joined arms resistance

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.730
against the Japan
with Kim Il-sung.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.550
Also, you can use
a Boolean operator.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.580
Let's see few examples.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.800
So we are looking for article
with economics as the subject

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.680
and published in 1958.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.060
We retrieved 757 articles.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.060
And this time, we like to
have article only related

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.450
to South Korea.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:20.550
So we enter Economics AND, upper
case AND, and 1958, upper case

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.850
AND [foreign language].

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.600
We got 12 articles.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.830
As you can see, you
can take advantage

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.530
of article advanced search
feature like other databases.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.440
This is very exciting feature
for the North Korean serials

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.860
which was not expected
to do in the past.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.250
Of course, if you have a time,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.680
you can browse all
articles index.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.090
Currently, we have
44,249 articles

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:55.280
because alternative title even
though we made those 34,000

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.890
articles, we have more titles.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.940
Search by publication date.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.090
You can search article from
particular year or years

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:12.150
by entering the years, limit
the search to publication date.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.160
To search for article
in the range of years,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.050
use a square bracket and upper
case TO you can also add the NOT

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.270
in upper case to skip the year.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.050
So for example, I tried to
search the article published

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:32.630
from 1950 to 1953 but not 1952.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:37.990
So I use a square
bracket, 1950, uppercase TO

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:43.800
and then add uppercase
NOT to skip the 1952.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.600
Here are the 244
results from this search.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.200
And again, you can sort
by title, name and date.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.520
Also, you can search [foreign
language] poster painting,

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:05.790
anything you can think of
on the everything option.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.680
So the study of North Korea
is gaining more popular lately

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.080
among scholars and graduate
students, this unique

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.020
and abundant resources

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.490
at the Library will
play a significant role

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.520
in supporting scholarship
in this field.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.260
North Korean's serial
collection is one

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.350
of our popular collections.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.360
So digitization of these
collections is the Library's top

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.790
priority in the future.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.690
If you have any questions
or concern, let me know

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:47.280
or you can send it to me
through the Ask a Librarian.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.660
And then this conclude
my presentation

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.710
but I displayed some
of the books

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.300
and serials from North Korea.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.610
Please take a look
if you have time.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.510
Thank you.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:33.320
[ Applause ]

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.800
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: Thank
you very much for coming here

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.100
and thank you for inviting me.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.700
My talk is going to be a
little different than hers.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.970
I'm not going to talk so
much about the records,

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.610
but more about the procedures
to gain access to the records.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.280
As was mentioned in
the introduction,

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.600
my name is Eric Van Slander.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.340
I work at the National Archives
at College Park, Maryland.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.910
Has anyone been to
the National Archives?

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.300
OK. Good, two people,
three people, good.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.330
Has anyone been to the
National Archives in DC?

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.460
Oh OK, great.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.120
So yes. The records I'm going
to talk about today are held

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.250
in College Park, Maryland.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.830
And what I'm going
to do today is first,

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.630
I'm going to give a
brief introduction on how

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.780
to conduct research with
the National Archives

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.110
in College Park.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.070
Second, I'm going
to talk a little bit

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:29.610
about the captured Korean
records particularly how we got

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.940
them, what they contained,
and how they're arranged,

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.910
again, just very briefly.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.180
And the third thing is a
procedural like about how

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.820
to actually request the
records that interest you.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.360
Now, first of all,
who can access records

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.120
at the National Archives?

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.890
The short answer, anyone.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.910
You don't need to be
an American citizen.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.080
You don't need to
present credentials.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.500
You don't need letters
of recommendations.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.950
The only thing you would
need to do would be to show

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:08.780
up in person either at
our Archives I facility

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.780
or our Archives II facility.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:16.250
And you would do this on a
weekday starting from 8:30 on.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.220
And in order to register,
you would simply have

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.370
to produce a photo ID, meaning
like a driver's license,

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.860
your work ID, school
ID, that kind of thing.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.050
You would then complete
a short form

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.670
where you provide your personal
information, your address,

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.780
telephone and a brief
description

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.050
of your research topic.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.350
The third thing you would do
once you would get there would

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.690
be to view a computer-based
research orientation.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.350
And basically, it's
just telling you how

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.360
to properly use archival
records,

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.740
how to safeguard these
records, the basic rules,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.860
procedures and practices.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.130
Before I go any further, does
anyone know the basic difference

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.880
between an archives
and a library?

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:04.460
OK. The basic difference
is libraries tend

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.900
to keep secondary source
published materials, archives,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.440
for the most part, tend
to have primary documents.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.750
And in the case of
the National Archives,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.180
these are primary documents
produced by US government,

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.980
executive branch
agencies or in the case

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.060
of the captured Korean records,
records that were captured

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.690
by people employed by the
commander-in-chief, meaning,

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.760
the US Army in North Korea.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.640
And after you've done the
research registration process,

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.520
the last thing you do is
sit for your photographs.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.680
So dress up nicely
how we want to be

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.580
and that card is going
to be good for year.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:48.130
There are no fees charged either
for registering as a researcher

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.930
and there are no fees for
the support that people

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.530
like myself was obliged to.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.430
There are staff on
hand when you get there

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.080
but it's not a bad
idea to let us know

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.290
in advance before you come.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.590
At the end of my presentation,

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.730
I'll have my contact
information up.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:07.010
But also at the end, feel free
to stop and ask me for a card,

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.370
I would be more than
happy to help you.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.560
As I said, our research hour--

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.140
room hours are Monday
to Friday, 8:45 to 5:45.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.650
In the past, we had Saturday
hours, but due to budget issues,

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.990
we have eliminated those and
we're open Monday to Friday.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:28.240
If you're in DC, probably
the easiest way to get

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.130
to our facility in College
Park which is right next

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.440
to the University of Maryland is
to take a free shuttle service.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.880
And we have a free
shuttle that runs

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.260
between our Archives I
facility and Archives II.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.080
For those of you who preferred
to drive, we have free parking,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.020
but come early because
parking is a little limited.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:53.630
Unlike some places, we have set
times for requesting records

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.660
at the National Archives
College Park.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.350
There are three requests
times in the morning.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.150
And one request-- and three
requests times in the afternoon.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.980
So keep this in mind as
you're planning a day

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.420
of research at National
Archives.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.330
This change will
probably tell you.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.780
So get there as early
as you can.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.080
Get registered.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.040
And after you submit
your request for records,

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.710
it takes usually about an hour
for you to get your records.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.850
So it can take, you know,
the better part of the half

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.020
of the day to really
get rolling.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.140
And at each request
time, you can request

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.720
up to 16 boxes of records.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.330
And I'll explain that one of
these boxes looks like later.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:35.220
And if you want more
information about going research

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.920
at the National Archives,
there is a link to our website.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.830
And it talks about what
you can bring with you,

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.500
what you can't bring with you
and these types of things.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.170
OK. As I said, my main purpose
in being here is to tell you

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:55.630
about the Record Group 242,
National Archives Collection

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.110
of Foreign Seized Records
from the Korean War.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.530
As you all know,
during the Korean War,

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.570
US forces moved rather quickly
up through the Korean Peninsula

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:10.160
up to the, up to the Yalu River.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.420
During that time, tens
of thousands of pages

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.450
of documents were collected

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.040
at various cities
all along the way.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.220
I think the bulk of what we
have was captured in the Capitol

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.430
in Pyongyang, but there are
also things captured in Seoul

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.200
and elsewhere along the way.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.230
The documents in this large
collection span basically the

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:36.100
period 1921 to 1952 and it
cover numerous subjects.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.890
But most of these
subjects are pertaining

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:42.990
to the Soviet Union
and North Korea.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.010
In a-- these records consists
of a variety of types of things.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.690
Everything from official
correspondence to office files,

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:55.620
personnel files, printed
materials, things like books,

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.030
periodicals, magazines,
newspapers,

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.620
both in various types,
photographs,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.380
propaganda leaflets,
things like that.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.750
OK. The great majority of the
records that were captured are

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.080
in either Russian, or in Korea.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.510
But there are also some
materials in other languages

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:23.920
such as Bulgarian, Chinese,
Japanese, Polish, Hungarian.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.240
Pretty much any type of printed
materials that would have been

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.500
on the Korean Peninsula at that
time could have gotten scooped

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.250
up by UN forces as they
had in North basically.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.360
After these records
were captured,

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.040
the US Army quickly spearheaded
them off the Korean Peninsula

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.650
to Tokyo which is where the
Far East command Military

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.220
Intelligence division was.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.690
So those records were kept.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.940
This again, these tens
of thousands of pages

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.940
of records were kept in Tokyo
for basically spot intelligence,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.190
what was going to be useful
for the actual fighting

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.650
that was going on at
that time in Korea.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:05.820
And after that, they were
shipped by ship from Yokohama

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.190
to Alexandria, Virginia.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.290
And once they arrived
in Alexandria, Virginia,

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:16.290
they were held for a bit longer
for more detailed analysis

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.980
by the Army and other
sort of CIA type agencies

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.220
for any intelligence that
might have been in there.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.830
And then after the
intelligence agency is finish

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.450
with these records, in
1958 they were transferred

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.180
to the National Archives.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.050
Now originally these records
were held at a facility

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:40.030
in Suitland, Maryland because
the building in Archives II

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.380
where I work had not
been constructed in 1958.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.760
In the 1990s when my
building was built,

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.420
those records were
transferred out to us.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.340
The records are hard to use.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.630
Reason for that being
as James will attest is

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:59.410
that they are not
arranged by subject.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.000
They are instead
arranged according

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.270
to the way they were
shipped, OK,

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.410
which makes it quite
challenging.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.340
Now the army which makes things
difficult always attempted

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.460
to impose intellectual
control over the documents

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.820
because you these
tens of thousands

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.340
of pages documented,
what's in them.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.510
A lot of people can't
even read the language.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.260
But, you know, in an
attempt to get control of it,

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.530
they basically set
up these inventories

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.890
where the shipment number

00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:36.690
or shipment advice would
have been indicated.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.940
The original box number which
would have been like a big sort

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.870
of footlocker type box and
then the documents were simply

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.970
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
that kind of thing, OK.

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:55.410
And that's how the
documents are arranged.

00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:59.380
These inventories that the army
created were later microfilmed

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.850
and actually came to
us with the records.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.320
OK. So these badly
arranged records,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.760
how do you request them?

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.150
You don't just want to
randomly start with box one

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.340
and start looking, not
a good use of your time.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.640
You're all very busy people.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.500
I know that.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:23.430
The-- what you do, step one
is you come to College Park

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.940
and you go to the fourth floor

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.880
which is the microfilm
research room.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.180
And that is where you will gain
access to the microfilm copies

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:37.160
of the shipping list that
the army had composed.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.240
The microfilm publications

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.580
at the National Archives all
have numbers assigned to them.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.150
In this case, it's
microfilm publication M1950

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.890
and has a really sexy title,
"Shipping Advice Lists

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.030
for Record Seized by US Military
Forces During the Korean War,

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.670
1950, 54", so.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:36:00.030
But that's the firsts step to
getting access to the records.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.180
OK. What I've done there in--

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.960
nice and green for you to
look at, this is a screen shot

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.890
from one of the microfilm lists.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:13.260
And what I've done, I've circled
in red the important information

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.710
which allows you to
request the document

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.380
that you would like to see.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.550
As you can see, the
shipping advice number

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.920
in this case is 2005.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.010
That is the shipment number.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:30.370
And then box one of the shipment
in box in item one within there.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.830
And you can see that it
has information in English

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.220
about what the documents
being described are.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.500
And just for the-- keeping it
simple, I circled the first one.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:47.750
And this is a printed book,
a 486 page document in Korean

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.190
as you can see at the top that
was captured in Pyongyang.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.380
Now, if you actually were
interested in that book,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:05.480
then the next step would be--
OK, there are two ways to do it.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.240
And unfortunately, the National
Archives Catalog is nowhere

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.870
nearly as nice and
well-organized, this Library

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.640
of Congress, full disclosure.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.800
But hopefully, the
link will work.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.720
What I've done is
found the catalog entry

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.720
for the records being described

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.670
in the microfilm
I just showed you.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.050
As you can, yes, Korean language
publication, records captured

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.960
at Pyongyang, record group 242.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:37.310
And then this is a long
list of sort of the records

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.650
in this collection of records.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.410
OK. Now, this information
basically comes

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.320
from the microfilm which I just
showed you a shut of earlier.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.740
Now, since you know
the number, you know,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.820
the shipping advice gets us
into this particular entry

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.510
and we know that it's
box one, item one.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:01.640
So if you scroll way down
to the bottom of the page,

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.120
you see list strings of boxes.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:10.060
OK. See right here, the SA
number is the first thing.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.690
And box one, item
one is going to be

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.750
in container or box number 36.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.470
So this is how we would then
take it to the next step

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.850
and order the records.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.870
I will show you how
to do that shortly.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:27.120
And full disclosure, please
contact this before you try

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.420
to do this on your own.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.260
This is not an easy thing to do.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.560
OK. All right.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.670
So I'll try to make
it easy though.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:39.000
So now that you know the record
group number, the entry number

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.520
and not the original box that
were shipped from Korea number

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.900
but the box that NARA keeps
the records in box 36,

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.140
we can take it t the next step.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.180
And also in addition to the
National Archives catalog,

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.770
there are actually
for use of researchers

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:59.590
to Korean language secondary
source reference books done

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.840
by Korean scholars
that also help you

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.850
to gain access to the records.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.400
It's not for everything, but
they've selectively gone through

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.240
and sort of thematically
in certain subjects.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.890
So that's also a
good thing to use.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.190
I think James when
you were there,

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.490
did you have a chance to use--

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:15.790
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: Yeah.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.090
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: And
that's, that's a good--

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.950
And again, that's a
National Archives product,

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:22.390
that's a product done
by Korean scholars.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:36.440
I think I lost my-- I'm back.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:43.230
OK. OK. So now that we know
the original information,

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.100
the current information
in terms of the box entry,

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.060
the next step is to fill
out a reference service slip

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.200
or a pull slip as it's called.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.940
And that is something that
would have information we saw

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.850
on the previous page.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.520
And this is something
unfortunately,

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.000
unlike some places that
must be done in person

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.620
at the National Archives.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.350
This is not something you
can do prior to going,

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.280
you need to do it in person.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.950
And then once you fill out this
slip with our expert guidance,

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.720
then you submit that slip
to one of the staff members,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.620
not at the microfilm section but
downstair on the second floor

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.130
where you would actually
request your records.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.910
Now this is what a
reference service

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.370
or pull slip would look like.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:32.590
The stuff I circled in red is
the information we've gleamed

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.980
from the catalogue page a
couple of pages earlier.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.990
So again, this is something
your first time there,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:41.220
don't worry we're not going
to let you on your own.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.720
We will help you to do this

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.630
and request the records
that you would see.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:52.930
OK. And at the end of this long
laborious process, hopefully,

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.800
yes, you will have a box, OK.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.020
At the National Archives,
you are--

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.120
even if you're only after
one document or one file

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.190
or one book, you are
requesting the entire box.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.200
And this is an actual box,

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.220
I went into the stock areas the
other day and took a picture

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.900
and this tells you that, yes,
this box contains record of 242,

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.780
the entry and the series of
the shipping advice numbers.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:30.310
So, one of these boxes contains
approximately a thousand pages.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.560
Again, you don't have
to look at everything,

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.700
you're more than welcome
to browse but, you know,

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.990
it is a pretty time
consuming thing.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:45.850
And as I said previously, it
takes about an hour for your one

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:50.130
or 16 boxes, however,
many you choose to order.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.270
OK. Now, you have your boxes,

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.730
you found your documents,
what next?

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:58.650
The next thing you can do, we
have self service photocopiers

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.710
which are also scanners.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:04.240
You can either make photocopies
of the records, 25 cents a page.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.770
Your research required
functions as a debit card.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.590
You can deposit money
in that way.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.270
If you bring your own USB drive,
you can plug it into our machine

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.800
but we'll still charge
you 25 cents to scan.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.740
I don't make these rules but the
most popular option these days

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.480
are for people to bring
either their smartphone

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.950
or digital camera and you
can actually take pictures

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:27.740
of the records.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.290
If you are taking a lot of
pictures, we can provide you

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:32.890
with the camera stands
so you can click,

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.190
click, click, click away.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.490
That's something-- It's free
as long as it's non-flash.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.750
You can bring a flatbed
scanner, some people like that

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.880
to get really nice flat images.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.880
As long as it's sort
of pre-approved,

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.420
you can bring the
flatbed scanner.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.260
But the link in how
to conduct research,

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.750
that will tell you what you
can and what you can't bring.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.980
If you're unsure, let us know.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.280
We'll say yes or no.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.590
But basically, any
flatbed scanner

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:01.630
that does not have a
feeder on it is accepted.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.920
If you're running out
of time and you want us

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.300
to make copies for
you, we'll do it.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.620
Eighty cents a page, not cheap.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.440
Very few people do this often.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.570
And this is our break
even number, by the way,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.340
we don't make a profit.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.560
The next thing that people
actually do a little bit more

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.440
and if you go on to our website,
there are lists of researchers

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.330
for hire and they
will do research.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:29.690
They're not in our employees.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:32.970
These are private people who
just list their information

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.330
on here and you can
reach out to them.

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.280
Tell them what you're
trying to do

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.140
and then negotiate a
price, price of thing.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:47.340
So that's the other
option that you can take.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.750
OK. That's basically what I--

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.790
yes and now it's
time for question.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.590
Yes?

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:58.020
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.630
Yeah. Thank you for
bringing that up.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.790
Actually I mentioned--
I'm about to mention that.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:07.810
OK. On day one, you get there,
you start using your records.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.680
5:45 is fast approaching,
they're flickering the lights.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.080
OK. Yes, you can save
records until the next day.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.380
Actually you can save--

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.010
you don't even have to
comeback the next day.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.950
You can save them for
three days or even five

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.280
if you plead your case and say,

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.310
I really need five
days, type of a thing.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.260
Yeah. So, you can definitely--

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.720
You don't have to rush
and finish on that day.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.520
OK. Yes?

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:38.260
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:42.320
Oh, yes. Unless you have
problems with the North Koreans

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.410
and their copyright
laws, I don't know.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.990
No, I mean-- only half jokingly.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:49.960
Most of what we have

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.420
at the National Archives
has no copyright researches.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.310
If there is a question, if it
was a secondary source that was

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:00.010
in something was
captured, it's basically

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:01.420
up to you to work that out.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.620
But you don't need
permission from us.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.410
The only thing we ask if you're
going to publish an image

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.970
of the document or something
else, photograph, whatever,

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.320
give a good citation because--

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.960
you know, which record group
it comes from, which entry,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.990
which box because we have no
ability to go in and search

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.690
at the document or records.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.680
So that's like on a daily basis,
we get emails with like a scan

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.110
of a document saying I want
a copy of the rest of this.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.410
Where is it?

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:32.740
And we really, really, have
a hard time tracking that.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.150
So yeah, the short answer
is there are no restrictions

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.640
but please cite the document in
terms of-- and on our website,

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.400
there's also sort
of a format on how

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.600
to properly sort our documents
and that kind of thing.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.280
So, OK. I know we have
a Q&amp;A period at the end,

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.650
so if you have other
questions, please feel free.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.510
Thank you.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:46:08.130
[ Applause ]

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.430
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: All right.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.990
Well good afternoon everyone.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:18.840
I'm James Person, NCNK
member and faculty

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.600
at Johns Hopkins SAIS
here in Washington

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.030
where I teach the
Korean Studies classes.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:32.860
I am, today, going to
talk about materials

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.970
from other countries
about North Korea.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:40.920
You've heard about materials
of the North Koreans produce,

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:47.630
periodicals and primary
source documents but there--

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:54.360
while this provide great front
door access to North Korea

00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:00.780
to learning about-- and Sonya
gave some examples of things

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.640
to learn about North
Korean society,

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:08.290
about North Korean
culture, history, politics.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:13.060
We also have great backdoor
access to North Korea

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:18.180
through materials that
were produces by embassies

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:23.430
in Pyongyang, the North Korean
capital throughout the Cold

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.730
War era.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:29.260
For about a decade, I oversaw--
a little over a decade,

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:35.440
I oversaw a project at Woodrow
Wilson Center that went into--

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.650
systematically went
into the archives

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.670
of North Korea's
former communist allies.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:43.930
So some of the countries
that we were in were--

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.390
we were in the Russian
archives, Chinese,

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:50.530
the East German archives,
Polish, Hungarian, Bulgarian,

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:56.940
Mongolian, Czech archives
gathering materials that, again,

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:02.190
are produced in--
largely in North Korea

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:05.160
and then dispatched back
to Foreign Ministries.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:12.890
You have among these materials,
records of conversations

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:18.260
between North Korean officials
and they're interlocutors

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:24.740
in North Korea including
for example, the ambassadors

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.770
and also you have working
level diplomats meeting

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.070
with North Korean officials.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.160
So you have all, you know, many
different levels of meetings.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:37.460
You have very high level
meetings between say Kim Il-sung

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.490
and the Soviet Ambassador.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.150
And then you have-- I
never see councilor meeting

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:48.640
with somebody talking about the
quality of concrete being used

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:54.030
to form the foundation
of the newly built annex

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:59.100
to the Soviet Embassy,
something along those lines.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.680
So you have many
levels of talks.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.250
And records are kept for
all of these meetings.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:12.300
You also have these diplomatic
cables that are being produced

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.310
in the embassies by
diplomats who are there

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:19.300
to really observe what's going
on in the country and then

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.940
to report about this and send
these detailed cables back

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:29.230
to their embassies describing
development in the country,

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:35.750
developments in their, yeah, in
North Korea's domestic situation

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:43.660
and as well as North Korea's
relations with their allies.

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:50.130
These are just the few-- I--
some documents I have sitting

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:55.080
on the house last night that
I snapped pictures of you have

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.080
for example a-- these are
soviet records from 1954.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:04.010
You have for example a record of
conversation with the Ambassador

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.120
of North Korea or the
North Korean Ambassador

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.480
to the Soviet Union, a
guy called [inaudible].

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:16.130
And then you have a
soviet report on classes

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.680
and class warfare in the DPRK.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:26.030
These are-- as you can--
well, this conversation here

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:31.750
with the Soviet or the
North Korean Ambassador

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:39.110
to Moscow should add
that we also have records

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.540
of conversations that took
place in other countries, so--

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.570
that involved North
Korean officials.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.660
So it's not just the
conversations that occurred

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:52.170
in North Korea but for
example when a meeting occurred

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.180
with the North Korean
Ambassador in Moscow,

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.680
you would have a record of that.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.940
If a delegation from
North Korea,

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.160
we travel to other countries,

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.350
then you'd also have
the full records

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:06.070
of those meetings included
in the files from the--

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:12.450
the files on North Korea
from these archives.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:19.330
Some of the things we can
learn about North Korea

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.300
from these materials are--

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.330
we can learn a lot about North
Korea's foreign relations,

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:27.290
a lot about their
domestic politics,

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:33.580
about economic policies,
military developments and a lot

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.680
about North Korean society.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.350
There were some limitations as
many of you I'm sure are aware.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.630
The North Koreans were
not always open even

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:44.930
to their allies.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.330
And there were times when
the North Koreans were

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:50.980
in conflict with their allies.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:56.240
So, for example, on the
early 1960s, the relationship

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:02.320
between Moscow and Pyongyang
soured, and that meant also

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.060
that the relationship between
Pyongyang and most other central

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.790
and eastern European allies
that were closely allied

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:16.780
with the Soviets
also were not good.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.270
So in times like this, you know,

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:22.730
the quality of reporting
could sometimes suffer

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:24.850
but these diplomats
that were based

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:27.050
in North Korea were
actually quite skilled

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:31.390
at gathering information and
would often compared notes.

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:35.420
And one former East
German Ambassador

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.720
to North Korea described it as
really picking up pebbles here

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.880
and there and then assembling
a mosaic by, you know,

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:44.280
getting together with, you
know, your friends and,

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.050
you know, comparing notes.

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:50.910
And you often find among
the records converse--

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:55.780
records of conversations
between other diplomats

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.120
that are stationed
in North Korea.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.540
So for example, you
may have a large group.

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:06.210
You have regular meetings that
occurred between East German,

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:10.120
Russian, Czech, diplomats where
they would really share notes

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:17.770
on what they were experiencing
in the country and tried

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:22.880
to develop a better sense of
developments in the country.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:28.380
And this is especially
helpful when the materials

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.370
that the North Koreans
themselves produced don't really

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:36.470
provide or send a lot
of light on developments

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:42.270
and political conflict for
example, say 1956 or 1967,

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:44.910
these are periods
of them working on.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.960
You don't have a lot of
information about other

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.090
than these reports that
denounce the activities

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:55.150
of these individuals who
are eventually purged.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:58.120
Well we get a better sense by
looking at the conversations

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.520
that these diplomats are
having and then their--

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.650
the cables that they're
producing,

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:08.980
what was actually going on and
what issue is-- were at stake.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:15.450
Was it simply as the standard
narrative, a factional struggle

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:18.930
or were there principled
policy positions at stake.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:22.850
These are things that we can
begin to understand by looking

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.700
at some of these materials.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:31.220
So it's a lot of use to
them for the historian.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:35.790
They-- Really these materials
force us to step back

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:37.730
and ask some basic questions,

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:42.150
basically epistemological
questions about how knowledge

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.370
about North Korea
was-- has been produced

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:47.300
and how we know what
we think we know.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.990
And I'm using these to
really challenge a lot

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:54.320
of things we thought we knew
about North Korean history.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.540
Things-- I mean is--
I mentioned factions.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:06.300
I mean this notion that you
had after the Korean war,

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:10.580
this intense factional rivalry,
we had-- you had Soviet faction,

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.860
and Chinese faction the
Kim Il-sung's group.

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.110
And Kim Il-sung skillfully
played these factions off one

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.900
another until his
power was unassailable.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.670
This is the standard narrative.

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:23.230
What we see if you really
interrogate these materials

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.690
though is that it
wasn't so simple.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:29.580
You had, in fact, principled
policy positions at stake.

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:35.710
And this, these positions seem
to be the issue of contention

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:38.080
and not so much the
revolutionary background

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.380
of the individuals.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:41.040
It was much more complex.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.550
You have internationalism
versus nationalism.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:50.530
You have issues of the
culture personality

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.250
versus collective leadership.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:59.300
You have the consumer economy
versus the industrial economy.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.000
And these, again, are the issues

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.490
that are really driving
political developments

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:09.070
after the Korean War not just
this notion of, you know,

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:11.500
endemic factionalism in
the Korean workers party

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.310
that we all know today.

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:16.230
So, a lot have used
these materials

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:18.890
to really getting a
better understanding

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:20.910
of North Korean history

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:24.380
and rethinking what
we believe we know

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.140
about North Korean history.

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:30.900
But they-- These materials
also help us understand North

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.370
Korea today.

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:35.190
But before I get into
that, let me just briefly--

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:39.830
can I go into where
you can get access

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.130
to a lot of these materials?

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:44.840
Well, as I said, for a
decade, I ran the project

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.010
at the Wilson Center that
gathered these materials.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:51.500
One thing I'm quite proud

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.090
of is something I develop
called the Modern Korean History

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.120
Portal, which provides
multiple points

00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.650
of access to the documents.

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:01.470
And you just go and
then Google and type

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:03.390
in Modern Korean History Portal.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:06.040
And you have, you
know, your timeline

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:13.310
which just features different
developments in Korean history.

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:16.140
And you can actually get
direct access to some

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.440
of the relevant documents.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.240
So, for example, you
know, here's, you know,

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.100
something from September 6,
1945, you have a Soviet report

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:30.350
on communism in Korea
from that period

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:32.720
that is directly
relevant connected

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.910
to the issue discussed there.

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:40.980
You also have featured
resources including essays.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.400
It's not Wikipedia.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.480
We're not just letting anyone
write this, but we've--

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.800
you know, when-- actually
commissioned essays

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.490
from professional
scholars of Korean history.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:58:02.790
You also had biographies of key
figures in North Korean history.

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:06.990
And then you have curated
collections of documents.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:10.350
And just, you know, just
click on conversations

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:12.690
with Kim Il-sung,
you have hundreds

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.570
and hundreds of conversations.

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.670
These records or memorandum
conversations that I was talking

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:20.640
about with Kim Il-sung going

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:27.010
from 1949 all the way
through, you see here, 1988.

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:33.630
It's really spanning this
guy's lifetime in leadership.

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:37.130
So a great resource.

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:40.290
I encourage you all to
access it again to work

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:44.800
with these materials really
challenge your thinking

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.850
about North Korean history.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:49.850
But, there's also have
use to these materials

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:52.540
and really understanding
North Korea today.

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.410
And this requires, you know,
sort of a longer term, you know,

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:01.020
work with these documents
across, you know,

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:08.080
larger or a broader
period of time.

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.480
These materials they
also really achieve--

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:17.500
they really challenge received
wisdom on North Korea today.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:22.440
They-- And if you do apply a
broader historical sensibility

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:26.410
then you can really begin to
identify, you know, patterns

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:29.590
and really more accurately
interpret

00:59:29.590 --> 00:59:31.650
contemporary developments.

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:37.230
Let me just look at two
areas where I try to do this.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:40.180
So, one thing that's emerged
from these documents, again,

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.630
if you-- when you really
interrogate the materials is

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:47.670
that we can challenge this idea
that China and North Korean are

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:50.250
as close as lips and teeth
as the expression goes.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:51.860
This expression is
suggesting, of course,

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.810
the level of intimacy
among two states.

00:59:55.810 --> 01:00:01.310
And that Beijing today
wields enormous influence

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.030
over Pyongyang.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.360
What you can see
from the materials

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.790
and then I encourage you to
look through these conversations

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:10.750
with Kim Il-sung in particular,
you can see that, well,

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:15.800
this may not be the case that in
fact there is a profound sense

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.280
of mistrust in the relationship,
really going both ways.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.150
But for the North Koreans,

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:25.590
one can see from the
conversations not just

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.020
with Kim Il-sung but with
many other I mentioned

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.290
that you have conversations
at various levels.

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:33.300
At all levels, you see people,

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.820
North Korean officials
describing this profound sense

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:43.450
of mistrust toward Beijing, this
sense that China is, at times,

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:46.220
overly interventionist
and not respectful

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.000
of Korean sovereignty.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.650
And what's fascinating is
to look at conversations

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:52.680
with Kim Il-sung and to see how

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:57.170
over the years the list
of grievances grows.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:00.570
So, in 1955, you
see him complaining

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:06.890
about the actions
of, for example,

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:10.950
[inaudible] during the Korean
War that person who was

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:13.890
in charge with the Chinese
people's volunteers.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:17.640
His arrogance and
dealing with Kim Il-sung

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.170
and he also blames
[inaudible] for decisions--

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:26.160
battlefield decisions that
Kim felt ultimately caused

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.460
him victory.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.360
A couple years later,
you see him adding on to

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.950
that list describing events
in 1956 where the Chinese

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.280
and the soviets directly
meddled in,

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.650
you know, in a party conflict.

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.310
You see then this list
growing and growing

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:47.610
and growing over the years.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:50.170
So you have the cultural
revolutions.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.540
You have eventually
even the criticism

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.170
of Kim Jong-Il's succession.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:04.690
But it mixed clear that there
is a profound sense of mistrust.

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:08.410
And this really forces us to
question this understanding

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:11.610
that we have today that,
you know, basically the road

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:14.820
to Pyongyang starts in Beijing
and that we really need--

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.310
And then China, you know,

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:21.490
again wields enormous political
influence over North Korea.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:26.430
Clearly, yes, they wield
enormous material leverage

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:31.390
but what we can learn from-- you
know, by through the application

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:35.220
of a broader historical
sensibility using these

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.910
documents, we can understand

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.690
that China does not
have the ability

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.740
to act will exercise
political influence

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.280
because of this really
tortured history.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.480
Another area where--
again, we all--

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.280
you know, again the
received wisdom is

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.870
that the North Koreans
skillfully played the Soviets

01:02:55.870 --> 01:03:00.430
and the Chinese off one
another throughout the Cold War

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:01.730
that there were these--

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:04.270
you know, Kim Il-sung was
this master manipulator.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:07.220
And he was able to
extract maximum concessions

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.220
from the soviets
and the Chinese.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:14.330
This I actually think is an
extension of this understanding

01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:16.390
that we have about
factional rivalry

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:18.550
within the Korean workers party

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:21.780
where Kim skillfully played the
rival factions off one another

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.210
until his power was
unassailable.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.660
And this, I would say, goes back

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:29.100
to Japanese colonial
era propaganda

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.550
of this essentialist narrative
of endemic factionalism.

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:37.180
But Kim Il-sung certainly
uses this

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:41.890
and labels his rivals
as factions.

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:48.040
But we have this
understanding that Kim was able

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.920
to play others off one
another and, again,

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.870
extract maximum concessions.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:56.080
But when you really look at
when you break down the--

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.810
you know, if you look--
really examine his--

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:06.190
the relationship between the
soviets and the North Koreans

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:09.990
and the Chinese and the
north Koreans over the years,

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:14.910
you see that North Korea never
really has sufficient leverage

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:20.290
over either Moscow or Beijing to
really extract these concessions

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:21.590
that we all think that they got.

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:25.770
And in fact what they did
receive was often stuff

01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:28.820
that the soviets themselves were
no longer even using or things

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.770
that the-- or the
Chinese couldn't--

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:33.650
weren't actually producing
things that were helpful

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:37.750
to the North Koreans or
at least at the level

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:41.200
that the North Koreans
had hoped.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.400
Moreover when relations
were poor with the soviets,

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:51.150
for example, from '62 to
'64, it's a very short period

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:53.330
of time, they were so poor

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.540
that the North Koreans
had really no choice

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:59.070
but to move closer to
the Chinese, otherwise,

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.490
they would have been
completely isolated.

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:04.720
Likewise when relations
report with the Chinese,

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.800
this is during the culture
evolution, they were so poor.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.780
I mean to the point where you
had armed clashes on the border.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.050
You know, Chinese
troops marching

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:17.850
into North Korean territory.

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:21.210
Then, you know, North Korea
really didn't have any choice

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:24.340
but to warm up to the Soviets.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.200
Again, they would have been
completely isolated had

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.510
they not.

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:32.230
The North Koreans were more
reactive than they were,

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.630
you know, the master
manipulators, you know,

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:39.540
sort of juggling all
these balls at one time.

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:43.170
And indeed by the '70s, by--

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:46.640
as the more extreme faces of the
Cultural Revolution subsided,

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.510
the North Koreans took
steps to really reduce

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:54.600
to the extent possible, the
influence of both Beijing

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.720
and Moscow on a trajectory
of political economic

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.060
and cultural developments.

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.740
This is something they
started early but really tried

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:05.690
to make the country
impervious to these influences

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:10.440
and maintains a policy of
equidistance, you know,

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.550
keeping both Moscow and
Beijing at arms length.

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:19.920
So we really need to
rethink this notion and then

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.260
by extension really try to,
you know, look at the ability

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.270
of north Korea today to
do what many believed

01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:33.370
and playing Beijing and
Washington off one another.

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:37.140
Is it rather trying-- you
know, by this frequent,

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.490
with this frequent
trips to Beijing as he--

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.230
or to try new other not just
the Beijing but as Kim Jong-un,

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:46.270
again, trying to play the US
and Washington off one another

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:50.410
or is he-- or the Chinese
and the US off one another

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:54.920
or is he trying to make sure he
has all of his flanks covered.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:59.350
So much to be learned
from these materials

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:03.600
to better understand North
Korean history and, again,

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.020
through the application of
a historical sensibility to,

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.990
you know, better
understand developments,

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:10.300
contemporary developments

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.460
to better frame contemporary
developments.

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:18.820
Happy to take questions or
during the Q&amp;A to talk more

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.050
about the documents and to
point you in certain directions

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:24.490
if you-- you know,
on your research

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:25.920
with some of these documents.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.720
Thank you.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:39.980
[ Applause ]

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.250
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: I like to thank
our three speakers for that--

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.400
their excellent presentations.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:49.720
I think that North Korea's often
misrepresented in the media

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.710
as something of a black box

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.790
where there's no
information that gets out.

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:57.850
I think these people on this
room know that's clearly not

01:07:57.850 --> 01:07:59.150
the case.

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:01.540
But getting access
to that information

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:06.030
on North Korea can sometimes
be a black box for scholars

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:07.330
who are starting out trying

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:11.050
to navigate the resources
that are available.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:12.350
So I think it's really helpful

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:15.550
that we've got our three
speakers today giving some very

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:20.490
practical advice to people
trying to start doing research

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:23.330
on North Korea using these
different collections.

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:26.620
And with that, I'd like
to open it up to question

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:27.920
and answers from the audience.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.770
And do we have microphone
for the audience?

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:35.620
No? I'll just reiterate
the questions with that.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.920
OK.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.220
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: Yeah.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.520
They won't be captured.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.820
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: Yeah.

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.120
They won't be captured
on the recording.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.170
So, I'll just summarize
the questions.

01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:46.970
Yeah?

01:08:46.970 --> 01:09:01.030
[ Inaudible ]

01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:03.400
So, for people with
limited language skills,

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.830
how difficult is it to use
these different resources?

01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:08.590
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: You go.

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:09.890
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: Well--

01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:15.820
So, for the materials from
former communist bloc archives,

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:20.090
a portion of those have been
translated into English.

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:23.090
And that's what you
see available

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.760
on this Modern Korean
History Portal.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.220
But for every one
document, there are dozens,

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.960
dozens more that
are untranslated.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:41.980
And it is-- that's one of the
problems is that getting access

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.190
to this without the
languages, you know,

01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:47.490
is going to be hindrance
especially

01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:50.160
with the Korean language
materials.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:56.810
I mean the index, the
serial index, you would need

01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:00.110
to have Korean to
know what it is

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:02.570
because there's no translation

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:06.640
of the articles titles,
for example.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.720
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: Actually,

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.830
I can show you one data
of this [inaudible].

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:19.650
This is in the same thing
with the article index but--

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:29.890
-- if you go Asian Reading Room
homepage pretty much what you--

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:34.560
what I told you CDR database
North Korean CDR Database you

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.860
see here.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.450
But then the one we have--

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:44.970
sorry, I mean it's really
my eyeglasses is not good.

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:48.940
So there's Korean
bibliography you see in there.

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:56.590
[ Inaudible ]

01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:01.560
Yes, yes. So, this is the
one covered until 1995,

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.980
English material on Korea.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:08.120
So, actually, I played out
all these, topical term index,

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.410
which is from the
table of content.

01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:12.620
So rather than dealing
with the subject,

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.590
you can pull it related books.

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:17.910
Find the books easily.

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.210
So this is arranged.

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:21.670
So this is English material.

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:27.620
We-- if we go like Kim
Il-sung, for example--

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:31.480
So this should be
between here, right?

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.700
So this is the one you can find
written by him or about him.

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:40.330
And then if you go
any of their article--

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:44.790
the record and you can
go from on and on here.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.540
You know, you can go
by subject or by author

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.660
or if you click the
term, extra term

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.180
and you can go further
from there.

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:57.950
So, this is the one way you
can search the English material

01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:59.490
if you need it from Korea.

01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:02.890
This is also primary
record too but in Korean.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:06.480
I mean the-- about North Korea.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:17.210
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: As, I
showed in one of my slides

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:21.450
at least the inventory to
the record is in English.

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:25.350
Although it's very
laborious to go through it,

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:29.510
you can at least identify things
that are potentially relevant

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:32.460
and then maybe get
some help, you know,

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.530
to actually translate what
you found, another thing

01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:40.430
which is actually separate from
the captured Korean records.

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:43.950
We do have very extensive
military intelligence reporting

01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:46.640
and these are compiled
reports done

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.460
by US military intelligence
people during the Korean War

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.130
period and shortly thereafter
using Korean language sources

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:57.950
and sort of summarizing
them in English

01:12:57.950 --> 01:13:02.670
for dissemination amongst
Americans who don't read Korean.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.920
So that's another possibility.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.760
So, for example, within the
Far East command records,

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.750
you will have these types
of things within the records

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:16.500
of the Eighth Army, which was
the army that still in Korea.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.680
You'll find that kind of thing.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.480
In some cases where
North Koreans

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.040
or Chinese soldiers
were captured,

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.530
the interrogations will
sometimes be summarized.

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.810
So these are ways
where you can--

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:33.860
even if your Korean is
not perfect, you know,

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.570
you could potentially
still do research

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:37.110
at the National Archives.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:40.520
But the time is always
the challenge

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:45.170
because as I said before, it's
the-- it's really hard to go in

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:48.380
and find the specific documents.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:52.120
But, there are ways to sort
of get around, you know,

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.050
your lack of language skills.

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:56.450
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: And to be
sure, if you are doing more

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:59.020
of it, you know, if you're
looking more at a political,

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:02.630
you know, diplomatic
developments,

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:07.980
US intelligence reports
are pretty good.

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.430
Not perhaps as good as
some of the, you know,

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:18.120
the Eastern Bloc materials and
they're present in North Korea

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.450
and reporting on what
they're observing,

01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:26.200
but we had our way
of finding out.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.560
And you should also note, the
British records are always

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.120
and that they're
very good resource.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.980
The British National Archives,
which I have to say, I'm sorry,

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.560
a little easier to navigate.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.400
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander:
It means job security.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.280
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: And to follow
up on that question for some

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.340
of the older North
Korean records, those,

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:55.510
especially from the
1940s and '50s,

01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:59.610
how much hanja are Koreanized
Chinese characters you need

01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:02.750
to know to be able to read
some of these records compared

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:07.710
to more contemporary
Korean documents?

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.110
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: Library Congress
collection not the many

01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:11.800
Chinese characters.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.330
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: The North
Koreans actually eliminated

01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:16.960
hanja pretty early-- the you
know the Chinese characters

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:24.530
pretty early on, you know trying
to eliminate you know, you know,

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:28.860
again, cultural influences
from China.

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.990
I mean certainly by--

01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:33.560
I mean while you look
at South Korean records

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.350
and you see Park Chung-hee
using-- I mean, you know,

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:41.530
you look at a document and it
could be almost 50% in hanja,

01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:44.140
North Korean records by--

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.310
I mean, really by the
early '50s are almost--

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.610
it's completely gone.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.930
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: With the
caption records, of course,

01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:55.090
depending on the
vintage of the records.

01:15:55.090 --> 01:16:00.300
So the earlier stuff would have
more hanja than the later stuff.

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.180
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: Ester?

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:22.770
[ Inaudible ]

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:24.280
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: Sure.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.960
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: Yeah, that's
just for the recording,

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.440
to understand the current
condition of the documents,

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.530
the National Archives
and digitization.

01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:33.680
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: Well,
the physical condition of some

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.870
of the documents is quite
good-- are quite good.

01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:39.290
Some on them because of--
for example, if it was very,

01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:42.770
very poor quality newsprint or
things like that, probably not

01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:48.150
as good, to my knowledge
there is no project

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:51.530
to digitize these
records at the time.

01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:56.150
I do know that there
are-- on a daily basis,

01:16:56.150 --> 01:17:01.750
Korean researchers
they're digitizing records.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.600
They're not sort of teamed
up with the National Archives

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:11.050
to share those images with us,
but they are going somewhere.

01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:12.350
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: They
[inaudible] Korea.

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:13.650
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: Exactly.

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:17.630
I know for example the National
Library of Korea has people

01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.750
who come and digitize things.

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:22.650
The National Institute of
Korean History has people who've

01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:23.950
digitized things.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:27.280
So there are sort of
non-National Archives efforts

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.710
out there to digitize things,
particularly since they are

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:32.540
so difficult to navigate.

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.420
But at this point,
yeah, we don't have--

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.900
I mean in actuality,
we have very,

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.670
very few of our records
digitized.

01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:44.400
And the main reason for that
being is just the resources

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.360
required to do that, because
things that are not digitized,

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.780
you know, the process

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:54.460
of digitizing them is
just so labor intensive.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:59.060
And once the records are
digitized then, of course,

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.840
they're only as good as the
metadata attached to them.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.100
So how searchable would
they be and if they're

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.010
in foreign languages, you know,

01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:08.700
typical OCR technology
probably doesn't work

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.950
on a hand written Korean letter.

01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:12.250
These types of things.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.380
There are certain
challenges, I think, to that.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.300
But yeah, I wish, you know,

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.400
tomorrow that we would
be able to do that.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.280
But I know there has been
interest in digitizing

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.980
at least portions of
them, but at this point,

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.700
yeah, we're not there yet.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.630
Yeah.

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.440
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: If I
can just add, Eric mentioned

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.540
that National Institute of
Korean History [inaudible],

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:42.950
they actually have
published dozens of volumes

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:46.240
of curated collections
from the--

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.540
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: And one

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.540
of the Korean language
volumes not--

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:55.330
nor are produced was
produced by them, so yeah.

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.130
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: Paulie
[assumed spelling]?

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:37.320
[ Inaudible ]

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.600
So what's the role
for policymakers?

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.900
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: You answer.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.220
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: No,
I don't have an answer.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.450
I've been-- This is
something I've been struggling

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:48.460
with for years now, for
over a decade, you know,

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.320
trying to make these materials--
trying to get these materials

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.230
into the hands of the
people who, you know,

01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:56.950
need a better understand,
for example, the relationship

01:19:56.950 --> 01:20:00.940
between China and North Korea,
you know, so what I would,

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:06.350
and not every historian is going
to be willing to do this, but,

01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:14.190
you know, I would actually
take excepts from three--

01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:17.150
for example on sign
of DPRK relations.

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:20.770
There are three documents that
I would refer to, you know.

01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:23.490
One is 73 conversation between
Kim Il-sung and [inaudible].

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:30.650
In 1977, East German
cable on the relationship

01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:34.560
and 1986 between--
conversation between Kim Il-sung

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.020
and a Mongolian official.

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:40.260
The conversation with
[inaudible] is 13 pages.

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:43.580
I know that people in the policy
community would not waste their

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:48.590
time reading 13 pages
even though I think it's--

01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:50.650
they would learn much from it.

01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.210
So, you know, just kind

01:20:52.210 --> 01:20:54.300
of extract the most
important parts of it.

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:59.280
And, you know, you cannot put
them in a brief report and try

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.550
to get that in their hands.

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:06.450
I've had the opportunity to
brief people just, you know,

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:09.060
across the street
here, members of--

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:12.930
it's actually senators
and member of the house.

01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:17.490
And I don't know that they
actually look at them,

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:22.160
they'll listen to me as I'm
describing the contents, but,

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.870
you know, I don't know if they
take the time to read the two

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:26.740
or three page summary
and, you know,

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:31.270
extracts or excerpts rather.

01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:34.470
But, you know, there's so
much that you could do.

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:39.640
You know, you can't compile
all of these rich, you know,

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.620
materials and do a
two-paragraph summary.

01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:49.140
I mean you can, but, you know,
as a historian, of course,

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:53.110
I tend toward, you know,
I want to, you know,

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:55.050
give the full context, you know.

01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:57.590
So there are challenges and--

01:21:57.590 --> 01:22:01.640
but, you know, certainly
the material is there.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.940
There are efforts to, you
know, curate collections

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:09.580
to make it more accessible to--

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:13.780
you know, and then to
compile these forts,

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:19.810
but one thing I find with North
Korea is that people are just--

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:23.890
you know, you have your
fixed ideas and, you know,

01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:28.720
no matter how many documents
I waive in front of your face,

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.930
you're not going to
change your mind.

01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:34.600
That's something that's
frustrating us, you know,

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.950
as a historian who's been
setting the country for,

01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:41.010
you know, a long time now, and
who really understand that much

01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:46.680
of what we think we know
is-- has been, you know,

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.740
needs to be reconsidered.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:55.270
But, with North Korea, because
there is this perception,

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:58.360
you know, again, the black
box or there's, you know,

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.600
this notion that North Korea
is unknown and unknowable,

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:07.760
people just don't want
to challenge these--

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.950
you know, what they bring to
the table already, these notions

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:15.990
that they already have,
so frustrating but--

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:17.630
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: If I
say one-- may-- one--

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:20.130
things that Library
Congress as a CRS

01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:23.470
which is Congressional
Researcher Service,

01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:26.960
so the Congress, they don't
deal with us directly,

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.620
they are the one actually
send their assistant

01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.810
and their CRS is the one
collect, you know, information

01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:34.930
and report to the Congress.

01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:38.050
So that's the one-- they are
the one we are dealing with.

01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:41.200
So I cannot say [inaudible]
but they are the one.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.060
Because even though I
emphasize 1940 to '60

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:50.810
or the '70 collection
because they are the one,

01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:53.130
because it's hard to find
this, so we are getting a lot

01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:58.380
of wager, so I focus on that but
still we're still getting a lot

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:01.670
of updated, you know,
current publication.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.450
So they are the one who
come and search, you know,

01:24:04.450 --> 01:24:08.550
with the skills and look at
the checking downloads Korean,

01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:11.400
you know, newspapers and
articles and try to dig out,

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.980
you know, fact or information.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.320
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: Well, on
your topic, actually in terms

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.320
of the National Archives, I
think for most policymakers,

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.380
our stuff is a little old.

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.550
I mean frankly, well, they
captured Korean records,

01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:32.630
for example, it's pretty much
the end of the Korean War is--

01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:38.450
But I mean in actuality, it
takes at least about 30 years

01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.130
for records to start
accessioning

01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:42.610
from the government
agencies to us.

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:47.720
And then after the records
accession or transferred to us,

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.280
it takes even longer for the
records to be declassified.

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.660
So in reality what you would
be able to access, you know,

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:58.840
as a researcher, it could
easily be something that's 50

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.140
years old.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.550
So unless the policymaker
is really keen on history,

01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:07.960
which they probably should
be, but they're not obviously,

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.040
you know, and I think our
collections are probably not

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.340
super useful.

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.750
Another part of the
National Archives,

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:18.760
the Presidential Library System
might be a little more useful

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.660
in that way.

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:23.820
So, you know-- and, for example,

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:25.550
the papers of the
National Security Council,

01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:27.010
those kind of things,
but, of course,

01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:29.370
classification always
becomes an issue

01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:31.130
with intelligence work product.

01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:34.220
So keep that in mind
if you're coming

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:37.380
to the National Archives
wanting things from the 1980s,

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.830
probably not the
best place to be.

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:40.590
Yeah.

01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:41.890
&gt;&gt; James F. Person:
Although the country files

01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:45.000
at the Reagan Library
from 1980--

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.850
through 1984 were just
released on Korea.

01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:50.730
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: On the
issue of digitization, actually,

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:52.620
the presidential
libraries are much,

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:56.350
much better about digitizing
things than the main part

01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:57.960
of the National Archive,
so yeah,

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.620
their websites are
actually quite good.

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.140
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: Well,
they're only-- it's only--

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.440
you can only see them in person.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.760
But Simi Valley is
a lovely place.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.440
I encourage you to go.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.560
It's-- But these were just

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.860
like four weeks ago,
I think, [inaudible].

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.940
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: Jonathan?

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:36.820
[ Inaudible ]

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.120
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: Sure.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:44.590
So after the Korean War,
you had this debate within--

01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:46.340
well, you had a discussion.

01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:53.690
You had-- you know, it was a
very diverse party at that time,

01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:54.990
you did have people

01:26:54.990 --> 01:27:01.330
with different revolutionary
backgrounds, but-- and they--

01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:03.560
you know, and you had some
that were more internationals

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.820
than more in-tuned with what was
happening in the socialist camp.

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.190
And after the death of Joseph
Stalin, you had a reorientation

01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:14.060
of the Soviet economy toward
consumer goods, you know,

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:17.860
sort of the-- shifting from
the industrial economy to more,

01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:21.740
you know, geared toward
improving the living standards

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.040
for the Soviet citizen.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.790
This was then promoted
throughout the socialist camp

01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:29.090
including to North Korea.

01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:33.270
And in fact, these new Soviet
policies were reflected

01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:37.360
in Soviet aid to North Korea.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:45.510
We're only-- all but 3% of the
total amount of aid was given

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:50.990
as a blank check, everything
else was allocated for projects

01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:54.340
that essentially-- that
would have, in some way,

01:27:54.340 --> 01:28:00.590
improve the living standards
of the North Korean people.

01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:03.560
Kim Il-sung, however,
was really trying

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.000
to eliminate colonial
error distortions

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.580
to the national economy.

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:10.880
It was determined
to make an economy

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:14.240
that was more internally
interdependent

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.440
and externally independent
wanting

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:24.100
to eliminate the potential for
future dependency relationships.

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:27.260
After the Korean War,
he saw that the--

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:33.070
they were utterly dependent
on the Soviets especially

01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:34.530
for military and so, he--

01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:39.960
and as the basis for
developing an economy

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.520
or developing military,

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.590
you needed to have an
industrial economy.

01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:52.650
And so, Kim was focused on
general industrialization

01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:54.750
but focusing on heavy industry.

01:28:54.750 --> 01:29:00.100
Wanted to, again, to eliminate
these colonial-era distortions

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.360
where you had highly
developed extractive

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:06.490
and primary processing
industries, but no ability

01:29:06.490 --> 01:29:09.080
to produce spare parts
and finished goods.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.410
So you had then this-- you
had discussion in the party

01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:16.850
over which path to take.

01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:20.800
Do you follow the Soviet model
and improve living conditions?

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.860
And the more internationalist
member

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:26.600
of the Korean workers party
were supportive of this,

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.550
but Kim Il-sung was
very much focused

01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:33.380
on eliminating future
dependency relations,

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:40.130
including with allies, the
Soviet Union and China.

01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:45.680
And you have then this
discussion in the party turning

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:53.190
into a debate when you have a
famine in late '54, early '55.

01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:56.070
And there's a lot of
criticism of Kim's policies

01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:57.740
which are focused so much on--

01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:06.140
despite the fact that Soviet
aid is not supporting his plans.

01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:10.310
He is mobilizing indigenous
human immaterial resources

01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:14.050
to try to push through
his goals.

01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:19.370
But then you have this famine
that comes with the process

01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:22.380
of collectivizing agriculture.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:28.370
And this discussion
turns more into criticism

01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:30.730
and there are unfavorable
comparisons being made

01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:35.550
between Kim's policies and
the policies being implemented

01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:39.010
in the Soviet Union to
improve living conditions.

01:30:39.010 --> 01:30:45.530
And at that point, Kim Il-sung
begins to see this as a threat.

01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:48.700
It's more-- He sees as a threat.

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:51.310
It was national security
imperatives

01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:53.820
and as a challenge
to him personally.

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:55.640
He didn't see this
debate as something

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.360
that would necessarily
strengthen policy but he saw it

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.400
as a direct challenge.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:08.370
And so, this is when he begins
this process of othering.

01:31:08.370 --> 01:31:11.210
In focusing on the revolutionary
backgrounds of the people

01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:14.400
who were more cosmopolitan
who were more internationalist

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:20.980
and were advancing or
promoting the adaption

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:23.720
of Soviet economic policies.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:27.360
And at the same time, he
is promoting his own--

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.620
highlighting his own
revolutionary background

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:33.280
as the core of the Korean
revolutionary tradition.

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:39.000
So he's marginalizing those who
are criticizing his policies

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.450
and engineering their downfall.

01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:50.000
But what-- I mean, we can see
a lot about this from a lot

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:58.250
of the Soviet reports after
'55 in particular, but you have

01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:02.910
to also compare with-- you
have to look also to fill it

01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:04.620
out a little bit
because it's not--

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.180
the level of reporting
immediately

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:08.180
after the Korean
War is not so great

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.240
because the embassies
were just rebuilding.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.660
They were just moving
back to Pyongyang.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.400
And so, for example, the Soviet
Embassy wasn't even rebuilt yet,

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.370
they were operating out
of temporary facilities.

01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:19.850
They weren't-- the embassy
was not fully staffed,

01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:22.460
there were other embassies.

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:26.560
So you have to look at
the available reports

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:29.270
and then come here to
the Library of Congress

01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:32.990
and read North Korea's own
publication, the periodicals.

01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:35.500
For example, I was just,
before you all arrived,

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.950
I was over there
looking at [inaudible],

01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:42.670
which is the party's--
it's the-- [Inaudible].

01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:43.970
Hmm? [Inaudible].

01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:50.860
No, I'm describing what it is.

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:54.090
It's a journal that's produced
by the Central Committee.

01:32:54.090 --> 01:32:57.720
So it's the party's
official journal.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.080
And you can see actually--

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:04.230
in [inaudible], you can
actually see the saddle

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:09.510
of these debates occurring
in-- among top officials.

01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:10.810
But they're very subtle.

01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:13.240
I mean it's not-- you're not
going to see overt criticism

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.430
of Kim and of his
policies in these journals.

01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:20.140
They're just sort of,
well, you know, you have--

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.710
on the one side,
you have, you know,

01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:24.990
the industrial economy
is the basis

01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:28.470
of an independent
national economy.

01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:31.740
And after you have an
industrial North Korea,

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:34.860
then you can have
improved living conditions

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:38.240
and we will have an
independent military as well.

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.480
And then on the other side you
see sort of these discussions

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:44.090
that we're promoting
an improvement

01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:46.140
of a living conditions, you
know, the people have suffered

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:50.020
over throughout the
colonial era and then from--

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.960
after the devastation

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.360
of the [inaudible] the
American Imperialist aggressors.

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.320
You know it's time
to really focus

01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:59.150
on improving living
conditions for the people.

01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:03.960
And so you see these subtle
discussions in these journals.

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:07.550
And then again when you compare
that then with what you have

01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:11.890
from the Soviet records and East
German record, then, you know,

01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:14.650
forward picture emerges.

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:18.050
If you people have really tried
to look at this period though

01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:20.680
or if you contextualized
some of the developments

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:26.910
that occurred during this period
including Kim Il-sung's use

01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:31.530
of the expression Juche,
this is something--

01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:33.830
you'll have to wait
my book, yeah.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.750
So, sorry, long answer.

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:40.550
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: Ester
[assumed spelling]?

01:34:40.550 --> 01:35:07.200
[ Inaudible ]

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.230
So how many contemporary
articles are still received

01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:11.530
at the library for North Korea

01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:13.920
and are there any
restrictions on them?

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:18.390
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: We have currently
48 North Korean titles we

01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:20.210
receive regularly.

01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:25.570
And we have a long paid really
comprehensive selection area

01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:27.420
but because we are getting lot

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:31.590
of those Korean scholars
compared to South Korea.

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:34.710
Actually we don't have any
limitation or policy not

01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:37.960
to acquire that because
any materials can be useful

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.600
and then they entitle
to use it freely.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.310
So we're still getting a lot
of North Korean materials.

01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:49.600
Even I try to-- I display
some children's book.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:53.730
According to library
selection criteria,

01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:57.640
we can acquire a children's book
when you have a research value

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.820
which North Korean childrens
who has a lot of research value,

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:03.410
because actually we
have a few scholars came

01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:07.460
out just researching
children's books.

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:14.760
So, to me any North Korean
materials has a value on it

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.220
because still lot of
things we don't know.

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:23.500
So any items and even
I don't expect the area

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.980
that we are getting really
interesting a lot of scholars,

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.910
for example, these days

01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:30.900
that invite the North
Korean committee and they're

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:33.710
like really first, I thought
there's a committee there but,

01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:38.720
you know, really commixing
comedy and then crown,

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.380
you know, you never know.

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.760
So it's like a really
playground, you have to come in

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.800
and play around to
find out what we have.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.100
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: And a lot of--

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.110
Are these materials made
available to the public shortly

01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:53.480
after the library receives them?

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.780
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: Yes.

01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:58.750
But anything, you know, coming
to the library takes at least--

01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:02.280
average of five or six
months to finish its logging

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:05.790
and then finish binding
some cases and then--

01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:09.950
so it takes a while but still--
so if you look at the record,

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:15.580
for example, we have until--
[inaudible] 2017 December

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.880
and then I get occasion.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.190
That means you don't
have after that,

01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:20.470
of course [inaudible]
keep getting it.

01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:21.770
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: Yeah.

01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:24.060
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: But still we
have only available like 2017

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.360
and we-- Yeah, so
it take some time.

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.210
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: And for those
more contemporary records,

01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:30.310
are there audiovisual materials

01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:33.050
in North Korean movies,
music, et cetera?

01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:35.460
Or does it tend to
be more textual?

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.280
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: The
Asian Division,

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.000
we collect the printing
material mostly.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.300
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: OK.

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.600
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: Because we
don't have any facility

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.270
to play the music or soundtrack.

01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:51.520
I recommend a few titles
every year from North Korea

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:56.710
but this is not Asian
Division position, you know,

01:37:56.710 --> 01:38:00.820
it's in the motion picture
in a special format.

01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:03.590
So not really-- not
that many though.

01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:07.750
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: There's-- By
the way, there's a great article

01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:09.260
that came out by Andre Schmid.

01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:13.360
I think it was in-- was it the
journal of Asian studies or--

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:18.540
just a couple of months
ago that describes work

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:24.460
with these materials at
the Library of Congress.

01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:25.880
He's at University of Toronto.

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.230
He actually has a book
that's coming out, I think,

01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:34.670
later this year or next
year, so probably next year.

01:38:34.670 --> 01:38:39.750
But that really just uses these
materials to get it, you know,

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:41.160
everyday life in North Korea.

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.780
In fact, there have been a
number of works that have come

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.890
out in recent years, again,
Everyday Life in North Korea,

01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:48.850
Susie Kim's book on '45
to '50, which uses a lot

01:38:48.850 --> 01:38:53.920
of the materials at the Library
of Congress, I'm sorry, at NARA,

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.880
at the National Archives.

01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:02.230
Harrison or Cheehyung
Harrison Kim at the University

01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:05.630
of Hawaii has a book
coming out in October.

01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:10.590
That is about Workers-- it's
called "Workers and Toilers",

01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:12.710
that also uses a
lot of materials

01:39:12.710 --> 01:39:18.980
from the caption
records, and I think a lot

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.530
from the LOC materials.

01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:23.940
But this is also
looking everyday life

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:26.500
of the worker after--

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:32.060
but focuses particularly on
the post-Korean War period, OK.

01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.390
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: So it sounds
like you got a lot of book

01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:34.830
to read after yours, James.

01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:37.910
&gt;&gt; James F. Person: But
theirs is coming out first.

01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:39.970
&gt;&gt; Daniel Wertz: So we'll
take one last question

01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:42.510
from [inaudible]
and then wrap up.

01:39:42.510 --> 01:40:02.750
[ Inaudible ]

01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:07.510
&gt;&gt; Eric Van Slander: You
mean from our catalogue or?

01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:12.340
[ Inaudible ]

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:17.680
In some cases, people
are starting

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.430
to crowd source things
for our website.

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:23.640
The question is how
to make it accessible.

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.040
You know, how would
somebody search bring it up?

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.140
But, yeah, I mean, there's
an ongoing effort to try

01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:36.890
to have the public contribute
images in some cases, and then,

01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:39.790
you know, if possible
if those records

01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:43.450
that the translation comes from
are described in our catalogue

01:40:43.450 --> 01:40:45.700
to actually have a
link to the digitized

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:51.210
and then the translated, I
mean, but it would depend

01:40:51.210 --> 01:40:53.070
by no means an expert on that.

01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:56.170
So-- but there's an
ongoing effort to--

01:40:56.170 --> 01:41:00.320
well, actually the term they're
using is our citizen archivists.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.430
And not only the
translating things that are

01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:07.200
in foreign languages but
also transcribing things

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.090
that are maybe written
in difficult handwriting

01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:11.390
and that kind of thing.

01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:13.400
But if you go to our
website, you know,

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.910
you might find more
information on it.

01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:19.300
But-- And my job as a
textual reference archivist,

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.570
meaning paper of records, yeah,

01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:24.010
I'm not really involved
directly in that effort.

01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:25.510
Yeah.

01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:26.810
