00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.760
And these last two chunks of code actually add the visual elements to the page.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.470
Notice here that bar is simply a bunch of g tags that have

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.660
some transform on them.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.160
We have not actually put any rectangles on the page or

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.280
any labels on those rectangles.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.480
But since d3 has this nice chainable syntax.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.710
And since any call to append puts elements within the element append

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.890
was called on, in this case bar.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.100
We can add direct angles inside of the group tags.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.640
And this last chunk of code simply adds the textural label which corresponds to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130
the value of the data point.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.030
That was all I wanted to cover from a high level of this code.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.470
And just wanted to expose to some of the d3 functions and

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.060
methods that we haven't encountered yet.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.710
And how to apply them to data loaded from an external file
