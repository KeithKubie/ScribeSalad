00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.970
You and your friends
are making name cards

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.970
to assign seats for dinner.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.440
You each are given an
identical strip of blank paper

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.540
and begin coloring parts
of it with crayons.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.510
You start with blue,
or you start with blue.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.150
Your friend Micah starts off
with green, Joelle starts

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.260
with the red, Holden
starts with pink,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.980
And Kate starts with purple.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.030
After one color is
used, whose strip

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.120
has the same part of its
area colored as yours?

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.409
So let's look at my
strip right over here.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.400
It has how many equal sections?

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 equal sections.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.404
And how many of them
have been colored blue?

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:42.070
Well, let's see.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.750
1, 2, 3, 4 of my equal sections
have been colored blue.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.130
So I need to figure out
which of these other folks

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.905
have colored exactly
4/6 of their strip blue.

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:55.030
Or another way of thinking
about it, I want to say,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.910
whoever has an equivalent
fraction colored, not blue,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.750
colored whatever
their color might be.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.530
So let's first look at
Micah, or "Mee-kah."

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.130
So he's got 3 equal sections.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.130
He's got 3 equal sections,
and he's colored,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.930
he's colored 2 of
them, 2 of them green.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.550
Now is 4/6 and 2/3
the same thing?

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.420
Well, he has 3 equal sections.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.760
I had 6.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.600
If I were to group each
of these into groups of 2,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.930
so if I were to divide
by 2, let me do that.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.380
If I were divide by 2, so
I'm going to group this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.680
into groups of 2.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.850
Then I would have 1, 2-- so I
have 1, 2, 3 equal sections.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.660
And then if I were to group the
blue strips into groups of 2,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.680
then I would have
1, 2 of them that

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.512
have actually been colored blue.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.720
So if I divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.210
by 2, I get 2/3, which is the
exact same fraction as Micah.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.720
Another way to
think about it, is

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.740
if you divide each of
Micah's sections into 2.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.889
So if you divide this into 2,
this into 2, and this into 2.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.660
Well, then how many total
sections does he have?

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.060
Well, he had 3,
now each of those 3

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.330
have been divided into 2.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.160
So we can multiply
by 2 to get 6.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.230
So this is multiplying by 2.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.600
And each of the 2
in green, there now

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.670
each of those sections have
now been divided into 2.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.050
So you can multiply by 2
as well, and you get 4.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.390
So 2/3 and 4/6 are
the same thing.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.267
So Micah has colored in the
same amount that I have.

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:44.350
Now let's see whether any
of these other fractions

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.690
are the same.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.600
So Joelle has colored
in 4, has colored

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.942
in 4 out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:53.942 --> 00:02:55.940
4 out of 7.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.884
So it's not clear to me that we
can somehow multiply or divide

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:04.550
the numerator and the
denominator here--

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.080
remember it has to
be by the same number

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.163
in order to not change the
value of the fraction--

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:11.410
to somehow make
that equal to 4/6.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.690
She's colored in
the same number,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.040
but the size of each of
her strips is different.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.110
So 4/7 is definitely
different than 4/6.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.910
So we can rule Joelle out.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:30.940
Holden has colored in 3 out of
5 sections, 3 out of 5 sections.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.410
Once again, not obvious
that I can multiply

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.970
both the numerator and the
denominator 3/5 times something

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.150
to get you to 4/6, so
these aren't equivalent.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.092
And then Kate has colored
in, Kate has colored in 1, 2,

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:48.249
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.230
8 out of 11.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.100
And once again, I could try
to get a numerator up here, 4,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.020
I could divide by 2.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.092
But then if I divide by
2 in the denominator,

00:03:58.092 --> 00:03:59.550
I'm going to get
something strange.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.530
I'm going to get 4
over 11 divided by 2,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.990
which 11 divided
by 2 is like 5.5.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.886
So this is clearly not
the same thing as 4/6.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.260
We'll have rule
this out as well.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.490
So Micah and I have
colored in the same amount.
