00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.130
You are listening to radiolab radio from w?

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:07.040
N y. S. T. E. Yep.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.280
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Molly Webster. This is radiolab. Uh,

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.350
Robert Krulwich will be back with us very soon, but today a story from you.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.300
Well, I guess I was just thinking, probably tell you just the, um,

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.440
Morgan and I back story of how I heard about the story.

7
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.530
So Morgan and I went to Grad school together at NYU,

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.300
so I guess I've known her for almost 11 years and we're, we're,

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.610
we're holed up in my apartment. I don't know,

10
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.970
this was like last November or something. She comes over,

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150
she's sitting on the giant [inaudible] big floor pillow,

12
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.740
like a Turkish floor pillow sitting, sitting on the floor pillow.

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.210
And then she is like, are you ready to hear the story? And I said, yeah.

14
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:57.490
And she's like, okay, I need you to take the battery out of your phone. Yeah.

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.620
And I was, and I was like, what? I have an iPhone,

16
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.400
I can't take the battery out of it. And she goes, okay,

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.300
I need you to power it down and put it in another room under a pillow.

18
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.490
What it was like, what is going on and shoot.

19
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.430
And then by this point she's taking the battery out of her phone. So I, I do it.

20
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.620
I put it in the, in my bedroom and I put it under pillows. I turned it off.

21
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.860
I came back, I sat down and then, um,

22
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.260
she starts telling me essentially about the ceremony,

23
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.060
<v 1>about going to the launch of this new, uh, currency,</v>

24
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.600
which involved her flying across the country to live in a hotel room for a

25
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.340
number of days with a bunch of strangers.

26
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.020
And then something happened because she came back, um, seemingly paranoid,

27
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.280
at least in so much as she was hiding

28
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.060
<v 0>phones and your pillows. What was it that happened?</v>

29
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.450
It takes a few steps. Okay. So we'll start with step one, which is,

30
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.680
hi, which is Morgan. I'm Morgan Peck.

31
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.280
How would you identify yourself professionally? Professionally,

32
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:11.281
I'm a freelance journalist and in my eyes Morgan has become like the historian

33
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.540
of the world of digital money. I started writing about neuroscience,

34
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:21.541
but quickly found out about bitcoin about a year into my writing 2011 and have

35
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.690
pretty much been writing about it ever since now. Yes. A lot of people,

36
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:28.450
when they hear about digital money, they think ransomware,

37
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.880
the hijackers held the files, ransom demand,

38
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.260
the roughly 650 euros paid in Bitcoin, bitcoin, the virtual currency.

39
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.920
Obviously it has become associated with cybercrime. But for Morgan, no,

40
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.790
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.700
What attracted her to this whole world but made her go, oh my God,

42
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:48.510
this thing is amazing. She was like pulled in by the idealism of it.

43
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.920
There was an extremely active community of people who were talking about,

44
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.270
you know, um,

45
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.080
completely subverting the financial system at a time when the financial system

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.370
was not trusted and was collapsing because Morgan says the birth of Bitcoin goes

47
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.210
back to, well, remember 2008, boom.

48
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.670
<v 1>Why does your work do the phone?</v>

49
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:16.110
Say a lot of their customers are freaked out in 2008 was the big implosion.

50
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.570
What in the world is happening on wall streets in September?

51
00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:20.790
The stock market's crashed, the banks failed.

52
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.390
Traders are standing there watching in amazement. I don't blame them.

53
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.930
There was the bail out, you know, this shakes your core,

54
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.900
this shakes your trust in American institutions.

55
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.530
<v 0>And then just a few months later, 2009 January,</v>

56
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.990
it's a hot topic on Wall Street right now. It's very interesting.

57
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.890
Digital money called Bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin,

58
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.210
I can't recall when showed up. Oh, so bitcoin was after the big collapse.

59
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.470
It was after and it was very much a response to that definitely because here was

60
00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.630
this currency that was decentralized,

61
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.950
which means it's run and monitored by all the people who use it,

62
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.370
which means you don't need a Federal Reserve. So at the beginning,

63
00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:06.371
a lot of people saw bitcoin as a way to sort of take the power back from the big

64
00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:10.040
banks that had just everybody over libertarians were really into it.

65
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.930
They thought that it was going to crash,

66
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.920
that it was going to crumble. The columns of every power structure in,

67
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.340
you know, the world. Like obviously that didn't happen.

68
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:26.090
It did not take down the world. But bitcoin has not gone away.

69
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.950
It's been a decade. It's still around. But if you talk to people on the inside,

70
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.420
they'll tell you one of the things that has dogged bitcoin from the beginning is

71
00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:36.740
this issue of privacy.

72
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.230
The way that the technology works is that, uh,

73
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.700
it tracks every single transaction that's ever made on the network.

74
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.740
Anytime anyone with a bitcoin buys a coffee or a pound of heroin,

75
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.070
that transaction is kept in something called the public ledger.

76
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.190
Bitcoin is a ledger public ledger. Is that something that each person has?

77
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.290
It's out there for anyone to see. Really? Yeah.

78
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.990
Every single transaction that's ever been done, any transaction ever is. Right.

79
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.640
That's not private at all. No,

80
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.400
but people thought it was private at the beginning because, oh,

81
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:15.830
we're using these pseudonyms. In other words, in the ledger,

82
00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:20.150
you never see anyone's actual name. There are no names on in Bitcoin,

83
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.970
like I wouldn't be modeling. I'd be t nine, five, seven g.

84
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.470
The problem is that while there are no names attached,

85
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.790
the behavior is out there for anyone to see. Turns out,

86
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.830
it's really not that hard to match this like string of characters with the

87
00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:39.440
person that it represents out in the real world.

88
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.080
You could just kind of Google it on the Internet,

89
00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:45.110
see if it pops up anywhere else, what is associated with,

90
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.790
and then you kind of figure out who the person is and then you can go back into

91
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:52.910
the bitcoin ledger and search their entire history,

92
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.180
can figure out all their business dealings, all their personal dealings,

93
00:05:56.181 --> 00:06:00.050
who they know, who don't know, possibly who their bank is. And you know,

94
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:02.660
people have tried to solve this problem with Bitcoin,

95
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.560
but there are companies now that actually specialize in doing the network

96
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.310
analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain. And they do it for companies who want to,

97
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.690
um, make sure that they're not transacting with, you know, criminals,

98
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:16.580
people who have had, they're clear, specific,

99
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.450
actively trying to de anonymize people. Oh yeah. Wow.

100
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.460
<v 2>Ooh.</v>

101
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.800
<v 1>And so one of the puzzles that, uh,</v>

102
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.830
all the Internet people think about is,

103
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.410
is there a way to get the best of both worlds?

104
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.210
Can you have the decentralization that comes with digital money?

105
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.590
But can you also get privacy on this? Like cash,

106
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.200
I take a dollar bill out of my pocket. I walked down the street,

107
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.010
I give it to someone they give to someone knowing can trace that money.

108
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.550
Can you get the decentralization that comes with digital money and can you wrap

109
00:06:52.681 --> 00:06:56.160
that up with the privacy that you get with paper money?

110
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.350
<v 0>And that question just suggesting brings us to this guy. Oh,</v>

111
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.330
so go here to somebody named Zuko Wilcox of Zuko at. I'm in a different room.

112
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.850
Okay. He is our master of the ceremony, I have to say. You do.

113
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.110
Um, everyone's like pretty excited on talking to a guy named Zuko.

114
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.760
Like it's just a good name. Sukkot. Thanks. Yay.

115
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:26.840
Zuko so anyhow,

116
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.131
Zuko is,

117
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:31.430
he's been working on digital currencies for a long time and he's extremely

118
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.550
trusted because he a charismatic leader type of thing. Yeah, he is.

119
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.820
When he first encountered Bitcoin, he was like, cool.

120
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.750
<v 3>Yes.</v>

121
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.130
But I was concerned about the privacy implications because he's a pretty

122
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:46.760
hardcore cyber bunk. My Gut, it's like worlds upon worlds are opening for us.

123
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.850
Cypherpunks yeah. She said,

124
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:54.851
this is a group of people that care deeply about how to make the Internet more

125
00:07:55.521 --> 00:08:00.521
private food privacy is a human right and that it's a necessary condition for

126
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:07.451
the exercise of a free choice of morality and of political participation and uh,

127
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.040
everything that's of intimacy, everything that's most important as humans.

128
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.630
<v 0>So this whole thing with bitcoin and the privacy problem.</v>

129
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.230
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

130
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.310
<v 0>right up his alley.</v>

131
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.720
<v 3>So I went out of my way,</v>

132
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.840
studied the bitcoin source code and contributed some suggestions and yes,

133
00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:30.420
I immediately started fantasizing about what could be better.

134
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.280
<v 0>So then he being like the privacy security Cypherpunk Guru,</v>

135
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.120
he becomes the leader of something called c cash,

136
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.540
z cash and z cash. Really its main, um,

137
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.960
contribution to this ecosystem is privacy.

138
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.420
So there's this thing called a zero knowledge proof. Okay.

139
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.560
And it's a mathematical invention that mathematicians had come up with.

140
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.590
It requires something called the Z snark to be baked into the protocol.

141
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.470
I asked hours of questions and it got me into a conversation about circles and

142
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:07.650
graphs in the shape of numbers and shape of what I need is the shape of what's

143
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.030
of possibility.

144
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.270
What I came away with was that it allows you to prove that something is true

145
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.880
without revealing anything about the thing you're trying to prove is true.

146
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.160
Wow. You just honestly need to, I just want you to take that and run.

147
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.530
<v 4>This is where computer science and mathematics start to overlap into wizardry</v>

148
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:31.210
here.

149
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.830
<v 0>All you need to know is that z cash promises to give you decentralization with</v>

150
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.290
this like buffet of privacy,

151
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.243
<v 5>but</v>

152
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:48.030
<v 4>z cash has its own flaw and unfortunate vulnerability in the math.</v>

153
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.940
In order to create the currency of z cash,

154
00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:54.270
you have to first create a number,

155
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:59.271
certain enormous number and then you use that number to do a bunch of math and

156
00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:00.460
then like

157
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.293
<v 6>boom,</v>

158
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.840
<v 0>you have the currency,</v>

159
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.520
but it all starts with this number.

160
00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:13.100
This key problem with that is

161
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.540
<v 4>in this system, in this system,</v>

162
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.170
if somebody got a hold of the private key,

163
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.480
they could counter Fitzy cash coins,

164
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.460
counterfeit money. Just make new coins,

165
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.820
millions and millions and millions of new coins out of thin air.

166
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.590
That's a really big problem when you have a uh,

167
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.170
anonymous currency cause no one would ever know. Nope.

168
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.800
Bitcoin since it's a public ledger,

169
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.440
you can actually see if there's any funny business going on.

170
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:49.020
That's actually why they keep it open, right?

171
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:51.420
The lack of privacy in Bitcoin is a security measure

172
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.760
<v 0>year. No one would ever know.</v>

173
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.260
So the challenge is how do you get people to buy into a system that has this

174
00:10:57.261 --> 00:11:02.261
like major vulnerability I'll be at just right at the very beginning.

175
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.490
There's this one moment where you know you have to trust people in a way that's

176
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.600
completely existentially defining of the currency.

177
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.100
So this is what Zuke goes up against. How do I,

178
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.920
if I want super privacy, which he does,

179
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.400
how do I generate this number in such a way that no one steals it,

180
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.800
not me, not anyone else.

181
00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:32.801
And how do I prove to all of the people that might want to use the cash later

182
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.680
than in this tiny little window of of creation?

183
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.750
Nothing untoward has happened that,

184
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.310
that the number has never been tampered with. That humanize,

185
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.630
I've never been laid upon it. You know,

186
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:48.620
that the entire creation of this system remains pure.

187
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.060
If this is very much like an immaculate conception, you're like, no,

188
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.880
humans can have sex to make this baby, but there needs to be a baby.

189
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.020
But we almost have to examine the act of sex to make sure that there was no

190
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:06.250
physical contact cause it like that. That's so good. Okay,

191
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.143
so here we are.

192
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:09.920
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

193
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.720
<v 0>Zuko decides</v>

194
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.660
<v 3>we'll have a ceremony.</v>

195
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.310
<v 6>Oh,</v>

196
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.860
<v 3>most securable sophisticated cryptographic ceremony that's ever been performed.</v>

197
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.330
Wow. Okay.

198
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.223
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

199
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.560
<v 4>here's the thing. While it's trivial to make your own currency,</v>

200
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.020
it is not trivial to, um, inspire trust.

201
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.660
That's what money is,

202
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.460
is the agreement between people to use it and to honor that sort of social

203
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.550
contract and the creation of value.

204
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.990
To me that's like alchemy. Um, and it's a moment of creation.

205
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.270
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

206
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.270
<v 0>I think I'm walking down the street near you, Molly.</v>

207
00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.090
Greenpoint and I get a text message on signal, a private messenger app,

208
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.720
a from Zika that's like pay. We want you to,

209
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.540
we want you to be there and yeah.

210
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.840
You though excited we're chosen. Chosen. Yeah. And,

211
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.610
but did you even know what you were being invited to? No,

212
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.750
I had no idea, but I was like, I have to do this. I mean,

213
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.860
I cannot miss this. Even if z cash doesn't make it,

214
00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:26.840
even if you know it collapses,

215
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.900
it seems like a historical,

216
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.423
<v 6>no ma'am.</v>

217
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.320
<v 0>So Zuko basically said, just wait for our bat call.</v>

218
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.330
So about two weeks later, the back call come to this, uh,

219
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.140
coffee store in boulder soap. Morgan gets on a flight to Denver,

220
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:46.210
rents a car to boulder and goes to the coffee shop.

221
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.480
Zhou goes there standing next to the Barista counter and actually he has a huge

222
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.050
paper map with him, spread out all over like the Barista's area.

223
00:13:56.051 --> 00:14:00.820
He's like up in their grill. And then, uh, this other guy, nat showed up,

224
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.660
friend [inaudible] who, uh, was going to film it all. Was that,

225
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.880
was that for you? You wanted everything recorded? Yeah.

226
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
<v 3>And it was to serve as a security mechanism and documentation for the public.</v>

227
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.650
<v 0>More on that in a second. Okay. Okay. Okay. They leave the coffee shop,</v>

228
00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:22.900
go over to Nance van. He mikes us both up. I told them they could make me up

229
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.743
<v 3>and we're going to,</v>

230
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.110
now we're going to turn it off all of our cell phones so that if there were any

231
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.980
hackers they would be able to track where we were physically.

232
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:36.060
I'm trying to think if I have to say goodbye to anyone. We were like, okay,

233
00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:38.730
now we've got the van, we've got our cell phones turned off.

234
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.310
The next thing we needed to do were next. Yeah, we're going to,

235
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:47.040
the computer store was acquire a computer because like if there was some hacker

236
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:50.730
who was planning to steal the key, they could have,

237
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.920
<v 4>you know already planted some malware or tracking device on Zucker's personal</v>

238
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:56.690
laptop before we even started.

239
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.350
So we all piled into the van,

240
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.980
settle off here you start heading north ticket clean computer.

241
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.060
He's decided to go to Denver for this. Yeah,

242
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.640
but he doesn't want to use his phone. No. Hey, I can even use my paper man.

243
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.810
Because what if somebody is like tracking what is looking at,

244
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.800
let's go straight. Nat is doing much of his recording while he's driving.

245
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.170
That's where we think it is.

246
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.280
Do you have like a black Hoodie over you like Hezbollah style? No. No.

247
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.290
So they're driving for a little bit. When

248
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.830
all of a sudden they make this pit stop.

249
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.580
We were like, hey, there's a costume store. Perfect.

250
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.050
We're ready to go yet. Like okay, next stop looking for a wizard hat wizard hat.

251
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.880
Can I see your wizard hat section?

252
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.360
So they walked through this big costume store. Past witches hats, Tiaras.

253
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.950
What is the wizard hat you settled on? Oh, it was a Gandalf hat. Yanoff hat.

254
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.500
Yeah. I love the Gandalf hat. Ah, I think it's good. That is appropriate.

255
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.960
The greatest wizard of all. Yeah, it's definitely a winter. Thanks. Yeah. Great.

256
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:09.140
And then back to the mission at Hand Sans Denver Computer.

257
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.290
We drove down using our paper map with their cell phones off to the computer

258
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.560
store. They get there. I would walk in. Oh yeah.

259
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:18.590
This is the place you a little computer shop and you know a side by side

260
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:21.150
comparison of two different ones. You minutes later. Yup.

261
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.470
I want this one because you could get this computer and at that point the

262
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:25.580
computer is sacred.

263
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.670
It's called [inaudible] 6,700 which hence forth is given a new name.

264
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.400
It's called the compute node. And why is it sacred? Well,

265
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:38.540
because this is the computer that will hold the secret number,

266
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:43.070
the number that will give birth to an entirely new currency.

267
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.760
So, all right, thank you very well. You know, got back in the van,

268
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:53.830
got back to boulder and drove to an area that had hotels that we do have.

269
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.860
Where's this hotel?

270
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.210
And we're going around to like the hotels in boulder this way and they're all

271
00:16:59.211 --> 00:16:59.721
full.

272
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:03.200
I don't know if they have lunch in their hotel room or they don't have an either

273
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:07.370
that connection. So then we go to another hotel, like that hotel ended another,

274
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.060
she wasn't clear on the notion of ether like seven o'clock at night.

275
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.400
<v 0>Oh, what's the plan here?</v>

276
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.760
The idea was if you don't know what you're going to do,

277
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.000
then they don't know what they're going to do.

278
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.140
So this is actually a security measure.

279
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.910
Like if you're totally in the dark about what you're doing, then some hackers,

280
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.400
they can't, they can't mountain attack. It's foolproof. Yeah. But

281
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.720
<v 4>okay. A ventrally millennium has rooms and it has ethernet.</v>

282
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.380
They find a hotel. Oh my gosh. She even went and double checked.

283
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.010
Zuko actually has nat booked the hotel room for two nights?

284
00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:47.050
You want me to come with you? Yep. Do you have a key? Well,

285
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:51.990
y'all check into one room. Brown floor. It's not particularly fancy.

286
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.280
Couple Tales, you know, you got your two beds, then they set up.

287
00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:01.440
We're a well organized machine. They totally transformed the place in general.

288
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:04.800
I'm not going to help out. They gave me a bed to chill out on.

289
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.040
You couldn't concentrate on, on careful observing. Okay.

290
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.100
So what we did was we stripped the room of all of the lamps and the telephone.

291
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.420
Everything on all counters gets shoved somewhere. All of that stuff.

292
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.720
Bearded away into the closet or the bath tub. And what are you doing?

293
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.390
In addition, we, oh, I'm going to plug in the TV.

294
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.940
Didn't want like the television for example,

295
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:30.300
which could be remotely controlled by an adversary. So they unplug it,

296
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.480
slide it under one of the meds, good by GV. You know what another reason is?

297
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:36.450
I hate TVs. Television is the worst.

298
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.210
Then they grabbed the table where they're going to set up the compute node.

299
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.340
You want to explain again while you're keeping it away from the wall,

300
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.930
pull that out a ways. Oh,

301
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.700
there's a teeny tiny chance that a team of spies rented the room next door and

302
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:50.520
set up a giant antenna on the other side of this wall.

303
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.780
This is like the dopest attack that Sukkot is planning against called side

304
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:55.650
channel attacks.

305
00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.000
That's a method by which you could use an antenna or like a really high tech

306
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:03.690
microphone to figure out what a computer is doing.

307
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.510
<v 0>For example, with some crazy microphone,</v>

308
00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:08.300
you could listen into the computers processor. If you heard something like,

309
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.133
<v 7>okay,</v>

310
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.570
<v 0>oh, that's a Diffie Hellman key exchange or</v>

311
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:15.900
<v 7>ah,</v>

312
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.531
<v 0>well yeah,</v>

313
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:20.280
this is obviously figuring out the full four zero nine six bit RSA decryption

314
00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:21.114
key

315
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.783
<v 7>or</v>

316
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.560
<v 4>oh, I, hey, that's the new babes video or whatever, so all right,</v>

317
00:19:27.561 --> 00:19:31.880
so please don't put anything on this desk from here on out.

318
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.360
It's pulled away from the wall about, I dunno, five feet,

319
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.430
just in case there's somebody set up next door and then started loading in all

320
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:44.480
the cameras and equipment, battery packs, junk food.

321
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.000
But then there was also a whole security camera set up.

322
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.540
One cool one really cool thing about these security cameras is that they don't

323
00:19:50.541 --> 00:19:53.240
have a radio for security cameras,

324
00:19:53.241 --> 00:19:57.440
which word from the 80s before security cameras came with Wifi,

325
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.530
which means we had to buy antique security cameras and they're night vision

326
00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:03.590
security cameras.

327
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.980
And they set those up so that you could see the other cameras from the first

328
00:20:06.981 --> 00:20:07.311
camera.

329
00:20:07.311 --> 00:20:11.270
So you could sell that new did just snuck in there and like tampered with one of

330
00:20:11.271 --> 00:20:12.860
the cameras during the process either.

331
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.680
<v 0>And this security camera set up was, uh,</v>

332
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.030
one of the key points in trying to create what Morgan was talking about earlier,

333
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.450
this alchemy, faith, trust, whatever.

334
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.330
<v 4>So the security mechanism, this was,</v>

335
00:20:25.331 --> 00:20:29.410
this was going to catch any shenanigans

336
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.690
<v 0>and then Zuko was going to post this security footage to the internet. So, uh,</v>

337
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.750
experts, security experts could scan it and make up their minds.

338
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.490
Could the ceremony be trusted?

339
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.510
<v 4>Hold on. Where are you going to sleep tonight? I mean</v>

340
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.790
we could all camp and sleep anywhere. So we set all that stuff up.

341
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.620
It's nine o'clock now at 10 o'clock. Yeah, it was late.

342
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.690
<v 3>And um,</v>

343
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.080
I took the computer that we use the so-called compute node and that from that

344
00:20:57.601 --> 00:21:02.601
moment forward I kept that thing like within arms reach for 48 hours or so.

345
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.411
Oh my God.

346
00:21:04.411 --> 00:21:08.670
It was a little bit exhausting trying to be paranoid and it is exhausting trying

347
00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:13.020
to be paranoid. Yeah. Like I slept with it that night. Um, in my bed.

348
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.270
He kept my, kept my arm around it.

349
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:17.670
<v 2>No</v>

350
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:22.120
<v 4>good night. Sweet prints and flights of angels. Sing knee today. Rest</v>

351
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.153
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

352
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.420
[inaudible] [inaudible]

353
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.253
<v 8>coming up.</v>

354
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.160
<v 4>A rude awakening.</v>

355

359
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.500
<v 8>Hi, I'm Abby Jacobson and you may know me from my fifth TV show, broad city.</v>

360
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.700
But before that I went to art school. And why am I telling you that? Well,

361
00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:33.330
it's because I have a podcast baby about art.

362
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.700
It's called a piece of work. It's a collab between me, w NYC studios and Moma.

363
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.510
I'll talk art with some of my friends like Questlove, Tavi, Gevinson,

364
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:46.410
and RuPaul, and we'll consult some experts and learn some incredible things.

365
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.700
Listen to a piece of work with Abby Jacobson, wherever you get your podcasts.

366
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.980
<v 4>Molly radio lab, back to boulder.</v>

367
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.330
Sorry, I can't open the door. That would be helping you.

368
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.590
So it's the next morning, Saturday morning.

369
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.830
Zuko sits down at his personal computer and he starts making all these

370
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.440
hello video check calls go right.

371
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.470
He calls up a guy in d c Hey Moses,

372
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:23.220
the guy in Texas who sound like Tom Hardy also. Oh,

373
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.090
that's pretty cool. Florida. Okay. Really appreciate your help. Slovenia.

374
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.260
Yes. Good job. Pit boss, another guy in California,

375
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.730
and then there was this mysterious one, K for recess ready?

376
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.200
That was so only referred to as February's and didn't know where he was.

377
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.560
I didn't find out until afterwards that he was actually driving from Vancouver

378
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.610
across

379
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.810
<v 0>British Columbia who are all these guys.</v>

380
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.870
So for Zuko it's, it's very unacceptable.

381
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:56.240
He wants to take as much of the trust.

382
00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.260
You got to trust me out of it as possible. And that's what he tried to do.

383
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.980
So even though Zuko is gonna record all this footage,

384
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:08.000
put it up online later, someone who's going to be watching that could be like,

385
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.480
this was a trick. It's all smoke and mirrors. It's like stage magic. I'm like,

386
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:13.100
sure. You say you recorded everything,

387
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:15.260
but maybe you manipulated with the footage.

388
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.800
Maybe you didn't even set the cameras up the way you said you did it. So,

389
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.980
so what to go decided to do is get in touch with all these guys all over the

390
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:25.340
world and try and decentralize this trust.

391
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.150
So there were six stations each with their own compute nodes,

392
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:34.151
security cameras set up ready to help Zuko make this big random number,

393
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.741
the private key.

394
00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:40.741
So each of the six stations was actually creating one piece of this key.

395
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.110
That way, there'll be no one person that makes the entire key.

396
00:24:45.111 --> 00:24:49.520
It'll just be these little pieces that actually won't ever come in contact with

397
00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:54.200
one another. The idea was nobody will actually have the key itself.

398
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.380
Hope this works. So everyone's got their compute node powered on.

399
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.583
And then

400
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.060
<v 3>diagnostics complete presenter. When you're ready to begin the ceremony,</v>

401
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.830
the ceremony begins. Okay. Now this is it's top secret part.

402
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.300
There's this, this special box. Yeah. We have to make sure that nobody can, uh,

403
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.480
guess or read this secret. Zuko closes the blinds.

404
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:24.060
And so I'm going to cover my keyboard with this special box.

405
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.980
So I took a cardboard box that one of the computers had come in and sawed it in

406
00:25:28.981 --> 00:25:31.740
half so that it was a half of a cardboard box.

407
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.290
<v 0>He put it over the keyboard of the compute node.</v>

408
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.020
<v 3>Yeah. Hold on. [inaudible] they're ready.</v>

409
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.030
And then I slid my hands under the cardboard box and then

410
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.530
<v 0>he starts punching in all these random letters and numbers into the compute</v>

411
00:25:49.531 --> 00:25:53.790
node. Just like pound on that. Just like black cat walking across the computer.

412
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.570
Okay. Yep. And once he's done,

413
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.260
<v 3>I think we're done with the cardboard box.</v>

414
00:25:58.261 --> 00:26:00.570
It served its purpose to know we can auction it on Ebay.

415
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.020
<v 0>What the compute node does is it takes all those random characters and it</v>

416
00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:08.460
combines it with more random characters that are generated inside the computer

417
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.970
until finally it creates a part of the key

418
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.090
<v 3>and each of the other five participants had to do the same thing.</v>

419
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.490
<v 0>DC made their piece of the key. Florida, Texas, Slovenia,</v>

420
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.320
Canada. Okay,

421
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.610
so you've got one key broken into six pieces and the next step is to get all of

422
00:26:26.611 --> 00:26:30.990
those pieces to work together to create one thing, which is z cash.

423
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.830
And you want to do this in such a way that those pieces never touch each other,

424
00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:39.831
that they remain hidden so that no person could ever get their hands on the

425
00:26:40.111 --> 00:26:43.860
power of the whole key. Whew. Yeah.

426
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.130
So thank God there's convoluted math to save the day.

427
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.990
I think it's a good time to just say what was happening three to one. So

428
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.810
<v 4>first things first, the guy in California gets on the horn,</v>

429
00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.130
the stations are Andrew. He gives everyone basically like the batting order,

430
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.023
and then

431
00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.500
he sends a message called the go message to station one

432
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:11.380
station, one guy, and he's compute, no, do some math on his piece of the key.

433
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.610
Just finish his compute node,

434
00:27:15.611 --> 00:27:20.440
spits out a number and then it burns it onto DVD. Why DVD?

435
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.230
Because all the guys at these stations have ripped out the Wifi and their

436
00:27:23.231 --> 00:27:26.740
compute node because we don't want the hacker to be able to hack into the

437
00:27:26.741 --> 00:27:30.250
compute node. This, by the way, has a pretty cool name. It's called air gapped.

438
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.450
You have a protective field basically around the computer that holds the secret

439
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:39.830
a field of. Anyway,

440
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.070
once the computer is done burning to this DVD,

441
00:27:43.071 --> 00:27:45.860
the guide station one takes it and walks it to another computer,

442
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.440
uploads it to the Internet. Okay, great. And then the guide station to this

443
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:53.330
Guy Peter van Valkenberg.

444
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.530
So what happens is the software I run on my connected computer downloads,

445
00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.420
that little answer puts it onto DVD.

446
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.950
I take the DVD out of the connected computer, walk across the air gap,

447
00:28:03.951 --> 00:28:08.440
if you will. Then the compute node takes that little answer,

448
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.880
combines it with Peter's piece of a key, and then

449
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.460
math so knows that computing. Again,

450
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:17.320
the compute node keeps Peter's piece of the key.

451
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.930
His secret spits out the new answer, a bigger answer,

452
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.820
and then I write on a different DVD.

453
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.260
That new answer takes it out of the compute node,

454
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:29.080
brings it back across the air gap. The networked computer uploads his answer.

455
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.330
Then station three grabs it, combines it with their key,

456
00:28:31.331 --> 00:28:32.800
gets a little bit more of an answer.

457
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.820
Then station for your node gets to do its thing, same thing,

458
00:28:36.821 --> 00:28:38.200
DVD across the air gap,

459
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.080
combine it with their piece of the key like serious math,

460
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.500
and then you get a little bit more of the answer and just rinse, wash,

461
00:28:44.501 --> 00:28:49.270
repeat station five, six, back to the top of the order.

462
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.610
And throughout this entire process,

463
00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:55.600
the individual shards of the key are kept separate and secret.

464
00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.880
Yet together they're doing the math.

465
00:28:57.881 --> 00:29:02.110
It's getting closer and closer and closer to the final key that will launch z

466
00:29:02.111 --> 00:29:06.340
cash. Was there a like a, a Tinder in the air?

467
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.290
<v 0>No, I mean it really,</v>

468
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:15.020
it's Dick DDD DDT

469
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.950
<v 10>cards. I brought juggling balls. Cool.</v>

470
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.130
I can juggle three balls. That's what I brought it

471
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.640
<v 0>because the thing is every one of those math steps took about an hour,</v>

472
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.770
the list and they had to do like three full rotations through this order.

473
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.360
Oh Hey. Somebody told Moses.

474
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:40.450
So most of the weekend was just kind of sitting around waiting and waiting.

475
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.783
Anyone

476
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.890
<v 4>told Moses? Yeah. Um, so yeah,</v>

477
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.180
we're hanging out. Yeah, my computer just finish. Oh, good to know.

478
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.800
Uh, Zuko has brought along some pork rinds

479
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.230
and sour cream, but he's dipping, he's dipping pork runs and the sour cream.

480
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:05.710
Cool. I'm going to get our coffee also

481
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.630
<v 2>and napping,</v>

482
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.920
<v 4>which is the only sleeping that's happened. Like there's like, you know,</v>

483
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.823
an hour here,

484
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.423
<v 2>hour there.</v>

485
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.510
<v 4>And as the hours roll by, things are going really well.</v>

486
00:30:26.511 --> 00:30:29.810
People are getting their math done, they're passing along these answers.

487
00:30:29.811 --> 00:30:32.870
They're getting closer to having their key win.

488
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.180
Maybe halfway into the process,

489
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.570
things get strange.

490
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.800
They were each lying in their beds, just kind of chilling out.

491
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.670
Morgan was just waking, Zuko was playing on a tablet and then,

492
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.690
oh well I growed too.

493
00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.520
Oh, there's work to do back to work.

494
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.660
So Zuko gets up and he starts talking when, which is,

495
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.130
uh, my voice echoing back at me. His feedback,

496
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.940
<v 11>feedback loop started. You?</v>

497
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.830
No, like going beep, beep, beep, beep beep.

498
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.080
<v 4>Oh, it's like a what in Congress noise. Make it stop.</v>

499
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.240
I'm muting all my, my eggs. I don't know where it's feeding back from.

500
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.180
What was this one? If he like turns off the mic. Uh,

501
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.690
and so I was like, okay.

502
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.550
And he sits down at the Google hangout computer with that

503
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.540
<v 3>a tester? Yes sir.</v>

504
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:54.730
<v 4>This echo comes back and if you look at the video you see,</v>

505
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.700
he like just freezes

506
00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.013
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

507
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.260
<v 4>and then just turns his head to the left looking off camera.</v>

508
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.600
Why do we have a play out over there now?

509
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.631
At this point,

510
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:14.830
everyone in the room just sort of falls silent and is looking around. Yeah.

511
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:20.220
I start like pinpointing it to like the part of the room that has the security

512
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.820
cameras. Monitor,

513
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.540
<v 3>test, test. Where's this coming from? Test. Test.</v>

514
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.950
<v 4>I started listening to that and I'm like, I think it's coming from over here.</v>

515
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:33.660
But again, whoa. Stopped. And he said, uh, wait, wait a minute.

516
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.760
What? What is playing out over there?

517
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.010
<v 3>Test, test. And</v>

518
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.480
<v 4>I looked in the direction of Oregon's bed and then I turn around,</v>

519
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.850
I pick up my phone, it's my phone

520
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.560
and the echo is coming out of my speaker. It's coming out of your phone.

521
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.490
It's coming out of my phone.

522
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.450
<v 3>Why is your phone playing out? Yeah,</v>

523
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.010
if you don't stop. No, don't mess with it. I want to see what's going on.

524
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.490
It's playing out from this way.

525
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.280
<v 4>He Zeroes in on this mic that's on the corner of the computer that's doing the</v>

526
00:33:08.281 --> 00:33:11.040
Google hangouts. Did you connect your phone to this hangout?

527
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.830
He leans over to that [inaudible] starts fiddling with it.

528
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:17.783
What

529
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.720
it's doing from this way? Yeah. Yeah.

530
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.880
So is there a way he stands? He sits,

531
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.970
<v 3>it knows I coming from the lake. It's coming from,</v>

532
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.200
it's not coming from this week.

533
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.810
It's coming from the Google hangout because I just muted it and software now

534
00:33:36.811 --> 00:33:41.120
it's gone. So my voice, Google hangout. Okay.

535
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:42.530
Let's hear Peter's voice here.

536
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.153
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

537
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.640
<v 3>I want to test audio coming from you say some stuff.</v>

538
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.320
<v 12>Testing, testing all would match in the aid of that country. Yeah.</v>

539
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:57.280
Yeah.

540
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.220
<v 4>And then I think Sukkot says something like</v>

541
00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.500
<v 3>Warren Gay. Why is your phone playing audio from our Google hangout?</v>

542
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.860
<v 4>Why is our chat coming through your phone? Oh wait,</v>

543
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:14.370
so the audio coming out of her phone is not originating from in the room.

544
00:34:14.711 --> 00:34:15.544
It's,

545
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:20.640
it's somehow the Google hangout chat that's coming through phone.

546
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.590
Yes. It's so weird. Very weird.

547
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.620
It was like your cat had just turned into a monster or had just started talking

548
00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:32.260
to you or like just turned on you.

549
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.690
So I'm kneeling on the bed with it and I look at it and I think that's when I

550
00:34:39.061 --> 00:34:41.610
just like threw it, threw it on the bed

551
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.550
revulsion. So can you turn on the screen?

552
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.840
He picks up the phone from the end of her bed and hands it to her and is like,

553
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:55.550
can you pull up the screen? What all, what all apps are running on this phone?

554
00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.140
I don't run any apps.

555
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.460
<v 3>Is that doing video? Yeah,</v>

556
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.390
<v 4>I'm recording at this point.</v>

557
00:35:03.391 --> 00:35:08.370
The cameras have like swiveled so they're focused on the phone. Okay.

558
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.150
Um, I don't know. Should we throw it in the river?

559
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:14.703
No.

560
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:21.770
<v 3>Can you, is this android? Yup. How do you,</v>

561
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.770
can you like get a list of apps running like by swiping down from the top or

562
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:25.604
something?

563
00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.553
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

564
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.680
<v 4>I think. I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't,</v>

565
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.070
<v 3>how about that? I don't use this. If you swipe down, there's that thing,</v>

566
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.490
this next to the thing here. What about that thing?

567
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.910
<v 2>Yeah. Wait. Yes, but just give me a second. Give me a second.</v>

568
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.490
What's running here?

569
00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.970
<v 4>I don't see a hangouts app</v>

570
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.390
<v 3>running. I def, well,</v>

571
00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.180
I didn't test run a hangouts. I think it stops here. Listen to it.

572
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:12.910
Test, test, test.

573
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.100
<v 4>It's up, hasn't it? Suddenly the phone stops doing the weird thing.</v>

574
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:21.390
It was doing the freaky audio play out. Then it went away. It went away.

575
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.420
Which feels hackery eh? Yeah,

576
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.300
like the hackers have been had and they just realized it. Yeah.

577
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.200
That's what I think that there wasn't a tagger and they screwed up and

578
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.950
accidentally turned on the speaker. Now I feel paranoid.

579
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.960
Yeah. It's weird. Creepy. No, this isn't just like,

580
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:42.973
<v 2>I don't know.</v>

581
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:47.530
<v 3>I've been, what do you mean hacked? What kind of hacked have they been? Oh,</v>

582
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.540
you find out that the private messages similar has been had access to them.

583
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.430
Um, or that people have been, uh,

584
00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.580
sending messages spoofed to be from you to your friends or colleagues.

585
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.330
Okay. I've never had that happen.

586
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.720
Just kinda horrible. [inaudible]

587
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.570
<v 0>so eventually they just decided to turn off her phone.</v>

588
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:19.180
Now it becomes a more civilized conversation of, um, what are we gonna do?

589
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.370
And then Zuko said, yeah,

590
00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.520
<v 4>to me, would you like to donate your phone to science? Oh,</v>

591
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.950
that's like, I'd rather donate my body.

592
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.320
Uh,

593
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.240
<v 3>no. Well, what would it take for you to do it at your phone to science?</v>

594
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.150
<v 4>Oh, like in the current state of it right now. Without,</v>

595
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.080
without like, yeah, that's a problem. Leaving my, no way.

596
00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:54.330
Like that has so much of my work on it and my life.

597
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.610
I just think that, uh, well I don't think I have to justify it.

598
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.453
<v 2>Why?</v>

599
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.810
<v 3>That's right. You don't have to justify it,</v>

600
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.260
<v 2>but I mean,</v>

601
00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:14.950
<v 4>do you have, you have pictures and some pictures but not much.</v>

602
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:19.230
I put myself in your position. I would have been like, I feel

603
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.380
<v 0>okay, take it. I don't know. I start, I,</v>

604
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:28.300
but you were very immediately like the opposite. Yeah. That's a no to me.

605
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:33.580
Why? To me, my responsibility is not just to myself, you know,

606
00:38:33.581 --> 00:38:36.970
privacy is a shared resource is a she or it's a share.

607
00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:40.870
It's something we share with each other. Um, the responsibilities.

608
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.900
I will say this is one of the first stories where I get my,

609
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.580
what privacy and data protection like means me.

610
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.870
Like I remember when Morgan was telling me this story thinking if someone had

611
00:38:55.871 --> 00:39:00.430
hacked into Morgan's phone, how long had they been hacked in for?

612
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.900
And I talked to Morgan all the time. Like, oh, weird, I was kind of hacked,

613
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.620
you know? And then it's like, who else did you talk to? It was your tie. Oh,

614
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.980
your dad was Kinda hacked. Oh, oh crap.

615
00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.500
You exchanged those text messages that weren't on signal.

616
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.310
Half person was kind of hacked. And then suddenly it just dawned on me, Duh.

617
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.550
Like her privacy isn't just hers.

618
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.360
The things that are on my phone that are private or not only private for me,

619
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:28.480
they're private for, for anyone I was talking to and,

620
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.780
and I almost feel like I don't even have a right to give over that phone if I

621
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:38.170
haven't talked to the people that, that, that would be exposing,

622
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.330
like that's not fair. Like sometimes when people insist on privacy,

623
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.130
it can feel selfish. Yeah. But then you realize like, no,

624
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:49.030
like if one person doesn't insist on privacy,

625
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.440
kind of like a chink in the armor and like suddenly we're all vulnerable,

626
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.830
uh, for about an hour.

627
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.190
Morgan and Zuko go back and forth about what to do with her phone,

628
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:05.950
but they don't really reach a conclusion.

629
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.790
<v 4>I feel I need to walk around.</v>

630
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.380
Does anything can happen if I go take a little walk? Yeah.

631
00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:17.220
You're not going to miss much. Uh, it's, uh, it's planned or scheduled.

632
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:19.883
<v 2>Oh,</v>

633
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.070
<v 4>I'm just hesitating for no good reason.</v>

634
00:40:22.071 --> 00:40:24.320
I can't think of any reason for you not to take a walk.

635
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.540
I'm just Kinda freaked out. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You say stay here.

636
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.520
What? I said be safe out there. Enjoy.

637
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:39.500
Do you think I meant do you think I'm a secret agent? No,

638
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.240
I wasn't thinking that. Okay. I was thinking I was afraid for you. Oh,

639
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.320
I'm not afraid for me. Yeah, I'm not either. I was just feeling that way.

640
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:54.670
Okay. I'm going to take a walk cause I feel really claustrophobic. Good. Enjoy.

641
00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.830
<v 3>So then I had to decide what shall we do?</v>

642
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.680
Shall we abort a ceremony? Shall we,

643
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.330
um, focus our attention on some sort of investigation of Morgan's phone?

644
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.280
What shall we do?

645
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.990
<v 2>No.</v>

646
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:32.420
<v 3>Okay, here's the decision. Here's what we're going to do. Uh, get, get more,</v>

647
00:41:32.421 --> 00:41:34.400
gets phone out of. And otherwise

648
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.470
<v 0>no change. He figured if these people have hacked into Morgan's phone,</v>

649
00:41:39.471 --> 00:41:44.471
we have so many security measures in place that we can keep going and we'll

650
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:48.230
figure this out later. So basically what happens is like

651
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.100
Morgan comes back from our walk. Okay,

652
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:56.930
we're worry they still have another full day of the ceremony left.

653
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.780
Where does insert a blank DVD to burn disc keys in the press center.

654
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.713
Okay.

655
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.790
And then it gets to a point where they finally have the final key.

656
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.020
Okay, I'm pairing up the compute node, everybody, it's a big step.

657
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.850
And is there a high five a okay. It's unplugged.

658
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.710
No. Oh, we're done.

659
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.620
<v 2>Ah, and then</v>

660
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:30.500
<v 4>to sort of cap it off, the last step is, so I mean if you would,</v>

661
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:32.030
to use the angle grinder,

662
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.710
you can anchor everybody takes their a compute node and circle your lead.

663
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:37.933
Destroy that.

664
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:43.630
Because in the case that the computer holds like a ghostie fingerprint of that

665
00:42:44.121 --> 00:42:45.770
like original piece of the key,

666
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.230
<v 0>they just want it gone. We saw</v>

667
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.100
<v 4>Peter into pieces I missed,</v>

668
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:56.690
smashed the pieces with a hammer and dropped the crushed pieces into a giant

669
00:42:56.891 --> 00:42:57.724
bonfire.

670
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.183
<v 6>And that was that.</v>

671
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:15.480
<v 1>And now they were sort of at the moment where they're like, okay, well we,</v>

672
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.570
we actually did the technological like thing,

673
00:43:18.571 --> 00:43:23.571
which was we created the system and now the bigger question was did they create

674
00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:30.060
the alchemy that they needed to inspire trust?

675
00:43:30.061 --> 00:43:33.450
Like where all the protocols and the video footage and all that stuff.

676
00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:37.740
Was it all enough? Especially now that they have this phone thing happens,

677
00:43:37.741 --> 00:43:41.280
especially now that they have the phone thing and they're like, dude,

678
00:43:41.281 --> 00:43:45.210
we do what we needed to do to show the world that they want to buy into this

679
00:43:45.211 --> 00:43:46.044
thing.

680
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.600
<v 0>So five days after the ceremony ended in a currency began</v>

681
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.660
<v 4>to an insane fanfare. Really?</v>

682
00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.760
It was crazy.

683
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:04.350
Z cash is a cryptocurrency built on Bitcoin's code base that is dedicated to

684
00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:07.080
protecting your privacy till, oh gosh, you're gonna have to look.

685
00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:11.010
But I think it went up to like $4,000 a z one z cash coin.

686
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:16.070
It is the first digital currency to combine you and that is the bitcoin high at

687
00:44:17.191 --> 00:44:21.150
the time is like around 1400 so that's insane.

688
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.960
So if the goal on some level at the very beginning of this conversation was to

689
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.093
instead fire

690
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:31.140
<v 0>the community to then use it, it seems like it has, it has done that. Yeah. Yes.</v>

691
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.130
Do people

692
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.730
<v 4>continue to point back at this phone moment and wonder and speculate</v>

693
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.050
some yeah. People have. People want me to,

694
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.010
they want to know like how it resolves and how does it resolve? I mean,

695
00:44:44.011 --> 00:44:45.810
did you give him your phone?

696
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.590
So what actually happened was we went to this bonfire,

697
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.140
uh, and then by the end of it Dave, everybody was sort of rushing off.

698
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:59.700
I was rushing to the, to the airport and just like gave my phone to Sukkot

699
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.800
and was like, we'll talk about it. I trust you.

700
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:10.650
Don't do anything that I haven't agreed to. No. So you ended in the, in the,

701
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:14.600
in the, in the spirit of the whole endeavor in some way. Yup. Huh.

702
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:32.060
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

703
00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:32.893
<v 13>Molly Webster</v>

704
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.400
<v 3>get to tell you that we have to do it again.</v>

705
00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.360
<v 4>Well you have to go through all of this again</v>

706
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:43.410
<v 3>so we have to do it again because we're upgrading the cryptography in z cash.</v>

707
00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:44.500
Okay.

708
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.750
<v 4>God Man, what have you started?</v>

709
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.460
<v 3>We're going to do new ceremony, deploy new approved cryptography.</v>

710
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.900
We keep thinking of improvements. We want to make [inaudible] inventions

711
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:14.553
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

712
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.410
<v 13>this piece was produced by Molly Webster and Matt Kielty,</v>

713
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.910
the Denver ceremony station recordings were created by media maker Nathaniel

714
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:28.560
Kramer. Thanks Nat. And also thanks to his assistant Daniel Cooper. And lastly,

715
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:32.490
very special thanks to Morgan pack, her reporting on the ceremony.

716
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.230
Obviously with sort of the anchor for our piece,

717
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.760
and you can find her article at [inaudible] spectrum.

718
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.350
We will link you to it from radio lab.org. Okay.

719
00:46:43.351 --> 00:46:47.490
We will be back and Robert will be back with me, uh, in a couple of weeks.

720
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.580
I'm Jad ABIM Ryan, I'm Molly Webster. Thanks for listening.
