00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.267
- [Instructor] Now that
we know a little bit about

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:03.694
how to construct a unit normal vector

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:05.401
at any point in a curve,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.443
that's what we did in the last video,

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:10.921
I want to start exploring
an interesting expression.

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:15.921
So the expression is the line
integral around a closed loop,

00:00:16.598 --> 00:00:18.239
and we're gonna go in the positive,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.366
counterclockwise orientation,
of a vector field F,

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.081
dotted with the unit normal vector

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:25.553
at any point on that curve ds,

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:27.970
I'll write ds in magenta, ds.

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:36.209
So first let's conceptualize
what this is even saying,

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:38.127
and then let's manipulate it a little bit

00:00:38.127 --> 00:00:40.647
to see if we can come up with
and interesting conclusion.

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:41.981
We actually will manipulate it.

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:43.527
we'll use Green's theorem,

00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:44.467
and we're gonna actually come up

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:46.917
with a two-dimensional version
of the divergence theorem,

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:48.435
which all sounds very complicated,

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.879
but hopefully we can get a
little bit of an intuition for it

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.512
as to why it actually a
little bit of common sense.

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:55.900
So first, lets just think about this.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.471
So let me draw a coordinate plane here.

00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:01.554
So let me do it in white.

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:06.113
So this right over
here, that's our y-axis.

00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:08.226
That over there is our x-axis.

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:11.506
Let me draw ourselves my curve.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:14.355
So my curve might look something like...

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:17.104
I'll do it in the blue color.

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:20.058
So my curve might look
something like this, my contour,

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:22.754
and its going in the positive,

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:25.923
counterclockwise direction just like that.

00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:27.548
And now we have our vector field,

00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:29.200
and, just a reminder, we've
seen this multiple times.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.839
My vector field will associate a vector

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:34.919
with any point on the x-y plane,

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:39.042
and it can be defined as
some function of x and y,

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:41.029
actually, I'll call that P,

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:44.520
some function of x and y
times the i unit vector.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.083
So it says what the i component
of the vector field is

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:48.879
for any x and y point,

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.126
and then what the j component,

00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:53.626
or what we multiply the j component by

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:57.319
or the vertical component
by for any x and y point.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.517
So some function of x and y times i

00:01:59.517 --> 00:02:02.987
plus some other scalar
function of x and y times j.

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:04.566
And so, if you give me any point,

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.572
there'll be an associated vector with it.

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:08.808
Any point, there's an associated vector,

00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:10.978
depending on how we define this function.

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:13.692
But this expression right over here,

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:15.167
we're taking a line integral.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:19.132
We care specifically about
the points along this curve,

00:02:19.132 --> 00:02:21.535
along this contour right over here.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:24.069
And so let's think about what
this piece right over here

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.300
is actually telling us before we sum up

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.538
all of these infinitesimally small pieces.

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:32.425
So if we just take F dot n,

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:34.151
so let's just think about
a point on this curve.

00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:38.267
A point on this curve, maybe
this point right over here.

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:40.276
So associated with that
point, there is a vector.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:43.165
That's what the vector field does.

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:47.021
F might look something
like that right over there.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.437
So that might be F at that point,

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:50.701
and then we're gonna dot it

00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:53.010
with the unit normal vector at that point.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.225
So the unit normal vector
might look something like that.

00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:57.357
That would be n hat at that point.

00:02:57.357 --> 00:03:00.538
This is the vector field at that point.

00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:05.089
When you take the dot product,
you get a scaler quantity.

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.649
You essentially just get a
number and you might remember it

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.638
and there's several
videos where we go into

00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:10.974
detail about this but
that tells you how much

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:13.746
those two vectors go together.

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:16.424
It's essentially, if they're
completely orthogonal

00:03:16.424 --> 00:03:18.685
to each other you're gonna
get zero and if they go

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:21.176
completely in the same
direction it's essentially

00:03:21.176 --> 00:03:24.077
just gonna multiply their
magnitudes times each other.

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:26.477
And since you have a
unit normal vector here,

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:31.199
what this is essentially going
to give you is the magnitude

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.866
of the vector field F that
goes in the normal direction.

00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:41.233
So, think of it this way.

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:42.396
So let's think about the component of this

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:43.610
that goes in the normal direction.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.721
It might look something
like that, this would be

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:47.278
the component that goes
the tangential direction.

00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:50.315
So, this expression right
over here is going to give us

00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:53.292
the magnitude of this vector.

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:56.402
Let me write this down,
this right over here is the

00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:01.069
magnitude of the component
of F, in the normal direction

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:11.874
or in the same direction
as that unit normal vector.

00:04:11.874 --> 00:04:13.291
Normal direction.

00:04:15.224 --> 00:04:19.070
And then were gonna multiply
that times a very infinitely

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.035
small length of our contour,

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:22.945
of our curve right around that point.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.751
So were gonna multiply that thing,

00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.377
times this right over here.

00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:29.372
And so you might say, "Well,
you know, okay, I kind of

00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:31.445
"get what that is saying but

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:32.876
"how could this ever
be physically relevant,

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:34.422
"or what could be the intuition for what

00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:37.361
"this expression is even measuring?"

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.826
And to think about
that, I always visualize

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:41.351
this is in two dimensions.

00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.764
You will later do things like this

00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:44.237
in three dimensions, so imagine this is

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:46.794
a two dimensional universe
and we're studying gases.

00:04:46.794 --> 00:04:50.194
And so you have all these gas
particles in a two dimensional

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:52.884
universe so they only can have
kind of an x and y coordinate

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:55.527
and this vector field is essentially

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:58.296
telling you the velocity
at any point there.

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:00.411
So this is the velocity of
the particles at this point,

00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.820
this is the velocity of
particles at that point,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.101
that is the velocity of
particles at that point.

00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:08.503
And so, when you take F right
on this curve, that's the

00:05:08.503 --> 00:05:10.364
velocity of the particles at that point

00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:12.260
they're going in that direction.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.353
When you dot it with N it tells you,

00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:17.504
essentially, the speed going straight out

00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:19.796
right at that point, and then when

00:05:19.796 --> 00:05:21.213
you multiply that times ds,
you're essentially saying,

00:05:21.213 --> 00:05:25.130
at any given moment, how
fast, or at that point

00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:30.640
right over there on the curve,
how fast are the particles

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.140
exiting the curve?

00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:35.628
And so if you were to sum up all of them

00:05:35.628 --> 00:05:38.625
which is essentially what this
integral is doing with the

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.382
slight integral, it's essentially saying,

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:44.439
how fast are the particles
exiting this contour?

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.975
Are they even entering
the contour if you get

00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:48.189
a negative number?

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.100
But since were taking the
unit normal vector that

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.154
is outward-pointing, it's saying,

00:05:53.154 --> 00:05:55.607
"How fast are they exiting this thing?"

00:05:55.607 --> 00:05:57.010
If you've got a negative
number, that means

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.647
there might be some net entrance.

00:05:58.647 --> 00:06:02.525
So, this whole expression
is if you take that analogy,

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:04.134
it doesn't have to have that
physical representation,

00:06:04.134 --> 00:06:08.884
how fast are particles, are
two dimensional gas particles

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.777
exiting the contour?

00:06:19.552 --> 00:06:21.318
In the future, you can do three dimensions

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:22.815
where you have a surface and you can say,

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:25.099
"How fast are things
exiting this surface?"

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.984
And so let's start, now
that we hopefully have

00:06:26.984 --> 00:06:29.767
a decent conceptual understanding of what

00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:32.635
this could represent let's play
around with it a little bit,

00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:35.116
especially because we know
how to define a normal vector.

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:37.100
So, let's rewrite it using what we know

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.584
about how to construct a normal vector.

00:06:39.584 --> 00:06:41.577
So, if we rewrite it our
integral becomes this.

00:06:41.577 --> 00:06:46.410
We have our vector field F,
dotted with the normal vector.

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:50.678
The normal vector we can write this way.

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:55.261
A normal vector we saw was
dy times y minus dx times j.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.921
And then we had to divide
it by its magnitude.

00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:02.204
In order to make it a unit normal vector,

00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:03.428
the magnitude was this right over here,

00:07:03.428 --> 00:07:05.518
dx squared by dy squared,
which is the same thing

00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:09.699
as ds which is the same thing
as that little mini arc length

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:13.366
that infinitely small
length of our contour.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.422
So, we're going to divide it by ds.

00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:20.097
We're going to divide it by ds.

00:07:20.097 --> 00:07:22.480
And then we're going to
multiply it times ds.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.811
We're going to multiply it by ds.

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:26.200
And ds is just a scanner quality,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.145
and so we can actually even multiply

00:07:28.145 --> 00:07:31.875
this thing times ds before
taking the dot product

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:33.517
or vice versa.

00:07:33.517 --> 00:07:37.622
But these two things
are going to cancel out.

00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:40.492
And so we're essentially
left with F dot this thing

00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:41.559
right over here.

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:43.679
But we have F defined
right over here so let's

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:45.174
take the dot products.

00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:47.606
I'll just write the line
integral symbol again.

00:07:47.606 --> 00:07:50.681
We're going in the
counterclockwise direction.

00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:54.060
And when we evaluate and now let's in--

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.600
let me pick a color that I have not used.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.506
I may have used many colors
so I'll do yellow again.

00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:01.211
So now, let's evaluate
F dot this business.

00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:03.612
So, dot product fairly straightforward.

00:08:03.612 --> 00:08:07.029
You take the product of the x-components,

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:13.397
or essentially the magnitude
of the x-components.

00:08:13.397 --> 00:08:17.647
So, it's going to be P of
Y, P of xy, times the dy,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.407
plus the product of the
magnitudes of the y component

00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:32.779
or the j component.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:37.091
So it's going to be plus
Q of xy times minus dx,

00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:38.450
times negative dx.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.756
Well, that's going to give us

00:08:40.756 --> 00:08:44.423
negative Q of xy,
negative Q of xy times dx.

00:08:46.504 --> 00:08:48.330
So, this is kind of interesting statement.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.588
We've seen something not too
different from this before,

00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:54.416
when we saw even just the
definition of Green's theorem.

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:58.256
Let me rewrite here just so we remember.

00:08:58.256 --> 00:08:59.869
So, the definition when we
learned about Green's theorem,

00:08:59.869 --> 00:09:02.398
it told us if we're taking a
line integral over this contour

00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:05.387
and there's multiple ways
to write it, but one way

00:09:05.387 --> 00:09:08.512
that we often still see it,
and we've explored it already

00:09:08.512 --> 00:09:12.845
in our videos is if we were
to say M times dx plus N

00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:17.080
times dy, this is equal to--

00:09:18.338 --> 00:09:20.730
and I'm just restating
Green's theorem right here--

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.572
this is equal to the double
integral over the region

00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:26.322
that this contour surrounds of...

00:09:28.764 --> 00:09:31.704
And whatever function
you have here times dy,

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:35.621
you take the partial of
that with respect to X,

00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:41.437
the partial of N with respect to X,

00:09:41.437 --> 00:09:44.681
and from that we subtract
whatever was on the dx side,

00:09:44.681 --> 00:09:49.024
so the partial of M with
respect to Y, and then

00:09:49.024 --> 00:09:52.286
you could say times df,
dy, or you could say da,

00:09:52.286 --> 00:09:56.577
for the infinitesimally
small little chunk of area.

00:09:56.577 --> 00:09:59.160
So, I'm going to write DA here.

00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:03.534
All right, dx, dy, or it could be dy.

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:08.521
Or we might as well write DA here,

00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:10.678
since we're speaking in generalizations,

00:10:10.678 --> 00:10:14.212
where DA is an infinitely
small little chunk of area.

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:15.877
So this here, this is just a
restatement of Green's theorem

00:10:15.877 --> 00:10:17.877
so we already know this.

00:10:20.099 --> 00:10:21.969
This is a restatement of Green's Theorem

00:10:21.969 --> 00:10:23.534
and how can we apply it here?

00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:25.134
Well, it's the same thing.
You have a little bit

00:10:25.134 --> 00:10:28.177
of sine differences but you
can apply Green's theorem here.

00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:31.711
This is going to be equal
to the double integral

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.378
over the region that
this contour surrounds.

00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:38.322
And then, what we want to do is,

00:10:38.322 --> 00:10:41.382
we want to look at whatever
is the function that

00:10:41.382 --> 00:10:43.013
is being multiplied by the dy.

00:10:43.013 --> 00:10:45.150
In this case, this is the function

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.850
that is being multiplied times the dy.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.368
And we want to take the partial
of that in respect to X.

00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:53.132
So, we're going to take the
partial of P with respect to X.

00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:56.382
So, the partial of P with respect to X.

00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:01.224
And then from that we
are going to subtract.

00:11:01.224 --> 00:11:03.443
We're going to subtract
the other function,

00:11:03.443 --> 00:11:05.131
whatever's being multiplied by dx,

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:09.453
we're going to take the partial
of that with respect to Y.

00:11:09.453 --> 00:11:11.802
So here, we're going to take the partial

00:11:11.802 --> 00:11:13.212
of this whole thing with respect to Y,

00:11:13.212 --> 00:11:14.493
but we have a negative out here

00:11:14.493 --> 00:11:18.481
so it's going to be minus partial of Q

00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:21.534
with respect to Y and then we have DA,

00:11:21.534 --> 00:11:23.134
and obviously, these two negatives,

00:11:23.134 --> 00:11:25.597
subtracting the negative
just gives you a positive.

00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:28.380
So this is going to be
equal to the double integral

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.146
over the region.

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:31.819
And maybe you already
see where this is going,

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:34.180
maybe getting a little bit excited.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.797
The partial of P with respect to X plus

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:40.047
the partial of Q with respect to Y, dA.

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:44.202
Now, okay, I took the partial of...

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:45.976
"Well, what is this telling me, Sal?"

00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:47.555
Well, look at this thing right over here.

00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:51.076
P was originally the
function that was telling us

00:11:51.076 --> 00:11:53.181
the magnitude in the X direction.

00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:55.229
Q was telling us the
magnitude of the Y direction.

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:57.421
We're taking the partial
of this with respect to X,

00:11:57.421 --> 00:11:59.755
we're taking the partial
of this with respect

00:11:59.755 --> 00:12:00.966
to Y and we're summing them.

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:03.966
This is exactly the divergence of F.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:06.825
And if that doesn't make any sense,

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:08.706
go watch the video on divergence.

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:12.373
This right over here
is the divergence of F.

00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:17.661
This is the divergence
by definition, really,

00:12:17.661 --> 00:12:20.072
this is the divergence
of our vector field F.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.097
And so, we have a very interesting thing.

00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:24.412
This thing that we saw was
the original expression

00:12:24.412 --> 00:12:26.582
that we started studying
which is essentially saying,

00:12:26.582 --> 00:12:28.072
"What's the speed at which the particles

00:12:28.072 --> 00:12:30.128
"are exiting this surface?"

00:12:30.128 --> 00:12:32.901
We now get it in terms of
this little expression.

00:12:32.901 --> 00:12:35.255
And we'll interpret in an intuitive way

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.663
and a little bit of this in a little bit.

00:12:38.663 --> 00:12:42.885
So this is equal to the
divergent of F times dA

00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:46.529
over the whole region
so the double integral.

00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:50.637
So, we're summing up the
divergence of F times

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:52.778
the infinite, really small
little chunk over there

00:12:52.778 --> 00:12:54.667
and we're summing them
up over the whole region.

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:57.083
Now, why does that make intuitive sense?

00:12:57.083 --> 00:13:00.041
And for you to realize why
it makes intuitive sense,

00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:02.387
you just have to remind
yourself what the divergence is.

00:13:02.387 --> 00:13:06.738
Divergence is a measure of
whether things are expanding

00:13:06.738 --> 00:13:09.574
or diverging or kind of contracting.

00:13:09.574 --> 00:13:13.574
If you have a point over
here where around that,

00:13:14.697 --> 00:13:17.207
the particles are kind of
moving away from each other,

00:13:17.207 --> 00:13:19.281
you would have a positive divergence here.

00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:21.976
If you have a point,
sometimes called a sync,

00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:26.096
where all of the particles
are kind of condensing

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:30.045
or converging you would have
a negative divergence here.

00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:32.016
And now, so this should
make a lot of sense.

00:13:32.016 --> 00:13:35.474
You take any little
infinitely small area in this,

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:37.729
you take any little infinitely small area,

00:13:37.729 --> 00:13:42.018
and then multiply that
times the divergence there.

00:13:42.018 --> 00:13:43.894
So, the more divergence, you're going

00:13:43.894 --> 00:13:45.476
to get a larger number and then you sum

00:13:45.476 --> 00:13:48.403
it up across the entire region.

00:13:48.403 --> 00:13:50.142
That makes a lot of sense.

00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:53.015
The more diverging that's
going on through your region,

00:13:53.015 --> 00:13:55.325
obviously, the more stuff that's going

00:13:55.325 --> 00:13:59.305
to be exiting your boundary over here.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.539
So, it actually makes complete sense,

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.674
or hopefully it makes a
little bit of complete sense.

00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:06.526
If you were to see how fast are things

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:07.873
exiting the surface, it's
really the two dimensional flux,

00:14:07.873 --> 00:14:10.315
how fast are things exiting the surface,

00:14:10.315 --> 00:14:12.215
and you take the sum of all of them,

00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:14.281
that's going to be the
same thing of summing

00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:18.192
all of the divergences over this area

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:20.802
that the contour is surrounding.

00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:22.835
So, hopefully that makes a
little bit of sense to you.

00:14:22.835 --> 00:14:24.745
And it's actually another way of

00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:26.627
kind of thinking about Green's Theorem.

00:14:26.627 --> 00:14:29.405
And we also have just
explored what we just said,

00:14:29.405 --> 00:14:31.552
this expression that the
divergence summed over

00:14:31.552 --> 00:14:34.045
this region over here is the
same thing as the F dot n

00:14:34.045 --> 00:14:35.482
over the contour.

00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:38.398
That is, essentially, the two dimensional

00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:39.981
divergence theorem.
