00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:12.259
 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:22.409
Medical education has over the years been famous for producing clinicians who are at the top

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:30.539
of the profession. When I left Grady
Hospital as a resident, I went over to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:40.260
Vietnam and I walked into emergency room at a M.A.S.H. unit in Vietnam and  a very harried nurse

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.980
came to me and said "Where you from?"
and I said "My training was at Emory,"

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.079
and she said, "Thank God! We need people
from Emory, they're the only people

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.190
the only people who know how to do things!"
I like to tell applicants to our house staff

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:11.939
training program that we had
graduates who had gone to Antarctica,

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.420
where they were the physicians for the
small band of scientists in the research

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.520
station in Antarctica. We also have had a
graduate who was one of the physicians

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.360
to this Senate. And then we had Sonny
Carter, a remarkable graduate of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.340
Emory Medical School who came to our house
staff program and who became an

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:47.520
astronaut and went one of the Challengers
around the world. And so as I like to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.159
tell the applicants, the people who
finished the program here at Emory

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.750
are sublime physicians. They're totally
confident they can handle any problem that

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.170
comes up and they stretch from the South
Pole to the Senate to going around the Earth,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.989
and so that's the kind of people
that Emory has turned out and is famous for.
