1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,523
Okay.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,210
Hey, what's going on It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:07,760
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,020
ahhh

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm just checking in on you
so you know your week's going.

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,780
How are you guys doing?
I am in a growth mode when

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,400
I'm in an awesome mood. Huh? You in a bad
mood. You're driving in your car there.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,450
You're stuck in traffic. Is this
some dose in front of you? Huh?

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,200
Not doing what you want them to do.
Oh,

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,610
you having a little dictated thoughts?

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,150
Are you thinking about what you
would do if you were in power?

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,510
What you would do with this person?
What rule you would implement? You know,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,170
it's gotta be awesome being a dictator.
You know what I mean?

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,810
How much fun is it on the 4th
of July to shoot off fireworks?

15
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,540
Can you imagine how much fun that fatty
over in North Korea is having? Okay.

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,710
You know how hard did they fucking laugh
when they shot that one over Japan?

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,440
Yeah,

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,800
I mean, Jesus Christ, man. How the fuck
did everybody had to go to bed after that?

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,290
Then he's just laying in bed,
so fucking amped up.

20
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,930
Like I can't believe we just did dead man.
It was crazy.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,700
We just freaked out a whole country
calling each other up.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,670
Do the whole world's talking about us,
man.

23
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,310
What a fucking lunatic.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,470
What if there was a malfunction on
that fucking thing in any, you just,

25
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:29,200
it landed that guy.
I'm telling you man,

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,990
he's got to lay off the fucking sweet.

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,400
All that sugar is just sees there's
not fucking, it's not doing them good.

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,850
He's not making sound decisions.

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,900
Thank God we have such a
level headed guy or an arson.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,090
Oh my God. Yeah. You know,

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,980
watching the dead zone was always scary.

32
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,080
Watching the Martin Sheen
character get into power,

33
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:59,081
but I think to go back and watch it now
is going to be just picture and Donald

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,320
Trump go on. The birds are away
gentlemen and doing that little thing.

35
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:02,831
He does what?

36
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,800
He puts his index finger and his thumb
together and this other three fingers are

37
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:08,210
in the air.
The birds of the way,

38
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,810
the greatest birds ever. Um, yeah.

39
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:14,381
Jesus Christ.

40
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:17,950
All this fucking ended day shit talking
about these goddamn tornadoes one after

41
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:21,490
another. You know, like some
battle royal of fucking weather.

42
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,890
I did Rogan's show last night.

43
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,740
There's nothing worse than hanging out
with somebody who's fucking informed.

44
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,230
He starts [inaudible] was
forming out over the Atlantic.

45
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,010
They'd never seen anything like this.
This is the size of fucking Florida.

46
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,050
Hey Bill,
how much time do you want to do tonight?

47
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,470
I was in a fucking panic. He was like
laughing at me. Go look at Bill's face.

48
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:47,100
Look at Bill's face. It's like, Yo, what
look am I supposed to have on my face?

49
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,720
When you basically said
you know everything,

50
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,280
you had everything but Jesus fucking
crowd surfing in on that fucking thing.

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,530
Not to mention I'm going to Mississippi
and Alabama this weekend. Okay.

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,930
Mesh the Yanno. Bam. The harder the FCC,

53
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,160
I'm going to tell you something right now
is a fucking northern white boy. Yanky.

54
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,100
I fucking love Mississippi and Alabama.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,820
I love that whole fucking stretcher.
The south,

56
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,080
how they all shit on each other and then
it's somehow lands in Louisiana's lap,

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,430
right? You're in Georgia and all
they do is make fun, Alabama, right?

58
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,670
Alabama's like, Fuck Georgia. Hey,
at least we're not Mississippi.

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,130
And Mississippi is like, what
the fuck do you want from us? Oh,

60
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,170
why don't you go to Shreveport?
Tell me how you fucking enjoy that.

61
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,210
What you call over there, free
fair. And I cook no catfish. Um,

62
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,400
I love it down there.
Granted I'm fucking white.

63
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,380
You don't even have to claim
started marching, you know,

64
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,230
and I got all fucking nervous. I could
fake my way through it, you know,

65
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,690
give them a nod, you know,
slip into a store real quick.

66
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,480
Um, anyways, I don't know if I
mentioned this the other day. Um,

67
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,800
I started playing catch again. You know,
something I used to do as a kid. Good,

68
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,970
clean, fun. You just need a glove of
ball in a friend, maybe a baseball kid,

69
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,870
baseball kid, baseball year. Um,

70
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,840
and it's just been a good time.
This is how old I am.

71
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,650
I did 45 minutes a catio and
I guess I didn't stretch.

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,650
I thought I stretched and I went out
there and a oh Billy fucking old face.

73
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:23,600
Does not have the range of
motion he used to have. And, um,

74
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,230
my buddy through the ball and it bounced
in front of me and just sort of was

75
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,200
skidding along the ground
and I bent down to get it.

76
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,810
I anticipated it was going to hop.

77
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,190
I don't know what I was doing or I just
didn't get down far enough and went

78
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:37,360
right by my glove and hit right
in my left ghost white calf.

79
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,190
And,
um,

80
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,300
it only hurt as much as it
should or hurt like a baseball.

81
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:46,830
However fast it was traveling and hit the
ground, it's slowed down a little bit.

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,570
May then Nice Pete sound
against my Alabaster Shit.

83
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:53,740
Right then I thought I was fine.
And within like three throws,

84
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,800
my calf just fucking tightened up.
Like you couldn't believe.

85
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,090
And for like the last three days,
it's felt like it's on fire.

86
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,620
Right?
Like if you thought of my,

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,410
like if they were going to
do a documentary on my calf,

88
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,180
they would go to van Halen one,

89
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,800
and they would take that clip from
David Lee Roth singing, I'm on fire.

90
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,950
Um, it's been fucking killing
me. So, uh, I got to have a,

91
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,040
I don't know, not going to have
somebody fucking work it out, but, uh,

92
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,180
my buddy gave me this shit.
This is a free advertisement.

93
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:32,570
This is how fucking good these
guys are. It's called, uh,

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,240
Arna Care Gel. They ever heard of
this stuff? It's, it's homeopathic.

95
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:42,060
What'd you call me?
Homeopathic medicine aren't a care,

96
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,910
it's for muscle pain and stiffness,
swelling from injuries and bruising.

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,500
I get pain relief. This shit, I'm
telling you, it's fucking magic.

98
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,060
I put this stuff on, I felt like
I was bionic, you know, like,

99
00:05:55,061 --> 00:06:00,050
like in that you could fix me
like a machine. One of those,

100
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:04,100
one of those fucking Moonraker movies,
blade runner, whatever the fuck it is.

101
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,230
Like they would just open my calf and it
looked like the inside of a fucking mix

102
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,450
. Uh, I just felt like that they just,
that think just cited a couple of wires,

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,090
wires together. I mean,
it didn't cure me. I mean,

104
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,060
it definitely feel like now I just feel
like I got hit with a golf ball rather

105
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:17,894
than a baseball.

106
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,293
MMM.

107
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,840
You know at the end of a drive,
I'm not saying right off the tee,

108
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,920
let's not get crazy hurricanes thinking
crazy. So anyways, that's the free thing.

109
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,881
I'll tell you right now,

110
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:31,140
if you fucking ever do something before
you go to them as suits and having

111
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,100
fucking unglue your
muscles and get all that,

112
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,220
what's out of there as my a person says,
ah,

113
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,700
Arna cared gel a r.

114
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,730
N I care Arnie care like Arnold
Palmer except it's I a r n.

115
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,630
I. O. N e. S. H. A. R. N. I.
E. Right here. Why don't you
confuse the people. See goes,

116
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:56,050
I had to do with something free massage
because I lost another advertiser.

117
00:06:56,051 --> 00:07:00,940
I can't believe it. I put my fucking
heart and soul into these fucking reads.

118
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,150
You know I could go monotone.

119
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,690
Yeah,

120
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,310
I can just read what they wrote.

121
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,690
Yeah,

122
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,090
I could just go with they've won.

123
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:10,990
Okay,

124
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,810
but you're not going to listen.
And I know this

125
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,850
show must go on even if I'm
reading fucking advertising,

126
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,070
but those fucking console over there.

127
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,260
Okay.

128
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,470
The most suits people.
That was a one and done.

129
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,800
How dare you bring up hand jobs that at
the end of the, uh, the massage rates,

130
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,430
what the fuck are you talking about?

131
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,660
That's a huge part of your industry.

132
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,200
Yeah.

133
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,540
Either you're doing it,
oh, you're not doing it

134
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,260
the fuck.

135
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,450
It's like you're, you're in food.
You're selling some sort of food.

136
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,510
Now bring up trans fat.
Like that's not a big fucking issue.

137
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,540
That is a hot button issue.

138
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,960
That debt is debt that needs to be
brought up in front of Congress. When I,

139
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,310
I stand by that.

140
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,620
Yeah.

141
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,620
If you can legalize weed at a state level,

142
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,880
you should be able to legalize a hand
job at the state level. Okay. Now,

143
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:11,670
if the feds come in and she's got your
Dick in her hand, you're on. You're wrong.

144
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,790
All right. You're on your fucking own.
You're Joe Pesci and good fellas out. No.

145
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,660
Right.
That's it.

146
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,110
Okay.

147
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,000
That's it. All right ladies.
It does it mean anything to
us. Doesn't mean anything.

148
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,760
If you ever saw the look on the woman's
face when she's doing it. I mean,

149
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:32,390
I swear to God, I swear to God,
like it's just like she, she,

150
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,810
I don't know what she did.
Thinking fucking zillion other things.

151
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,300
Yeah.

152
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,520
Which is probably usually where you got
this part of your safe place, you know,

153
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:43,020
when you're fucking employed in
the sex industry. Um, no. Well,

154
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:45,030
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
I don't know what to tell you.

155
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:48,450
So because I brought that up, which
was funny enough to make people listen,

156
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,590
they walked away from all the fucking
massages that my listeners would have got.

157
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,270
Yeah.

158
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,370
No, I'm not. Galatia of them
would have been expecting

159
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,120
some sort of a hand release at the end
of it. So maybe, maybe that's okay.

160
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,230
I'll take that. Okay. I will
take that part of it. All right.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,170
When I'm getting tired of
these deeds, deeds of the
blue aprons, the nature boxes,

162
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:10,530
you know,

163
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,530
they're all good when the sun's out in
the second they see a little bit of rough

164
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:15,110
water.
Yeah.

165
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,700
What do they do? They
fucking pull up stakes. Those
fucking phony bastards. Okay.

166
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,810
And they take their aprons
and they fucking twats and
they go to somebody else's

167
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:25,760
podcast. And I'll tell you right
now, I've had enough of it.

168
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,883
Okay.

169
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,400
Do My,

170
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,020
my gosh darn just over here to try and
put a little bit of money in your pocket.

171
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,310
You know, how many people do you
think at that fucking massage place?

172
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,470
I've actually gone to a massage
parlor and gotten fucking jerked off.

173
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:45,420
How many do you know what I mean?
Fucking out.

174
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,070
She's done. Don't get me fucking
started. You know, I got in the, uh,

175
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:50,950
all my dogs back in town.
Oh Cleo,

176
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,160
this is back in town. I just saw
her, she fucking freaked out.

177
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,940
We had a nice little battle.
Royal took over this awesome fucking hike.

178
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,510
Love that Goddamn dog. And I love
that. She's got a great family now.

179
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:07,380
Family babies. And uh, she put
her on a little bit of weight.

180
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,310
He's new people. They're, they're
uh, they're treating her right. Um,

181
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,410
but she looked awesome and, uh, same
old dog dragged me down the street,

182
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,150
all frigging excited and that
type of stuff. So, uh, it's out.

183
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,570
It all worked out nice,
happy.

184
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:25,050
And then she got a little more white
whiskers around her muzzle, you know,

185
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,230
becoming very distinguished and stately.

186
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,210
These last couple of a bump in a less, I
don't know, gave away almost a year ago.

187
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,450
Fucking unbelievable. Nine months
ago, 10 months ago, nine months ago,

188
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,870
nine months ago. Um, so it was great
to see her and everything. So, uh,

189
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,560
she's in town for like 10 days. Uh,
I'm leaving for a couple of days,

190
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,870
but that's what I do when she comes to
town and take for a hike every morning.

191
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,800
It's kind of been working out. I get to
see her every couple of months, you know,

192
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,820
she's not around where she can eat
my baby or attack somebody else,

193
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,910
so she'll never get put down and I
won't have to deal with an unbelievable

194
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,190
amount of guilty. And she's got a
great house and she's, you know,

195
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:04,080
she's fattened up. It's fucking perfect.
I love it. She's not fat people.

196
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,850
I'm just saying she is living a good
life, full of energy. Still a ball.

197
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:13,640
A muscle though. Good Lord.
That's a strong dog. Um,

198
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,730
I still miss the hell out of her,
but I definitely made the right decision.

199
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:20,150
So anyways, um, what's going on tonight?

200
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,960
All the Patriots yet
that dad, Buddha, Buddha,

201
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,860
[inaudible] and ignore your fucking wife.

202
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,180
Football season is back bay.
Ignore the arcade.

203
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:44,030
Sorry. Just blow out years. Ignore the
hurricanes. Ignore all fatty up there.

204
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,400
Fucking doesn't it fucking
guy in North Korea.

205
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,850
Did he look like he's the same shape
is like curly from the fucking three

206
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:54,610
stooges? You know, I'd love to see
me. They just the old football sketch,

207
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,133
you know,

208
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,550
can somebody please do that just for a
sort of photoshopping we'll do in that

209
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:04,130
thing. Does that run in, in placing
all Rah rob doing that whole thing.

210
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,540
Just put his head on Curley's
fucking body. It's what he's,

211
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,730
he's Kim Jong Howard.

212
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,890
Uh, how many times would I be put
to death in that fucking country?

213
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:23,390
I can't even fucking imagine.
I can't even imagine. You know,

214
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,020
you gotta go up swinging. You
got to go out like a fucking,
you know, Gino, I'm not,

215
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:30,110
I, you know, sit down
was fucking brutal guy.

216
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:32,420
But did you see how that guy went out?
He was standing there.

217
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,820
He's just stare at them all in the eye.
They put the rope around his neck.

218
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,050
He's still talking shit. Yeah. Go
Fuck Yourself. Go Fuck Yourself.

219
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,680
You know it's fucking any people always
talk about do it. When you in Philly,

220
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,710
how did you handle that? Fucked and
wiggled a little sit down. Handled.

221
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,620
He was talking shit. Right? Until
they fucking Yank that rope. Oh,

222
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,900
that lever or whatever. Oh Man. Crying
like a little girl. Go on. I'm sorry.

223
00:12:55,901 --> 00:13:00,650
I'm sorry. Sweep the streets.
Anything you want. Yeah,

224
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,480
yeah. That's how I would've gone out.
Gone into the next world and God,

225
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,700
what did you spend looking at
me shaking his head, you know,

226
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,730
of all the awful fucking things you did.
I think you're bitchy way.

227
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:11,990
You left was the worst.

228
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,540
Get out of my sight and then they just
pushes the button and go down to health.

229
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,540
I go down a hill and I burn forever.

230
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,490
And that's a good fucking thing to bring
up. When you got two gigs coming up,

231
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:26,770
Mississippi and Alabama, I'm
gonna tell you, go down. May Cbl,

232
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,480
bamboulas mother fuckers ain't got
computers yet. They ain't got computers.

233
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,750
I'll tell you, they still eat. They'll
still lead. And I don't tell you,

234
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:37,020
give him some clothes line. They'll
catch catfish and dry your overalls,

235
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,520
mother fuckers,
they can live off the land.

236
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,970
You know, if, uh, what Rogan was
telling me was even remotely true. Um,

237
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,660
him and Jimmy Dore are the
two most informed fucking
comedians I know as far as

238
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:55,080
they actually pay attention to shit.
Somebody says some shit.

239
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,950
And rather than just taking it as truth,
they actually will fucking research it.

240
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:03,750
They'll have guests on their
show. I cannot recommend
their podcasts. And G, uh,

241
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,680
his by Joe's podcast
in a, um, Jimmy doors,

242
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,360
youtube show highly enough, and you don't
always have to fucking agree with them,

243
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:13,290
but I'll tell you right now,

244
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,620
I want to tell you something right
now if you fucking watch and see.

245
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,170
And then if you're watching Fox News
and Shit, I mean, that's, you know,

246
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,430
those people. Okay, I'm going to, you
know, no offense to other comedians,

247
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:25,800
but they're definitely more well
spoken than a lot of us. But, you know,

248
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,280
I'm just saying there is
a whole, uh, you know,

249
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,550
just look at how they read
the ads on those channels
and then, you know, exactly,

250
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:39,240
like they're, they're, they're,
they're stuck between the lines.

251
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,370
I don't know what I'm talking about. Um,
uh, fuck that reminded me of something.

252
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:48,360
I just forgot it. What the hell was
it? Something I wanted to talk about.

253
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,970
Not News,
not be in between the lines.

254
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,920
Ah, fuck it. It's over. Um,
so anyways, I am going to, uh,

255
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,750
one of my favorite things
and I don't have a lot of,

256
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,510
I don't have any favorite
things in Mississippi yet
because I've only been there

257
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:04,830
one time,
two times.

258
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,250
One time I was driving up to the airport
after I watched the Patriots beat the

259
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:12,000
rams and the Superbowl and I just couldn't
get a flight into fucking New Orleans.

260
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:16,920
So we drove, we flew in and out of
fucking, uh, what does it, Baton Rouge,

261
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,570
Mississippi. I'm kidding.
Um, Jackson, Jackson,

262
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:25,980
Mississippi. And um, and then I
did a gig there a few years ago.

263
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,080
Um, so, ah, I don't know a
lot about it, but Alabama,

264
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,690
Alabama, I'll taste him. What I love about
Alabama, I love the, uh, first of all,

265
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,410
the fucking, I'm going to the Alabama
game, by the way, on Saturday.

266
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,363
Hello?

267
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,210
It's an afternoon game against
mighty mighty Fresno state.

268
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,710
They can surprise some people.

269
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,193
MMM.

270
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,150
So I'm going to go there. I'm not going
to be a con and root against Alabama.

271
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:57,500
I really don't hate the crimson tide.
It's just that they are the fucking,

272
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,170
the Yankees or the Patriots,
so f of fleeing on,

273
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,940
they're the ones that always fucking,
you know, uh, winning, right. So, uh,

274
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,930
we'll Yankees,
you know,

275
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,600
they've won enough even though
they haven't won since 2009, two.

276
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,990
There's still the fucking Yankee
sitting on 27. You know what I mean?

277
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,793
MMM.

278
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,400
I just couldn't become a college
fan and jump on that bandwagon.

279
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:20,790
Like if I was watching the NFL, I would
fucking root against the Patriots to,

280
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,900
that's what you do with you. If you
just what you do, it's what you do.

281
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,290
You don't just jump on the fucking big
bandwagon. I'm like, Roger Clemens.

282
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,960
When he joined the Yankees after
they'd already one fucking three.

283
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,693
MMM.

284
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,500
I would say,
yeah,

285
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,990
yeah,

286
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,450
yeah. That's, that's how, that's why I
root against them. So when I go there,

287
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,550
I'm not going to be a cop.
I'm going to root for Alabama,

288
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,930
but there's a major part of me that wants
to bet Fresno state and just start the

289
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:52,080
game up. Like, you know,
it's 57 to nothing,

290
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,120
but you know what it is.

291
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,530
Nick Saban has an intensity slash anger.

292
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,750
Slash inability.
I'm telling you to drown a puppy that I,

293
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:10,320
I just know that even as second string,
it's just going to keep, you know,

294
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,560
running up the points because they
don't want to deal with it in practice.

295
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,810
You know that they didn't score another
fucking 30 points against Fresno's

296
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,820
number one,
I don't know anything about Fresno state.

297
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not trying to disrespect Fresno.
Okay.

298
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,910
Now if you like me and you watch any
sort of basic cable stuff about gangs or

299
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:32,490
prisons or anything, they
always, it's, you know,

300
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:36,250
the second they start one of those shows,
you can literally turn over an hour.

301
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,540
Glass is sand and it's not getting maybe
at halfway through before they ended up

302
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:43,350
in Fresno. And then there's
always that guy, you know,

303
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,670
with the Bandana all the way up to
under resides Bay Bandana on his head.

304
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:49,080
And then the dark sunglasses,

305
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,930
they have his voice altered named Burton
or burden care. But you're aware of

306
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,860
[inaudible] you can understand where
they're saying right. I'll talk to him.

307
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,370
[inaudible] not good. My
Eric's would call. Um,

308
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,640
so I'm not trying to fuck with Fresno.
All right.

309
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:16,641
Everybody knows that fucking stretch
between La and San Francisco.

310
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:20,040
You don't know what the
fuck goes on out there.

311
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,050
Charlie Manson lived somewhere up there.
All right. There's a nice national park.

312
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,090
There's a bunch of people growing
food. But other than that, you know,

313
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,650
I don't know what goes on other than it's
really hot and a lot of people grew up

314
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,990
career board mirror.
So I don't have any fun,

315
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,970
not trying to fucking shit on Fresno.
Okay.

316
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,390
I'm just a praise pasty freckled guy
trying to go to a football game. So I'm,

317
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm working with del Rey and fucking Joe
Botnick, the Rosebowl tailgate legend.

318
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,531
And A,

319
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:53,790
we're doing a Gig at some casino in a
missed ship and then were in Alabama.

320
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,240
And when I go down, Bam, I got placed.
I liked to eat every time I go there,

321
00:18:57,241 --> 00:19:01,110
first time I went there,
a fan came. Remember how I
found out by bond gold. EBAC,

322
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,363
time saws.

323
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,690
Barbecue started stands
for smart ass Wilson's.

324
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,120
I always go there.
They have a Manet's based barbecue sauce.

325
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:15,840
Swear to God. It's white. You like,
there's no way that's going to taste good.

326
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:19,140
You eat it. You like
Jesus. Fucking delicious.

327
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,630
Jesus Christ. Is that delicious?
So, um, that's a good time. Um,

328
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,870
I'm actually thinking of
coming back again next year.

329
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,420
I'm going to do quick kick here and then
think I'm going to come back next year.

330
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:34,080
Do a little bit of a bigger show
and next GM and go to Talladega.

331
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,910
I went to Daytona 500. I'm going to go
Talladega next. I gotta go to that man.

332
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,170
I used to always watch that with hair
game in a scold main car. Cale Yarborough.

333
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,530
I'm fucking, uh, what's
his fate? Rusty Wallace.

334
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,560
Daryl hawala trip.
Who else was fucking running back then?

335
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,250
Richard Petty was winded.

336
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,630
Now I told you I used to buy
all the fucking model cars.

337
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,360
I'd build them and put the
stickers on them and shit.

338
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:03,450
I used to always skip the engine because
they just wanted to get to the fucking

339
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,600
car part and I wouldn't let it dry
and I wouldn't let the paint dry.

340
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:09,270
I was just too fucking,
they always came out like shit.

341
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,040
That was glue all over the place because
I've just too impatient, you know?

342
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,480
I wish I could buy one of those models
again and actually just take the time to

343
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:22,260
see if I could do it right.
Like the people who really did it right.

344
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:26,970
They would paint all the parts before
they even took it off that plastic grid

345
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:31,971
and they would let it dry for like a day
and then they would just slowly put the

346
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,180
whole fucking thing together and
it was a fucking work of that.

347
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,550
I would never do that.
I was all, you know,

348
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,120
you know as the worst was when you'd
remember the decals and he'd soak them in

349
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:45,630
the warm water, then they'd all start
coming off and you were like fuck.

350
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:48,130
And they would roll up
and all look like shit.

351
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,400
They'd be put on lead like
an angle, you know? Then you,

352
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,780
then you had like the older guys,
right?

353
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:57,430
And they had a little thing
like parent tweezers, all right,

354
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,650
they'd have a pair of tweezers
and that little fucking, you know,

355
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,150
Julie or glasses on and they
put it on and look unbelievable.

356
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,860
And I always wish I had the
patience to do that and I don't.

357
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,900
And that's why stand up comedy has been
the only thing that I was ever good at

358
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,910
is because it is just going up there
and just fucking letting you add go.

359
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,720
And I kind of learned something this
week within in a frustrating way,

360
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,950
trying to learn drums. And it's just
like to do, you have to fucking sit down.

361
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,640
And if you want to learn something,
you have to take a big breath.

362
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,360
You have to relax and you
have to start really slow.

363
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,770
And I've known this for fucking years.
I've seen everybody talk about it.

364
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:43,540
Some of the most monster players ever
talk about how slow they start a new idea.

365
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,890
But the whole thing is, you know, with
all this information on the Internet,

366
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:52,440
you can be like, well, what bpms is this
song? It's 115 and then you just thinking,

367
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,630
I can get it you,
you 10 feet.

368
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,580
And so you start playing it like
95 when you should be like 65.

369
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,500
So that's my new shit.
I got to fucking relax.

370
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,120
I got to pick like one or two things
and just stick with that for a while,

371
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:10,150
just like you would with the model,
right? Just leave those pieces on there.

372
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,580
Paint the fucking thing and walk away.

373
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,060
Just let it dry. So, um, anyways,

374
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:22,310
I know I'm a fucking mess here. I'm all
over. I'm all over the Goddamn map. Uh,

375
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,100
22 minutes of fucking talking shit. All
right, we've got six reads here. People,

376
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,360
you know, these fucking reads
like these, these advertisers,

377
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,920
this is becoming like a
special forces, you know, or,

378
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,480
or a fucking some sort of military
operation here. It's like, you know,

379
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,410
most of you will. All right, um,

380
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,010
private pile infantry. You're made
it all right. Draft kings, everybody.

381
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,031
Oh,

382
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:53,740
is this the perfect read for tonight or
what fantasy football season is finally

383
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,583
fucking,

384
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,480
and there's no better way to get closer
to the game you love with draft kings.

385
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:05,170
One week fantasy fucking
football draft kings is hosting a

386
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,990
$100,000 or 50 grand after
taxes contest this Sunday.

387
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,470
That is totally free.
Free, free, free to enter.

388
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,810
And if you draft the perfect lineup,
you can win $1 billion.

389
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:23,570
In other words, the odds of you doing
that as fucking, you know, I dunno,

390
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,720
it's pretty fucking difficult.
It's,

391
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:29,110
the odds of them have actually taken your
junk and make it into a perfect pussy.

392
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:31,210
You know, we're not there yet. Okay.

393
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:35,180
But it doesn't stop these brave fucking
people from still trying with draft

394
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,014
kings.

395
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,200
There are many ways to play choose between
public contexts with big cash prizes

396
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,050
or private context tests where you can
compete against a group of your friends.

397
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,940
Draftkings also has the beginner and
casual content contests where you can,

398
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,270
where you'll play against people.
I have to get glasses. Well,

399
00:23:56,271 --> 00:24:00,070
you'll play against people of a
similar skill level. Everybody gets,

400
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,780
the best part is you get to draft a new
team each week without any commitment.

401
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,300
Where is this going?

I would say like $706 million mans.

409
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,640
You could make 700 Steve Austin's and

are@draftkings.com eligibility
restrictions apply.

413
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:58,490
See draft kings.com for details.
Eligibility restriction.

414
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:02,090
That means their own employees probably
can't play, I would think. All right.

415
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,100
Oh Shit. Look, I'll snap.
Look who's back. Oh,

416
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,950
club looking good.
Doesn't have to cost a fortune.

417
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,410
Fan Club is revolutionizing the
way men shop at five o' clock.

418
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,910
Geez, I've never had found a thing that
says their name more than these people.

419
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,950
They found a way to make great looking
clothes affordable for everyone who

420
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,540
Faffel clip.

421
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,230
Also understands that your
time is extremely valuable.

422
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:34,130
Why wasted at the mall or wandering
around in the stores each month?

Oh, lift everybody. Oh Jesus Christ.

453
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:32,050
Look who's back. It's Lyft.
You don't want to lift. Knows.

454
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,350
They know that their drivers are
what keeps them moving. Well,

455
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:36,370
that's what the fuck you do.

456
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,783
Okay.

457
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,790
Do you know what Koch knows
if you're thirsty,

458
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,960
so they do everything they could do to
make sure their drivers are happy on

459
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:47,794
every trip.

460
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,000
Lyft is the ride sharing company that
believes in treating its people better.

461
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,920
Lift believes that being a ride share
drivers should be fun if you're having a

462
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:59,110
good time.
So are their passengers.

463
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,200
If you're choosing a ride
sharing company to drive for,

464
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,120
go with the company
that treats you better.

465
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:08,950
Lift lift was the first to offer in APP,
uh,

466
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,760
tipping. When you drive for
Lyft, you keep 100% of the tips.

467
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:16,600
Drivers get paid over $200 million in
tips. Since the feature was introduced,

468
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,430
express pay lets drivers get paid
almost instantly instead of four weeks.

469
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,910
Lyft has even taken the
guesswork out of pickups.

470
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:30,060
The new amp amp device uses isn't that
APP color coding to help passengers find

471
00:28:33,221 --> 00:28:36,370
their drivers. You can earn hundreds
of dollars a week plus tips. One,

472
00:28:36,371 --> 00:28:39,520
earn more money, drive more. It's never
been easy to give yourself a raise.

473
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,330
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

474
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,240
Maybe that's why nine out
of 10 on Lyft riders, uh,

475
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,940
get a perfect five star rating.

476
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:52,360
So joined the ride sharing company that
believes in treating his people better.

great talent and or the importance of

485
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:29,010

business. I'll tell you right now,

486
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:32,730
finding town is easy, but to find
great channel wall, that's really hard,

487
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,600
especially if you want to be

534
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:56,000
You know what I watched the other day,
I watched an episode at Tj fucking hookah.

535
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,100
The,
I will tell you this right now,

536
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:03,101
the funniest running you will ever see
in your life by William Shatner and his

537
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:08,440
fucking partner. Um, all
they do is their concert.

538
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,370
They always have like a fucking wide
shot and they show TJ hooker running like

539
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,170
he runs for like six seconds every
shot. It's like, why? I would,

540
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,210
you know what it is,
is they had it,

541
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:24,810
they had to fucking do an hours 22 or I
forget what a full season was back then.

542
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,650
I'm only 22 episodes of an hour long show.

543
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:31,250
That's 22 hours of television
will actually with the, uh,

544
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,180
what the commercials, eight minutes per
half hour, 44 minutes they had right.

545
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,200
44 minutes of fucking Shit Times 22.

546
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,780
I mean, it's, it's like
where we came up short again.

547
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,970
We'll just have William
Shatner run a little longer.

548
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,100
Can TJ hooker like run half the length
of a football field before he catches up

549
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,870
to somebody a third of his fucking age?

550
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,170
I saw the one, uh, I gotta
get this actress name.

551
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,000
Um, he was one, he was one of my, uh,

552
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,910
one of my favorite actors when I
was growing up. He was in colors.

553
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,580
He was a Latino duty, got hit by a drunk
driver, unfortunately was like 37 or 30,

554
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:17,690
38 years old. Hang on, I gotta get
this guy's name. Ah, let's see. Colors.

555
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,790
I am DB. I didn't know Don
Cheadle was in that movie.

556
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,730
I got to watch that again.
That'd be one of his earliest ones.

557
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:30,620
I am a nightmare walking. Um,
it's something silver, I believe.

558
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,600
Trinidad Silva. So he was
in this episode of, um,

559
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,200
this episode of,
uh,

560
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,710
Tj hooker and it was fucking hilarious
because all of a sudden TJ hooker when

561
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:46,280
he's talking to them would throw in some
fucking Latino words and it was only

562
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:51,200
like shit that like a let white
people know, like cake pasta,

563
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,970
fucking Agua. He said at one point, well
maybe if you stop back to like a polo,

564
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,500
like he, he threw in like
chicken and it's just like, yeah,

565
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,580
that's because the writing staff
ordered El Polo local that day.

566
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,820
But Trinidad silver, I believe
he was in the jerk. Um,

567
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,600
I think he was in the, Oh, you know
what, when I look up this fucking,

568
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,010
this guy was amazing.
He was in Hill street blues.

569
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,650
He was in the jerk.
Yeah.

570
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,760
He actually died during the filming of
a underrated movie by Weird Al Yankovic

571
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:26,810
called UHF. I was in colors. Uh, yeah.

572
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:31,450
Hill street blues stir crazy.
He had such shame.

573
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:34,940
He died so young yet he was on Barney
Miller. I mean that this Gulu grant,

574
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,510
the white shadow, the jerk,
this guys imdv page Beretta.

575
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,980
You know, granted you played, played a
perp in all of those fucking things here.

576
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,370
He's probably fixing games in the white
shadow. That's the way it was back then.

577
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,400
And this guy somehow got through it
and open the doors for a bunch of other

578
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,350
people. I hadn't seen him in a
while. It was great to see him.

579
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:57,270
Trinidad silver look 'em up. Uh,
1950 to 1988. Unfortunately he was,

580
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,160
uh, he was only 38 years
old. Jesus Christ. Um,

581
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,880
phenomenal actor though. Alright.
Legal Zoom. Last one here. Legal Zoom.

582
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,500
When you run your own business,
when you know that time equals money,

583
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,360
it's not just an old saying,
it's a fact. So why Hawaii?

584
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,390
Her waste your valuable time dealing with
an issue that legal zoom can help you

585
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:23,040
with. I'm doing this because I'm going
to Mississippi and Alabama this weekend.

586
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,090
You may already know, put your hands in
the air and feel the spirit of Jesus.

587
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,420
They had over 2 million people have
used legal zoom to start their business,

588
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,210
but legal zoom services don't end there.

589
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,660
There's a kingdom waiting
for you after your kit.

590
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,690
They're fucking website run in a
business comes with taxes, contracts,

591
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:40,620
hiring employees,

592
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,840
and the devil basically a lot of
fine print and we all know that.

593
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:46,470
The devil's in the details.
I'm sorry.

594
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,550
That's why legal zone built a network
of independent attorneys licensed in all

595
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,750
50 states, not in Puerto
Rico, not in our territories,

596
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,780
just the 50 states they can provide the
advice you need to get through the daily

597
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:02,370
grind of running your business. By
the way, everybody in Puerto Rico,

598

Good Lord.

599
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,830
Good Lord, man. Okay,

me and I live in fucking la.

601
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:14,810

people doing out there. Uh,

hours since legal zoom is in a law

all right,

610
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:44,380
I think that's the podcast for this week.

611
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:47,980
I'm going to go play some drums and he
barely relaxed. No, actually I'm not.

612
00:37:47,981 --> 00:37:50,920
I gotta go write an episode.
Episode 309

613
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,200
of a

614
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,890
season three of f is for
family were actually this week.

615
00:37:56,891 --> 00:38:00,130
We're working on a episode seven
so you not in the business.

616
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:02,710
The reason why it's called three
Oh nine three means season three.

617
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,060
I never knew what that meant. I finally
figured it out after three seasons.

618
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:08,980
I remember last year,
it's like we're working on two oh four,

619
00:38:08,981 --> 00:38:13,510
and I'd be sitting in the back of the
room, like we're not on the 204th episode.

620
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,640
But I knew that sounded
stupid. So I finally just, I
finally just asked, you know,

621
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,880
and I felt it.
I felt all the rangers looking at me like,

622
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:26,860
why is this hacky comedian in this
fucking room? You know, when it hurts,

623
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,480
I'm not kidding. My work with great
people in case any of them are listening.

624
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,210
And if you're the one person in
the writers from listening to your,

625
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,610
my favorite writer, the Bro, um,

626
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,590
so I'm writing the episode three Oh nine.
That's why I have to do today.

627
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:42,310
I just do like,

628
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:47,310
I do two scenes a day and
then I get through the script
and then I do like three

629
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,350
or four passes. I didn't do that last
year, but this year I'm going to do it.

630
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:54,520
And then, uh, I bring it in and
then everybody just guts the thing.

631
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:56,440
And maybe like three jokes make it,
but you know,

632
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:57,850
it's all about making that template.

633
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:00,490
And that's the game that everybody
fucking place. All right,

634
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,730
so that's the podcast.
Let's go pats

635
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,670
Dr fucking year off.
Right?

636
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,120
Who's going to step into Edelman shoes
before he comes back for the wonderful

637
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:14,560
playoff run? Okay. I hope it doesn't
come back too soon. You know?

638
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,820
Do you know why Edelman got hurt?

639
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:20,140
That was the curse of the
nude ESPN magazine issue.

640
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,783
You know what I mean?
I,

641
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,360
I can't remember the last time I laughed
harder than watching him jump through

642
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:29,860
the air, catch a ball and have it over
his junk. Is he through through the year?

643
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:33,610
That was one of the funniest
fucking things I've ever seen.

644
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:36,920
I just don't understand how a woman,
I don't know, maybe I guess what,

645
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,310
I just don't understand
how any level that is.

646
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:43,830
Anything other than fucking hilarious
naked men are for,

647
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,240
they were just funny.
I used to do a bit,

648
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:48,580
my accident and naked
man is one of two things.

649
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:51,100
It's either funny or scary
depending on what's happening.

650
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:54,910
Like if you're at a game and a naked
guy runs across the fucking field,

651
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:57,730
I mean you're fucking on the
ground laughing. However,

652
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:01,660
if you're walking home late at night and
a naked guy jumps out of Bush, like, ah,

653
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,920
that's the scariest fucking
thing you'll ever see, right.

654
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:09,280
I'd rather see a fucking rattlesnake,
you know,

655
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,430
I would rather see that and I'm
terrified of fucking snakes. Okay.

656
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:16,620
Then to have some fucking naked
jump out of a fucking Bush. Um,

657
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,040
I probably shouldn't just giving out
that information. All right. Anyways,

658
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,640
do let's troll them.
Um, anyways. All right.

659
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:29,290
That's the a the podcast for a this
Thursday. I have a great weekend.

660
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,890
You can't enjoy the football game tonight.
That college football this weekend.

661
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:37,270
Maybe tune into Alabama, Fresno
state. I will be there. I'll be there.

662
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:42,250
And a thank you to everybody
in Mississippi and Alabama
for a buying the tickets.

663
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:45,830
I'm going to come out there
with my Yankee Bullshit and uh,

664
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,830
telling you guys once again why
you lost that war. Uh, all right.

665
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,491
Enjoy the,
uh,

666
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:55,390
the music here and we're going to have
another half hour stuff from a classic

667
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,710
podcast from a Thursday gone by in a
year that already happened or possibly

668
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:01,870
early this year. I don't
know what it is. All right.

669
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,773
That's

670
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,393
[inaudible].

671
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,163
[inaudible] [inaudible]

672
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,733
[inaudible]

673
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,050
hey,
what's going on?

674
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,860
It's built bar and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

675
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:16,130
September 7th,
2009.

676
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,300
Happy Labor Day.
Happy Labor Day.

677
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,950
What are you guys doing today? Huh?
With your big bad days off? Uh,

678
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:28,820
what are you doing? You're laying
around you becoming fat fucks.

679
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,140
What are you doing when you barbecue?

680
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,250
When we're going over to Carol's
and we're going to have a barbecue.

681
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,320
Do you want to come Steven? No, I don't.

682
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,150
I want to fucking drink and
forget that I married you, Carol.

683
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,990
I'm sorry. I'm going to fuck. I'm
moving some shit around right now.

684
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,460
This is the Monday morning caught podcast.
Almost said cod past podcasts.

685
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:53,650
I'm actually gonna try to do some,
uh,

686
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,890
something different this week because
it's such a special fucking holiday cause

687
00:42:57,891 --> 00:42:58,790
it is Labor Day.

688
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,890
Why do they go Lou [inaudible] I'm sorry.

689
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,290
I always have to do a tribute
to fucking eighties comedy.

690
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,190
I'm actually watching a fucking, I watch
too much sports this weekend and I just,

691
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:15,020
uh, I was watching the end of the Colorado
Colorado state football game and right

692
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:18,230
after it, um, I take best
damn tough man, you know,

693
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:21,230
cause it game always goes
longer than its allotted,

694
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,530
so you have to take the next show,
listen to this fucking spares.

695
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,480
He goes by the name of the coach.

696
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,740
This is the classic example of a scared
guy before a fight and he's trying to

697
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,300
turn that fear into like
some sort of fucking, uh,

698
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,260
courage. But it works. This guy goes
by the coach. This is hilarious.

699
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,530
They're actually showing them right
now, he's getting a, his gloves put on,

700
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:43,520
listen to this maniac

701
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,063
popped up.

702
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,220
I don't know you,
you're to hear that.

703
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,690
But basically you standing
there and he just goes like,

704
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:05,650
it's show time and then he just snaps.
It choked out and just, you got to,

705
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,410
I'm sorry, I don't even know if this
is even going to translate, but I got,

706
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:11,060
I got to get the rest of this shit here.

707
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,070
I got to get the other thing
that he fucking says here.

708
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,490
What the fuck is wrong with this stupid
piece of shit? Fucking God damn cable.

709
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,880
Anybody else have this fucking
problem with your cable?

710
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,280
All right now for this,
I'm going to make,

711
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:30,890
did I just delete it? You
fucking cunt. Alright. Whatever.

712
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,500
God Damn.
I thought I was going to be such that,

713
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:37,501
that was like my big fucking different
beginning that I was just going to have

714
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:41,160
there and I just ended up deleting
it because my fucking cables sucks.

715
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,070
Now what are you going to
do? It's a holiday, right?

716
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,710
I shouldn't even be doing this. So
anyway, so the next time they, they,

717
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,980
they come to him,
he's screaming some more.

718
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,410
So he goes out there and of course
he doesn't know how to fight.

719
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:56,340
He flailing or flailing around with
this dude. And in the end, you know,

720
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:01,320
he gets knocked on his ass and he,
and he loses. So it's, it's every,

721
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:04,680
basically, every time they show
the guy, he, he would say one,

722
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,240
the first little thing he would say
quietly and then he would just completely

723
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:13,530
flip out. I can't fucking believe I
got, I deleted that. What an asshole.

724
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,300
So whatever. The guy ends up losing in the
end of the fight, he goes, uh, he goes,

725
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:22,350
I'm ready for some more. I already
bleeding yet. And then he just snapped.

726
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,750
I buying yet.

727
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,620
Ah, fuck. I don't know what Co,
what sport that guy, coaches.

728
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:33,270
But if I was playing on his team,

729
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:36,330
I would run through a fucking
wall for that guy. You know,

730
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,020
I don't know all the pens. Depends
on your personality. You know,

731
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:44,190
I like maniacs like that. God dammit.
Why? I can't believe that. Fuck.

732
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:46,530
I knew that was going to happen. I
knew it was going to happen. You know,

733
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,200
it's the worst.
It was not on every bad enough.

734
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:53,150
If I had to try and rewind it and get
back to where the hell it was, but then I,

735
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:56,400
I, it comes up with a delete thing and
I accidentally deleted it. I'm sorry.

736
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:00,510
Everybody. Ah, fuck. Where the
hell do you go from here? Um,

737
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,260
it's Labor Day. What exactly are
you supposed to do on labor day?

738
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,060
Am I supposed to observe something
for all the people who died at work?

739
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,390
Do they have a little parade?
Do you guys like parades?

740
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:17,250
Those little pathetic things with the
mediocrely talented people of your town

741
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:18,840
marched down your fucking street.

742
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,920
There's not the worst when you come from
a small town. It's just a numbers game.

743
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:25,740
I mean, how many truly fucking
talented people can there be?

744
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,760
But somehow they still have to
put together a band. You know,

745
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:34,230
some chick with braces playing a
fucking flute marching down the street.

746
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,230
And then they always end it with like
a fire engine just trying to drown out

747
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:41,510
your bad local band.
We aim eh,

748
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,950
or everybody's singing in monotone.

749
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:46,920
A bunch of dentists and accountants
sitting there with their fucking weird ass

750
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:51,510
looking kids. God Ah, ah, ah, ah.

751
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,200
Do they do that today?
Is that what you're supposed to do?

752
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,230
Am I supposed to be dressed up
like it's the revolutionary war?

753
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,710
Reenacting something? I've
gotta be honest with you. Uh,

754
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,700
Labor Day feels like every other fucking
day to me because I'm a comedian and

755
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:09,810
I'm always sitting in my underwear
at fucking 12 noon. All right?

756
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:13,260
That's why I do this. Do you think I
want to make you fucking people laugh?

757
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:14,250
I don't,
I don't.

758
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,930
I just remember when I was 14 sitting in
my underwear eating toast one day on a

759
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:20,160
Saturday morning and I was thinking,

760
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:24,990
I want to be fucking great if I
could do this every day. You know,

761
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,680
wake up, watch cartoons,
wrestle with my fucking dog,

762
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,360
you know, and just have absolutely
no responsibility whatsoever.

763
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:36,700
And I gotta tell you something.
I made that dream come true.

764
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,590
We get worried when you die. God's
just going to be looking at the video,

765
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:42,490
your life,
you know,

766
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:44,770
just looking at it then kind of
glancing over at you and just,

767
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,300
just shaking his head. Haley, you
get one shot at this and this is,

768
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:50,134
this is what you did.

769
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,600
Do you realize that you spend over 98,000
hours of your life in your underwear?

770
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,170
And I'm not even counting when you were
fucking sleeping. Oh, speaking of that,

771
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:03,730
the other day I met him.
Still on, I'm still sorry.

772
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,180
Nia just walked by laughing at
me like I'm an idiot. I, um,

773
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,230
I'm still on European time.
Um,

774
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:14,530
today was the first day I actually got
up at nine o'clock. I've basically,

775
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:19,060
I have been when I was over in Sweden.
How did you feel about that?

776
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,540
When I was over in Sweden,
uh, last week, um, Clia,

777
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:27,220
what are you doing?
You stop walking around like a creep.

778
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,690
My dog is like most big
dogs there. Uh, she's at,

779
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:34,810
she doesn't realize how big she is and uh,
so she's,

780
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,650
but she's not afraid of a
lot of things. Uh, you know,

781
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:42,490
she's not afraid of other dogs, but
hardwood floors scare the shit out of her,

782
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,550
so she's so worried that
she's going to be slipping.

783
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,260
She walks like really slowly in daintily
all around the apartment and it looks

784
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,740
like she's going to like sneak up
on you or something. That's right.

785
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:55,540
Just laid out.
All right.

786
00:48:59,010 --> 00:48:59,540
Woo.

787
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,180
Ooh, I got to teach her how to howl. Oh,

788
00:49:02,181 --> 00:49:04,850
you guys want to see something
fucking adorable. Do you want to see?

789
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:06,170
You want to see something that we'll,
we'll,

790
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:11,380
we'll make you actually believe again in
whatever the fuck you stopped believing

791
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:16,880
in. Go on Youtube and search a boxer, B o,

792
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:17,180
x,

793
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:22,180
e r and baby and there's a little baby
playing with a boxer and I'm telling you

794
00:49:22,971 --> 00:49:26,990
it's, it's, it's one of the most adorable
things you'll ever see. You know,

795
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:31,040
there would be less violence in the
world if everybody watched this video.

796
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,460
Actually that's not true. Everyone would
watch the video and then the second,

797
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:38,000
somebody next to you in, ah, yeah,

798
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,240
the rage would come back and you'd want
to just fucking blast him in the face.

799
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:45,620
But whatever. I digress. Let me get
back to what I was talking about. Um,

800
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:49,550
so anyways, so I have been when
I was over in speed and yeah,

801
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,270
I was up all night and uh,

802
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,930
and then I would sleep all day like
that awful heavy metal song by that band

803
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:59,960
slaughter and read that.
That's when you knew it was over.

804
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,620
Everybody said it was over when fucking
nirvana came out. No, it wasn't.

805
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:05,810
It was over when slaughter came out.
Slaughter,

806
00:50:05,811 --> 00:50:09,710
slaughtered the rest of hair metal.
That awful guys voice

807
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,493
sleep.

808
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,800
No, it isn't right. It
isn't. It's fucking terrible.

809
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,850
Um, anyways, I'm plowing
ahead here. So, uh,

810
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,870
I finally got used to the time over in
Sweden and then I came back to the states

811
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,360
and now I'm on Sweden time.

812
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:34,361
So basically I have been up every fucking
night watching old football clips and

813
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:40,040
whatnot on uh, on the Internet and
I call it like, you guys all, uh,

814
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:45,110
sent me emails going, I swear to
good. I don't work for the NFL man.

815
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,160
Just tell me where I can see them.
Where do you see all the videos?

816
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:51,950
Where is the main site where
everybody watches videos?

817
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:53,690
That's where the fuck they are.
Okay.

818
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,570
It rhymes with Mu Lube. Um, anyways,

819
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,810
so I, that's what I've been doing
late at night. I've been watching, um,

820
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,520
these fucking videos and uh,
what am I trying to say here?

821
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,070
I don't know what happened. So yeah.
So I fall asleep at la about six,

822
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:12,620
six 30 in the morning.
I sleep until one in the afternoon.

823
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:15,110
That's what has been happening to me. I
feel like a fucking drug addict. Right.

824
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,230
So evidently yesterday,
um,

825
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,790
I was passed out and for some
reason I was in the nude.

826
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,710
All right, go ahead. Visualize that
one face down in the fucking nude.

827
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:32,711
And my girlfriend took a picture of me
because she thought it was funny and um,

828
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,540
I saw it and I,
I don't know,

829
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,070
I never really had a, Oh look, I never
thought it was a good looking guy,

830
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:42,830
but I thought it was all right.
I saw myself lay in there,

831
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:46,670
Butt ass naked and I got to met.
Dude, I look like a fucking cadaver.

832
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,960
That was the worst part. It's not that I
looked out of shape. I'm in decent shape.

833
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:56,870
I just look like somebody just
said fished me out of a river.

834
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,160
That's the only way I could describe it.

835
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,730
The only thing missing was bill
Curtis, his voice, just narrating.

836
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,080
I'm Bill Curtis,
a pasty frankly,

837
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,020
man was fished out of fuck
head river the other day,

838
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,880
this sleepy little town with their, with
the fuck. I was gonna say Memorial Day.

839
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:20,780
What the fuck is it? Labor,
the Labor Day parade. Hey,

840
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:24,500
stupid cunt with braces playing a flute.
It looks perfect.

841
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,070
And looking at me right now, go and you
do not sound like Bill Curtis, whatever.

842
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,240
I fucking looks.
I was dead.

843
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:31,580
So I deleted the picture and
then my girlfriend felt bad.

844
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,810
She goes,
I thought it was cute.

845
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,610
I didn't want to make yourself
coaches his on. It was cute.

846
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:39,743
It wasn't cute.

847
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,140
Yeah,

848
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,630
no one should see what they
look like face down naked.

849
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,800
I can't shake the image. I hope you
guys aren't having your fucking,

850
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:54,970
your traditional Labor Day
breakfast while not while you're,

851
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:59,200
you're visualizing then Jesus Christ.
I look at that Rosetta stone.

852
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,940
Remember I was going to
learn how to speak Spanish.

853
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,830
I just hate when you do
that and you're like,

854
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:03,970
I'm gonna learn how to do this shit.

855
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,690
And you and you buy something and you
stick it on your bookshelf and it's just

856
00:53:07,691 --> 00:53:10,180
sitting there marking your
laziness for the next nine months.

857
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:14,470
I got that for Christmas last year and I
cannot fucking say anything in Spanish.

858
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,791
You don't really want to do.

859
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:19,250
I'm just gonna go down to home depot and
I'm going to find one of those Mexican

860
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:24,251
dudes who around always asking me if they
can fucking rewire my entire apartment

861
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:27,990
for fucking $3 because of the hardest,
hardest work fucking people on the planet.

862
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,390
Um,
and I'm just going to look at it.

863
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:35,010
Why don't I just give you 20 bucks and
teach you and you just teach me how to

864
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,490
speak Spanish. Is that okay? And then of
course it'd be like I had not died on.

865
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,810
Now I don't know what. Well, I know
I want, I want you to teach me,

866
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,200
teach Amelia how to speak a Idi,

867
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,740
done knowledge I'd done to leave saying I,

868
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,380
we just sit there for fucking an hour.

869
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,710
And then after while my forehead would
be sunburned and I would just give up,

870
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,210
that's probably what would happen.
And who knows,

871
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:00,780
maybe I would actually make a friend down
there and maybe he was really good at

872
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:02,700
an instrument and he
was slightly retarded.

873
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,350
And then I would draw that talent out.

874
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,970
And then some day a Freddie Prinze jr
would have a comeback play in that dude.

875
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,240
And we can make a little Oscar winning
movie. Maybe that could happen.

876
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,250
All right, let's plow ahead.
Let's, let's, let's get, let's,

877
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:21,240
let's actually be smart this week and
rather than waiting till 50 minutes into

878
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:23,580
this podcast to hype,
what the fuck I have to hype.

879
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,570
Why don't I hype what I have to
hype right fucking now. Okay,

880
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,381
well I'm going to do that.

881
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:32,430
And of course the second I sat at my
fucking computer shuts down. All right,

882
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:36,760
hang on a second. Um, all right. This week
I am going to be in Philadelphia, Penn,

883
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:41,370
Pennsylvania at the a helium
comedy club. Um, September 10th,

884
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,690
11th and 12th. Um, for the love of
God, please come out to that show.

885
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:47,550
Please show up.
And a,

886
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,490
I got a brand new hour at least
since the last time I'd been there,

887
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,580
cause I haven't been there in like a
year and a half and that's plenty of time

888
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:57,810
for me to come up with some new
shit. So, uh, please come down there.

889
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,250
I'm actually gonna try
to go to a Phillies game,

890
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:03,660
check out that new stadium and uh,
what else am I going to do there?

891
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,930
I think that's it. I think
that's it. You know what,

892
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,360
somebody actually sent me an email,
you know,

893
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,620
cause last week I was telling you guys
about how you can watch those Superbowls

894
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,160
clean out. Would you just
take a confidence step in
the apartment? Jesus Christ,

895
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:19,250
you would think there were
land mines under the floor.

896
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,530
The dog has never fallen down.
That's the funny thing.

897
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,800
I could see if she fell down the first
day she was here and then she'd have this

898
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,920
willingly. God, Oh my God,
she's never fallen down

899
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,420
and it was just pathetic to see a
scared pit bull, isn't it? Um, anyway,

900
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:39,930
so this guy actually told me about
a, uh, if you're into hockey,

901
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,830
hockey, I don't know, I just said
it that way for your to hockey. Um,

902
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,730
there's actually a fucking
website, if I can find it. Uh,

903
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,810
where I was watching the
1974 Stanley Cup finals,

904
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:54,470
like game six. I'd never seen it. Um,

905
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:58,530
and I was watching the Bruins verse the
flyers of course the flyers probably

906
00:55:58,531 --> 00:56:02,400
when that fucking game, cause I know they
won the series and you have to go to,

907
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,700
uh, this is it right here. This
is for the sports fans out there.

908
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,460
It's h f boards,

909
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:13,680
B o a r d s.com/um,

910
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,371
actually,
you know what,

911
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,540
just go to that age boards.com and just
go to that and just start searching for

912
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,240
some games and they have all the
original games in their entirety.

913
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:23,290
And if you are a big sports fan like I am,

914
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,460
it's great to watch those because you can
watch how the game has changed and all

915
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:29,370
that type of stuff. I to be honest, man,

916
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,240
I had like the greatest fucking
weekend ever where, um, you know,

917
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:37,030
just because college football started
and I don't want to happen. Like two,

918
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,980
two years ago I became a college football
fucking maniac and absolutely love it.

919
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,520
And um, I was actually once
again sleeping until noon,

920
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:49,060
which is fucking like three
o'clock east coast time.

921
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:53,020
So I missed like most of the first
games I think. I think it was like miss,

922
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:55,960
like the first three quarters
of the first game. So I wake up,

923
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:58,420
my girl actually gives,
she would have made some breakfast.

924
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,070
She actually brings it into me.

925
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:03,340
I have breakfast in bed and I walked
into the living room after I eat it.

926
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:08,270
She just made me breakfast in
bed people. Okay. And I fucking,

927
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,270
and she goes into watch one of her
reality shows and I woke up and uh,

928
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,930
after I ate the breakfast, I realized that
I was missing all these college games.

929
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:21,931
So I just stumbled in the living
room because when you're my age,

930
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:25,810
you stumble for the first hour when you
wake up because for some reason your

931
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,310
Achilles shrink up to your fucking the
bottom of your ass and your legs don't

932
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:34,030
work. Right. Right. So I
stumbled in here and uh,

933
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,750
I just took the remote from our,
usually I say, honey deemed,

934
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:38,680
would you mind if I just kind of hung on?
I didn't,

935
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:42,970
I just fucking walked in and
I put on the USC game and uh,

936
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,650
she rightfully just looked down
at the floor. Like, really?

937
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,740
I just made you fucking steak and eggs
and you fucking just come wandering in

938
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:54,220
here. And then she just sort of walked
out and then I had to do that pathetic.

939
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,920
You know when you want to apologize
for something you just did,

940
00:57:56,921 --> 00:58:00,430
but you want to continue
doing the thing that you're,

941
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,550
that you're apologizing for.
So rather than hitting pause,

942
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:04,720
I kept watching the game,

943
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,920
like yelling out the side of my
mouth as she was walking away.

944
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,620
Sorry honey ideas,
learning in [inaudible] and

945
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,910
I just continue to watch the game and
she gave me the silent treatment for the

946
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:18,610
next four hours,
which actually worked out good.

947
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,730
I think I watched like 12
football games this weekend.

948
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,000
I don't know why anybody gets the
fucking NFL package. You don't need it.

949
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,100
You can get all the, all the college
games you want for free and a,

950
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,840
and the kids are young.
They haven't blown out their knees.

951
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,920
They're fucking maniacs. Nobody's
holding out. I don't know.

952
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,060
I don't know what the fuck of saying,

953
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,740
you know it's getting hot in here cause
I have to close my goddamn windows cause

954
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:44,920
I curse too much when I do
this. You know what? I actually,

955
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,890
I have some more audio here.
Let me take a actually a sip of water.

956
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,770
Like I'm Frank Sinatra in
between fucking songs here.

957
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,420
That ain't water. Alright. Um,

958
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,970
you ever hear him say that he makes a
joke back then when it was funny that you

959
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,660
were drinking booze on stage?
Um,

960
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,200
I actually found another
record if you guys are actually

961
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,710
big fans of my podcast,

962
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,680
you know what sucks about this shit is
I have to literally move my mixer and

963
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:16,060
everything else listened to
it. Hit the floor, see that,
hear that. And then we go,

964
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,070
God damn these fucking wires.
Um, I've been slowly but,

965
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,550
and that's how you can never say I've
been slowly, you always have to say,

966
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,820
but surely you always said that they
take, they go together, you know,

967
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:29,720
sick and tired.

968
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,700
Slowly but surely suck my dick with my
balls. You know, it all goes together.

969
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:35,480
All right,
here we go.

970
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,530
I've been basically buying my dad's
record collection one album at a time and

971
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:42,050
this is one of the weirdest
fucking albums my dad had as a kid.

972
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:44,330
But because I was a kid and I
didn't know any better, I love that.

973
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,164
Listen to this shit.

974
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,190
This is basically the original like you
know when you watch Austin Powers and

975
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,500
their kind of mocking the
weird music of the 60s.

976
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,920
This is basically why this is a called
persuasive percussion 1966 and in defense

977
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:02,960
of the orchestra, I think that
they were trying to demonstrate um,

978
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,720
as many instruments as they possibly
could isolated how good they sound in the

979
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:12,770
new found high fi stereo. So
here we go. Listen to this shit

980
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,223
any day now.

981
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,033
Yeah.

982
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,200
Has that the shit or what?

983
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,070
Uh, you know, a lot of people,

984
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:50,130
if they saved they'd go back in a time
machine that they would go back and try

985
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:51,480
and stop Hitler.
I wouldn't,

986
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:55,470
I go back to this fucking
recording session because I
just want to see the looks

987
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:57,630
on people's faces when they
play that kind of music.

988
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,120
I always picture Barney Rubble's face,
you know,

989
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,390
when he was playing the drums in
that one Fred Flintstone episode,

990
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:07,470
we got Barney rubble Logan for trouble.
And he had like,

991
01:01:07,471 --> 01:01:09,210
his eyes were all squinted.
Like that's,

992
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:13,830
I just picture all these guys and like
fucking those turtle necks with, with the,

993
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,640
uh, the peace sign. Remember how buddy
rich was, was dressing and like the, uh,

994
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:21,540
the early seventies when he was trying
to act like he was still going to stay

995
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:24,210
relevant with these new hip Kooky kids,

996
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,520
but he was still playing big band music
and he would come out with like these

997
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:33,510
plaid Johnny Carson fucking Hagar slacks,

998
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,700
a knitted turtleneck. And then you
on the outside of the Turtleneck, um,

999
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,510
a little precursor to Eddie Murphy's,
a pinky ring on the outside of his glove.

1000
01:01:42,511 --> 01:01:46,740
He would have his, he'd have his
necklace outside the turtleneck with a,

1001
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:51,540
with a peace sign and it was
all in like silver, I dunno.

1002
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,060
And he let his hair grow a little long.
Any of that awful fucking toupee pay out,

1003
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,020
but he still was fucking fantastic.
All right.

1004
01:01:58,021 --> 01:02:00,930
Was that worth the trip all the
way over to my high fives stereo.

1005
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:05,580
Do you guys have a hi Fi? Huh?
All right. Sorry about that.

1006
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:08,140
I'm a fucking nerd. So that's basically
why I did all this weekend. I, uh,

1007
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,360
listened to bad records and I,

1008
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:13,060
I was listening to and watching all these
football games and I gotta admit you

1009
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:17,850
got to watch these old football games
because it is such bullshit nowadays the

1010
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:20,880
way they, they don't let these
fucking wide receivers can,

1011
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,330
they can do whatever they want. You can't
even cover the fucking receivers. Huh?

1012
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:28,320
Any Georgia bulldog fans out there. How
bad did you guys get fucked on that call?

1013
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,300
I'm not saying that you
would've won the game,

1014
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:32,280
but that was definitely
a pivotal fucking moment.

1015
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,540
This guy is going over the middle, the
ball, his throne high and the defense,

1016
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,910
the defensive back lays them out.
That's football and then like,

1017
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,380
and Nancy scamming Gaffney and Yankee.

1018
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:48,600
He where that roughness was unnecessary.
It was fucking pathetic.

1019
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:53,910
I mean, unnecessary. I'm,
I'm doing my fucking job.

1020
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:59,160
If you want to see how far football is
changed co I fuck it. Who gives a shit.

1021
01:02:59,161 --> 01:03:02,880
Go onto youtube and just fucking search.
Um,

1022
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,320
search 1978 AFC championship
game, uh, Steelers versus

1023
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,070
the Houston Oilers and watch part
four go all the way to the end.

1024
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:18,240
You're going to see Mike. Barbara goes
over the middle. Dan, pastor Rainey,

1025
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,630
the fucking douchebag throws it
like nine feet over his head.

1026
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:25,620
But my Mike Barber is a Gamer,
right? So he goes up for the thing.

1027
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:26,910
Mike Wagner comes in,

1028
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:32,180
doesn't even look at the ball and just
fucking goes as low as he possibly can.

1029
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:36,480
Hits Mike Barber right on his goddamn
nice. You ever see a guy on youtube?

1030
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:40,380
You ever watch a guy like
slam into offense doing 80
miles an hour on a fucking

1031
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,500
motorcycle. And that way,
you know, you just launch.

1032
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:47,430
It's like you're standing up in the air,
but you're doing flips, head over heels.

1033
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,280
That's what he did. He flipped
it, flipped around like twice,

1034
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:55,670
landed on this astro turf and he's holding
his fucking knee and flipping out and

1035
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,520
you know, he's on the ground for
like five minutes. When he gets up,

1036
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:01,980
he's pointing and Mike, Mike
Wagner, you motherfucker,

1037
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,020
you cheap motherfuckers
screaming all this stuff.

1038
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,200
And the announcers in the booth of just
sitting there going like, well you know,

1039
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:12,180
Mike wasn't looking at the ball. So, uh,
I mean I know I'm Mr Barbara is really,

1040
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,880
he's really annoyed.
But I mean he was just doing his job.

1041
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,790
He's just doing his job.
You know,

1042
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,160
there was no unnecessary roughness.
Actually there was back then,

1043
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:25,980
but you actually had to do
something that was unnecessary.

1044
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,960
Now you're doing the necessary shit.

1045
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:31,560
It is to cover a fucking receiver
and they go, it's unnecessary.

1046
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:35,550
That's why one of the biggest bullshit
records ever broken was Dan Marino's

1047
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:37,920
touchdown record by Peyton manning.

1048
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:42,420
Remember that year when he cried because
the fucking patriots diff players

1049
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,170
actually covered his fucking
receivers union with trying too hard.

1050
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,710
And the next thing you know you can't
even touch these fucking guys and he

1051
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:52,800
breaks Dan Marino's record Dan Marino
where to throw 90 touchdowns if you

1052
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:55,560
couldn't touch Clayton and duper.
All right, that's it. I'm done.

1053
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,930
I'm done with this sports this
week cause I know people are like,

1054
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:00,440
oh you don't watch boring and didn't want,

1055
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,170
and then when he telling him and they
get bored, well you know something.

1056
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,380
Listen to another fucking podcast.
All right, you're whiny cunt.

1057
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,130
Go enjoy your fucking Labor Day
on somebody else's podcast. Ah,

1058
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:14,800
how do you like that? Look at me
getting all tough. All right, you got,

1059
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,830
you guys want to,
um oh wait real quick.

1060
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,930
Um,
my team is a Lsu.

1061
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,380
I think I'm going to go with Lsu this
year is sound bought that les miles.

1062
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:25,570
I just liked the guide fourth and 12,

1063
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:27,490
two minutes into the game
and he fucking goes for it.

1064
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,680
This is like a direct quote for him.
They go less.

1065
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:32,740
Why do you always go for it on fourth
down? And he says, well, you know what,

1066
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,930
when you have play makers on your team,

1067
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,300
you have an obligation to turn them loose.

1068
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,640
That might be one of the
greatest quotes ever.

1069
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,830
And I love the southern
fucking turn them loose.

1070
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:48,820
You got play makers on your
team, buddy. Okay, you follow me?

1071
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:52,060
You have an obligation. Turn him
loose. Just turn him dogs loose.

1072
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,220
Just see what to come up with.
Go out there.

1073
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:58,390
Dig Up fucking first day on greatest
fucking fake field goal of all time.

1074
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,870
Lsu. Look that up. Lsu fake field goal.

1075
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,270
It's the smoothest shit
you're ever going to see.

1076
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:07,210
Just flips it right over
his goddamn shoulder.

1077
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,280
I was fucking them as a thing of beauty.
All right,

1078
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,500
here's some youtube videos for you guys.
If you're new to my podcast,

1079
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:15,880
this is what I do every week. I act like
a fucking moron in my apartment and um,

1080
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:21,090
people send me in these youtube videos
already gave you the boxer baby one. Um,

1081
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,390
and the Lsu fake field goal. And
uh, this is just a creepy one.

1082
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:28,570
It's really quick, but it's
really creepy. Look up, um,

1083
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:33,630
animal recording fail animal recording
fail at somebody's filming and Anaconda

1084
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:39,760
or some big ass fucking snake. And
evidently this snake was not ready for,

1085
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:44,680
it's a close up. Okay. We'll just leave
it at that and it will make you jump.

1086
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:48,690
It'll fucking make you jump. All right,
this is going to be quick podcast.

1087
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,460
I'm already to the questions,
you know,

1088
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,510
I'm only 24 minutes and you
know what this feels like.

1089
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:55,150
This feels like when I'm
fucking bombing on stage,

1090
01:06:55,870 --> 01:07:00,700
and I know a lot of you guys out there
and now comedians, sure, we all aren't.

1091
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:05,380
And uh, basically what happens is
when you're having a great set,

1092
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:10,570
all right, say you're slated
to do 50 minutes, okay?

1093
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,320
Somebody comes back and they say,
Hey kid, can you give me 50 minutes?

1094
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,480
Can you go out there and give
it the college track? Right?

1095
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:19,120
And you fucking go out there and you
start killing. And if you're killing,

1096
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,650
and if you're totally on,

1097
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:24,310
what ends up happening is
you do 50 minutes and you
feel like you only did half

1098
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:28,780
your act, you know, but on
nights when you're bombing,

1099
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,400
you're about to jokes away
from your closing bit and
you look down at your watch

1100
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:35,200
and you're about 12 minutes into your set.

1101
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:40,540
And that's when the dry mouth
sets in and you're like, okay,

1102
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,450
uh, so, uh, what do you
do for a living? Oh yeah,

1103
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:49,030
here's my cute little jokes about
fucking plumbers, you know? Oh,

1104
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:52,960
that's the worst I have to tell you about
to sound. My first headline in gigs,

1105
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:57,490
this is basically how I became a
headliner was firstly I had to write the

1106
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,820
material. All right. And
I had gotten up to a,

1107
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,690
I knew I had 45 minutes,
but I had never done 45 minutes.

1108
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:09,310
And when you headline or going last or
whatever the fuck you want to call it, um,

1109
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:13,810
on a real show as a headliner,
you have to do at least 45 minutes.

1110
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,920
That's how it works.
Okay.

1111
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,050
I don't know where the fuck you
guys are from where I'm from.

1112
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,780
That's how it fucking works.
You got to do 45 minutes.

1113
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:25,220
So I've been doing standup for
about three and a half, four years.

1114
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:28,070
So I had written 45 minutes of material,

1115
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:32,060
but I had never done 45 minutes.
You know what I mean?

1116
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:36,110
I was basically, at that point I was a,
I was the feature act of the second guy.

1117
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:40,460
So I was doing like anywhere from 20
minutes to 30 minutes at the most.

1118
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:43,610
Usually Feature Act does 20 to 25 30.

1119
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,420
If you work at working with like an old
bitter headliner who's given into the

1120
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:51,290
fact that he's not gonna make it, or maybe
he just doesn't feel like doing it. Um,

1121
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,710
you know, that's when you work with
those guys and they just come up to you.

1122
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:59,390
And that I work with this guy one time
and he looks at me and he goes, he goes,

1123
01:08:59,391 --> 01:09:04,040
hey, kid, kid. Uh, he goes, how much
time you got? I'm like, I don't know. Uh,

1124
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,920
30, 35. And he just goes do all of it.

1125
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,670
He's just like, do your whole
fucking act, play with the crowd.

1126
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:17,030
I don't give a shit. I'll fucking do 11
minutes and close this show. I've had it.

1127
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:20,510
Right. So, um, anyways, yeah.

1128
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:25,160
So I'd written 45 minutes of material and
I, uh, but I never done it all in a row,

1129
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,700
so I didn't know how to put it together.
So when I moved down in New York,

1130
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,151
you know,

1131
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:32,480
the only way to start headlining is at
some point you got to bite the bullet.

1132
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:35,660
Just tell somebody that you're a
headliner. You don't tell that to a,

1133
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,740
to a good room. You tell it to like, you
know, you have a rooms, you have be rooms,

1134
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:44,480
you got C and d room, so like to c and d
rooms. I was like, I just told the guys,

1135
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:48,050
yeah, I'm a headliner. And they're
looking at me, you know, I was just a kid.

1136
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:51,050
They're like, you're a headliner. And I'm
like, yeah, yeah, my headliner. You know,

1137
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:53,690
it's like when you try and get served,
when you're under age,

1138
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,210
you just try to have that look
at confidence. Don't flinch.

1139
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:59,540
Just give him the money. I would
like a vodka. Collins. Yes, I would.

1140
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,930
Me and my one whisker on my chin
would like to have some alcohol.

1141
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:07,760
Thank you very much. And um,
the first time I headlined,

1142
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:09,500
I remember I went on after this, this, uh,

1143
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:13,730
this black dude was on in front of me
and he was totally like high energy to

1144
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:15,880
begin with. And, um,

1145
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,850
that's one of the first things you
learn how to do as a headline is how to

1146
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:22,220
follow somebody if they have
high fucking energy. Right?

1147
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:26,030
So this guy's doing his act and you know,

1148
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,350
it's like, it's, you know, he's
been doing it for a long time,

1149
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,320
so he just keeps building with the energy
building and building and building.

1150
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,480
And he ended his act doing some jokes
about like a prostate exam and by the end

1151
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,920
he's just screaming.
Yeah.

1152
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:45,430
And he's got his fucking,
thank God my mother fucker. Now

1153
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:51,020
it's screaming into this, my killing in
this restaurant and I'm sitting there,

1154
01:10:51,021 --> 01:10:54,830
I'm already sweating trying to think how
the fuck am I going to follow that guy.

1155
01:10:55,070 --> 01:11:00,070
And I made the biggest fucking mistake
you can ever do is when somebody ends and

1156
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,900
they're on 11 with the energy,

1157
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:07,640
the worst fucking thing that you can do
is to go on stage and start your act at

1158
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:10,970
the same energy that, that, that,
that guy left off. First of all,

1159
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,770
you're not going to have enough energy.

1160
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,860
There's way you can't be on
10 for 45 fucking minutes.

1161
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:20,010
You're going to pass out.
Okay. And not only that,

1162
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:23,430
it's bizarre to have someone
just come out on stage, you know,

1163
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:27,610
please welcome bill burr
screaming.

1164
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,620
I said, I like that guy in the tough man
thing. You know, you gotta get psyched.

1165
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:35,820
You got to get pumped. I was coming
out with like that kind of energy.

1166
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:41,010
So I went up there and eight
minutes in screaming my act,

1167
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:45,150
I am pouring sweat and I remember looking
down at my watch feeling like I had

1168
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:50,100
done at least 25 minutes and I had only
done like 11 minutes and I was out of

1169
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:53,760
breath,
out of breath from telling fucking jokes.

1170
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:56,040
And I had no,
I just remember there was a,

1171
01:11:56,041 --> 01:12:01,041
for some reason there was a big fish tank
in this place and I was trying to riff

1172
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,230
about the fish tank and it was a
restaurant and like a, anybody oded,

1173
01:12:06,231 --> 01:12:11,010
the flay of fish goes, I think I know
where they got it. It was, it was awful.

1174
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:16,230
Ugh. Just fucking, ah, I, you know
what, actually got a bad feeling,

1175
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,730
just even thinking about that fucking set.

1176
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:21,150
So if you are a comedian and you're
listening to this and you just starting to

1177
01:12:21,151 --> 01:12:23,250
headline,
if you follow somebody with energy,

1178
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,980
what you actually want to do is
go in the opposite direction.

1179
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:30,870
That's what I learned as you go up there
and you just start really fucking slow

1180
01:12:30,871 --> 01:12:33,420
and actually kinda eat your balls for,
you know,

1181
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:37,500
just let everybody just bring it down.
Everybody fucking relax.

1182
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:41,040
And then once you get them relaxed,
then you start to build them up again.

1183
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:44,880
You know what I mean? It's just like
doing drugs. You start coming down,

1184
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,030
but you know, once you go through the
floor and you start filling depression,

1185
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,120
you take another drug and you
start coming back up again. That's,

1186
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,780
that's where right there,
right as you go below the floor boards,

1187
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,040
that's when I grabbed you by the back
of your fucking goddamn shirt and I pull

1188
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,970
you back up again, comedically. And
then we, then we go back up again.

1189
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:04,690
But this is what,

1190
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:09,690
what ended up happening was I would do
my jokes and I could kill for 37 minutes.

1191
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,360
And for some reason
when I said 37 minutes,

1192
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:16,500
I just wrote it on my Ottoman
with my finger. I wrote 37,

1193
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:20,070
like the fucking rain man,
fucking Weirdo.

1194
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,850
I really have a lot of rain man qualities.
I don't know if you've noticed that,

1195
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:26,040
but uh,
like

1196
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:33,060
I can actually name all everybody who's
won the Superbowl the last 43 years and

1197
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:36,190
now I don't have it in front of me,
but I can do it. So if you ever see me,

1198
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:39,100
I'll fucking rattle them off,
rattle them off.

1199
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:41,470
I'll have my head to the side
just like the fucking rain man.

1200
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:43,690
And then if you want me to go
back and name all the losers,

1201
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:46,720
I can fucking do that.
And uh,

1202
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:51,750
I was actually at 1.1 to memorize where
all the Superbowls took place and that's

1203
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,770
when, uh, right after I had that thought,

1204
01:13:53,771 --> 01:13:56,110
I kind of caught myself in a mirror
and I was just like, what are you doing

1205
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,790
bill? What, what do, what do
you run it from? You know,

1206
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:04,260
because I'm just sitting there in the
mirror going green bay, Green Bay jets,

1207
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:09,660
chiefs, colts, cowboys,
dolphins, dolphins, Steelers,
Steelers. Yeah, Raiders,

1208
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:13,180
cowboys. See, can I still do it? Steelers,

1209
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:16,480
Steelers and then Jim Plunkett
with the fucking Raiders.

1210
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,650
Joe Montana. That was
in Pontiac, Michigan.

1211
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:25,180
They beat the Bengals and they stopped
Pete Johnson right down on the goal line

1212
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,470
and then the fucking Redskins who I
hated because I was a huge cowboy fan.

1213
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,050
They beat the dolphins. Does that Fulton
Walker? Huh? Took the kickoff back.

1214
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:36,220
See,
I remember all this shit.

1215
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:42,280
Then the Raiders kicked the shit out of
the Redskins and next year and then a

1216
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:45,250
fucking 40 niners beat the dolphins.

1217
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:48,910
Remember that sports illustrated with
Dan Marino was on the cover and he was

1218
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:52,630
pointing at him like, yeah, this is
going to be the first one, right.

1219
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:57,310
With Joe Montana. Next year was
the bears, which could have,

1220
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,610
should have been the greatest
fucking super bowl ever. You know,

1221
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:02,500
I'm just gone all sports this week.
I don't give a fuck.

1222
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,630
I'm just going to give you guys
a heads up. Do you remember that?

1223
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:08,950
The bears went 15 and one
in the regular season.

1224
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:13,080
Okay. And the only team they lost to
was the dolphins on a Monday night.

1225
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:18,130
It was fucking awesome cause the dolphins
basically defended the 72 dolphins,

1226
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,480
you know, undefeated record
by beating the fucking bears.

1227
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:28,280
So in the AFC championship game that year,
it was the dolphins first,

1228
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,310
the Patriots, and we were
playing them in the orange bowl.

1229
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:31,580
And we had this curse we had,

1230
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,460
we had never won in the
orange bowl for like fucking,

1231
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:35,380
I don't like 20 goddamn years.
Okay.

1232
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:40,210
Since like Lyndon Johnson was an office
and the San Diego chargers played in Los

1233
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:42,340
Angeles. Okay. And then, um,

1234
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,430
the fucking dolphin should've beat us
and then they should have gone to the

1235
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,830
Superbowl and then the bears should have
been set up to fucking avenge their one

1236
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:53,740
loss of the year.
And then the dolphins with Dan Marino.

1237
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,740
And that unbelievable fucking offense
was the only ones that was able to beat

1238
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:59,230
the 46 defense.
And what fucking happens.

1239
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:04,870
Stupid ass patriots. We come in
there and we beat them. Right.

1240
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,390
And then, you know, with squish the fish,

1241
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:10,240
remember that squished the fish and
everybody, Miami was just like, Ooh,

1242
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,580
Dolphin join the foods. The removal. Hello

1243
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:19,000
was some of the gay ass shit
talking ever 10 during that time.

1244
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:23,290
And somebody had made a song in Boston. I
remember that song by Pete Townsend, uh,

1245
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:28,300
face to face that face to face, get
to face to face, something like that.

1246
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:33,400
Somebody wrote us a squished the
fish to that song, squish the fish,

1247
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,800
get to squish the,
if it was fucking horrific,

1248
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:38,440
but somehow I still actually watched
the game and then the Patriots got,

1249
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:43,060
or they got raped, I believe is the best
way to describe it. Um, by the bears,

1250
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:45,190
46 to 10.
Then the next year was the giants.

1251
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:50,400
Then the Redskins than 40 niners 40
niners and then was the bill's era where

1252
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:52,510
they lost to the giants,
Redskins, cowboys,

1253
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:56,230
cowboys than the 40 niners
then the cowboys, then the
packers and then the pack.

1254
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,920
Ah, yeah. The packers beat the
fucking patriots. I went to that game

1255
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:05,200
than the Broncos won the next two.
Then the rams. Then the ravens,

1256
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,220
stupid a that coach there. They have
no idea how fast we shut up your clown.

1257
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:15,590
They beat the giants then patriots
than Tampa Patriots. Patriots, colts,

1258
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,310
stealers. Giants stealers.
Huh? You like that Shit

1259
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,550
fucking rain man.

1260
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,690
What do you want to go to another sport?
Name another sport. I'll fucking do it.

1261
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,480
I can go all the way back to
like the early 70. [inaudible].

1262
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,650
That's what I actually fucking sit there
and I write that down on like Napkins,

1263
01:17:32,651 --> 01:17:36,880
cocktail napkins. When I'm on planes,
like that's how I make plane rides go by.

1264
01:17:36,881 --> 01:17:39,580
Like right now, maybe you're on
a plane listening to this ship.

1265
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:44,160
I actually sit there. Green Bay, Green
Bay jets. Yeah, definitely the chiefs.

1266
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,800
I know. I'm a fucking loser. All right,

1267
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:51,370
let's get to some of the questions
here for the week. Jesus Christ near.

1268
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:53,013
Okay.

1269
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,050
This is what happens when
I'm doing my fucking podcast.

1270
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,450
Nia is always getting ready
to go somewhere and she
comes out and all sorts of

1271
01:18:00,451 --> 01:18:01,800
fucking different dress.

1272
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,680
Yeah.

1273
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,150
And I'm not ready for it.
Um,

1274
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,990
you just don't say you're going to go do
one of those sports illustrated covers

1275
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:15,230
and why those ones where they wore the
mesh is bathing suit. Yeah, exactly.

1276
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,950
All right. Let's [inaudible]
plow ahead here. Um, questions
of the week. All right,

1277
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:24,790
question number one. Hey Bill, I'm sure
you've by now you've seen the punch.

1278
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:27,730
Just wondering what your
opinion was on it. Personally,

1279
01:18:27,731 --> 01:18:31,930
I thought the Boise state player deserved
it and the expression on his face was

1280
01:18:31,931 --> 01:18:34,720
priceless. Go blue. All right.
There's a Michigan Fan are,

1281
01:18:34,721 --> 01:18:39,410
unless you're saying go blue
because of the fucking turf. MMM.

1282
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:43,500
Um, okay. How do I explain this shit?
This is basically what happened.

1283
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:48,270
Boise state played a, played Oregon
and I guess last year at Boise State,

1284
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,780
um,
injured the quarterback on a fucking,

1285
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:56,690
I was just picturing that
dude from England getting all
pissed. Listen, this shit,

1286
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,430
cause I know he doesn't give
a fuck about all this stuff,

1287
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,320
but I don't give a fuck.
But you don't watch this stuff.

1288
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:03,190
I'll talk about the premier
league next week. So anyways,

1289
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,010
somebody in Boise state injured
the quarterback a on Oregon.

1290
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:11,440
So the running back on
Oregon said, uh, we,

1291
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:16,240
we owe Boise state, uh, and ass
whooping. So he's basically talking shit.

1292
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:20,740
So they play the game and they held that
guy who talks shit to minus five yard.

1293
01:19:20,741 --> 01:19:23,680
So at the end of the game they came up
and they talked a little bit of Shit.

1294
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,030
The guy gets in his face,

1295
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:28,480
it's probably like, oh, where
are you going to say now man,

1296
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:29,830
what are you guys say now?

1297
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:34,090
And then the dude looks away and the
dude who was getting yelled at just wound

1298
01:19:34,091 --> 01:19:37,290
up any fucking dropped
the guy and then it,

1299
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:41,230
then it just got ugly and ugly and
ugly. What do I think about that? Um,

1300
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,900
it was definitely funny.

1301
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:47,470
There's definitely funny to see when you
received a guy getting somebodies face

1302
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,280
talking to a bunch of Shit and
then the other guy just, you know,

1303
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:55,990
just fucking winds up and drops him.
It was definitely funny, but, uh,

1304
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:59,770
I thought that dude had a common, you
know, if you're going to say, you know,

1305
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,010
you got an ass whooping common.

1306
01:20:01,011 --> 01:20:04,180
If you're going to talk shit and
then only get minus five yards,

1307
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:08,010
you got understand that people are
going to give you some shit back. And a,

1308
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,420
I gotta be honest, man, I feel real good,

1309
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,880
bad for that guy because uh,
you know,

1310
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:17,881
he could've got drafted and now he got
suspended and I'm just one of those heat

1311
01:20:18,911 --> 01:20:23,380
of the moment things were, I dunno,
it's at some point, you know, I mean,

1312
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:27,390
he might've just fucked his whole life up.
Like now,

1313
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:31,210
now he won't get drafted. And then
what do you do? You work at best buy,

1314
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,000
you could have, you know, you could have
got at least, you know, even if you suck,

1315
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:38,510
you're going to get like six figure
contract maybe for a couple of years.

1316
01:20:38,511 --> 01:20:42,920
You run around and play for the
fucking chiefs or some shit like that.

1317
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:46,850
I don't know. It was just really
bad. It was fucking ugly and a,

1318
01:20:46,851 --> 01:20:49,400
and then the fact that it was a black
dude and he punches a white dude,

1319
01:20:49,401 --> 01:20:52,160
then you go on the internet and
everybody has to write some racist shit,

1320
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,130
which is one of the things I really
can't stand about. Youtube is all the,

1321
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:58,370
all the, uh, all the racist on there.
I really can't fucking stand that.

1322
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,210
I don't mind when someone writes some
shit just to be a dick to annoy somebody.

1323
01:21:02,211 --> 01:21:05,480
But like a,
yeah,

1324
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:09,920
the n word is used pretty liberally on
youtube. And that's the one fucking thing,

1325
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,180
you know, somebody asked me that actually
about my website was saying like,

1326
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:17,050
you know, why don't you have a
page where people can, you know,

1327
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,700
leave comments and stuff like that.
And that's why I don't,

1328
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:23,090
because people end up arguing and then
invariably somebody writes something

1329
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:27,140
racist or something just really horrific,
uh,

1330
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,710
something about Jews or something. And
then it's on my website, it's just, I,

1331
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,200
you know, I don't condone that
shit and I just, you know,

1332
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:35,840
I don't give a fuck what I do.
The podcast. Do you want to,

1333
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:38,630
you want to write something or send it
to me and I'll fucking read it on this?

1334
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:40,843
Um,

1335
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,100
I don't know that I explained that I,
I feel bad for that guy.

1336
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:47,100
I feel bad for that too because
he just fucked his life up.

1337
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,530
And one moment by punching
the guy in the face.

1338
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:50,820
But you're not saying I don't like,

1339
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:54,510
I don't like when people
sucker punch somebody and
then they had like that. Yeah.

1340
01:21:54,511 --> 01:21:58,260
What, what fucking vibe?
What do you mean what, uh,

1341
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:00,480
I wasn't looking at you when you
punched me in the face. Yeah,

1342
01:22:00,481 --> 01:22:03,450
I'm going to go down. That's really,
there's really no skill level there,

1343
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:08,490
but in defense of that guy, if you do
get in somebody's face and talk shit,

1344
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,590
yeah. You, what you do is
that you do that little,

1345
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,850
you know that little gay backwards
skip that fucking football players do.

1346
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,930
That's what you do. Why you look
at the person, you don't say, ah,

1347
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:22,290
you don't talk shit and then just fucking
turn the other cheek like you're Jesus,

1348
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:26,520
you know? Do you think Jesus ever
got dropped with that whole fucking a

1349
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:32,570
wait, did he, did Jesus say that? Talk
Shit and then turn the other cheek.

1350
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:36,080
He didn't say that.
He said if somebody slaps you,

1351
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:39,980
turn the other cheek so they can slap
that side. What kind of a fucking,

1352
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:45,750
you know, woe is me and that's
what, that's how I am not religious.

1353
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:47,550
I can't get behind that son of God.

1354
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,970
Not Son of God profit or whatever
that is is just some dumb shit.

1355
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:53,451
Son.

1356
01:22:53,451 --> 01:22:58,451
If somebody kicks you in the left ball
when your eyes stop watering and you can

1357
01:22:59,511 --> 01:23:03,830
actually see your right ball, hold it
out for him so he can kick it. That one.

1358
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,980
Yeah, go fuck yourself. You

1359
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,440
fucking Hippie your stupid ass sandals.

1360
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:11,920
He really was the original fucking dirty
ass hippie wasn't he wasn't Jesus that

1361
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,270
all right. That should get some people
sending me some emails. God help me.

1362
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:20,200
If I ever get fucking famous and they
start cutting up some of the Goddamn shit

1363
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:24,570
on this podcast, I'm really going to be
in trouble. Um, all right, next question.

1364
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:27,400
Bill. Did you ever, uh, at some
point in your early career,

1365
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:29,650
think about performing on a cruise ship?

1366
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,590
This guy has no idea how
funny this question is. Uh,

1367
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,440
I'm not sure if you've ever taken a
cruise before, but let me tell you,

1368
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,910
it's pretty fucking sweet.

1369
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:41,470
Okay. He says, uh,

1370
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:46,080
it seems like you literally a would
be getting paid to go on vacation,

1371
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:51,590
get shit faced daily and flirt with
some finance trim in between all that.

1372
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:56,340
If you could find the time on Tuesday
and Thursday night to do your act for an

1373
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,740
hour in the main show room,
um,

1374
01:23:58,741 --> 01:24:02,550
not to mention you're waking up in some
of the sickest places in the Caribbean

1375
01:24:02,551 --> 01:24:04,620
every other day.
Let me know what you think.

1376
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:10,140
All right? Um, okay. Amongst comedians,

1377
01:24:10,141 --> 01:24:14,720
you are never further out of
show business than when you do.

1378
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:18,420
When you do stand up on a cruise ship.
Um,

1379
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:24,590
people who do standup on cruise
ships, it's basically, uh,

1380
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,320
I dunno,
it's,

1381
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:31,330
it's like there's two places where
you go out to pasture as a performer.

1382
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,800
Um,
Vegas and cruise ships.

1383
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:40,050
Vegas isn't bad because you'll get like
$1 million, fuck me like that Danny Gans.

1384
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,310
Dot. Guy would just fucking passed
away. Like that guy was making millions.

1385
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:46,890
He had like, he was making
like five, 6 million a year.

1386
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,100
He doesn't have to be on the road.
You let the crowd come to you.

1387
01:24:50,101 --> 01:24:54,690
There's a lot to say about that shit.
But, uh, when you're out on a cruise ship,

1388
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,570
I mean, first of all, let's just
break this whole fucking thing down.

1389
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:01,890
It seems like you'd literally be
getting paid to go on a vacation. Yeah.

1390
01:25:01,891 --> 01:25:03,360
Except you have to work.

1391
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:07,530
That's actually one of the classic things
that club owners used to do when I was

1392
01:25:07,531 --> 01:25:09,180
starting out to try and fuck you over.

1393
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:13,200
When they would try to book you down in
Florida in the wintertime and they'd all

1394
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:16,140
feel like 80 bucks for the week or some
awful shit. And they'd be like, yeah,

1395
01:25:16,141 --> 01:25:18,360
but you know,
it's Kinda like you're on vacation.

1396
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:20,160
It's kind of like a paid vacation.
Yeah.

1397
01:25:20,161 --> 01:25:25,020
Except I have to work except for that
working part. You fucking assholes.

1398
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:29,760
Um, now, yeah, a cruise
ship is an absolute fucking
nightmare, believe it or not.

1399
01:25:29,761 --> 01:25:31,770
One of the first things you
want to do as a performer,

1400
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:34,950
the second the show is over, is you want
to get the fuck away from the crowd.

1401
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,330
You want to get away from
the crowd because the only
way to describe it is you,

1402
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,840
you ever get stuck in an elevator with
some douche bag and you have to make this

1403
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:46,920
small talk conversation that you don't
want to have imagined being stuck on a

1404
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:49,710
boat with a fucking a
thousand of those people.

1405
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:51,090
Cause that's basically what it is.

1406
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:54,960
And I'm not trying to be unappreciative
of people who come out to see the

1407
01:25:54,961 --> 01:25:59,580
fucking show, but you know, I
dunno. What do you do for a living?

1408
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,580
Okay, let's use the plumber
analogy. Does that guy,

1409
01:26:02,581 --> 01:26:06,740
I want to talk fixing fucking toilets.
How did you get into fixing toilet?

1410
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:10,130
Do you get nervous right before
you have to fix the toilet?

1411
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:16,450
You know, it's awful. I
did one cruise ship, right?

1412
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,390
And I actually, uh, I got, I
didn't, I didn't get fired,

1413
01:26:19,391 --> 01:26:23,500
but I was definitely not asked back.
And, uh, the whole thing was alive.

1414
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:24,850
They told me, I told him, first of all,

1415
01:26:24,851 --> 01:26:27,820
I said that my act is not
conducive to a cruise ship.

1416
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:32,110
I just don't see myself doing well on
a cruise ship. And they were like, no,

1417
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,330
you know,
cause people are old on cruise ships

1418
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,370
and they're like, Nah, this
is a young hip cruise ship.

1419
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,580
I already told this fucking story.
And I got on there,

1420
01:26:39,581 --> 01:26:41,650
there was that old
Vietnamese woman passed out,

1421
01:26:41,651 --> 01:26:45,630
missing all their fucking teeth up front.
And I ate my balls the entire weekend.

1422
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,490
The only people I made laugh was the band,
you know,

1423
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:52,180
the captain wrote a letter saying how
as offensive to all fucking people and

1424
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,290
cruise ships are a nightmare,
sir. They're fucking nightmare.

1425
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,960
And I don't know what cruise
ship that you're taking, but um,

1426
01:26:58,961 --> 01:27:01,240
all I know is that when
I took a cruise ship,

1427
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:06,040
they would stop and you had basically
four hours to see whatever the fuck you

1428
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:09,940
could see before you had to run back to
the ship or they would leave without you.

1429
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:13,120
So it was a very stressful situation.
And then other than that,

1430
01:27:13,121 --> 01:27:16,930
you were just out on the water and
it all looked the fucking same to me.

1431
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,530
Maybe I didn't take a good one.
I mean,

1432
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:22,140
if I went to the Mediterranean
and did a European cruise,

1433
01:27:22,141 --> 01:27:25,290
I imagine that would be
cool. But, uh, you know,

1434
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:27,720
I don't want to go to Athens
for fucking three hours,

1435
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:29,923
you know,

1436
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,120
and fucking sitting there running around
trying to see all this shit, you know,

1437
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,360
in flip flops and a fucking
Hawaiian shirt, you know, dress like

1438
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:41,490
Robin Williams before he does a goddamn
special. Um, it's, it's a nightmare Gig,

1439
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:46,340
sir. They definitely pay well, but it
is, it's, it's a fucking nightmare.

1440
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,360
And you're out to sea. And I
don't know, when I did them,

1441
01:27:50,361 --> 01:27:52,010
they didn't even have Internet access.

1442
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:55,310
So there was no way for your fucking
agent to even get in contact with you if

1443
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:56,660
you did have a big audition.

1444
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:01,280
But even if he did have a big auditions
now you can fucking get off the boat,

1445
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,000
you know, call a fucking helicopter
helicopter, you know, it's, it's horrific.

1446
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:09,300
Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um,

1447
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:12,270
it's getting hot as fuck
here in my apartment because
I had to close the windows

1448
01:28:12,271 --> 01:28:16,290
because I curse. Um, what
is this section here?

1449
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,620
Something I wasn't aware of. I don't
even know what this is. Let me read this.

1450
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:25,430
Um, the reason I'm writing you is
I'm a huge college football fan,

1451
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:29,660
but I have to say that there is one trend
that has emerged over the past decade

1452
01:28:29,661 --> 01:28:32,750
that really bugs the shit out of me.
Oh, this guy doesn't like the promos.

1453
01:28:32,751 --> 01:28:36,170
I haven't had anybody on any other
football fans, none of this. He said,

1454
01:28:36,171 --> 01:28:40,460
why is it that every major
football telecast kicks off
with some redneck singing,

1455
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:41,294
a theme song?

1456
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,650
I guess it started with Hank Williams
jr now that's the only one I know that I

1457
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:46,523
read it on

1458
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:48,480
Football Asia.

1459
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,730
John not part.
Huh?

1460
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:52,780
I fucking hate that. I don't like
that one either, but I wasn't aware.

1461
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:56,050
He's saying they're doing it everywhere.
He said it's gotten way out of hand.

1462
01:28:56,051 --> 01:28:56,681
A few years ago,

1463
01:28:56,681 --> 01:29:01,120
college game day employed it's own country
music band to sing the show's theme.

1464
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,690
It's like the guy with the fiddle.

1465
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:06,950
Um,
and the guy wearing the big

1466
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:11,100
top hat are supposed to be a little less
white trash because they're joined by a

1467
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:15,240
black guy shouting out football
audibles in the middle of the song.

1468
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:19,690
Wow. Dude, that sounds
fucking horrific. Um,

1469
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,900
this year to top it all off,

1470
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:26,520
all the day apparently isn't complete
unless some other Appalachian with a 10

1471
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:31,380
gallon hat sings to the scene theme song
for ABC's game of the week on Saturday

1472
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,480
night. Not to mention that
during the actual game,

1473
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:37,530
the ACC has its own commercial with
some other hicks singing a theme song.

1474
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:42,810
At least that is somewhat understandable
since the ACC is predominantly, um, uh,

1475
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:43,210
southern.
Yeah.

1476
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:46,360
Con Con Conference.
Such a moron.

1477
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:47,920
All right. Ah, look, I get it.

1478
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:50,860
College football has a lot of fans
in the southeast part of the country.

1479
01:29:50,861 --> 01:29:54,730
Football in general attracts
a large audience of white
males between the ages of

1480
01:29:54,731 --> 01:29:57,850
25 to 40. I am one of those
white males. And frankly,

1481
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:02,020
I'm a little tired of my football viewing
experience becoming intruded on by an

1482
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,920
assorted cast of characters from
Hazard County. Sorry for the ramp.

1483
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,280
But I had to get that off my chest and
frankly my wife couldn't care less.

1484
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,620
Oh Dude,
I'm in that boat.

1485
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:14,320
I know that you start ranting to your
girlfriend about some shit and they just

1486
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:17,620
start glazing over. Like, yeah,
I really don't care about sports.

1487
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:21,860
So at any point,
if you want to stop yelling at me,

1488
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,550
you're spitting on the side of my
face, by the way. Um, yeah, dude,

1489
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,740
I gotta admit I haven't noticed that shit.
But I'll tell you why.

1490
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:32,610
Cause I don't watch pregame or post game.
I don't, I just watched it. The Games,

1491
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:35,440
I don't want to watch that part where
people like, you know, I'll tell Ya,

1492
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:40,260
you know, if I'm Terry Bradshaw, I gotta
be taken. What's John Stallworth doing?

1493
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:44,680
Fuck, I don't know. Give a shit, you know,
and I don't listen to sports talk radio.

1494
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,790
All those people fucking freaking out,
losing their minds.

1495
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,550
Give me an Oklahoma. We
launched, just joined

1496
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:57,270
with the second stringer in relax.
That's why they have coaches.

1497
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:02,480
You don't have to worry about it,
sir. The decisions will be made. Um,

1498
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:05,190
all right. Underrated. Overrated
for the week. Uh, underrated.

1499
01:31:05,191 --> 01:31:09,650
The a television series,
brotherhood. Um, dude,

1500
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:13,680
the Brotherhood was my show and
they actually cancelled it. Um,

1501
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:14,990
this is what this guy has to say about,

1502
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,850
he says a crime show on
showtime was recently canceled,

1503
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,070
was much better than the similar.

1504
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,620
The soprano's it had
superior writing and acting.

1505
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,000
It also had a better place and his
characters were much more interesting. Um,

1506
01:31:27,001 --> 01:31:31,650
it could be just be that the whole Italian
mafia thing is getting tired genre,

1507
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:37,320
but, um, but I got to go with Brotherhood
as overall being a better show,

1508
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:40,950
although they were both good.
Uh, yeah, the Brotherhood is
awesome, man. If you guys,

1509
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:44,640
uh, have a DVD store
around you, what sucks is,

1510
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:49,641
is there's two awesome seasons and they're
really the cliffhanger that they left

1511
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:52,080
you with.
It's basically based on the,

1512
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:56,280
I think the Billy and Whitey Bulger thing
where back in Massachusetts they had a

1513
01:31:56,281 --> 01:32:00,250
really high ranking politician whose
brother was a really high ranking

1514
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,260
gangster.
And uh,

1515
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:06,590
this is something else I think I already
talked about on the podcast. Yeah.

1516
01:32:06,591 --> 01:32:10,220
That was like the dynamic and everyone
would always be asking the, uh,

1517
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,910
was I think was it was Billy Billy Baldwin
or I think it was the politician and

1518
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:18,900
Whitey was the gangster.
And they would always ask Billy be like,

1519
01:32:18,901 --> 01:32:21,810
what is your affiliation be?
I don't,

1520
01:32:21,811 --> 01:32:25,930
I don't have any affiliation with my
brother. You know, Massachusetts might

1521
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:27,460
rather,
uh,

1522
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:32,820
I'm just trying to do the best job I can
do to the tax payers of Massachusetts,

1523
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:34,743
you know?

1524
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,740
And the last thing I remembered happening
was the gangster actually won the

1525
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:40,780
state lottery.
How fucking hilarious is that?

1526
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:43,900
So this basically the show was based
on that took place in Providence,

1527
01:32:43,901 --> 01:32:47,620
Rhode Island. I highly, highly
fucking recommend that you watch it.

1528
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:51,460
It sucks that there's only two seasons,
but um,

1529
01:32:51,461 --> 01:32:54,670
starts off a little slow.
There's a lot of fucking, uh,

1530
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:57,650
there's a lot of characters,

1531
01:32:57,651 --> 01:33:01,790
but I'm actually at one point I'm
actually going to give away something.

1532
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:05,780
This is just sort of a little vignette
that they had on the show is a Yankee fan,

1533
01:33:05,781 --> 01:33:10,280
comes into one of the provenance bars
and starts talking shit to one of the

1534
01:33:10,281 --> 01:33:13,160
hothead gangsters and who's a red sox fan.

1535
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:17,180
And I'm a fucking blows his brains out.

1536
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,590
And it was really,
it was disturbing.

1537
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,470
It was disturbing.
Um,

1538
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:28,070
so definitely checked out and that
fucking guy was a great actor and not to

1539
01:33:28,071 --> 01:33:31,790
mention that I'm the guy
who plays Freddy Cork,

1540
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:36,770
um, is actually, believe it or not
because he's such a great fucking actor,

1541
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:41,000
is Kevin Chapman who was a comedian that
I started out with and he was one of my

1542
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:44,470
faith that was one of my favorite
characters on TV. Tony Vee was in it,

1543
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,920
another great comedian from Boston.

1544
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:50,330
I'm so fucking pissed that they canceled
that show cause, uh, that was my show,

1545
01:33:50,331 --> 01:33:53,180
man. I love that show. So I got to
go with you. Yeah, a brotherhood.

1546
01:33:53,181 --> 01:33:58,010
Definitely underrated. Alright. Overrated.
Uh, this dude says the black eyed peas,

1547
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:02,300
the sheer amount of times I've heard the
new album against my will is staggering.

1548
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:06,020
The only people you'll catch
listening to them are the lame ass.

1549
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:09,950
Want to be cool white people who have
never heard of anything unless it was on

1550
01:34:09,951 --> 01:34:12,740
the radio. Yeah, I know. They
definitely play them in elevators.

1551
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:14,510
And if you go to staples,

1552
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:16,843
yeah.

1553
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:19,330
Um, I can't even think of their
fucking music, but I can't stand. Ah,

1554
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:24,660
did they do London Bridge always that,
that check when she went solo.

1555
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:31,360
Oh, that was Fergie by herself.
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Yeah.

1556
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:33,330
You know what I actually
discovered the other day? Uh,

1557
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:36,870
I have a lot of shit in my iPod that
my girlfriend downloaded on her fucking

1558
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:40,320
computer was on the blink. And
uh, did I say on the blink?

1559
01:34:40,321 --> 01:34:43,920
I didn't know what the fuck that means
when it was on the Fritz. He, uh,

1560
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:46,110
so she downloaded all this shit
that I never would have listened to.

1561
01:34:46,111 --> 01:34:49,710
So the other day, what was that
song? Act Crazy. Who sings that song?

1562
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:50,683
Yeah.

1563
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:56,540
GNARLS Barkley. I never,
she used to listen to that
song and I fucking hated it.

1564
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,420
Um, with that dude singing in
that falsetto, you know. Uh,

1565
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:05,450
but I actually listened to the lyrics.
It's, I actually like the song now.

1566
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,880
I was at the gym lifting weights,

1567
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:11,290
listening to that song and I've
never felt gay or in my life. Uh,

1568
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,970
I gotta wrap this up cause that was
embarrassing to even admit that. Um,

1569
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,700
all right, I'm 53 minutes in. That's
going to be the podcast this week.

1570
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:20,840
I know it's a little fucking, it was a
little off this week I think, but um,

1571
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,450
I'm coming down off a Tylenol pm.
I had to do it to,

1572
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:27,110
I had to drag myself up like fucking
Michael Jackson so I could actually fall

1573
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:31,070
asleep by two at night so I could wake
up and actually try and do this thing at

1574
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:33,080
some point remotely near Monday morning.

1575
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:35,450
I hope you enjoyed this podcast this week.

1576
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:38,390
I hope you guys had a great
Labor Day weekend. I apologize.

1577
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:40,160
I can't believe I deleted that,

1578
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,420
that rant at that boxer was doing,
it was fucking great.

1579
01:35:44,421 --> 01:35:45,800
The coach look out for him.

1580
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:49,430
He's a tough man and evidently he's
ready for more cause he only started

1581
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:53,000
bleeding. He, oh, started
bleeding. All right, that's it.

1582
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:56,360
Please continue listening to
podcasts. I'm going to be at the, um,

1583
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:00,710
helium comedy club this weekend
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

1584
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:05,630
Please come down to the show and
also, uh, please join my mailing list.

1585
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,620
I never bring that up.

1586
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:10,280
I would like to get more people on my
mailing list because my space is really

1587
01:36:10,281 --> 01:36:12,800
dying.
A slow pitiful death.

1588
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:17,420
I barely get any emails over there
anymore and um, I don't know where.

1589
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:21,530
I don't know where to go next. Um, cause
I imagine Facebook will take a nosedive.

1590
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,490
Twitter,

1591
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:25,370
we'll take a nose dive and his whole
jumping around is driving me fucking nuts.

1592
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:29,720
I figured out how to blog here on my
website and I'm going to start blogging.

1593
01:36:29,721 --> 01:36:34,670
I actually began one about
Sweden that I will finish and um,

1594
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,320
hopefully I'll get some
new videos up there,

1595
01:36:36,321 --> 01:36:39,410
but it's a bill bird.com if you
could go on and you sign up,

1596
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:44,440
you just sign up for my
mailing list underneath the
city that you're closest to.

1597
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:49,630
And basically I only send you emails if
I'm coming to your town or if I'm going

1598
01:36:49,941 --> 01:36:50,774
to be on TV.

1599
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:53,960
I'm not going to be one of
these douchebags who every
week gives you the bill

1600
01:36:53,961 --> 01:36:58,790
burr update and then I become spam in
your life. It's not going to be that way,

1601
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:03,791
but please sign up for it because my days
on my space might be numbered because

1602
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:06,350
I don't, I don't, I don't know
that there's anybody left.

1603
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:11,330
I'm really feeling like fucking Mad Max
and I'm there looking for fuel. You know,

1604
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:15,950
it's just whores and uh,
people sell in music.

1605
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:20,690
That's all that's left and me, you know,
tumbleweeds over there, people. All right,

1606
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:23,720
that's it. That's the podcast for
this week. Please tune in next week.

1607
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:26,480
Wait a second, wait a second. Did you
want to chime in with something new? Yeah.

1608
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:26,801
Well.

1609
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:31,750
I'm just surprised you didn't talk about
Tila Tequila shocked by that football

1610
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,923
player.

1611
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:37,410
Oh, that's right. Sean Merryman
choked out. Tila Tequila, you know I,

1612
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:41,400
well, she's a warrior anyway.
She probably deserved it.

1613
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:44,470
Exactly.
Fucking apple.

1614
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,960
What do you mean it's a podcast?
I got to make it funny.

1615
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,310
I don't like how you actually have my,
you actually have my voice

1616
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,250
down like you actually know
what I'm going to say. No,

1617
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:00,150
that's not what I was going to say.

1618
01:38:00,151 --> 01:38:04,920
I was going to say before I
so rudely interrupted with
your completely offensive,

1619
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,650
I don't like how you know you,
have you noticed that with women,

1620
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:10,380
whenever they do an impression of
their boyfriend, they always have to go

1621
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:11,460
Ooh,

1622
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,930
before they say anything. I wanted to go
out to go to a restaurant and you know,

1623
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:18,540
my boyfriend said he was going
to take me and I was like,

1624
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,330
so we're going to go to the
restaurant and he's all,

1625
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,210
where's your football game?

1626
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:28,770
I know my impression of you is really bad.
It is bad.

1627
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,940
Do you want to go to a party this weekend?
My girlfriends,

1628
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:36,500
Ben Roethlisberger wallet
that a while ago though.

1629
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:40,130
What Ben Roethlisberger Ah, that
was, that was that, that was us.

1630
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:45,200
That was a cash grab. He
raped me. Ben. Roethlisberger

1631
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:48,390
well do you feel like, like the whole,
my whole big thing with the dogs.

1632
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:51,110
Why don't you come over here near the
microphone if you're actually going to

1633
01:38:51,111 --> 01:38:54,950
come in here and high jacket. All right,
here's my lovely girlfriend, da everybody.

1634
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:58,370
Hey, let me just do this as
like an interview, like a
little Dick Cavett thing.

1635
01:38:58,371 --> 01:39:00,000
But what was your question here?
Uh,

1636
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:04,990
my question was in regards to
the football player who, uh,

1637
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,440
allegedly choked out to what
Tequila, um, and, and other,

1638
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:10,580
why are you being so official?

1639
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:13,820
The question that I had this
afternoon and first of all,

1640
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:18,230
I want to say I love the
show and I'm really like the
listener first time caller.

1641
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:22,990
Uh, no, but do you think cause I
feel like, and I guess we'll see.

1642
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:26,420
Please get to the point, man.
Oh well we'll see how the
story develops. But like,

1643
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:31,450
do you feel like the Michael Vick thing
got more attention then when athletes

1644
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:35,660
have like sort of like these abuse
charges, putting aside cost? First of all,

1645
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:41,150
Sean Merryman didn't have like 40 my
space whores hung from trees that he was

1646
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,550
electrocuted and drowning. Okay. He choked
out one dumb whore with a fake tits,

1647
01:39:46,610 --> 01:39:47,870
a bisexual hort that,

1648
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:51,650
and I have to say that I fucking
hate the San Diego chargers,

1649
01:39:51,651 --> 01:39:56,180
but my hatred went down a
little bit knowing that he
slapped her on Tila Tequila.

1650
01:39:56,181 --> 01:40:00,320
That's just funny. If she was, if
she was just, you know, a regular,

1651
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:04,640
you know, Girl from Hooters
whose dad didn't stick around.

1652
01:40:04,641 --> 01:40:09,490
So she felt the need to dress
around scantily clad and
try to get guys attention.

1653
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:14,180
You want to see my clam? If she was one of
those people, that's a woman's Day. Huh?

1654
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,940
Do you think that's a woman's
Day? Do you, I'll tell you this,

1655
01:40:16,941 --> 01:40:18,380
I'll tell you this right
now and I might get,

1656
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:21,710
I might get in trouble here as I
weighed into these dangerous waters.

1657
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:24,770
Women don't say clam,
they don't refer to it as a clam.

1658
01:40:24,771 --> 01:40:28,360
So how would you know that? Because
I'm a woman. You asshole. Well,

1659
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:33,440
well first of all, oh,
you're storming out.

1660
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,170
You're going to take off your
little lapel mic and just walk out.

1661
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:40,970
All right. Obviously I know they don't
do that. Get back here. You can't,

1662
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,350
you can't just leave like
that. No, they don't say,

1663
01:40:45,351 --> 01:40:48,740
I'm going to show you my clan, but I will
tell you this. When women get fake tits,

1664
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:52,130
they will show you them like they got
the nails done because obviously it was a

1665
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:53,770
very insecure part of their body.

1666
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,830
So now they have it and they will eat.

1667
01:40:56,980 --> 01:41:01,150
It's so easy to even be able
to touch them. Then you just,

1668
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:05,080
all you gotta do is like what their big
paranoia is. Now that they have them,

1669
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:07,720
they want you to tell
them that they feel real.

1670
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:12,060
So all you gotta do is just
be like, uh, you know other,

1671
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:16,030
they look really natural at the,
do you feel like they feel oh yeah,

1672
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:19,450
here and they just grabbed your hand
for some reason because their hand is on

1673
01:41:19,451 --> 01:41:20,230
your hand.

1674
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:25,230
They don't feel like you're
actually filling them up
on Facebook before you felt

1675
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:27,820
a fake boot before.
Okay.

1676
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:32,410
The girl that I used to work with had
fake boobs and she was just talking about

1677
01:41:32,411 --> 01:41:36,280
it I guess like sometimes they do and I
was like, Oh really? And she was like,

1678
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:40,270
yeah, feel them. They not read on.
Yeah. See where there you go guys.

1679
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:44,120
Actually like Nice.
I haven't really felt a lot of,

1680
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:49,410
oops. Well what you say?
Nice. What do they, what do
they felt like a bag of sand?

1681
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:54,570
I guess both full and Nice and just
bucks to me and soft, you know,

1682
01:41:54,571 --> 01:41:55,404
like a woman.

1683
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:59,160
Really? I can't even hear the
talk about, no, I'm actually,

1684
01:41:59,161 --> 01:42:02,520
I'm getting turned on by this. This is
like, this is really good. You know,

1685
01:42:02,521 --> 01:42:04,080
I got to tell you got a lot
of creeps or listen to this.

1686
01:42:04,081 --> 01:42:07,020
So they probably touching themselves
right now. I know they drive trucks.

1687
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,580
I helped him out a little.

1688
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,880
Now I'm not going to haul out my
girlfriend and my own podcast.

1689
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:13,770
You're a good girl, right? Say it.

1690
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,470
What do you, wait a minute. What are
you, this is what you do at the office.

1691
01:42:19,471 --> 01:42:23,280
You go around filling up
girls with fake tits. Where?

1692
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:26,580
Where was it when you
were fucking in a bill?

1693
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,910
Haley's swimming pool down the street.
I can never remember people's names.

1694
01:42:29,911 --> 01:42:34,050

who has playboy? Hector Camacho.

the one on the on longer.

1697
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:43,560
Hector Camacho is a boxer.
That's one of the,

1698
01:42:43,561 --> 01:42:47,320
the long standing jokes in
our relationship is how I,

1699
01:42:47,321 --> 01:42:50,850
this is what happens is I can never
remember famous people's names,

1700
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:52,410
so I just,

1701
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:56,770

my mind or the names of movies like my

Yeah, she's a cutie. All right. That's it.

1708

little bonus interview. Um, and that's it.

questions and they'll find, you know,

1715
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,630

chance they'll take them out.

1716
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:46,430
If you're in like a ground round,

1717

didn't shut down by the

1719
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:56,180
health department with all those crushed
peanut shells on the floor. You know,

1720
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:58,400
you walk into a barbershop,
they got to sweep up the hair.

1721
01:43:58,401 --> 01:44:01,430
How about you sweep up the peanuts?
You fucking disgusting. All right.
