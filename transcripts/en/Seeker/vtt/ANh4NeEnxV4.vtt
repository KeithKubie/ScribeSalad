00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.790
Ugh get out of here, leave you stupid mosquito.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.390
I don’t want your stupid diseases!

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.110
hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.740
Mosquitoes are often seen as one of the most
annoying creatures on this planet and arguably

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.359
one of the most deadly.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.660
These buzzing nuisances carry deadly diseases
like yellow fever, dengue fever, lymphatic

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.130
filariasis and, famously, malaria.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.920
According to the World Health Organization,
Malaria infects over 500 million a year and

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.170
kills 3 million.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.739
So, why are mosquitoes such good carriers
of disease, especially malaria?

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.829
Well interestingly #NotAllMosquitoes!

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.370
Of the 3,000 species of mosquitoes, only three
seem to be the ones spreading most of the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.609
human diseases we’re familiar with.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.879
Anopheles mosquitoes carry malaria, filariasis,
and encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain)

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.320
Culex mosquitoes carry encephalitis, filariasis,
and the West Nile virus

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.390
and Aedes mosquitoes carry encephalitis, yellow
fever and dengue fever

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.870
In fact many species of mosquito aren’t
good carriers of disease at all!, According

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.920
to Dr. Kenneth D. Vernick, a microbiologist
at the University of Minnesota, “most mosquitoes

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.610
are malaria-resistant and the susceptible
ones are the oddballs."

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.950
Most mosquitoes actually fight malaria with
their immune responses to parasites.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
After a mosquito sucks up it’s bloody meal,
a peritrophic matrix, (or barrier) forms in

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.660
between the bug’s lining of their midgut
and the blood.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.250
While it can take a few hours to form, it
does trap some parasites inside, possibly

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.420
providing protection against some of them.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.030
The malaria parasite doesn’t infect mosquitoes
at all, it never enters their circulatory

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.030
system.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.270
Another response mosquitoes have, is to coat
the parasite in a melanin capsule, but this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.549
comes at a cost.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.719
The mosquito has to commit resources to coat
the invader, which takes resources away from

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.110
things like reproduction, resulting in the
infected mosquitoes becoming less fertile.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.810
So though the parasite can enter the mosquitoes
body, it often doesn’t make them sick.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.800
Which is good for the parasite or virus.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.450
Because if their host dies, they die too.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.320
And malaria's next trick is getting from the
mosquito into a human body.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.320
Probably yours.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.430
The parasite uses some of the very things
that help a mosquito feed to easily enter

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.910
the next host.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.480
Mosquitos have substances in their saliva
that widen blood vessels, promote bleeding,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.150
and shut down the human body’s natural first
lines of defense.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.590
These evolutionary advantages help invaders
slip into their next host; with an injection

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.790
directly into the bloodstream, they bypass
a lot of immune defenses.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.480
And some parasites actually change a mosquito’s
behavior to make it easier for them to achieve

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.590
this goal.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.430
One study in PLOSone found that malaria makes
humans smell more attractive to mosquitos.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.690
And another study published in The American
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene found

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.769
that malaria makes mosquitoes feed longer.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.010
It invades the mosquito’s salivary (SAL
UH VERY) glands while in the sporozoite (spore-oh-zoh-ite)

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.090
stage, which probably helps the parasite get
into the next host easier.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.940
But in their invasion, these young viruses
interfere with the mosquito’s saliva production

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.349
which the mosquito needs to locate blood vessels
in a host.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.890
With impaired salivary abilities, it takes
longer for the mosquitoes to feed to get the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.260
same amount of blood.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.890
Which is just fine with the parasite.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.400
It gives them more time to jump to their new
host!

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.510
So though mosquitoes are good at ferrying
parasites like malaria to our bloodstream,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.970
they don't benefit from their morbid task,
and instead put themselves in more danger,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.580
and can even become infertile.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.220
The saying goes don’t kill the messenger,
but in this case….you should totally kill

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.220
the messenger.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.239
I agree with one cornell university researcher
who called mosquitos “the most vile and

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.680
useless species on Earth.”

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.019
Why don’t we just get rid of them all?

00:03:31.019 --> 00:04:00.270
