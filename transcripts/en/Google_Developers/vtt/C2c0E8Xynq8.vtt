00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.550
Hi, I'm Kanan.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.952
I'm the strategist lead
for the AdMob in India.

00:00:09.952 --> 00:00:11.410
And today we're
going to talk about

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.990
how can you build a successful
business out of ad development,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.540
whether in India or abroad.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.720
So let's first talk
about what is AdMob,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.850
and how can it be useful to you.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.600
So AdMob is Google's solution
for in-app advertising.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.430
That means if you
have a mobile app

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.930
and you want to monetize it
through in-app advertising,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.200
AdMob is a cool product to use.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.340
So how can it work for you?

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.890
So think of it as from
a user perspective.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.200
When you're browsing an
app, and you see an ad,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.100
when do you tend to click on it?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.650
Only when it's relevant, right?

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.990
So it's important from an
advertiser and a publisher

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.600
perspective to deliver ads that
are very relevant to a user.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.690
So to give you an example, if
I'm browsing through a travel

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.170
application, and I want to book
tickets from Delhi to Bombay.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.260
So I check the fares,
check the date,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.760
timing, and then I decide
not to buy for some reason.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.320
After that I move on to
a gaming application.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.200
By browsing through
the gaming application,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.390
if I see an ad from
the same travel app

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.845
talking about discounted
fares from Delhi to Bombay,

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:18.460
it might catch my eye.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.090
That is something
I'm interested in,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.930
that's something
that's relevant to me.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.780
So, if I click on it, you,
as a publisher of the app,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.870
will earn money from that click.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.230
So it's important to deliver
ads that are very relevant.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.420
And that is what
Google's technology does.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.530
It ensures that only relevant
ads use the right users.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.960
The other thing
that is important

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.910
is to check where are
your users coming from,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.350
where are you getting the
clicks and the revenue from.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.340
So we have advanced features,
reporting and filters,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.260
which allow you to do just that.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.870
The other thing that's
important is to maximize reach.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.870
So If you build a
really cool app,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.360
it's important to make sure
you reach the right users,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.770
people can find your
app easily, especially

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.190
considering the kind of
competition that's out there.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.290
So think of an app that
is really, really popular.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.330
It became popular for a reason,
because the UX is really good,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.760
people find it engaging.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.620
So it's important to
build a quality app,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.520
but it's also very
important that people

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.320
can find your application.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.460
So discoverability, and
maximizing downloads,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.540
maximizing revenue
is something else

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.980
that you need to keep in mind
when you're building an app

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.530
business, and this is something
that we hope to help you with.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.530
The other interesting
thing about AdMob

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.310
is that not only
does it allow you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.260
to monetize your
mobile applications,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.300
but you can also
use it to promote

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.180
your apps as an advertiser.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.950
That means if you
want to showcase

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.170
your app on other
people's applications,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.350
you can use AdMob.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.270
It's very simple to set up.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.950
But let's focus on the
monetization side of it.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.360
So if you are an app
developer and you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.200
need to figure out how you're
going to make money out of it,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.400
you need certain
monetization options.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.080
So essentially
there are four ways

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.030
to monetize an application.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.580
The first is a paid model.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.100
So that means your app
is [INAUDIBLE] paid.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.540
If a user wants to
download it and use it,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.570
they have to first
make a payment

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.350
through the Play Store
or any other app store.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.470
The second model is a freemium
model, which is more popular.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.285
How the freemium model works
is if you have a mobile app,

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:32.300
like a game, which
has about 100 levels,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.420
you make the first 10
levels completely free.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.500
So, from a user perspective,
it is more effective

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.445
because I download
the application,

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.390
I test out the first ten apps.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.110
If I think it's an engaging app
and I want to play the next 90

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.880
levels too, I make a payment
of, say, $1 or $0.50 or $2,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.510
whatever you define, I
get access to the rest

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.390
of the levels.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.520
So as a user, I'm
sort of getting

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.400
a sense of what the game is,
I know what I'm paying for,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.950
so for me its value for
money, so it's easier for me

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.490
to make that payment.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.420
The third model is
in-app purchases.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.830
So you can combine this
with both the other options.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.180
So in-app purchase is a
model where you buy something

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.310
within the app while
you're engaging with it.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.670
If it's a game, you can
pay for a booster of sorts.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.160
Or, if it's a
social app, you can

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.640
pay for an additional
feature which

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.490
may not be otherwise available.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.350
The fourth and the most popular
model is in-app advertising.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.410
That means it's a
completely free app,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.420
and you monetize
it by placing ads

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.020
which are both relevant to
the user, and also engaging.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.680
So this is where AdMob comes in.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.130
It helps you monetize by
placing ads in your existing

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.020
application.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.300
So advertising is an easy way
to offset development costs.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.880
So if you already have
an app out in the market,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.570
you're working on
the second one,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.750
you need some sort
of revenue coming in.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.410
So, because AdMob is
just plug and play,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.050
it's very easy to
work around it.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.790
And revenues scale as you grow.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.500
Because, if you have
only 10 downloads,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.110
your reach is
limited, but as you

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.350
go from 100 downloads
to 10,000 to a million,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.050
your user base is growing
more and more people engaging

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.160
with the ads, and they tend
to click on more of such ads

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.470
and you get paid even more.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.160
So revenues
definitely will scale

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.000
and you will make more and
more revenue as you grow.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.640
And, because it's
such a simple product,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.800
you can start earning
revenue right away.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.450
So as soon as you create an
account and implement the SDK,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.010
ads will start showing on
your mobile application.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.880
So let's take a step
back and understand

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.880
how AdMob essentially works.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.640
You create an account
in AdMob, which

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.220
is a few basic steps, like
your username, billing address.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.160
And then specify the
kind of app that you've

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.200
built, whether it's an Android
app, or iOS, or Windows.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.830
And after that it allows
you to download the SDK.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.290
Once you integrate the SDK
in your mobile application,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.660
ads will start
showing instantly.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.100
From then on, how do you
start making revenue?

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.660
So your app is uploaded on
the Play Store, for instance.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.050
I as a user browse through it.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.260
I think it's interesting,
I download it.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.970
After downloading, I will
launch the application,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.657
and, once I'm
engaging with it, I'll

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:16.240
start seeing ads at
the bottom or top,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.020
or wherever you
choose to place them.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.450
If I think it's interesting
or if it's something

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.650
that I want to look at,
I will click on the ad.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.470
And as soon as I click
on it, you get paid.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.530
AdMob has unmatched
reach and scale.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.730
That means not only
do we support Android,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.090
but we also support
iOS and Windows.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.200
Also, advertisers
from across the globe

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.890
have access to your application.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.390
So, if an advertiser sitting
in the US, UK, Australia

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.260
thinks your app is
interesting or if it's

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.770
popular in their
country, they can

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.200
choose to target your
mobile application,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.480
and you can make a
lot of money with it.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.430
So you can start making
money from AdMob right away.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.530
All you have to do is
sign up for an account,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.320
download and integrate the SDK,
and it's as simple as that.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.770
I hope this session was
helpful, and let's see

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.100
you start making money
from AdMob right away.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.810
Thank you.
