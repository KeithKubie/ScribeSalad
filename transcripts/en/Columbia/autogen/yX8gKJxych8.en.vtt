is very interesting i was traveling that
 

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:19.250
is very interesting i was traveling that
day so i have no particular insights in

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260
day so i have no particular insights in
 

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.210
day so i have no particular insights in
all that but what I read made me think

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220
all that but what I read made me think
 

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.780
all that but what I read made me think
that three things that happened which

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:26.790
that three things that happened which
 

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.810
that three things that happened which
were positive the first thing is that

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:28.820
were positive the first thing is that
 

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.220
were positive the first thing is that
this european fund or financial

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:33.230
this european fund or financial
 

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:37.040
this european fund or financial
mechanism is going to be made permanent

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:37.050
mechanism is going to be made permanent
 

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:43.670
mechanism is going to be made permanent
and we're not will not lapse in 2013 now

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680
and we're not will not lapse in 2013 now
 

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.530
and we're not will not lapse in 2013 now
that's very important because there was

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540
that's very important because there was
 

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:49.490
that's very important because there was
an uncertainty in a large segment of the

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500
an uncertainty in a large segment of the
 

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.480
an uncertainty in a large segment of the
market on the on what would happen after

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:52.490
market on the on what would happen after
 

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.520
market on the on what would happen after
2013 the second point which i think is

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:55.530
2013 the second point which i think is
 

00:54:55.530 --> 00:55:00.790
2013 the second point which i think is
very interesting is that if after 2013 a

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:00.800
very interesting is that if after 2013 a
 

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:05.890
very interesting is that if after 2013 a
sovereign of the of the zone is under

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:05.900
sovereign of the of the zone is under
 

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:12.530
sovereign of the of the zone is under
debt pressure there will be a systematic

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540
debt pressure there will be a systematic
 

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:18.130
debt pressure there will be a systematic
intervention by the IMF and the European

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:18.140
intervention by the IMF and the European
 

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:22.460
intervention by the IMF and the European
financial mechanisms in order to

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:22.470
financial mechanisms in order to
 

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:27.170
financial mechanisms in order to
determine what has to be done and the

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180
determine what has to be done and the
 

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.730
determine what has to be done and the
third thing which i think is very

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740
third thing which i think is very
 

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.820
third thing which i think is very
interesting is that it is understood

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:31.830
interesting is that it is understood
 

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:36.650
interesting is that it is understood
that if the judgment made collectively

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660
that if the judgment made collectively
 

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.690
that if the judgment made collectively
is that there is an element of

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:40.700
is that there is an element of
 

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.490
is that there is an element of
unsustainability of the debt of the

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:43.500
unsustainability of the debt of the
 

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.940
unsustainability of the debt of the
sovereign in question there will then be

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:46.950
sovereign in question there will then be
 

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:53.660
sovereign in question there will then be
a mechanism that could lead at least 44

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:53.670
a mechanism that could lead at least 44
 

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.980
a mechanism that could lead at least 44

the holders of subordinated debt could

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540
the holders of subordinated debt could
 

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.730
the holders of subordinated debt could
lead to to a restructuring that is a

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:03.740
lead to to a restructuring that is a
 

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.700

it's not doable now now the SDR question

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280
it's not doable now now the SDR question
 

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.760
it's not doable now now the SDR question
is is I think very it's a very good

is is I think very it's a very good
 

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:13.070
is is I think very it's a very good
question because if you do really

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080
question because if you do really
 

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.100

overhaul the functioning of the system I

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:16.110
overhaul the functioning of the system I
 

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:19.490
overhaul the functioning of the system I
think you have to ask the question

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500
think you have to ask the question
 

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.280
think you have to ask the question
wouldn't it be better to have an

Special Drawing rights now you have to

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540
Special Drawing rights now you have to
 

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.150
Special Drawing rights now you have to
understand that the Special Drawing

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:47.160
understand that the Special Drawing
 

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.210

what the SDR is so if you want to have a
stabilization in the system you have to

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:09.330
stabilization in the system you have to
 

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:13.880
stabilization in the system you have to
have a discipline amongst the countries

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:13.890

Scism of the present system so you have

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840
Scism of the present system so you have
 

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.400
Scism of the present system so you have
to have an element of convergence which
