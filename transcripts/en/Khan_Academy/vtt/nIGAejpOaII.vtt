00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.720
Problem 16.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.920
Use the diagram below
to answer the

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.690
question that follows.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.390
This diagram, which
is n by 2n.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.130
Maybe they want us to do some
type of area or something.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.630
They shaded in this triangle,
which is about 1/2 of it.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.920
It's exactly 1/2 of the area.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.350
Let's see what they
want to ask us.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.545
The diagram above could best
be used to derive a formula

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.920
for which of the following
quantities?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.220
Interesting.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.860
All right, the sum
of the first n

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.700
consecutive odd integers.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.065
Now does that make any sense?

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:32.490
Let's see, we have n here, and
they say the sum of the first

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.580
n consecutive odd integers.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.940
Let's see, if we look at the
shaded area, if we look at the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.120
height here-- that height here
is 1-- the height of this next

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.970
column, right here, is 3.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.310
The height of the next
column is 5.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.410
Every column is incrementing
by 2, so these are the odd

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.620
integers, and there are going
to be n of them, right?

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.010
One, two, three, four, all
the way to n of them.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.770
And so if we wanted the sum
of them, we would have

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.950
essentially just to figure out
the area of the shaded region,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.870
so we could use the
diagram for that.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.060
So, the area of the shaded
region is 2n times n divided

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780
by 2, which is equal
to n squared.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.500
Which is a neat outcome by
itself, that the sum of the

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.610
first n consecutive odd
integers is n squared.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.210
So that's going to
be our choice, A.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.490
You can actually use
the diagram to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.060
figure out that formula.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.140
The other ones don't
make sense.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.150
The product of the first n
consecutive even integers.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.720
I don't see where you
get even integers.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.550
There's a 1 and a 3 and a 5.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.800
So anything with even
doesn't make sense.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.000
And then choice D tells us the
product of the first n

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.600
consecutive odd integers.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.030
But I don't see how this is
helping you visualize what

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.610
happens when you multiply
1 times 3 times 5

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.420
times 7, and so forth.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.850
Next problem.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.390
Problem 9.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.460
Use the diagram below
to answer the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.340
question that follows.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.020
OK, it looks like some type
of lattice multiplication.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.540
The diagram above demonstrates
how the lattice multiplication

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.410
algorithm is used to multiply--
I was right, it's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.100
lattice multiplication--
multiply 231 by 25 to get the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.480
product 5,775.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.760
What value does the circled
digit represent?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.280
So, if lattice multiplication
looks like something

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.150
completely foreign to you, you
just have to-- well, I'll give

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.440
you a quick primer on it.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.540
All you're doing, each of
these boxes, you're just

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.220
multiplying the corresponding
digit.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.200
So 1 times 2 is 2.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.220
0, 2.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.370
3 times 2 is 0, 6.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.450
2 times 2 is 0, 4.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.700
1 times 5 is 0, 5.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.610
3 times 5 is 15, 1 5.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.180
2 times 5 is 10.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.000
And then, you add up the core,
the different places.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.640
So this is the 1's diagonal,
right here.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.610
You have just a 5 there.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.320
You get a 5.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.780
This is our 10's diagonal,
right here.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.810
So it's 20 plus 0
plus 50 is 70.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.290
And then this is your 100's
diagonal, 600 plus 100 is

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.560
equal to 700.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.930
So I just answered
your question.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.000
They said, what does the circled
digit represent?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.690
Well the circled digit is in
this hundreds diagonal, so it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.960
represents 100.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.460
Now, if that still is kind of
unfamiliar and you're like, oh

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.720
gee, how was I supposed to know

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.460
about this 100's diagonal?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.290
You could think about
it this way.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.720
This 15 right here is the
byproduct of multiplying that

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.810
3 and that 5.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.070
Right?

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.900
3 times 5 is 15.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.410
And then they circled the 1.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.070
But what is this, really?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.710
This is really a 30.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.110
Right?

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.790
This is 231.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.290
So this is really 30 times 5.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.320
This is just a regular 5.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.850
30 times 5 is equal to 150.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.450
So this 15 is really
representing 150, or this 1 is

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.540
really representing 100.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.780
And that makes sense because
it's in that 100's diagonal.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.490
So once again, our answer
would be C, 100.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.210
Problem 18.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.600
Use the samples of a student's
work below to answer the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.950
question that follows.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.280
Which of the following
statements best describes the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.360
mathematical validity of the
algorithm that the student

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.820
appears to be using?

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.190
So let's see what the
student's doing.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.399
9/16 divided by 3/4.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.530
He or she is just dividing the
numerators and then dividing

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.100
the denominators.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.380
Now that's not the standard--
the traditional way-- that,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.970
you know, most of us are taught
of doing division of

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.680
fractions, right?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.750
The standard way, if we have
a/b divided by c/d-- or at

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.860
least the way I learned to do
it-- I would say that this is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.060
equal to a/b times d/c, times
the reciprocal of this.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.110
And I would have gotten that
it's equal to ad over bc.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.760
This is the standard.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.790
This is the standard
algorithm.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.880
Now let's see, this guy over
here, if he takes a/b and he

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.420
divides it by c/d, what he's
getting essentially for the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.320
new numerator, he takes
a/c, and for the new

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.820
denominator he takes b/d.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.690
And if you were to simplify
this-- a/c divided by b/d--

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:21.060
this is the same thing as a/c
times d/b, which is equal to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.620
ad over bc.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.710
So even though this looks very
bizarre and actually very

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.720
naive, because he's just
dividing the numerator and

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.840
dividing the denominator,
it works.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.720
This'll work for any numbers
that you put in there.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.150
And so, let's see,
A isn't right.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.710
It is definitely, you know,
try doing this the

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.130
way you know it.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.980
You'll get these same answers.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.740
So A isn't it.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.120
It's definitely, well,
here you go, D.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.850
It is valid for all rational
numbers, as unintuitive as

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.360
that might be.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.670
But it looks like this kid, oh,
he just said oh, I'll just

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.210
divide the numerators and divide
the denominators just

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.570
because multiplying fractions,
you kind of do the same thing.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.260
But it just happens to work.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.790
In fact, this is probably
how they should

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.710
teach it, or maybe.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.140
Arguably how they might
want to teach it.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.220
Problem 19.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.250
Use the inequality below
to answer the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.370
question that follows.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.940
OK, maybe it's an inequality.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.160
Which of the following
inequalities describes all

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.280
possible values of x?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.200
So let me write.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.710
So they're writing 3/x
is greater than 4/x.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.520
So, if we assume-- well x can't
be equal to 0, because

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.500
that would just be undefined.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.040
So let's just write that down.
x cannot be equal to 0.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.580
So to solve this equation, we
can multiply both sides by x.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.770
We have to be very careful,
though, because if x is

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.990
negative, and you multiply both
sides by it, you'd have

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.290
to switch this inequality.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:54.130
But let's just assume
x is greater than 0.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.250
If x is greater than 0, then
when you multiply both sides

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.940
of these, of this equation, by
x, you don't have to switch

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.920
the inequality, and then you
get 3-- let me put it in a

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.760
different color-- if you
multiply both sides of this

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.030
equation by x, you get 3 is
greater than 4, which is

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.940
definitely, this is false.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.965
This cannot be true.

00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:19.735
So x cannot be greater than 0.

00:07:19.735 --> 00:07:22.570
So let's see what happens
when x is less than 0.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.580
If x is less than 0, then when
you multiply both sides of

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.340
this equation by x, you have to
switch the inequality sign.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.350
So then you would get
3 is less than 4.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.310
Which is definitely
true, right?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.490
What I did is just multiplied
both sides of this by x.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.680
When you multiply both sides
of an inequality by a

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.050
negative, you have
to swap this.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.890
That's why the greater than
became a less than.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.800
These canceled out.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.760
So you got 3 is less than
4, which is true.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:55.040
So any x less than 0
will satisfy this

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.950
equation, right here.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.710
So then you could try it out
as, you know, minus 3/4 is

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.020
greater than minus 4/4, right?

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.720
You could try it out with any
numbers that you might like.
