00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:04.037
( intro music )

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:11.544
( applause )

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.379
Kobie Boykins: Tonight what we
are going to try to do...

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.114 line:0%
we are going to take
an exploration,

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:18.685 line:0%
an exploration of
the planet surface of Mars.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.788 line:0%
And we are going to look
at that planet through the
eyes of Rovers.

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.323
And the first Rovers
we're going to talk about

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.658
are Spirit and Opportunity,

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.627
the two Mars Exploration Rovers.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:29.695
And then we're going to
switch into Curiosity.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:34.133
A larger Rover and its
job is to do something
a little different.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.668
But first we have to
go back in time.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.469
We're going to back
approximately 10 years,

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.771
a little bit more than 10 years.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.474
And we're going to discuss
what happens

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.844
<i> and how Spirit and Opportunity
made it to the surface of Mars.</i>

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.513
<i> So, we're going to fly over to
Kennedy Space Center in Florida</i>

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.082
<i> and we're going to go
 and we're going to get</i>

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.983
<i> real close and personal
 with the Delta II rocket.</i>

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:52.485
<i>Now this is the Delta II rocket,</i>

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.153
<i> it's built by the
 Boeing Company.</i>

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.455
<i> It has three stages to orbit.</i>

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.223
<i> And around the bottom side
 of this vehicle</i>

00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:00.059
<i> there's nine air-lit solids.</i>

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.662
<i> So this is going to help us
 get a little bit extra lift,</i>

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.031
<i> so that we can get to Mars
 as rapidly as possible.</i>

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.699
And if you don't mind
counting down with me.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:11.037
Five, four, three, two.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.872
Begin ignition.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.509
<i> And lift off of the Delta II
 rocket with the
 Mars Exploration--</i>

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.911
<i> And in a minute and 30 seconds
 we're in orbit around Earth.</i>

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.513
<i> As you see, we're starting to</i>

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.148
<i> drop away some of the
 air-lit solids.</i>

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.951
<i> Once those air-lit solids fall
 back away they get recycled.</i>

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.085
<i> They get picked up.</i>

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.219
<i>Once out first stage burns out,</i>

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:28.053
<i> we're going to let that go,</i>

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.421
<i> we're going to light
 our second stage.</i>

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:30.756
<i> Once we light our second stage</i>

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.591
<i> then we let that first stage
 fall back to the ocean,</i>

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.493
<i> it becomes an ecosystem
 for the fish.</i>

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:35.694
<i> We light our second stage.</i>

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:37.796
<i> At this point the spacecraft
 has very little stability,</i>

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.031
<i> so we are going to spin it up.</i>

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.834
<i> We spin it up to about 12 RPM,</i>

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.569
<i>more or less like a quarterback
 that throws a nice,
 tight spiral.</i>

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.638
<i>We are going to get really good
 flight through the air.</i>

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:46.906
<i> We light our third stage,</i>

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.774
<i> this puts us on
 a direct trajectory to Mars.</i>

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:51.076
We are going to do what we like
to call quiescent period.

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:53.746
The boring period of travelling
through interstellar space.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.081
( audience laughter )

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.348
Okay. So now...

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:57.650
<i>Seven months later, here we are</i>

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.451
<i> travelling at
 16,000 miles per hour</i>

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:00.686
<i> toward the surface of Mars.</i>

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.888
<i>We lose our cruise stage because
 we don't need it any more.</i>

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.324
<i> It has pointed us
 directly at Mars,</i>

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.192
<i> we are ready to go and we are
 going to hit our landing site.</i>

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.093
<i> We are travelling at
 16,000 miles per hour</i>

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:09.595
<i> and we hit the
 upper atmosphere of Mars.</i>

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.230
<i> When we hit the
 upper atmosphere of Mars,</i>

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.732
<i>the friction as we come through</i>

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.267
<i> literally burns a hole
 in the upper atmosphere.</i>

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.103
<i> The heat shield
 in the front of our Rover</i>

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.038
<i> gets to about the
 surface temperature of the Sun</i>

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.639
<i> 1600 degrees centigrade.</i>

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.674
<i> At this point we're
 going to start</i>

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.309
<i> what I like to call
 reverse origami.</i>

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.543
<i> We're going to pull up
 a parachute,</i>

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:25.879
<i> this is a supersonic parachute</i>

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.513
<i> and that's going to start
 changing our angle</i>

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:28.881
<i>of attack from being directly in</i>

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:31.150
<i> to being more vertical
 with the surface of Mars.</i>

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.518
<i> At this point
 we're going to slow down</i>

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.754
<i> to around 300-400
 miles per hour.</i>

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:35.921
<i> We are going to lose
 our heat shield</i>

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:38.157
<i>because we don't want that heat
 to come back into our vehicle.</i>

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.926
<i>We are going to lower our lander
 more or less on a shoestring.</i>

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:43.996
<i> Once we find the surface
 we blow up the airbags.</i>

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:45.664
<i> That takes about
 the blink of an eye,</i>

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:46.866
<i> about half a millisecond.</i>

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.334
<i> And then we're going to fire
 some retrorockets</i>

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.569
<i> when we get to about
 40 meters above the surface,</i>

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.171
<i>slow down to zero miles per hour</i>

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.540
<i> cut the cord and bounce.</i>

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.910
<i> And we bounce...</i>

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.411
<i> and we bounce.</i>

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.913
<i> Now the first bounce of
this vehicle could take us over,</i>

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:02.281
<i> I use,
 the Empire State Building.</i>

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.784
<i> we can bounce anywhere from
a mile and a half to two miles.</i>

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.586
<i> Each successive bounce
 is taking away a
 little bit of energy,</i>

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.887
<i> which slows us down.</i>

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:11.057
<i>After we lose all of our energy
 and we come to a stop,</i>

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.424
<i> we are going to
 deflate the airbags.</i>

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:14.327
<i> So the vehicle senses that
 we've stopped</i>

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.427
<i> we deflate the airbags.</i>

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:16.796
What you saw happen
in a few seconds there

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.697
takes about
45 minutes in real time.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:19.832
The next thing
that we're going to do is

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.501
we're going to open up
our lander petals.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.102
We are going to open up
these lander petals now,

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.937
what you're going to see
happen in about 30 seconds

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.372
happens in 45 minutes.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.473
<i> The next thing
 that we are going to do</i>

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:28.641
<i> we are going to open up
 the solar arrays.</i>

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.177
<i> If you don't mind,
 I'll watch too.</i>

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.378
<i> Ah!</i>

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.746
( audience laughter )

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:36.448
<i>We've got one more thing to do.</i>

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:39.719
<i> Just one more part.
 Okay, just...</i>

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.422
<i> ooh...
 once it gets over center,</i>

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:45.825
<i> ah, okay! Well done.</i>

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.593
I must have seen this
a thousand times,

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:48.895
it doesn't matter
how many times I see it,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.263
I get very excited
when it works.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.865
Because my team and I were
the team that designed that

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.167
and if it didn't work we had
a very, very bad day on Mars.

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:57.870
So, when it works
I get a little excited.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.471
So, open up the solar arrays,

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:00.773
now we can power the vehicle.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.108
We are starting to
charge up the batteries.

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.343
The last things that you
are going to see happen
on this first day

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.813
is we pull up the Pancam mast,
what we call the PMA.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.313
And we deploy our
high-gain antennas,

00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:10.016
so we can talk directly
back to Earth.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.550
The last thing that you are
going to see the Rover do

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.520
in this animation is it's going
to take a panoramic image.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.722
<i>One of the things that you want
 to do when you've landed
 in a new place</i>

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:18.224
<i> is find out where you are.</i>

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.725
<i> So we are going to
 take this beautiful image,</i>

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:21.727
<i> we're going to start
transmitting that back to Earth.</i>

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:22.962
<i> So the next day
 what we're going to do is</i>

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.363
<i> we're going to stand up
 the vehicle.</i>

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:25.564
<i> Deploy the front wheels,</i>

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.332
<i> and we're going to change
 more or less</i>

00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:29.702
<i>our perspective on the surface.</i>

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.336
<i> When we designed
 Spirit and Opportunity,</i>

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:34.073
<i> we designed the eyes
 to be at 5-foot-2.</i>

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.475
<i> That's approximately the level
 of a human being walking</i>

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:37.809
<i> on the surface of Mars.</i>

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:39.645
<i> So, now when we take images</i>

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:41.213
<i>and we get our panoramic images,</i>

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:43.616
<i>it's going to feel like a human
 being was standing on Mars</i>

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.851
<i> looking around.
 We are looking for</i>

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.254
<i> scientifically exciting sites.</i>

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.256
<i> Spirit and Opportunity
 are roving geologists.</i>

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.124
<i> Their job was to follow
 the water,</i>

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:55.695
<i>to look for water that may have
 flown on the surface of Mars.</i>

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.696
<i> And we are going to do
 that through the history
 of the rocks.</i>

00:04:57.696 --> 00:05:00.432
<i> Go up taste the rocks,
touch the rocks, feel the rocks,</i>

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.901
<i> if you can break the rocks.</i>

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.737
<i> Try to figure out
 do the rocks tell us something</i>

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.772
<i> about the history of Mars.</i>

00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:08.074
<i> So now the last thing
 that we have to do</i>

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.141
<i> is drive the Rover
 off the lander.</i>

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:11.277
<i> You are going to see
 the lander change it's
 position a little bit,</i>

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.145
<i> get ready for the
 Rover to drive off</i>

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.646
<i>on these things called batwings.</i>

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:15.782
<i> We drive off on those batwings</i>

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.649
<i> and we get six wheels
 on the surface of Mars.</i>

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.652
<i> We call Spirit the bad sister.</i>

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.054
<i> And not because
 she was bad in any way...</i>

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:24.790
but we drive off the lander,
we go up to the first rock.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.225
The rock was called Adirondack.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:29.062
We took out her arm,
we touched the rock

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.663
and as soon as we
touched the rock

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.298
Spirit did not call home.

00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:36.668
It's like ET went,
"I no phone home."

00:05:36.668 --> 00:05:39.104
So, we were worried that
we didn't understand

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:40.372
what was going on with Spirit.

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:41.707
Remember that boring period

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:42.841
of driving through
interstellar space

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:45.311
that I told you about...
seven months.

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.680
So, during that
seven month period of time

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.348
we had one of the
biggest solar flares,

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:51.250
solar activities
that we have ever seen,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.519
Alright? So lots of gamma rays,
bad stuff...

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.522
are... the sun burped,

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.224
bad stuff goes flying through
interstellar space.

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:00.359
So what did we do?

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.294
First time ever when we
were flying a spacecraft

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:06.232
into deep space we actually
rebooted the computer.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:09.702
So we turned it off.

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.236
( audience laughter )

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:14.539
Turned it back on.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:15.808
And it goes, "Hey, I'm here."

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.376
And we go all, "Oh goodness,
gracious, thank you."

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:20.012
Okay! It calls back home,
we are like great, great, great.

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.747
It has all of this great stuff,

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:23.516
it starts recording everything
that it's doing,

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.018
all of it's maneuvers,
it records all the things
that are felt,

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:28.320
all the bounces on the surface,
everything, everything...

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.323
eight days later drives off,
touches a rock

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.225
and it's memory got full.

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:36.495
And once its memory got full,
the computer wouldn't boot up.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.564
And we actually told it to
erase it's memory,

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.634
threw all of that stuff
through quiescent space away.

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.602
And then,
"Hey, here I am all happy."

00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:45.070
"Do whatever you want me to do."
"Do the rock."

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.838
And then Spirit became okay

00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:49.442
Spirit and Opportunity were,
I'll tell you,

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:52.478
they were designed to go
to the surface of Mars

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:55.114
and explore the surface
for 90 days.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.149
And travel up to 600 meters.

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:58.184
<i> Spirit was on the surface</i>

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.553
<i> communicating for more than
 five years.</i>

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:03.689
<i> Traveled a little less than
 five miles.</i>

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.025
<i> Opportunity, the good sister
 landed a month later,</i>

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:10.395
<i> has been on the surface
 for over a decade</i>

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:15.034
<i> and continues giving us
 great information daily.</i>

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:17.169
<i> And she's traveled
 over 25 miles.</i>

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:19.805
So, why do we go to Mars?
Why is Mars

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:22.041
such an interesting place
to explore?

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:26.512
In the image that you see
behind me on the left is Mars.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:28.513
And on the right is Earth.

00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:29.982
Looks like where river or water

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.950
may have run
at some point in time.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.886
<i> In this image,
 I have switched it around.</i>

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:37.022
<i> On the left is Earth,
 on the right is Mars.</i>

00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:39.925
<i> That image on the right
 is the largest known volcano</i>

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:41.260
<i> in our solar system.</i>

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.228
<i> The rocky planets,
 it's called the Olympus Mons,</i>

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:44.597
<i> it's on the surface of Mars.</i>

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:48.567
<i> It's approximately the size
 of the state of Arizona.</i>

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:51.570
<i> Go back to the early 70s,
 76-77 when we landed</i>

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.972
<i> the Viking landers
 on the surface of Mars.</i>

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:57.710
<i> We have Mars Pathfinder,
 which landed in
 July 4th of 1997.</i>

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.810
<i> And then we had Phoenix.</i>

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.047
<i> And then you have the
 two landing sites for
 Spirit and Opportunity,</i>

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:03.448
<i> in this topographical map.
 Let me show it in
 a different way.</i>

00:08:03.448 --> 00:08:05.884
<i> For those that like
 planetary maps</i>

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:07.086
<i> you can see where we landed.</i>

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:08.954
<i> And the other thing
 that you'll see in this</i>

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:11.090
<i> is the yellow places are the
 places that we've landed,</i>

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.758
<i> the ones in white were the</i>

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:16.828
<i> possibilities for
 Curiosity to land.</i>

00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:18.263
<i> So, now we're on the surface.</i>

00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:19.699
<i> Spirit and Opportunity caught</i>

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.167
<i> some very interesting things
 on the surface.</i>

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.737
<i> From orbit we could see things
 that look like large tracks,</i>

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:27.606
<i> long tracks on the...
 on the dust, the surface.</i>

00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:29.909
<i> And we always postulated
 that they would have to have</i>

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.777
<i> these dust devils,
 but we had never seem them.</i>

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.245
<i> We believe that this is
 one of the reasons</i>

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:34.680
<i> the vehicles have lasted
 so long.</i>

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.615
<i> Every so often when these
 dust devils would come by</i>

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:37.883
<i>and clean off my solar arrays...</i>

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:39.785
and make us happy
and we make more power

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.421
and now the Rovers can
continue to do their science.

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.389
Very interesting.

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:47.393
<i> Scientifically this is one of
 the most important images</i>

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.528
<i> that we took with the
 Opportunity vehicle.</i>

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:51.930
<i> It was the first time ever
 remotely</i>

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.765
<i> with a robotic vehicle</i>

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:56.835
<i> that we took an image
 on the surface</i>

00:08:56.835 --> 00:09:00.639
<i> at the exact same time
 we took the image from orbit.</i>

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.774
So, now we can actually do
atmospheric science

00:09:02.774 --> 00:09:06.779
from the ground and from
orbit at the exact same time.

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.147
<i> So, with Opportunity,
 the good sister,</i>

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:12.685
<i> it travels 300 million miles,</i>

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:14.686
<i> bounces along the
 surface of Mars</i>

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:16.221
<i> and lands in a crater.</i>

00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:18.223
<i> There's nothing there,
 it's just nothing,</i>

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:19.959
<i> except one rock.</i>

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:25.331
<i> And the rock is not from Mars!</i>

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.500
It's a meteorite
from somewhere else.

00:09:28.733 --> 00:09:30.135
Now, the interesting thing is

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:32.338
we've seen quite a few of these
now on the surface of Mars.

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:34.574
<i> We do know that they are from
 one of the four rocky planets</i>

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.708
<i> or some of the asteroid belt,
 we do know that.</i>

00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:39.478
<i>But where they are actually from
 we don't know, okay.</i>

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:41.580
They probably were around
sort of the early formation

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.981
of the planet.

00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:44.416
But we don't know.

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:47.452
But they are very interesting.
Very exciting.

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:50.522
<i> The Rover is now
 here in Endeavour Crater.</i>

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:52.091
<i> It's been exploring
 Endeavour Crater</i>

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:53.459
<i> for at least a year now.</i>

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:54.893
<i> We've driven down
 into the crater,</i>

00:09:54.893 --> 00:09:56.728
<i> we are at a new location
 inside the crater.</i>

00:09:56.728 --> 00:09:59.264
<i> We are seeing a lot more of
 these clays, right.</i>

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.433
<i> So now we know that
 in this location</i>

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:04.470
<i>all across the Meridiani Plains
 there's a lot of water.</i>

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.837
<i> Deep water.</i>

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:07.439
<i> We see the change in salinity.</i>

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:08.473
Same thing for Spirit,

00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:09.675
as we drove up Husband Hill

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:12.578
we started to see this change
in salinity in the soil.

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:14.313
It was a failure that actually
told us that.

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.248
One of the wheels
on the Spirit Rover

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:18.850
stopped working
and so we started dragging it.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.018
And by dragging it we created

00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:21.587
this trench
on the surface of Mars.

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:22.621
And as we were
creating this trench

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.190
when we turned around
and took images

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.358
we saw the actual albedo,

00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:29.495
the light that was coming off
the soil change.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:31.029
And that started to tell us
something is going on

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.631
so we started doing
more investigation.

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:34.900
And we saw this salt
level change

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.203
as we started to get higher
in elevation on the mountain.

00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:40.205
And what it means is that
as the water was receding

00:10:40.205 --> 00:10:42.508
it got much more salty

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.109
and that told us that
there was water there.

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:46.545
Very salty water and there was
water at both these locations.

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.280
So now we know that Mars
was a very wet place

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.415
at one point of time
in the past.

00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:53.585
<i> We are going to change
 gears and talk about
 Curiosity a little bit.</i>

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:57.623
<i> Curiosity was launched on
 November 26th 2011,</i>

00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:59.224
<i> and landed August 5th.</i>

00:10:59.224 --> 00:11:01.160
<i> We've traveled for 9-point...</i>

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.131
<i>9-point-4, 9-point-5 kilometers
 on the surface as of Saul 774.</i>

00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:09.668
Curiosity was designed
to drive 20 kilometers

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:12.104
and be on the surface
for one Martian year.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.205
So, we've already made
one Martian year,

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:16.207
so we've already made part of
our prime commitment to NASA

00:11:16.207 --> 00:11:17.810
and that... it's been awesome.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.044
It's been an awesome
couple of years.

00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:21.112
Now how did we get there?

00:11:21.112 --> 00:11:22.448
<i> So it's a little different.</i>

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.916
<i> Very, very similar
 launch sequence</i>

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.083
<i> but it's a different
 launch vehicle.</i>

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.786
<i> So instead of a
 Boeing vehicle, this is a
 Lockheed Martin vehicle.</i>

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:30.322
<i> It's called an Atlas rocket.
 It's built by Lockheed.</i>

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:32.391
<i> It has really
 just two stages to orbit.</i>

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.958
<i> So you've seen
 we've already got into orbit,</i>

00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.027
<i> you saw that particular part.</i>

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:38.497
<i> Now, this second stage of this
 vehicle is much more capable.</i>

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.733
<i>It has some retrorockets on it,
 it has some thrusters on it.</i>

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:44.303
<i> Now it can spin us up and it
 can point us directly at Mars.</i>

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:45.704
<i> So we did the last kick,</i>

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.639
<i> and then that's going to
 fall back and burn up
 in the atmosphere.</i>

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:50.242
<i> What doesn't burn up
 becomes ecosystem for fish.</i>

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.677
<i> And now we are going to
 start going around.</i>

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:53.546
<i> So now we are on a
 direct trajectory to Mars.</i>

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.414
<i> You are going to see us
 light up the solar arrays</i>

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:56.681
<i> that are around
 on the cruise stage.</i>

00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.450
<i> That's going to actually
 charge up our batteries</i>

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.352
<i> and then what we do is,
 we supercharge the batteries</i>

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.353 line:0%
<i> and then we discharge them</i>

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:04.323 line:0%
<i> and we keep them at about
80 percent the rest of the way.</i>

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:05.624 line:0%
<i> Now we are travelling
 a little bit slower</i>

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:07.659
<i> because we don't have
 the same lift capability</i>

00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:08.794
<i> with the Lockheed vehicle.</i>

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.763
<i> So we are travelling at
 14,500 miles an hour.</i>

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:12.664
<i>And it takes a little bit longer</i>

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.666
<i> because Earth and Mars
 are at different orientation.</i>

00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:16.034
<i> Deploy a parachute again.</i>

00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:17.102
<i> We are going to
 lose that heat shield</i>

00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:18.370
<i> because we don't want to
 get that heat soak</i>

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.771
<i> coming back
 into the vehicle.</i>

00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:20.805
<i> But now everything is changed.</i>

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:22.774
<i> We lose the heat shied
 and instead of...</i>

00:12:22.774 --> 00:12:25.344
<i> lowering a lander with airbags</i>

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:29.381
<i> we are actually going to
 cut some cables and bolts,
 more or less</i>

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.751
<i> and let our Rover
 fall toward the surface.</i>

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.520
<i> Fire up some rockets and fly.</i>

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.223
<i> We added a new science
 instrument called the
 Marty Camera.</i>

00:12:38.223 --> 00:12:39.624
This camera is actually
taking images

00:12:39.624 --> 00:12:41.226
at about 32 frames per second.

00:12:41.226 --> 00:12:42.560
So we are going to
zoom in on the camera

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.995
and you're going to look at
what's going on.

00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:45.464
<i> So as we are
 falling toward the surface</i>

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:48.300
<i> the camera is taking images
 of the surface of Mars,</i>

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.136
<i> overlaying them, figuring out
what is our downrange trajectory</i>

00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:54.305
<i> and velocity, and if there are
 any obstacles that
 are in the way.</i>

00:12:54.305 --> 00:12:55.674
<i> Once we figure out
 there are no obstacles</i>

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.242
<i> in the way, we are going to
 lower our Rover</i>

00:12:57.242 --> 00:12:59.177
<i> on three shoestrings and
 an umbilical cord.</i>

00:12:59.177 --> 00:13:01.379
<i> Really gingerly hit the ground</i>

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:03.548
<i> and once we sense
 slack in the cables.</i>

00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:06.252
<i> The cables go slack, we cut
 the three umbilical cords</i>

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:09.221
<i> and the descent stage
 fires up and flies away.</i>

00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.623
<i> Designed to go 600 meters
 away from the vehicle.</i>

00:13:11.623 --> 00:13:12.524
<i>It would be bad if it came back</i>

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.159
<i> and crashed on us,
 that would be really bad.</i>

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:15.226
<i> Now we are on our wheels.</i>

00:13:15.226 --> 00:13:16.762
<i>We are ready to start exploring.</i>

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.397
So now instead of having to
drive off a lander,

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:20.199
we are ready to go
the very first day.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.668
Last things that we have
to do is pull up our
remote sensing mast

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:23.836
what we call the RSM

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.370
and pull out our
high-gain antenna.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.705
The high-gain antenna
for this vehicle

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.240
was delivered to us
by the Spanish

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.577
as a gift... to NASA.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.878
<i> Last thing you are going to
 see here is</i>

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.180
<i> as we start driving around
 with Curiosity is that</i>

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.082
<i> Curiosity is a
 different vehicle.</i>

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:38.917
<i> Instead of being a
 roving geologist,</i>

00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:40.286
<i> it's a roving biologist.</i>

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:43.721
<i> It's job is to look for
 past places on Mars</i>

00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.524
<i>that could have sustained life.</i>

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:46.959
<i> We get to shoot a laser
 at the rock.</i>

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.093
<i> Now why did we do that?</i>

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.728
<i>Instead of having to go over and
 touch every rock</i>

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:51.864
<i> and taste every rock...
 like we said before,</i>

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.665
<i> we can actually fire
 the laser at the rock,</i>

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:55.267
<i> burn the surface of the rock</i>

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:56.935
<i> and look at the gas
 that comes off.</i>

00:13:56.935 --> 00:13:58.204
<i> And from that gas we can see</i>

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.038
<i> what the chemical composition
 of that rock is.</i>

00:14:00.038 --> 00:14:01.573
<i> What are the elements
 that are there.</i>

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:03.308
<i> The other thing
 that we did with Curiosity</i>

00:14:03.308 --> 00:14:06.044
<i> is we added a drill.</i>

00:14:06.044 --> 00:14:09.647
<i> Now this is the first time
 that we will be able to
 drill robotically</i>

00:14:09.647 --> 00:14:10.950
<i> on another planetary surface.</i>

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.451
<i> Now we have drilled before
 with human beings</i>

00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:14.953
<i> on the surface of the moon.</i>

00:14:14.953 --> 00:14:15.921
<i> Anyway what we are seeing here</i>

00:14:16.054 --> 00:14:17.556
<i> in the video is what we call
 x-ray florescence.</i>

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:19.424
<i>We are actually shooting x-rays
 through the rocks,</i>

00:14:19.424 --> 00:14:21.293
<i> we agitate them and we can see</i>

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.929
<i> how the actual chemicals
 are held together.</i>

00:14:23.929 --> 00:14:27.132
What is the crystalline
structure and that actually
tells us a lot

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:30.702
about what's going on with rocks
on the surface of Mars.

00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:32.303
<i> Some more of the testing
 that we've got</i>

00:14:32.303 --> 00:14:33.806
<i> and here what we're going to
 do is,</i>

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.674
<i> we're going to show
 the mobility system.</i>

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.309 line:0%
<i> The mobility system
 is very similar</i>

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:39.210 line:0%
<i> to the mobility system
 that we had on Pathfinder</i>

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.912 line:0%
<i>and the Mars Exploration Rover.
 Right.</i>

00:14:40.912 --> 00:14:42.748 line:0%
<i> It's the rocker-bogie
 suspension system</i>

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.415 line:0%
<i> that we've used
 on all of the vehicles</i>

00:14:44.415 --> 00:14:45.384 line:0%
<i> that we've had on the surface.</i>

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:47.085
<i> But this one serves
 a different purpose.</i>

00:14:47.085 --> 00:14:49.087
<i>It actually is our landing gear.</i>

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.723
<i> So, the wheels that look like</i>

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.591
<i> they are one monolithic
 structure of aluminum,</i>

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:55.027
<i> they are not.
 They are about seven sheets</i>

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:57.362
<i> of paper of aluminum
 on the outside shell.</i>

00:14:57.362 --> 00:14:58.763
<i>But in the middle it's titanium</i>

00:14:58.763 --> 00:14:59.932
<i> and the titanium is there</i>

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:03.102
<i> to give us sort of a spongy,
 flexer feel.</i>

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:04.737
<i> You are going to see us
 doing some testing.</i>

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.939
<i> We are driving over
 obstacles that simulate</i>

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.673
<i>what we believe we are going to
 get to on Mars,</i>

00:15:08.673 --> 00:15:11.009
<i> about 35-centimeter
 height obstacles.</i>

00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:13.846
<i> We tilt the vehicle to
driver over different surfaces,</i>

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.314
<i> we drive on the surface.</i>

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:17.650
<i> We have six-wheel drive,
 four-wheel steering.</i>

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.684
<i> So, all six wheels
 of the vehicle can drive,</i>

00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:22.688
<i> and all four wheels can
 turn toe-in about 90 degrees.</i>

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:24.656
<i> So we can actually turn
 about our center of mass.</i>

00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:27.158
<i> So if we wanted to turn
 in place we actually could.</i>

00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:29.394
<i> The vehicle has a top speed</i>

00:15:29.394 --> 00:15:31.896
<i>of five centimeters per second.</i>

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:33.265
<i> It's boogieing.</i>

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.432
( audience laughter )

00:15:34.432 --> 00:15:36.001
<i> It takes us...
 I'll tell you what--</i>

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:39.338
<i> It takes us 45 minutes
 to do a football field.</i>

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:40.405
<i> That's how slow we move.</i>

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:41.607
<i> So it's really, really slow.</i>

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.975
Now, when you are
300 million miles away from the

00:15:43.975 --> 00:15:46.478
nearest gas station,
it's okay to go slow.

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:50.983
<i> Where did we go on the surface
 of Mars for Curiosity?</i>

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.284
<i> Curiosity went to a place
 called Gale Crater.</i>

00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:56.421
<i> So, why did we go
 to this Gale Crater?</i>

00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:58.590
<i> The reason we went to
 Gale Crater is that...</i>

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.125
we wanted to investigate

00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:03.595
this place called Mount Sharp.

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:06.565
<i> And Mount Sharp is this very,
 very large mountain.</i>

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.101
<i> It's 5-point-5 kilometers
 in size</i>

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:13.204
<i> and what we are looking
 for is the different layers</i>

00:16:13.204 --> 00:16:15.574
<i> as you drive up the mountain.</i>

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.575
So, we are going to land,
drive to the mountain

00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:19.611
and then look at the difference,

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:22.280
they say clays,
we'll just say it
is time periods.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.549
So, early time period
to later time period

00:16:24.549 --> 00:16:26.184
as you drive up this mountain.

00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:28.319
Trying to see... can we see

00:16:28.319 --> 00:16:29.954
places on the surface of Mars

00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:34.259
that once could have
been habitable for life.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:37.162
Could Mars in this location,
around Gale Crater,

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.898
sustain life and does it have
the building blocks,

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:44.269
the basic pieces to
actually have life grow

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.737
in that location.

00:16:45.737 --> 00:16:47.506
<i> Then we got some of the
 first images back.</i>

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.707
<i> So this was actually...
 after the first drive.</i>

00:16:49.707 --> 00:16:52.043
<i> And you see the
 name Curiosity.</i>

00:16:52.043 --> 00:16:54.045
<i> After we got to the surface,
 we started taking selfies.</i>

00:16:54.045 --> 00:16:55.880
( audience laughter )

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.150
<i> So this is one of the
 first selfies of the Rover.</i>

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.652
<i> It's a shadow,
 we weren't really
 good at it yet.</i>

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.487
<i> Then...</i>

00:17:02.487 --> 00:17:06.759
( audience laughter )

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.328
<i> Somebody had some fun
 with one of our images.</i>

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.062
<i> Optimus Prime came
 and visit us...</i>

00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:12.764
<i> So...</i>

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:14.900
( laughter )
That's fun.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:17.702
<i> We have a laser.</i>

00:17:17.702 --> 00:17:19.537
<i> So great, we have a laser.</i>

00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:21.139
<i>Here's what people think we do.</i>

00:17:21.139 --> 00:17:24.309
( audience laughter )

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:25.410 line:0%
<i> Sort of fun.</i>

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.745 line:0%
<i> Here's what we really do.</i>

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.713 line:0%
<i> So, you have the picture
 on the left, undisturbed soil</i>

00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:30.815 line:0%
<i> picture on the right,
 five laser holes.</i>

00:17:30.815 --> 00:17:32.817 line:0%
<i>I'll show it to you a different
 way, I'll show a video.</i>

00:17:32.817 --> 00:17:36.120
<i> So, here's a video of us
 burning a hole in the ground.</i>

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.757
<i> Pretty exciting, you can
 see sort of the by-products
 coming off.</i>

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:40.125
You can't see the gas.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.327
But what we are actually doing
is we're burning a hole,

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:45.030
looking for the gas so we
can tell what it's made of.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.966
So, the first thing that
happened after we got--
after we landed

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:51.436
<i> we drove to this area on Mars
 that was very interesting.</i>

00:17:51.436 --> 00:17:52.904
<i> Within the first three months</i>

00:17:52.904 --> 00:17:55.340
<i> of being at this location,
 we were able to say,</i>

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.875
<i> one, Gale Crater was wet.</i>

00:17:57.875 --> 00:17:59.844
<i>Number two, it can sustain life.</i>

00:17:59.844 --> 00:18:01.346
Now we can't say that
there was life there

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.548
but we can say that
if there was,

00:18:03.548 --> 00:18:04.816
it would have been
able to be sustained.

00:18:04.816 --> 00:18:06.484
There are all of the
chemical compositions

00:18:06.484 --> 00:18:09.554
that are needed to support life.

00:18:09.554 --> 00:18:12.658
<i> Paying homage to some of
 our great explorers before us,</i>

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:18.830
<i> footprint of Buzz Aldrin and
then Curiosity Rover footprint.</i>

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.031
<i> Our first scoop,</i>

00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:22.434
<i> so we now went down and
we scooped up some of the dirt.</i>

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:25.237
<i> We are going to actually
 take that inside the vehicle.</i>

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.905
<i> Some more of
 these analogues.</i>

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.506
<i> So, looks like riverbeds.</i>

00:18:28.506 --> 00:18:29.907
<i> Picture on the left
 is uncorrected,</i>

00:18:29.907 --> 00:18:31.376
<i> just an image that comes back</i>

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.544
<i> from the surface of Mars,
 looks like a riverbed.</i>

00:18:33.544 --> 00:18:36.314
<i> You can see
 false cover image of Mars</i>

00:18:36.314 --> 00:18:37.482
<i> that's sort of in the middle</i>

00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:39.117
<i> and then an Earth riverbed.</i>

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:41.019
<i> Looks very, very similar.</i>

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.354
<i> Here is the first time
 we are going to sample,</i>

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:43.855
<i> we are going to drill
 into the surface of Mars.</i>

00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:45.957
<i> I can tell you
 this took a long time.</i>

00:18:45.957 --> 00:18:47.359
<i> It took us about four weeks</i>

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:49.494
<i> to actually make this
 one little hole.</i>

00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:51.863
<i> Here's a picture
 of the hole up close.</i>

00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:53.498
<i> The next image is
 after we've taken that</i>

00:18:53.498 --> 00:18:54.832
<i> and we ingest it inside,</i>

00:18:54.832 --> 00:18:57.636
<i> we can actually separate
 different particle size.</i>

00:18:57.636 --> 00:19:00.405
<i> So we can take things that are
 down to the couple microns.</i>

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:01.306
<i> We will sift those out,</i>

00:19:01.606 --> 00:19:03.508
<i> then we can deliver those
 to different instruments.</i>

00:19:03.508 --> 00:19:05.109
<i>Here's a picture of Mount Sharp.</i>

00:19:05.109 --> 00:19:06.678
<i> This is where we wanted to go</i>

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:07.879
<i> It was an early picture.</i>

00:19:07.879 --> 00:19:09.547
<i> There's a rock that's out
 in the distance,</i>

00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:12.984
<i> that rock is 5-point-5
 kilometers away from our Rover</i>

00:19:12.984 --> 00:19:16.054
<i> and it's approximately
 the same size as the Rover.</i>

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:17.222
<i> And we are thinking,
 "Oh, my goodness,</i>

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:19.591
<i> it would so great
 if we can make it there."</i>

00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.193
<i> The other thing that
 you will notice in this image,</i>

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.896
<i> if you are looking
 closely is there's clouds.</i>

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.364
<i> Mars does have clouds
 just like Earth, right.</i>

00:19:26.364 --> 00:19:28.433
<i> So there is moisture
 in the atmosphere.</i>

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:32.136
<i> So, this image shows sort
 of our trajectory to get down</i>

00:19:32.136 --> 00:19:34.038
<i> to the start of the mountain.</i>

00:19:34.038 --> 00:19:37.042
<i> And as we were driving
we were starting to figure out,</i>

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.776
<i> "Oh, my goodness
 there's parts of Mars</i>

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:40.545
<i>that are really, really scary".</i>

00:19:40.545 --> 00:19:42.480
And the reason they are really,
really scary

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.816
is that the rocks
that are on the surface

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:47.752
are different than
we have ever seen

00:19:47.752 --> 00:19:49.121
anywhere else
on the surface of Mars.

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:50.956
As we were driving on Mars
with Spirit and Opportunity,

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:52.323
we'd hit a rock and
we'd break it

00:19:52.323 --> 00:19:55.260
or push it over and
move it out of the way.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.264
In this particular area,
the rocks are like cemented
into the ground.

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:01.066
And then they have this word,
I don't know,

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:03.334
I'm just going to use it,
it's called Ventifacted rocks.

00:20:03.334 --> 00:20:06.205
In other words
the rocks are wind-blown.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.240
So, if you can imagine
you are covered with water

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.109
and as the water recedes, the
wind starts working on the rock

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:14.078
and as it recedes,
it sharpens the rock.

00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:16.047
So the rocks look like teeth.

00:20:16.047 --> 00:20:17.849
Very, very sharp teeth.

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:19.050
And as we are driving over them,

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.552
we are puncturing holes
in the wheels.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:21.653
So, we thought,
"Oh, my goodness,

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:23.955
one, we have to figure
how not to hurt our wheels,

00:20:23.955 --> 00:20:26.091
and number two,
we have to figure out where
to drive around things."

00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:29.627
<i> So, you can see we take
sort of this really crazy path.</i>

00:20:29.627 --> 00:20:31.763
<i> And then we got to the place
 that's at the end of</i>

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.598
<i> this particular image.</i>

00:20:33.598 --> 00:20:35.233
And the scientists had a choice.

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:37.269
We could go right,

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.204
effectively right from
the Rover's perspective

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:40.872
and go through this area,
right here,

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:42.807
which is a choke point.

00:20:42.807 --> 00:20:45.276
There's really no way to get out
if you get in there.

00:20:45.276 --> 00:20:47.112
Or we could go straight,

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:49.213
very, very bad rocks.

00:20:49.213 --> 00:20:52.551
So we chose to go right.
So we go right.

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:53.718
We end up right

00:20:53.718 --> 00:20:55.354
<i> we take some images
 of our wheels.</i>

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.322
We started to see lots of wear

00:20:58.322 --> 00:21:00.692
as we were driving over this
area called the Hummocky Plains.

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:04.830
And the hole that you see is,
eh, sort of benign.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.098
The thing that's actually,
really scary

00:21:07.098 --> 00:21:11.069
is the hole
that's underneath that.

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.104
And the reason it's scary

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.773
as we are driving over the
surface what we are going to do

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.341
is the wheel is taking load,
right, it's moving,

00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:18.910
it's actually getting stressed.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.678
And every time you do that

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:23.215
you are actually having
this crack propagate.

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:24.516
And we were worried,
"Oh, my goodness,

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:25.449
how are the wheels
going to fail?"

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.486
These cracks are going
to propagate across the wheel

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.854
and then part of the wheel
is going to fall off.

00:21:29.854 --> 00:21:31.556
And the part of the wheel
that falls off

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.558
is it going to hit anything
that's bad?

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:35.126
Because there's cables
all around this.

00:21:35.126 --> 00:21:37.061
So, as the wheel falls apart,
is it going to do this.

00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:38.329
So now what we are doing is

00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:42.767
selectively on different
soils we are driving the
Rover backwards.

00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:44.235
So, driving backwards actually

00:21:44.235 --> 00:21:46.737
takes a little bit of the load
off the front wheels...

00:21:46.737 --> 00:21:49.173
about the same
in the middle wheels,

00:21:49.173 --> 00:21:51.843
and then starts to do
the damage to the back wheels.

00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:52.377
But that's okay

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.279
because they are not
damaged at all at this point.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.647
So we are going to start
to try to even out

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:56.448
the wear across the wheels

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.049
so that we get a little bit
of longer driving.

00:21:58.049 --> 00:21:58.983
The other thing we noticed

00:21:58.983 --> 00:22:00.518
and I told you we went
to that choke point

00:22:00.518 --> 00:22:02.654
is that with damaged wheels

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:06.024
we could drive over
sand dunes better.

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:07.826
So,
climbing over nice light stuff

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:09.894
was actually better with
these holes in the wheel.

00:22:09.894 --> 00:22:11.729
<i> So, we turn right
 we get to the sand dune.</i>

00:22:11.729 --> 00:22:12.597
<i> Now we've done some testing,</i>

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:13.898
<i> we know that we could
 drive over it.</i>

00:22:13.898 --> 00:22:17.702
<i> But as all good engineers and
 all good scientists, go,</i>

00:22:17.702 --> 00:22:19.237
<i> "Well, what happens if there's
 really sharp rocks</i>

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:21.572
<i> underneath the dune?"</i>

00:22:21.572 --> 00:22:24.175
So we argue for about two days,

00:22:24.175 --> 00:22:26.344
about driving over this dune
and I'm thinking,

00:22:26.344 --> 00:22:27.913
"Golly, it's only a meter tall,

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.714
only a meter tall,
you know three feet.

00:22:29.714 --> 00:22:32.850
And the Rover's belly
is 75 centimeters,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.186
so three-quarters of a meter.

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:36.721
So, if it was really
just light, fluffy

00:22:36.721 --> 00:22:38.289
you know sand dune
we would get stuck.

00:22:38.289 --> 00:22:40.424
But the reality is that the
rover would sort of
float over it.

00:22:40.424 --> 00:22:42.327
But we were freaked out,
for a little while.

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:44.663
So, we did some testing.
And then we decided to go.

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:46.864
But we didn't decide
to go all at once.

00:22:46.864 --> 00:22:49.300
We put a toe in and
then put another toe in,

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.136
we drove up to the top
and looked over

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.771
and then we drove back.
Then we said, "Okay, go."

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.940
<i> So here's the image
 from the other side.</i>

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.309
<i> Here's the video of us driving
 over that particular obstacle.</i>

00:22:58.309 --> 00:23:01.579
<i> Sort of fun. But it took us
 a while to do that.</i>

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.281
<i> Then we have where we've gone.</i>

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:04.949
<i> So we land at Bradbury,</i>

00:23:04.949 --> 00:23:06.450
<i> we go over to Yellowknife Bay.</i>

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.919 line:0%
<i> And now we are
 at the Pahrump Hills.</i>

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:11.589 line:0%
<i> Now the Pahrump Hills are more
 or less the gateway to
 Mount Sharp.</i>

00:23:11.589 --> 00:23:14.559
<i> Our first drill at
 Pahrump Hills.</i>

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:17.295
<i> Now you can see it really
 sort of looks clayish.</i>

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.831
<i> We do some
 close-up investigation,</i>

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:23.201
<i> we can see these lines,
 looks like secretions.</i>

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:24.502
<i> And hard stuff around it,</i>

00:23:24.502 --> 00:23:25.970
<i> the mineral that we believe
 that's there,</i>

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.105
<i> and we were just doing
 some investigation</i>

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:28.839
<i> right now,
 looks like hematite...</i>

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:30.608
which only forms
in water here on Earth.

00:23:30.608 --> 00:23:31.909
So, it looks like we are
finding another place

00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:35.013
that was really wet
on the surface of Mars.

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.081
<i> And then we can talk
 about what's coming next.</i>

00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:38.716
<i>In 2020, we'll have a new Rover.</i>

00:23:38.716 --> 00:23:39.884
<i>You can see some of the science.</i>

00:23:39.884 --> 00:23:41.686
<i> The science suite
 has been announced.</i>

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:43.355
<i> You can see the
 international collaboration</i>

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.422
<i> that's going to happen.</i>

00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:47.425
<i> Very, very similar vehicle
 to Curiosity in terms of size,</i>

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:48.827
<i> but has a different mission.</i>

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:51.830
<i>And it's mission really is going
to go sample the surface of Mars</i>

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.197
<i> and capture the samples.</i>

00:23:53.197 --> 00:23:55.600
<i> And hopefully return them
 back to Earth.</i>

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.636
So, now as I close

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:59.770
I'm going to show you
some of my favorite images

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:00.538
from the surface.

00:24:00.538 --> 00:24:03.775
<i> This image is from Curiosity.</i>

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.511
<i> And you see that star...</i>

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:09.981
<i> that's out there?
 That's Earth.</i>

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:13.217
<i> And in high-resolution
 you can see the moon.</i>

00:24:13.217 --> 00:24:14.819
And now I'll show
you my favorite video...

00:24:14.819 --> 00:24:16.020
my favorite image.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.389
<i> This is from
 the top of Husband Hill.</i>

00:24:18.389 --> 00:24:21.359
<i> This is one of the last things
 that we got from Spirit.</i>

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:25.362
<i> And if we had been able...
had a little bit better camera,</i>

00:24:25.362 --> 00:24:27.698
<i> we could have seen Earth set.</i>

00:24:27.698 --> 00:24:29.233
<i> And I'll show you this
 as a video.</i>

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:31.769
<i> And this is the
 Sun setting on Mars.</i>

00:24:31.769 --> 00:24:36.040
<i> And, the thing that makes me</i>

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.943
<i> love this image so much is</i>

00:24:38.943 --> 00:24:41.212
<i> literally the fact that...</i>

00:24:41.212 --> 00:24:44.882
some day a human being will
stand on the surface of Mars

00:24:44.882 --> 00:24:48.119
and say,
"I am watching the Earth set

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:50.054
and then I am watching
the Sun set."

00:24:50.054 --> 00:24:52.223
And I can't wait for that day.

00:24:52.223 --> 00:24:54.225
Thank you guys so very much.

00:24:54.225 --> 00:24:56.528
It's been awesome.
( applause )

00:24:56.528 --> 00:25:00.632
