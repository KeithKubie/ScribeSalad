00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How can we model the spreading of a contagious disease?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The straight forward approach may be to model individual persons as either infectious or susceptible

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If one infectious and one susceptible person meet, there is a certain chance

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that the susceptible person becomes infectious too and then the first infectious person

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as well as the newly infected person further spread the disease.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This seems to cry out loud for a spatial model in which

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we take care of the location of these persons that would be complex.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Luckily, there is another way. This is a much simpler way of thinking about such diseases.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The SIR Model. We do not look at the spatial distribution at all.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We simply say that our population is made up of susceptible, infectious, and recovered persons

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and we only look at the total number of these persons.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Susceptible persons can get infected and then become infectious.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The rate of that process is controlled by the number of infectious people.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The more infectious people there are, the larger the probability is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that a susceptible person meets an infectious person.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Hopefully, people are going to recover from the disease,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
so that is the process that takes us from infectious to recovered.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then the standard version of that model, we assume

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that the recovered persons are immune and cannot be infected again.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So they form a third compartment.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is a much simpler way of dealing with our problem.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We forget about the spatial distribution altogether and simply construct a mechanical model if you will

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in which the population consists of three compartments,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
susceptible persons, infectious persons, recovered persons

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
depending on the number of infectious persons, susceptible persons become infected

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and hence infectious and after a while, infectious persons recover and we assume that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
recovered persons are immune against the disease and cannot be infected again.

00:01:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is the SIR Model. Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered.
