- What kind of
world do we live in

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.605
where we can't stage
a fake gay bashing

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.240
without really being gay bashed?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.942
(audience laughs)

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.511
(techno music)

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.726
- Welcome to This is
Not Happening presents

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:27.594
One Crazy Night.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.062
So this is what we do,

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.731 align:start position:0%
our bunch of comedians tell
stories about a similar subject

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.266
so this is just one crazy night.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.401
Please give it up for
my friend and yours

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.002 line:0%
Mr Sean Patton everybody.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.838 line:0%
(audience cheers)

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.415
- There are three things
you need to know about me

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.250
before I commence
telling this story.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.785
It's very simple.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.054
One, I was born and raised
in New Orleans, Louisianna,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.557
two, I'm trained
in stage combat.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.592 align:start size:94% position:6%
My friend Tommy and I,
we're high school friends,

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.361
we're both comedians, as a goof

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.730 align:start size:84% position:16%
we started taking
stage combat classes,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.899
it kept going for a year.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.736 align:start size:97% position:3%
And three, I've only snorted
cocaine once in my life.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.907 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, I've done cocaine
half a dozen times

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.910
but I've only snorted it once.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.312 align:start size:97% position:3%
What I mean by that, is
that I would always go last,

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.514
I would cut the biggest line,

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.083
I'd be the most amped about it,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.951
I'd let all my friends go first

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.453 align:start size:84% position:16%
and as soon as they
were off in the corner

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.922 align:start size:97% position:3%
comparing how the drip felt,
I would just wipe it away

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:33.159 align:start size:97% position:3%
and go "woo yeah" and then
just be high energy all night.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.260
Why didn't I actually do coke?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.361
Because it's fucking cocaine,

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.564
it's bad for you, I was scared.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.132
Do I need to explain anymore?

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.769
Terrified to do it,
didn't want to do it.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.205
So I lied.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
However one year, 2004
on Lundi Gras Day,

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.343 align:start size:81% position:19%
that's the day
before Mardi Gras,

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.579
if you know your
New Orleans shit

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.047
and it's the crazy day.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.483 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's when the fucking crazy
fucking things happen.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:00.753 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's when people do coke
for the first time for real.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.288
That's exactly what happened.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.390
I was with my friend Tommy
and was like fuck it man,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.359
let's do this coke for real

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.827
and it was amazing.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:10.830
Anyway, so we're coked
up, we're both comedians,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.632
we're both trained
in stage combat,

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.968
we're let loose on the
streets of French Quarter

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.203
in New Orleans on
Lundi Gras Day.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.439
Duh, what's gonna happen?

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.342
Fight scenes, you
bet your fat ass.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.614
Non-stop fight scenes
in front of tourists.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
Where you would see
big groups of tourists

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:33.386
looking for tits, chanting
for tits in the wrong places,

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:37.023
we would roll up, we'd
act like a gay couple

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:39.159
that had gotten
into an argument,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.528 align:start size:97% position:3%
that had turn into a spat
that it will become a fight.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:44.564
So we'd walk by like "Why
can't I be on top tonight?"

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.866 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Well because you're hung
like a fucking light switch."

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.768 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Well at least my cum
doesn't taste like blood."

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.637
and then we'd start fighting

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.806
(audience laughs)

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.708
and then we'd go at it.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:01.247
And the weird thing was,
no one ever once threatened

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:05.118 align:start size:94% position:6%
to call the cops, tried
to break us up or stop us,

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.020
they just let it happen.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.054 align:start size:84% position:16%
And it was weird
because the thing is,

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.790
I look now like I did then

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.427
and I think I look now and
then like a cancer victim

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:17.697 align:start size:97% position:3%
that survived cancer by eating
the tumor out of his body.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.599
That's my description of myself.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.569
Tommy is sculpted out of marble,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.704 align:start size:97% position:3%
he's got an eight-pack,
he's a gorgeous human being,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.072
he is now, he was then.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.208
So I would always win the fight

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.543 align:start size:81% position:19%
'cause it just
didn't look right.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.845 align:start size:88% position:13%
And at one point I
remember we're fighting

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.348
and there's just
this old black dude

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.651 align:start size:97% position:3%
just chilling, just watching
us, smoking a cigarette

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.087 align:start size:84% position:16%
and who knows if it
was a menthol, I don't
wanna stereotype,

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.856
it could've been, you know,
I don't wanna be that guy

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:48.127
who just assumes he's
puffing on a Newport,

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
could've been a
clove for all I know.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.633 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now he's just standing
there puffing away,

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.335
then Tommy tries to
get his attention

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.036 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he goes, and Tommy
is a great actor,

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:58.304
he was in character.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:02.308
He's like "Help, help
my lover's hitting me."

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.744
and this old black dude with
all his old black man wisdom

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.981
just goes, "Well hit him back
you're both boys ain't ya?"

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.817
(audience laughs)

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.855
So we decided after
a while that maybe

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:18.124 align:start size:97% position:3%
we were just too predictable,
we decide to change,

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.127
to flip the script,
to change it up.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:24.964 align:start size:88% position:13%
He started, Tommy, he
played a gay prostitute.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.067
So he was just standing
on random corners going,

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:32.171
"I'm selling dick by the
inch, dick by the inch".

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:37.110
Which doesn't really make sense
but made me laugh real hard.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.344
It's like so what
if they wondered,

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.247
how much by the inch and
what if they only want

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:44.651
half your dick, can
they get half, half?

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
Cause what are they
gonna do with only half?

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.854
Wait a second it's
not like a Kielbasa,

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:51.190
you're not slicing
off dick by the inch.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:55.261
He would do that and I
would play a gay basher.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:56.829
So I would roll up
on him outta nowhere

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.432
and be like "you fucking
queer," through a punch

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.900 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we had the move
all worked out.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.503
He would catch, barrel
roll me, roundhouse kick,

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.271
upper cut, I'd be out cold.

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:06.673
It was beautiful.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
We nailed this time
and time again.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.843
There was this one
point, this old woman

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:14.480
just out of nowhere was
like "He deserved that,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.915
"he deserved it."

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.819
'cause I'm a good actor.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.554
Tom is a better actor though

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:22.989
'cause after every
time he beat my ass

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.091
he would celebrate,
people would walk up

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.993
and high-five him and shit

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.662 align:start size:84% position:16%
and be like "Dicks two
for one by the inch

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.732 align:start size:84% position:16%
"for the next hour"
which makes less sense

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.133
than just selling
dick by the inch.

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.035
"Dicks two for one by the inch"

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:36.969
what does that even mean?

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.271
I don't care' it's hilarious!

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:41.307
(audience laughs)

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.509
At one point we knew the fight,

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.580 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm laying there unconscious,
he's celebrating,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.616
a few people come by and
high-give and at one point

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.853 align:start size:94% position:6%
just out of nowhere, this
dude rolls up on him,

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.321
eating a lucky dog,
which if you've never

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:58.224 align:start position:0%
been to New Orleans a lucky
dog, it's just a giant hot dog.

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:00.593
Someone chuckled like they
know what a lucky dog is.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:01.961
Oh it's bad.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:04.731
It's like 14in of hot dog.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.799
I don't know why
they call it lucky

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:08.267
unless you're the kind
of person who's like

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:12.438 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Oh, I get to shit 15
times tomorrow, lucky me!"

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:14.173
"Nom nom nom nom nom"

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:19.011
But this dude just rolls up on
Tommy who's like celebrating,

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.481 align:start size:88% position:13%
he's like "Dick is three
for one by the inch"

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.316 align:start size:94% position:6%
and keeps getting funnier
the more he offers

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.784
although it makes less sense.

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:27.587 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Nom nom nom nom nom nom"
and this guy walks up

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.922 align:start size:88% position:13%
nibbling on his lucky
dog, he's like "Hey dude

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:32.658
"you really gay,
you really gay?"

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.128
First of all I thought
that was a funny thing

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
of him to ask that
question while nibbling

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.666 align:start size:84% position:16%
on a giant phallic
shaped thing in a bun.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.201
"Really gay?"

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.103
And I'm watching this a
few feet away pretending

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:48.908 align:start size:94% position:6%
to be unconscious thinking
"Oh damn, a real john."

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.245
(audience laughs)

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.413
"We are good!"

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:58.851 align:start position:0%
But then Tommy still in
character doesn't break a frame

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.288
and he goes "Yes I am
Mr Man, gay as shit,

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:05.958
"dick is free for you."

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:10.096 align:start size:97% position:3%
Then this man, this stranger,
drops that lucky dog,

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:14.267
rears back and punches
Tommy in the chest hard,

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:19.205 align:start size:84% position:16%
no stage combat,
now just straight up
(makes hitting sound),

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:23.342
punches him fucking
hard and I see that

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:27.246
and think "Oh no,
a real gay basher!"

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.215
(audience laughs)

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:33.619
"We were too good, noooooo!!!"

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.321
So I jump up, I get between 'em.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:38.024 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm like "Hey, hey dude,
back off, seriously back off,

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:39.992
it's fine" and this dude goes,

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:44.697
"What, man fuck that, he
was about to rape you!"

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.365
Is that what was
about to happen?

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.936
(audience laughs)

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.071
He was 20ft away dancing.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.107
(audience laughs)

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:57.710
What do you think rape is sir?

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.514
You think it's just someone
dancing 20ft away from you?

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.683
But then I realize this guys
is a bigot, like all bigots,

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.485
he thinks incorrectly.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.620
So I was just like "Dude,
it's fine, get the fuck out

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.056
of here man, he's not
gay, he's my friend"

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:13.392
but Tommy, as I said a great
actor doesn't break character

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:16.329 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he's still in character
and now he's angry

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:20.500
and just goes "Fuck this,
yes I am, I'm gay as shit,

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.537 align:start size:88% position:13%
"bring it motherfucker,
bring it!"

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:29.175
What happens next was, that
gay basher throws one punch,

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:32.211
it hits be directly in the jaw.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.280
Now if you've never been hit
directly in your jaw before,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.017 align:start size:84% position:16%
what happens is
your legs disappear,

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.852
they disappear,

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.854
they turn into a magical cloud,

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:44.123
that you float to
the ground happily,

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:47.793
bye (makes cartoon sounds).

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:57.236
And I say this only
once in my life,

00:08:57.236 --> 00:09:00.406
I'm glad I was on
cocaine, I'm glad,

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:03.209
because I didn't
get knocked out.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.078
I fell but I stayed conscious
and I credit that entirely

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:08.814
with the blow in my system.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.984 align:start position:0%
And I'm glad I stayed conscious
'cause what I saw next

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:12.985
was amazing.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.488
What I saw next was
my friend Tommy,

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:17.723
who I had known most of my life,

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:21.794
who I knew was trained in
stage combat just like I,

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:25.531
I saw him square up on
this dude Wolverine style

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.934
(audience laughs)

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.870 align:start size:97% position:3%
take a punch to the face
and go "That's all I needed"

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.440
and then fuck this guy
up bad, destroy him,

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.577
(applause)

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.812
like destroyed him.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.450
Like and I mean, yeah,
trained in stage combat

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.153
didn't matter, turns out he
was a natural at real combat.

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.788
It was amazing.

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:51.157 align:start size:88% position:13%
There was like Jason
Bourned elbows and shit,

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:54.961
he landed a jump knee,
he landed a jump knee.

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.563 align:start size:94% position:6%
When have you seen anyone
just (grunting sound)

00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:00.499
land a jump knee
in the dudes chin.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.102 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like it was so badass
that when Tommy

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:06.339
was finally done with this
dude we had to skedaddle

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.674
'cause now we were the bad guys.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:12.244
We'd gone to far, so we got
up, got the fuck outta there,

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:15.915
went to a bar, had an
emergency medical beer

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.685 align:start position:0%
and we're just kinda like
walking around talking about it,

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.220
I'm like yapping my ass off.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.888
Like I can't believe that
happened that was amazing,

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:25.625 align:start position:0%
Tommy has been quiet for
sometime like a few minutes now,

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.561 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he finally just goes
look, "You understand though,

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.764
"that that was real, that
was real" and I was like

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:35.034
"Yeah, I know it was
real, it hurt, ow"

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.670
then he goes, he gets
real serious, he's like

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.240
"No no, umm, (sigh),

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.977
I'm the gay thing,
I'm gay, I'm gay.

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:49.148
"I've tried to come
out to you for years,

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.884
"I said it then figuring
fuck it, kill two birds

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.053
"with one stone, I'm gay."

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:58.691
(audience laughs)

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.662
So you think about
this for a second,

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:06.198
not only am I the only person
who's straight that I ever met

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:07.900
who's been gay bashed

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.869
(audience laughs)

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.238
but that is how my friend Tommy

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.240
got to come out to me,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.175 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is the most
badass way to come out

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:18.277
of the closet possible.

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:20.846
Just announce, "Yes I
am, I'm gay as shit,

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:24.083 align:start position:0%
"bring it motherfucker" and
then immediately thrash a bigot

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.919
like right out of
the gates you know.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.387
(applause)

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:31.924
Can't top it, can't top it!

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:33.192
Thank you very much.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:36.028
(audience cheers)

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.298
- Hey everybody, I
just took a break

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.833
from flying through
space to tell you

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:44.370
to click like over there so
that we get more YouTube hits

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.405 align:start size:97% position:3%

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:49.275
when the story comes out,
you'll get that as well.

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:51.744
Oh, there goes a
celestial planet.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:52.578
Hi planet.
