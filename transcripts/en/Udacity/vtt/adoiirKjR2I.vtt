00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.390
So today, we've been talking about learning by correcting mistakes.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.840
We started off by revisiting explanation based learning and

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.230
incremental concept learning, in those lessons we were dealing with a small

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.400
number of examples coming in one by one. We dealt with the same thing here, but

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.450
here we had the additional feedback about whether or not our initial conclusion

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.230
was right or wrong. We then talk about isolating mistakes. This was similar to

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.580
our problem diagnosis. Given a mistake how do we narrow down our reasoning to

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.380
find where that mistake occurred. Then we talked about explain the mistake.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.200
This is key both to building human like agents and to enabling the agent to

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.810
correct its mistake. Only by explaining the mistake can the agent correct it

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.220
efficiently. And after those phases correction becomes a much more

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.370
straightforward task. Next time we'll talk about meta-reasoning in more detail.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.270
For example here we've discussed mistakes in knowledge but what about mistakes

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.620
in reasoning? What about mistakes in architecture? What about gaps instead of

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.650
mistakes where we don't know something instead of knowing something incorrectly?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.840
We'll talk about all that next time.
