00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:08.060
We want to figure out the limit
as x approaches 1 of the

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.570
expression x over x minus
1 minus 1 over the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.930
natural log of x.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.900
So let's just see what
happens when we just

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.230
try to plug in the 1.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.630
What happens if we evaluate
this expression at 1?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.050
Well then, we're going to get
a one here, over 1 minus 1.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.040
So we're going to get something
like a 1 over a 0, minus 1

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520
over, and what's the
natural log of 1?

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.250
e to the what power
is equal to one?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.140
Well, anything to the zeroth
power is equal to 1, so e to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.420
the zeroth power is going to
be equal to 1, so the natural

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.350
log of 1 is going to be 0.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.820
So we get the strange,
undefined 1 over

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.300
0 minus 1 over 0.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.370
It's this bizarre-looking
undefined form.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.820
But it's not the indeterminate
type of form that we looked

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.880
for in l'Hopital's rule.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.625
We're not getting a 0 over
a 0, we're not getting an

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:03.750
infinity over an infinity.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.640
So you might just say, hey,
OK, this is a non-l'Hopital's

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.150
rule problem.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.910
We're going to have to figure
out this limit some other way.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.210
And I would say, well
don't give up just yet!

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.880
Maybe we can manipulate this
algebraically somehow so that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.380
it will give us the l'Hopital
indeterminate form, and then

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.040
we can just apply the rule.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.790
And to do that, let's just
see, what happens if we

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.470
add these two expressions?

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.865
So if we add them, so this
expression, if we add it, it

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:32.160
will be, well, the common
denominator is going to be x

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.850
minus 1 times the
natural log of x.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.740
I just multiplied
the denominators.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.420
And then the numerator is going
to be, well, if I multiply

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.436
essentially this whole term by
natural log of x, so it's going

00:01:46.436 --> 00:01:51.317
to be x natural log of x, and
then this whole term I'm going

00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:52.930
to multiply by x minus one.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.955
So minus x minus 1.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.540
And you could break it apart
and see that this expression

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.870
and this expression
are the same thing.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.000
This right here, that right
there, is the same thing as x

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.310
over x minus 1, because the
natural log of x's cancel out.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.220
Let me get rid of that.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.430
And then this right here is the
same thing as 1 over natural

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.510
log of x, because the x
minus 1's cancel out.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.630
So hopefully you realize,
all I did is I added

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.120
these two expressions.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.110
So given that, let's see what
happens if I take the limit as

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.600
x approaches 1 of this thing.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.010
Because these are
the same thing.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.320
Do we get anything
more interesting?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.360
So what do we have here?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.810
We have one times the
natural log of 1.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.650
The natural log of 1 is 0, so
we have 0 here, so that is a 0.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.200
Minus 1 minus 0, so that's
going to be another 0, minus 0.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.000
So we get a 0 in the numerator.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.570
And in the denominator we get a
1 minus 1, which is 0, times

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.100
the natural log of 1, which is
0, so 0 times 0, that is 0.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.960
And there you have it.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.940
We have indeterminate form that
we need for l'Hopital's rule,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.110
assuming that if we take the
derivative of that, and put it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.360
over the derivative of that,
that that limit exists.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.130
So let's try to do it.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.340
So this is going to be equal
to, if the limit exists, this

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.200
is going to be equal to the
limit as x approaches 1.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.490
And let's take the derivative
in magenta, I'll take

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.190
the derivative of this
numerator right over here.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.590
And for this first term,
just do the product rule.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.970
Derivative of x is one, and
then so 1 times the natural log

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.920
of x, the derivative of the
first term times

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.930
the second term.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.570
And then we're going to have
plus the derivative of the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.820
second term plus 1 over
x times the first term.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.430
It's just the product rule.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.920
So 1 over x times x, we're
going to see, that's just 1,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.390
and then we have minus the
derivative of x minus 1.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.450
Well, the derivative of x minus
1 is just 1, so it's just

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.090
going to be minus 1.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.710
And then, all of that is over
the derivative of this thing.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.340
So let's take the derivative
of that, over here.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.600
So the derivative of the first
term, of x minus 1, is just 1.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.330
Multiply that times the second
term, you get natural log of x.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.520
And then plus the derivative of
the second term, derivative

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.350
of natural log of x is one
over x, times x minus 1.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.240
I think we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.270
This 1 over x times
x, that's a 1.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.580
We're going to
subtract one from it.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.910
So these cancel
out, right there.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.710
And so this whole expression
can be rewritten as the limit

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.260
as approaches 1, the numerator
is just natural log of x, do

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.160
that in magenta, and the
denominator is the natural log

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.600
of x plus x minus 1 over x

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.250
So let's try to evaluate
this limit here.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.060
So if we take x approaches one
of natural log of x, that

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.640
will give us a, well,
natural log of 1 is 0.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.720
And over here, we get natural
log of 1, which is 0.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.920
And then plus 1 minus 1 over
plus 1 minus 1 over 1, well,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.900
that's just going
to be another 0.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.810
1 minus 1 is zero.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.680
So you're going to
have 0 plus 0.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.140
So you're going to get
a 0 over 0 again.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.740
0 over 0.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.230
So once again, let's apply
l'Hopital's rule again.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.890
Let's take the derivative
of that, put it over

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.240
the derivative of that.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.210
So this, if we're ever going to
get to a limit, is going to be

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.950
equal to the limit as x
approaches 1 of the derivative

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.320
of the numerator, 1 over x,
right, the derivative of ln of

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.340
x is 1/x, over the derivative
of the denominator.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.160
And what's that?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.950
Well, derivative of natural
log of x is 1 over x plus

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.590
derivative of x minus 1 over x.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.120
You could view it this way,
as 1 over x times x minus 1.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.730
Well, derivative of x to the
negative 1, we'll take the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.280
derivative of the first one
times the second thing, and

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.670
then the derivative of the
second thing times

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.610
the first thing.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.980
So the derivative of the first
term, x to the negative 1, is

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.030
negative x to the negative 2
times the second term, times x

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.830
minus 1, plus the derivative of
the second term, which is

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.780
just 1 times the first
term, plus 1 over x.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.060
So this is going to be equal
to, I just had a random thing

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.860
pop up on my computer.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.730
Sorry for that little
sound, if you heard it.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.780
But where was I?

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.710
Oh, let's just simplify
this over here.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.210
We were doing our
l'Hopital's rule.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.010
So this is going to be equal
to, let me, this is going to be

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.870
equal to, if we evaluate x as
equal to 1, the numerator is

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.610
just 1/1, which is just 1.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.406
So we're definitely not going
to have an indeterminate or

00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:09.480
at least a 0/0 form anymore.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.080
And the denominator is going to
be, if you evaluate it at 1,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.180
this is 1/1, which is 1, plus
negative 1 to the negative 2.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.490
So, or you say, 1 to the
negative 2 is just 1, it's

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.445
just a negative one.

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:24.820
But then you multiply that
times 1 minus 1, which is

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.100
0, so this whole term's
going to cancel out.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.890
And you have a plus
another 1 over 1.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.090
So plus 1 And so this is
going to be equal to 1/2.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.990
And there you have it.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.620
Using L'Hopital's rule and a
couple of steps, we solved

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.050
something that at least
initially didn't look

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.260
like it was 0/0.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.110
We just added the 2 terms, got
0/0, took derivatives of the

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.460
numerators and the denominators
2 times in a row to

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.180
eventually get our limit.
