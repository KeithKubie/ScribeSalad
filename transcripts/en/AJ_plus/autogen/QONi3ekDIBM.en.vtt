00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.872
By now, you probably know that the NSA can track your every move online.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:09.309
If you care about your privacy, and want to know what data the NSA has collected from you,

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.879
then you should know what a FOIA request is.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:17.851
The Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, gives you the right to request access to federal agency records,

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.187
and the right to get those records.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.425
But only if the records don't fall under one of the nine exemptions that keep them out of the public eye.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:28.262
So you can actually FOIA your own data.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:32.666
That is, you can make a request to see which of your own data the NSA has collected.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.670
So far, everyone who has attempted a FOIA request for this has been denied.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.741
But do you think you have a right to know what data the NSA has collected from you?
