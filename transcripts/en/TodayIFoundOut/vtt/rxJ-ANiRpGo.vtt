00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:13.820
The two distinct spellings for what today
is essentially the same condiment are simply

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.930
the reflection of the evolution of nearly
everyone’s favorite French fry topper.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.930
(Well, in certain regions of the world.)

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.950
Today often disdained as low-brow, when it
was first conceived, ketchup was revered for

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.630
the flavor it added to foods.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.430
Initially a paste made from fermented fish
guts, it was first recorded in 544 BC in Important

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.800
Arts for the People’s Welfare; according
to the legend, while in the course of pursuing

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.820
his enemies, emperor Wu-ti came across a pit
filled with fish entrails and covered with

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.680
dirt from which “a potent, delicious aroma,”
could not help but emanate.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.480
For some reason, they actually ate it, learned
to love it and at first named it Chu I. (Worcestershire

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.890
Sauce also has a similar slightly stomach
turning origin, only in this case is still

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.760
made pretty much the same way it was in the
beginning.)

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.940
Eventually, Chu I evolved to kôe-chiap or
kê-chiap.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.579
Over time kôechiap migrated and made its
way to Indonesia where it became known as

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.579
kecap.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.920
British sailors were trading there by the
1690s, and it is believed they developed a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.810
taste for, and began exporting, kecap from
the East Indies during this time.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.459
Also in the 1690s, Brits began tinkering with
the sauce’s name, and catchup, which, according

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:21.880
to the OED, was a “high East-India Sauce”
first appeared, while by 1711 others were

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.490
using the spelling, ketchup.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.659
Nonetheless, it appears that both words were
still describing a type of fish sauce . . . although

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.649
by this time, rather than fish entrails, salted
anchovies were fermented.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.880
Anchovy ketchup quickly became popular in
the West, and recipes for it can be found

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.049
as early as 1732; by 1742, some recipes had
even begun to put a definite British twist

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.859
on the sauce by adding to the anchovies, “strong
stale beer,” mace, cloves, pepper, ginger,

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:48.960
and shallots.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.509
Nonetheless, as anchovies were not always
at hand, and necessity being the mother of

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.600
invention, cooks in the west began experimenting
with different ingredients to form the base

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600
of their ketchups.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.359
Two that quickly became popular were mushrooms
and walnuts.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.000
In 1747, Hannah Glasse included a mushroom
ketchup recipe in The Art of Cookery, Made

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.570
Plain and Easy, and it involved several steps
including salting the mushrooms, then boiling,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.130
straining, skimming, straining (again), boiling
with ginger and pepper, straining (again)

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.470
and then bottling the mixture with mace and
cloves.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.910
Another 18th century variant, a family recipe
from that of noted novelist Jane Austen, began

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.040
with a paste of green walnuts which were then
liberally salted and soaked in vinegar, strained,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.300
boiled, skimmed, boiled (again) with cloves,
mace, ginger, nutmeg, pepper, horseradish

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.010
and shallots, and then bottled.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.550
Vinegar, itself a preservative, eliminated
the need for fermentation.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.911
By the early 1800s, tomatoes had been established
in English cuisine, and so, naturally, they

00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:46.750
were being used as a base for ketchup as well.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.780
In 1810, Alexander Hunter (a physician) in
Receipts in modern cookery provided a recipe

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.810
for a Tomata Sauce that called for first baking
the tomatoes, removing the peel and seeds,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.580
adding chili vinegar, salt, garlic and shallot.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.220
Then it was boiled, skimmed, strained and
bottled.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.610
Catsup had arrived in the United States in
the early 1800s as well.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.030
In his Cook’s Oracle (1830), William Kitchiner
(also a physician) included several recipes

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.150
for catsup that used alternately, walnuts,
cockles, oysters and mushrooms as their bases.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.110
Interestingly, Kitchiner also used the word
catchup throughout the book, but seemingly

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.680
exclusively as a term for a mushroom-based
sauce.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.750
Kitchener also had a couple of recipes for
sauces that could have been (but weren’t)

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.130
called catsups: Love-apple Sauce and Mock
Tomata Sauce.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.880
Both of these were highly spiced with shallot,
clove, thyme, bay leaf, mace, salt and pepper,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.380
and the latter, which apparently used apple,
also incorporated turmeric and vinegar.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.790
It appears that catsup was the predominant
term in the United States through the about

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.480
the 1870s when ketchup began to appear.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.720
Some authorities claim that the distinction
between the two marked the differences in

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.720
quality, as ketchup, the term used in Britain,
was usually seen on expensive, imported sauces;

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.410
this claim is supported by the fact that Heinz
sold two types of these condiments in the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.420
1880s, a cheaper, Duquesne Catsup, and a more
expensive, Keystone Ketchup.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.370
If you hold a traditional Heinz bottle at
about a 30 degree angle and patiently tap

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.130
the 57 stamped on the neck, eventually the
ketchup will flow beautifully.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.120
Physicists have another method, although it
requires an explanation (of course).

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.940
Because of its composition of tomato, vinegar,
water, syrup and spices, ketchup is a “Non-Newtonian”

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.509
fluid whose thickness and stickiness can be
changed with force.

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.360
Therefore, essentially all you have to do
is “shake the bottle beyond its breaking

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:45.770
point, and ketchup becomes 1,000 times thinner,”
and, therefore, easier to pour.
