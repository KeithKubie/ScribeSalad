00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.700
Some films tell intricate stories filled with
twists — like the search for truth in

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.820
All the President’s Men
the dark tangents of Mulholland Drive,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.410
, or the trippy lunacy of Being John Malkovich.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.820
Other times, the story is very simple, while
the telling is remarkably complex.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.720
Steven Soderbergh’s 1999 film The Limey
is one of those movies.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.980
By using unusual or even experimental techniques,
filmmakers can draw out the themes of a film

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.620
and challenge viewers to look at cinema in
a whole new way.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.620
From its scrambled timeline to its occasionally
avant garde editing style, The Limey takes

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.150
a familiar plot and layers it with deeper
meaning.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.180
This film shows how movies, more than any
other medium, can mirror the ways our minds

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.780
work and how memories unfold.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.600
I'm Michael Aranda, this is Crash Course Film Criticism, and I have a cold.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:03.480
[intro music plays]

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.560
In 1998, Steven Soderbergh had just finished

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.670
directing Out of Sight, the sexy crime thriller
starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.229
And he was gearing up to make Erin Brockovich
and win a Best Director Oscar for Traffic.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.049
But before scaling the heights of mainstream
Hollywood, he turned his attention to a little

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.440
revenge thriller written by Lem Dobbs, best
known for writing the sci-fi noir cult hit, Dark City.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.460
The Limey follows a British thief named Wilson,
played with steely conviction by Terence Stamp.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.240
He travels to Los Angeles fresh from prison
to investigate the death of his daughter Jenny.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.590
The thing is, Wilson’s been incarcerated
for most of Jenny’s life.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.729
He barely knows her.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.920
So he starts filling in the gaps.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.100
He gets help from Eduardo, a fellow ex-con
played by Luis Guzman.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.760
Eduardo knew Jenny and becomes Wilson’s
reluctant sidekick.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.570
Wilson also connects with Elaine, a former
actress and mentor of Jenny’s, played with

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.259
tragic grace by Leslie Ann Warren.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.009
The trail ultimately points to Terry Valentine,
a former music producer who was dating Jenny

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.090
at the time of her death.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.299
Played by Peter Fonda, Valentine is a vapid,
charming sleaze-ball.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.039
He’s recently started laundering money for
a drug cartel to make ends meet.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.979
Wilson spends the movie circling his target,
investigating Jenny’s death, and avoiding

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.799
a pair of hitmen hired to take him out.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.010
There are flashes of violence, moments of
deadpan humor, and a galvanizing 1960s soundtrack.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.150
The final gun battle at Valentine’s beach
house in Big Sur, California leaves most of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
Valentine’s crew dead or dying.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.260
Eventually, Wilson chases a wounded Valentine
to a rocky beach, and he gets the whole story.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.629
Jenny had discovered Valentine’s illegal
activities and threatened to turn him in.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.599
Valentine panicked and tried to stop her,
and in their struggle, she struck her head

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.599
and died.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.730
Wilson remembers Jenny threatening to call
the cops on him when she was a young girl

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.170
— without ever following through on her
threats.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.680
And, in that moment, he recognizes that he
played a part in her death.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.200
He leaves Valentine bleeding on the beach
as the tide comes rolling in.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200
And that’s it.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.540
It’s a pretty familiar plot, but Soderbergh
saw something else buried inside the tropes.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.340
For him, The Limey was a deep, introspective
story about memory, regret, and forgiveness.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.530
And Soderbergh thought that he knew how to
shoot and edit the film in ways that would

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.549
make these themes central to the experience
of watching it.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.890
Basically, he thought he could cut the movie
so that it felt like a memory.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.439
And when you’re critiquing a film, it can
be helpful to take a magnifying glass to the

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.940
filmmakers’ choices and techniques.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.560
By doing that with The Limey, we can figure
out how Soderbergh adds layers of complexity

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.780
to the characters and plot of a classic revenge
story, and the ways he carefully controls

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.030
how the audience experiences it all.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.409
Now, as we talked about in Crash Course Film
History, most films are edited using an strategy

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.060
called
continuity editing.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.280
That means that most of the cuts are seamless,
or even invisible.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.620
The edits are designed to make the film’s
time and space clear.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.890
They don’t interrupt the action, and time
generally moves forward.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.750
The Limey takes another approach.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.200
From the first few shots, Soderbergh and editor
Sarah Flack opt for a strategy called

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.659
discontinuity editing.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.750
Here, the edits deliberately draw attention.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.189
The filmmakers cut back and forth within or
between scenes, without actually telling us

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.970
how they fit into the film’s timeline or
geography.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.160
This fragments the narrative and forces the
audience into a more active role.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.159
We have to really watch the movie and piece
it together.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.209
It’s like solving a puzzle, which is exactly
what Wilson’s up to!

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.780
As the film progresses, we get shots of Wilson
sitting and thinking – in an airplane, unpacking

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.689
in his hotel room, turning on the shower,
then back to him on the plane, staring out

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.689
the window.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:15.689
Did he get back on the plane?

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.689
Did he ever leave?

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.689
Is this a memory?

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:18.689
A fantasy?

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:19.689
A flash-forward?

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.829
The movie sets up a kind of dissonance between
sound, image, and time.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.210
The filmmakers scramble these elements to
get at something deeper in their story.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.740
All these cross-cut shots of Wilson give the
film a much more contemplative tone than your

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.250
average revenge thriller.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.900
And as soon as we’re used to those, the
film deploys even more sophisticated discontinuity

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.080
editing techniques.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.639
Soderbergh and Flack start cutting to heavily
stylized shots of a young girl on a beach.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.590
She looks right at the camera, a circle of
reflected light flashing over her face.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.380
This is Jenny, refracted through Wilson’s
memory.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.960
It’s an almost ghostly image — imperfect,
sad, yet beautiful.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.229
And these memory shots lead to other flashbacks,
often without dialogue.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.430
They’re of a convict that looks remarkably
like a young Terence Stamp trying to maintain

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.639
a relationship with a woman and their daughter.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.419
Turns out, it is a much younger Terence
Stamp!

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.550
Soderbergh had the idea to use a 1967 film
by Ken Loach called Poor Cow to show Wilson’s

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.550
backstory.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.370
That film follows a single mother played by
Carol White as she struggles to make a life

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.150
for herself while dealing with a troubled
young thief played by Stamp.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.419
Soderbergh not only uses these shots to fill
in the gaps of Wilson’s backstory, but also

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.250
to highlight The Limey’s connections to
bold British cinema of the 1960s.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.270
In 1967, director John Boorman made Point
Blank, an aggressively non-linear revenge

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.949
thriller about a double-crossed criminal left
for dead.

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.860
Richard Lester’s Petulia from 1968 uses
discontinuity editing to reflect the scrambled,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.979
quirky nature of the characters’ experiences.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.410
Inspired by these and other films, Soderbergh
has played with non-linear storytelling in

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.360
everything from his debut film, sex, lies,
and videotape, to Out of Sight.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.720
But nothing comes close to the fractured quality
of The Limey.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.460
Two sequences especially illustrate how far
Soderbergh and Flack are willing to push the envelope.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.380
Early in the film, Wilson visits Elaine and
takes her out to dinner.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.849
She tells him about Jenny, painting a picture
of his daughter’s life in LA.

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.960
And he shares a heartrending story about how
he knew she’d died, before he’d been told.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.420
It’s a straightforward conversation that
deepens our understanding of Jenny, her difficult

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.819
relationship with Wilson, and Wilson’s growing
intimacy with Elaine.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.020
But instead of shooting the conversation in
a conventional, linear way, Soderbergh decided

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.000
to film it in three different locations: Elaine’s
apartment, the restaurant, and along a moonlit pier.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.220
Then, when he and his editor cut the sequence
together, they kept the dialogue linear.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.949
But visually, the film cuts between the three
locations on almost every line, scrambling

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:35.860
our sense of time and space.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.080
Elaine: That's where Eddie wrote you? In prison?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.600
Wilson: Oh no. No, no, I knew.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.340
Wilson: I knew before hand. Uhhhh...

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.560
Wilson: What time was it supposed to have happened?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.140
Wilson: Eddie said... two in the morning.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.820
Wilson: Well, that's like 8 hours difference between here and London.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.680
Wilson: That would have made it like about ten o'clock my time.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.540
Wilson: I was just going out in the yard.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.020
The effect is disorienting, and visually confusing.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.069
But the emotions – the yearning, pain, and
regret – are the connective tissue throughout

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.430
the sequence and play very clearly.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.580
To make the scene even more complex, it’s
here that Soderbergh cuts in most of the Poor

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.069
Cow footage, as Wilson thinks back to his
early days with Jenny’s mom.

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:23.330
It’s a risky technique, one that threatens
to confuse the audience.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.490
But used in such an intentional way, it’s
tremendously effective.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.349
An equally creative and effective sequence
plays out at Valentine’s house, high in

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:32.460
the Hollywood Hills.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.990
Wilson and Eduardo crash a cocktail party,
because Wilson wants to see Valentine in the

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.990
flesh.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.440
After skulking around the house and stealing
a photograph of Jenny, Wilson finds himself

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.970
out on the deck, staring back inside at an
oblivious Valentine.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.360
Wilson’s staring is intercut with stylized,
slow motion shots of him walking in the house,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.350
pulling his pistol, and shooting Valentine
in the chest.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:58.669
Over these shots we just hear the sound
of crashing waves, a motif that recurs throughout

00:07:58.669 --> 00:07:59.800
the film.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.360
These choices make it clear that this is Wilson’s
fantasy, rather than something that’s

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:15.379
actually happening.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:18.919
The film then cuts back to Wilson on the deck,
and he starts walking into the house.

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:22.440
And again, we cut to shots of Wilson pulling
his pistol, aiming, and firing.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.009
This time, we hear more party noise and the
shots play at regular speed.

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:29.340
It feels like we’re getting closer to reality
— but not quite.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.950
And then we cut back to Wilson entering
the house a third time.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.789
This time, Soderbergh doesn’t stylize the
shots, and the sounds of the party play at

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.789
full volume.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.599
So this feels very real.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:44.159
Wilson pulls his gun, Valentine sees him and
freezes, and Wilson shoots Valentine in the

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.159
head.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.790
A woman screams and we cut to…

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.260
Valentine, unhurt, as Eduardo stops Wilson
from drawing his pistol.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.000
By gradually stripping away the slow motion
and subjective sound design, Soderbergh fools

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.170
us into believing that the third time we were
actually seeing Wilson’s revenge.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.430
But it was really another example of how filmmaking
techniques put us in Wilson’s head, giving

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.970
us access to his imagined experience.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.220
So how does this all work?

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.060
What makes the movie hold together, instead
of fracturing into a confusing mess?

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.080
One idea holds that our minds work by moving
back and forth in time, and in and out of fantasy.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.620
You hear a song on the radio, which reminds
you of a high school dance, which makes you

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.600
think of that outfit you thought was so cool,
which reminds you that you need to go shopping

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.100
this weekend for a new coat, which makes you
imagine that you might bump into a local celebrity…

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.100
and so on.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.240
Most films iron out these chains of association,
creating clear and linear stories.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.320
Not The Limey.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.390
Here Soderbergh uses the cinematography, editing,
and sound design to immerse us in a character’s

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.390
mind.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.209
His goal is subjectivity, not objectivity.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.149
And it comes full circle in the last scene.

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:49.920
We see Wilson back on the airplane, in the
same shots that opened the movie.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.230
But this time we learn that he’s on his
flight back to the UK.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.529
Suddenly, all the shots of Wilson on that
plane scattered throughout the movie take

00:09:57.529 --> 00:09:58.790
on a new meaning.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.420
They frame the whole film as a string of memories.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.899
He’s sitting on the plane, thinking back
over the people he’s met and the things

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:05.899
he’s done.

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:09.720
His memory is naturally jumping back and forth,
mixing events, capturing fleeting moments,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.510
and not always making narrative sense.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.389
And the intended meaning of the film becomes
clear:

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:18.940
it’s a story about Wilson’s meditation
on regret, redemption, and the inability to

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.160
escape the past.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.209
With The Limey, Soderbergh has taken a conventional
revenge plot and used the tools of cinema

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:27.870
to elevate it to something richer and more
profound.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.670
It’s a unique puzzle of a film that gets
its power less from the story itself, and

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.040
more because of how that story is told.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.640
Next time, we’ll find new ways to get at
a character’s subjective experience as we

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.660
look at Juliette Binoche’s performance in
Kieślowski's classic film Blue.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.960
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.120

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.180
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.199
