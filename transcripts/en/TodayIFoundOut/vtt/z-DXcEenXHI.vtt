00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.100
For many people, being dead is a fairly limiting
handicap that prevents them from doing most

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.460
of the things the living take for granted.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.730
In the 1930s, a man called Charles Vance Millar
challenged that unfair stereotype via various

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.450
stipulations of his will that allowed him
to continue playing jokes on people despite

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.450
being dead.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.260
A lawyer by trade, Millar possessed a daunting
intellect and an incredibly sharp legal mind.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.280
Born in Canada in 1853, he excelled at nearly
everything he tried his hand at, reportedly

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.969
scoring near-perfect marks at university,
before settling on studying law.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.469
Along with ultimately becoming a highly-respected
lawyer, Vance had a keen eye for investments,

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.670
making him a millionaire in his lifetime-
money Vance used to fund his true passion

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.430
of playing practical jokes.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.730
Millar’s sense of humour was legendary and
in particular he liked to test his theory

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.600
that “every man has his price”, doing
things like dropping dollars bills (which

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.110
were roughly the equivalent of $20 today)
on the sidewalk and watching as people tried

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.460
to covertly pocket the cash.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.460
When Millar collapsed of a heart attack on
Halloween of 1926 at the age of 73, his final

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.659
and perhaps greatest practical joke was revealed-
his will.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.770
A lifelong bachelor, Millar had many friends,
but no relatives save for distant cousins

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.399
and the like- none of which he was well acquainted
with.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.310
Thus, he decided to bequeath much of the fortune
he’d accumulated throughout his life to

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.700
various humorously chosen people.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.689
To wit, Millar bequeathed (for their lifetimes)
his Jamaican summer house to three lawyers,

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.689
T.F.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.159
Galt, J.D. Montgomery, and James Newerson,
he knew hated each other, but would now be

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.689
forced to share a common vacation home.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.500
He noted that “upon the death of the last
survivor of them I direct my Executors…

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.159
to sell the same and give the proceeds to
the council of the city of Kingston, Jamaica,

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.210
for distribution among the poor of that city…”

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.520
He further bequeathed shares in the catholic
owned O’Keefe Brewery to various temperance

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.750
supporting protestant ministers, so long as
they took part in its management.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.050
Millar similarly left shares of Kenilworth
Jockey Club to three men, including Reverend

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.410
Samuel D. Chown and Judge W.E.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.400
Raney, who were against horse racing.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.020
Millar’s will stipulated that all three
men had to become members of the club to be

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.860
eligible to claim the shares.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.010
Again, greed won out and all three men dutifully
joined the club they had previously stated

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.560
to despise, though the aforementioned pair
supposedly sold their $1500 worth of shares

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.840
(about $27,000 today) and then promptly canceled
their memberships directly after.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.610
stork-derbyOther, less amusing stipulations
in Millar’s will included orders for money

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.610
to be bequeathed to his housekeeper, some
personal effects to be given to close friends,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.000
and for a small part of his estate to be liquidated
to settle some debts.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.860
As for the remainder, and most significant,
of Millar’s impressive estate, we’ll quote

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.820
the 9th clause of his will:

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.630
All the rest and residue of my property wheresoever
situate, I give, devise and bequeath unto

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.200
my Executors and Trustees named below in Trust
to convert into money as they deem advisable

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.300
and invest all the money until the expiration
of nine years from my death and then call

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.641
in and convert it all into money and at the
expiration of ten years from my death to give

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:25.700
it and its accumulations to the mother who
has since my death given birth in Toronto

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.210
to the greatest number of children as shown
by the registrations under the Vital Statistics

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.210
Act.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.420
If one or more mothers have equal highest
number of registrations under the said Act

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.300
to divide the said moneys and accumulations
equally between them.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.360
Now initially when the will was found by Millar’s
law partner shortly after his death, it was

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.120
dismissed as just another of Millar’s many
jokes, with his partner allegedly quipping:

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.040
“I’ve found some writing in the form of
a will, but it’s not a will – it’s a

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.040
joke.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.930
We’re searching for the actual will now.”

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.410
The will wasn’t a joke, however, and it
soon became clear to Millar’s partner, who

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.630
was on the hook to oversee the lengthy process
of awarding the various bequeathments to the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.850
right people (another joke on Millar’s behalf)
that the document was genuine.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.240
Millar, knowing that people might think the
will wasn’t serious, opened it with the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.510
following line:

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.799
This Will is necessarily uncommon and capricious
because I have no dependents or near relations

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.370
and no duty rests upon me to leave any property
at my death and what I do leave is proof of

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.950
my folly in gathering and retaining more than
I required in my lifetime.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.300
Almost immediately, distant relatives of Millar’s
crawled out of the woodwork to challenge the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.270
will, claiming in court that it was so absurd
that it couldn’t be taken seriously.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.229
The judge presiding over the case, one Justice
Middleton disagreed and ruled that the will

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.069
and its various stipulations were legally
sound- an unsurprising twist considering it

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.270
was personally authored by Millar himself
and, being a lawyer, he knew how to craft

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.729
a will such that it would be iron-clad.

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.699
The will and its contents were, thus, deemed
valid from a legal standpoint with no less

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.039
of an authority than the Canadian Supreme
Court weighing in on the issue.

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.250
This left the courts with the tricky matter
of deciding how exactly to define the various

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.680
terms of Millar’s most unusual request.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.960
It was eventually decided by Justice Middleton,
in proceedings that are still studied by law

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.360
students today, that the courts would only
consider a claim on the estate to be legitimate

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.409
if the children birthed by a Toronto woman
making a claim were similarly legitimate (not

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:24.479
born out of wedlock).

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.030
It was further agreed that only live children
would be counted, discounting stillbirths

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.280
or miscarriages.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.440
In regards to this matter, Justice Middleton
had the following to say:

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.680
I think that a child is live born when it
proceeds entirely from the mother and becomes

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.490
a separate living person.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.949
This generally is evidenced by the child establishing
an independent blood circulation and its ability

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:44.949
to breathe.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.430
A child born dead is not in truth a child.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.889
It was that which might have been a child.

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.189
One cannot but recall the utterances of the
witches in Macbeth who assured Macbeth that

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:59.189
he need fear none of woman born, and Macbeth’s
disappointment when he found that they lied

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:03.379
to the sense while ‘keeping” promise to
the ear’, and he faced Macduff who was ‘from

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.370
his mother’s womb untimely ripped.’

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.379
In the final years of the stipulated decade,
particularly after the Canadian government

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.069
tried to nullify the will in 1932 and give
the money to the University of Toronto, which

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.260
helped to shed more light on the whole affair,
newspapers reported on the various women attempting

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.860
to claim this prize like a sporting event,
dubbing the subsequent spree of pregnancies

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.199
‘The Great Stork Race”.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.199
(And if you’re curious, see Why Storks are
Associated with Delivering Babies.)

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.229
It wasn’t all fun and games though, as Millar’s
death happened to mostly coincide with the

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.580
Great Depression, turning what Millar had
originally intended as a playful joke into

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.889
a matter of life and death for some of the
women hoping to claim Millar’s fortune simply

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.280
to be able to have money to feed said children
at all.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.879
Yet despite the Great Depression, the value
of the remaining assets in Millar’s estate

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.270
had not only been maintained, but increased
upon, with the increase thanks mostly to a

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.159
seemingly insignificant purchase of land below
the Detroit river.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:54.139
Initially bought by Millar for $2 (about $30
today) shortly before his death, the land

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.780
was eventually used for the Detroit-Windsor
tunnel, which today is the second most trafficked

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.080
crossing between Canada and the U.S.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.280
By 1936 this $2 investment was worth $100,000!
(about $1.8 million today).

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.150
This saw the remaining value of his estate
rise to about $750,000 (about $13.2 million

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.120
today) when it was due to be liquidated in
1936.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.969
When the time came to find out who’d actually
won the remains of Millar’s estate, at least

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:26.669
two dozen women in Toronto claimed to have
given birth to eight or more babies in the

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:27.849
city in the previous decade.

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:28.849
Of these women, eight were initially deemed
eligible.

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.150
Of these eight, only four were ultimately
agreed to have fully fulfilled the stipulations

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.249
of the will based on Judge Middleton’s interpretation
of what constituted a “child” and imposing

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:40.389
his personal morals on the issue of illegitimate
children.

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:44.979
These women were identified as, “Annie Smith,
Kathleen Nagle, Lucy Timleck and Isabel Maclean”-

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:47.999
all of whom had given birth to nine children
in that ten years.

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:54.199
For this, all four were awarded $125,000 (about
$2.2 million today) each.

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.349
However, two of the other women identified
as Pauline Clarke and Lillian Kenny were initially

00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:02.580
deemed eligible, but were eventually dismissed
when it emerged that Clarke had given birth

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.330
to five of her ten children out of wedlock
(five with her husband and five with a man

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.330
she lived with after separating, though not
managing to get a divorce from, her husband,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.330
meaning she would have been the winner outright
had this stipulation not been put in place

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.330
by the courts).

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.740
As for Kenny, of her eleven children, three
were stillborn, meaning she missed the mark

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.020
by one live child.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.039
(Interestingly enough, Kenny named her youngest
child Charles Vance Millar Kenny after the

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:21.699
man she thought would be her benefactor before
the courts ruled stillborn children didn’t

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:22.699
count.)

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:26.800
As executing Millar’s will had already been
a hugely expensive and time consuming affair,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.370
in order to avoid an even more drawn out and
costly appeal process (after-all, Millar himself

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.980
had said nothing about a child needing to
be “legitimate” or not stillborn), each

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:42.180
woman was given a settlement of $12,500 (about
$220,000 today) to not pursue the matter further.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.850
As for why Millar is thought to have put this
provision in his will at all, it is known

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.870
that he thought the then taboo of not just
birth control, but even the mere discussion

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.920
of it, was absurd.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.050
Thus, it is speculated that he wanted to highlight
what can happen in exceptional cases when

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.380
one lacks any form of birth control (or knowledge
of it).

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.130
And, funny enough, one of the winning ladies,
Lucy Timleck, did take a moment to tell the

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.170
press, “I think birth control is a wonderful
thing” and further noted “I am sorry,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.430
in one way, that birth control information
wasn’t available years ago.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:28.010
I know mothers who would have welcomed such
knowledge.”
