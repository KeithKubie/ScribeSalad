00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.760
ITS ALWAYS SAD WHEN SOMEONE DIES. HUH

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.540
THIS YOUNG MAN
WAS DRIVING DRUNK,

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.375
COMMA,

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.211
WITHOUT KNOWING
HOW TO DO IT PROPERLY. OK?

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.213
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.717
THIS YOUNG MAN
WAS DRIVING DRUNK

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.719
WITHOUT HAVING PRACTICED

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.455
SO HE WOULD KNOW
HOW TO DO IT RIGHT.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.757
AND YOU'RE NOT STUPID,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.192
AND I'M NOT GONNA TREAT YOU
LIKE YOU ARE.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.294
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING
THAT'S PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL.

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:32.298
SOME PEOPLE DRIVE BETTER
WHEN THEY'RE INTOXICATED

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.133
THAN THEY DO
 WHEN THEY'RE SOBER.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.969
HI. MY NAME'S
DEPUTY JOHNSON.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.639
I'M ABLE TO DO
SUCH A THING, ALL RIGHT?

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.973
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.909
MY DAY-TO-DAY LIFE,

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.410
WHEN I'M DRIVING,
WHAT AM I DOING?

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.079
I'M PLAYING AIR GUITAR?

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.881
MAYBE I'M TRYING
TO WIPE MUSTARD
OFF MY PANTS,

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.416
OR I'M TEXTING SOMEBODY,

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.652
BUT I'M SURE AS HELL
NOT LOOKING AT THE ROAD.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.921
YES, I SAID HELL.
LIVE WITH IT.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.789
WHEN I AM DRIVING DRUNK,

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.758
2 O'CLOCK. 10 O'CLOCK,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.761
MIRROR, MIRROR,
EVERY 30 SECONDS.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.596
THE AIR CONDITIONER'S
ON ME,

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.798
I'VE GOT
SOME SPEED METAL
ON THE RADIO,

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:09.535
I'M PUMPED.
 I'M PAYING ATTENTION.
 BELIEVE ME.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.337
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
SINCE I WAS 11 YEARS OLD.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.805
I'M VERY GOOD AT IT.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:14.740
IT'S LIKE USING CONDOMS,

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.242
OR POPPING
A PENICILLIN

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.412
BEFORE YOU HAVE
MULTIPLE ENCOUNTERS.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.748
YOU KNOW? SAFETY.
YEAH?

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.585
I SEE A LOT OF
PRETTY GIRLS HERE TODAY...

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.587
A LOT OF PRETTY GIRLS.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.490
SOME OF YOU HAVE
DEFINITELY GOT CAREERS

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.426
IN GENTLEMEN'S MAGAZINES
LATER ON

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.096
AND ADULT ENTERTAINING.
ALL RIGHT?

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:41.367
I HOPE THAT
WHEN IT COMES TIME
TO LIST YOUR TURN-OFFS,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.704
THAT VEHICULAR
MANSLAUGHTER...

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.737
WILL BE ONE
OF THOSE TURN-OFFS.
