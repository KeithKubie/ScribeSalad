00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:01.521
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:04.717
Today we're going to be
discussing more irregular plurals.

00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:09.551
So, this is the irregular
plural part II, the two-ening.

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:16.105
Because we really want to
focus on this en particle.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:17.313
I'll explain in a minute.

00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:21.704
So, previously we discussed
the idea that there's one

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.301
regular plural.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.111
And then, there are a
couple of different kinds

00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:29.039
of irregular plurals.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.542
So, we have the word dog.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:36.549
Then it becomes dogs.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:39.578
We have the word leaf.

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:43.283
Then it becomes leaves.

00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:48.052
I'd like to introduce something
else too, the word child

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:51.235
is also an irregular plural
because its plural form

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:53.599
is not childs, but in fact, you ready,

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.017
say it with me, children.

00:00:56.017 --> 00:00:56.639
Wow.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:57.632
That's weird.

00:00:57.632 --> 00:01:00.374
What is that about?

00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:03.946
Like I said, English is
not a predictable language.

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:05.248
Few languages are.

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:07.894
When we think of English
as one solid block of wood,

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:11.168
what we're actually seeing
is this lashed together raft

00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:13.981
made of spit, hope, and history.

00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.399
So, it's your job as a writer
and a speaker of English

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.311
to make of this crooked
timber something straight,

00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:23.055
to borrow a phrase and then mangle it.

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:25.551
So, the question is what is the deal?

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.584
Right.

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:29.627
And the answer is that it has
to do with English language

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:32.034
history and heritage.

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:35.142
English comes to us from Old English,

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:41.503
which, if you look at it now,
it kinda looks like German

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:44.714
because English is a Germanic language.

00:01:44.714 --> 00:01:46.758
That's the term linguists use.

00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:51.892
So, in Old English, there
were a bunch of different ways

00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:53.492
to make something plural.

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:57.070
Some nouns would become
plural by adding an e n.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.527
Some you could add an s.

00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:01.466
Some you would add an r.

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:05.021
And part of this depended on
what part of England you lived

00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:06.484
in at the time.

00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:09.238
There were a bunch of
different regional variations.

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:13.999
Today, this e n ending only
applies to basically three

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.140
or four words.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.279
These are all you need to
remember for this one weird

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.395
e n thing.

00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:22.770
So, the e n ending plural only applies to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.944
child,

00:02:25.994 --> 00:02:26.874
ox,

00:02:28.424 --> 00:02:29.964
brother, or sister.

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:34.265
And even those, these are really rare.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.180
I bet you don't even know
what I'm talking about.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.605
The plural of brother
originally was brethren.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:42.640
The plural of sister
is sistren, or sistren.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.685
But these are so rare, and
brothers and sisters is

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:49.484
so common that we don't
even need to consider them.

00:02:49.484 --> 00:02:53.582
So, really, the only weird e
n plurals that are gonna be

00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:58.175
in common usage are children, and oxen.

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:03.101
And unless your family
raises musk oxen or you're

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.398
an ox driver, you're probably
not gonna be using the word

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:10.369
ox very often, and if oxen
are a big part of your life,

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.981
you probably knew how to
pluralize them already

00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:14.618
just from hearing people
talk about them your

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:15.721
entire childhood.

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:17.000
So, I'm going to cross that off too.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.764
The only thing you need
to worry about is the e n

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:23.245
in children.

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:27.702
Child becomes children.

00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:33.261
Now, you're probably wondering
David if there's the word ox,

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:35.352
and ox becomes oxen.

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:37.336
What about box?

00:03:37.336 --> 00:03:41.092
Why is the plural of
box boxes and not boxen?

00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:45.173
To borrow a gag from Brian Regan.

00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:48.332
The simple truth is that it has to do with

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:50.419
this word's origin.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.322
Ox is a native Old English word.

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:57.679
Box comes to us originally
from Greek, and then Latin.

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:58.600
And then French.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.491
That's how it came to English.

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:04.861
I'm sorry if that's not a very
satisfying answer, but that's

00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:06.370
how English works.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.832
English is this language
that is composed of a bunch

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:12.256
of different puzzle pieces
all mashed together by time,

00:04:12.256 --> 00:04:15.442
history, and repeated invasions,
which are totally metal.

00:04:16.472 --> 00:04:17.835
But I'm getting away from myself.

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:19.766
The important thing to
remember is that for this

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:23.553
irregular plural, this e n
ending, really, unless you work

00:04:23.553 --> 00:04:28.006
with oxen, or unless you are
leading some sort of old-timey

00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:30.352
folk revival where you
have to refer to brethren

00:04:30.352 --> 00:04:33.723
and sistren, child to
children is really the only

00:04:33.723 --> 00:04:36.157
change you need concern yourself with.

00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:40.490
All this can be summed up just like that.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.102
You can learn anything.

00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:44.310
David out.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.998
Now, if you're still with
me, I would like to relate

00:04:47.998 --> 00:04:51.471
a humorous, historical
anecdote that comes to us from

00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:55.735
the 15th century English
printer William Caxton.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:01.108
Now, this story comes to us
from about the year 1490.

00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:04.473
And I just want to use this
story to illustrate just

00:05:04.473 --> 00:05:08.085
how different, how dependent
on what part of the country

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.149
you were living in was on
the language that you spoke.

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:14.404
Because before mass transit,
and mass communication

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:16.794
media, which William Caxton
was a part of because he was

00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:19.100
one of the first English
language printers.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.107
Before any of this technology
allowed us all to communicate

00:05:22.107 --> 00:05:24.981
with each other, we basically
just had letters, and most

00:05:24.981 --> 00:05:26.128
people were illiterate.

00:05:26.128 --> 00:05:27.866
And talking to each other.

00:05:27.866 --> 00:05:30.431
And since it wasn't really
easy to get from place to place

00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:33.810
to place before the advent
of cars most people didn't

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.452
really go very far.

00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:38.978
So, here is the story, which
I will translate for you

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:40.261
from Middle English.

00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:41.041
It goes like this.

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.584
So, these merchants were
traveling from the Thames river,

00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:45.263
which flows through London,
and they're trying to get

00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:48.845
to Zeeland, here, which is in
the modern day Netherlands.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:53.487
This is, incidentally, this is England.

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:55.809
This is the southern
southeast coast of England.

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:57.608
They're trying to get to
Zeeland, and this is a distance

00:05:57.608 --> 00:05:59.963
of about 160 miles.

00:05:59.963 --> 00:06:01.278
Give or take.

00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:05.751
But they can't make it
there because of bad winds.

00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.964
They stop here at Foreland
to refresh their stores.

00:06:09.964 --> 00:06:11.707
They stop for groceries basically.

00:06:11.707 --> 00:06:14.128
And then, they realize that
their London English and the

00:06:14.128 --> 00:06:15.568
English of the place where they are,

00:06:15.568 --> 00:06:19.735
which is maybe 60 miles
out of London, maybe,

00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:21.987
is mutually incomprehensible.

00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:23.682
A man goes into a house.

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:25.608
Asks the woman of the house for eggs.

00:06:25.608 --> 00:06:27.712
She doesn't understand the
word eggs because the word

00:06:27.712 --> 00:06:30.653
she uses for eggs is eyren.

00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:33.328
The word egg is Norse.

00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:35.163
And he says I would like some egges.

00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:36.945
And she says I don't have any egges.

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:38.176
I don't speak French.

00:06:38.176 --> 00:06:39.655
And he gets angry because
he's like I don't speak

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:40.298
French either.

00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:41.107
I'm English.

00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:42.160
He says do you have any eggs.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.320
She says I don't know what that is.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.709
And finally, someone says
I think he means eyren.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:46.797
Do you have any eyren?

00:06:46.797 --> 00:06:48.363
And she said oh eyren.

00:06:48.363 --> 00:06:49.419
Of course, here.

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:50.486
Buy some.

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.542
And it just goes to show
you that before the advent

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:56.938
of mass communication, we
could have had variations

00:06:56.938 --> 00:07:01.005
from, as Caxton put it,
shire to shire to shire.

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:03.919
Each little town had its own
variant of language, and it

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.215
wasn't until everything was
united by this technology

00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:10.106
that Caxton worked with, the
printing press, that people

00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:12.521
started to become literate
and converge toward what

00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:15.840
we would consider a more
unified standard of English.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.556
Alright.

00:07:16.556 --> 00:07:18.477
That was just a little bonus, silly video.

00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:20.545
You can learn anything.

00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:21.509
David out.
