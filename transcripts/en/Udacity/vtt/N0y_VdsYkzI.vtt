00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.180
So far,
you've researched browser events, and

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.230
you've taken a peek
at them being logged.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.680
Now it's time to actually listen for
and respond to them with jQuery.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.760
There are three items you need in order
to listen for events and react to them.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.530
You need the target element to listen
to, the event we want to react to,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.320
and the actions to take in response.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.230
Let me show you an example.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.660
I need the target element that
jQuery will be listening to for

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.750
events, so I'll use jQuery
to select the input field.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.710
Next, I call the .on() method.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.240
This .on method is where
the magic happens.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.469
It's the primary way the jQuery
uses to set up event listeners.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.490
The first argument to the .on method
is the event I want to listen for.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.190
In this example, it's keypress.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.650
But it could also be click, change,
and mouseover to name a few.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.360
And finally,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.050
I need to pass a function with the
actions I want to happen in response.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.282
This function is called the .callback.

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.890
The .callback function being
passed to the .on method,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.840
is just a regular JavaScript function.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.400
And therefore, can contain
any JavaScript code you want,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.580
from altering page content
to analytics code.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480
I'll change the contents of the function
to alter the color of the page.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.404
And I'll test it.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.810
Bam.
Looks good.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.200
In the next quiz, you're going to
create your own event listener.
