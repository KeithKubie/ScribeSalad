00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.066
- Andrey, Andrey?

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.049
Andrey starts working
on his science project

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.049
at 4 o'clock pm, and he
finishes 50 minutes later.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.283
Which number line below
has a red dot marking

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:19.087
when Andrey finishes working
on his science project?

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:21.142
So they tell us that he
starts his science project

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:23.208
at 4 o'clock pm.

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:27.834
This first choice over here,
puts the dot at 4 o'clock,

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:29.356
but they didn't say when
did he start working

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.597
on his science project,

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.036
they say put a red dot marking

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:35.473
when Andrey finishes working
on his science project.

00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:37.378
So he started at 4:00, and it says

00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:40.812
he finishes 50 minutes later.

00:00:40.812 --> 00:00:43.970
So if you start at four, if
you add 50 minutes to four,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.489
that's gonna put us at 4:50.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.567
So where is 4:50 on this number line?

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:51.887
So, let's see, or on this time
line, I guess I could say.

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.233
So, let's see, this is 4:15,

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.532
so each of these marks
must be five minutes.

00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:01.164
This is 4:05, 4:10, 4:15, 4:20,

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:05.567
4:25, 4:30, 4:35, 4:40,

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:09.464
4:45, and then 4:50
would be right over here.

00:01:09.464 --> 00:01:12.371
So which of these choices
has a dot at 4:50?

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.027
This last choice has a dot,
has the red dot, at 4:50.

00:01:16.027 --> 00:01:20.778
Notice this is 50 minutes
after he started at 4 o'clock.

00:01:21.973 --> 00:01:23.959
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.734
Amira starts raking leaves at 2:30 pm,

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.415
and she finishes 25 minutes later.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.778
Which number line below has a red dot

00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:35.645
marking when Amira
finishes raking the leaves?

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:39.871
So she starts at 2:30, and
she finishes 25 minutes later.

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.253
So it looks like on this one,

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:44.793
each of these spaces is five minutes.

00:01:44.793 --> 00:01:49.528
So this is 2:30, so this five, 10,

00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:53.648
15, 20, 25 minutes later.

00:01:53.648 --> 00:01:56.647
And this space right over her is 2:55.

00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:58.692
It looks like this first choice

00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:00.594
is actually the choice we're looking for.

00:02:00.594 --> 00:02:03.694
They put the red dot
25 minutes after 2:30.

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:06.306
Notice this is 2:30,
five minutes after 2:30,

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:10.335
10 minutes after 2:30,
15 minutes after 2:30,

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:15.335
20 minutes after 2:30,
25 minutes after 2:30.

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.345
Let's keep going, this
is actually a lot of fun.

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:22.341
The number line shows when Scarlet

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.966
starts and finishes art club.

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.371
That's when she starts.

00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.136
That's when she finishes.

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:31.212
What time did Scarlet start art club?

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:33.267
Well, let's see, this is half way

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.066
between 3 o'clock and 3:30,

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.913
so that's going to be 3:15.

00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:40.013
Each of these marks go up by 15 minutes.

00:02:40.013 --> 00:02:42.927
So this is at 3:15.

00:02:42.927 --> 00:02:45.527
What time did Scarlet finish art club?

00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:48.975
So this is right in
between 4:30 and 5 o'clock,

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:52.272
or you could say it's 15
minutes more than 4:30,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:57.272
so that's going to be 4:45, 4:45.

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:00.365
How long was Scarlet in art club?

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:01.735
So let's think about it.

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:02.850
There's a couple of ways you could do it.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.208
You could look at the line.

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.170
Let's see, to go from
this point to this point,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.170
that's 15 minutes, then
30, then 45, then one hour,

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.579
one hour 15 minutes, one hour 30 minutes.

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.272
So you could say one hour 30 minutes,

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:19.199
or actually they want it all in minutes.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.401
One hour is 60 minutes plus
30 minutes is 90 minutes.

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:25.562
So actually let me just do
it all in minutes again.

00:03:25.562 --> 00:03:28.684
So this is, as I move my mouse,

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:30.763
I'm gonna talk about how
many minutes I'm adding,

00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:32.875
relative to this, or from the start.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:37.875
So 15 minutes gets us to
3:30, 30 minutes, 45 minutes,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.900
60 minutes, 75 minutes, 90 minutes.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.482
So that's 90 minutes right over there.

00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:48.290
Another way to think about it is

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.438
it would take 45 minutes to
go from 3:15 to 4 o'clock,

00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:55.618
45 minutes to go from 3:15 to 4 o'clock,

00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:57.778
that makes sense, then another 45 minutes

00:03:57.778 --> 00:04:00.762
to go from 4 o'clock to 4:45.

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:05.762
So 45 plus 45 is going to be 90 minutes.

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.965
Let's do a couple of these.

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:12.706
So the number line shows
when Anna starts and finishes

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:15.063
reading a chapter in her book.

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:17.466
What time did Anna start reading?

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:21.539
It says right over there she
started reading at 8:10 pm.

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.798
8:10 pm.

00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:25.627
What time did Anna finish reading?

00:04:25.627 --> 00:04:27.612
Let's see, let me make
sure I'm reading this,

00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:31.250
so this is 8:20, this is 8:25,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.560
and they have one, two,
three, four, five marks,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.593
so each of these go up a minute.

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:38.077
So, you could say it's
a minute before 8:25,

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:40.213
or four minutes after 8:24,

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:44.694
8:21, 8:22, 8:23, 8:24.

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:46.787
8:24.

00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:49.593
How long did Anna read?

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:50.800
Well, she starts reading at 8:10

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.171
and finishes reading at 8:24.

00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:56.037
To go from 10 to 24 that
means she read for 14 minutes.

00:04:56.037 --> 00:04:57.593
And you could even count it over here.

00:04:57.593 --> 00:05:02.593
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:07.575
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.119
Let's do one more.

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:15.138
Mohamed speaks on the phone for 15 minutes

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:18.597
and finishes his phone call at 9:20 am.

00:05:18.597 --> 00:05:21.151
Which number line below
has a green dot marking

00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:24.554
when Mohamed starts his phone call?

00:05:24.554 --> 00:05:27.874
Alright, it finishes at
9:20, so it finishes,

00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:29.917
let's see, where's 9:20
on this number line.

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:33.307
So it looks like each of these
marks go up by five minutes.

00:05:33.307 --> 00:05:35.629
So this is 9:15, and I was
able to figure that out

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.334
because we have three
marks that go to 9:15,

00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:42.572
from 9:00 to 9:15, so
this is 9:05, 9:10, 9:15.

00:05:42.572 --> 00:05:44.650
So this would be 9:20.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.867
So this is when he finishes, 9:20,

00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:50.625
and he was on the phone for 15 minutes.

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:52.173
Remember, we don't want
to mark when he finished,

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:53.369
they tell us that it's 9:20.

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.389
We want to mark when he started.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.258
So if he's on the phone
call for 15 minutes,

00:05:57.258 --> 00:06:00.279
and he finishes at 9:20,
he's gonna finish 15 minutes,

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.018
or sorry, if he's on the
phone for 15 minutes,

00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:06.602
and he finishes at 9:20,
he's going to start

00:06:06.602 --> 00:06:08.974
15 minutes before 9:20.

00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:11.191
So five, 10, 15.

00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:13.478
He's gonna start at 9:05.

00:06:13.478 --> 00:06:15.720
So that's this choice right over here.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.171
Another way you could think about it is

00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:22.171
if I'm at 9:20, and I go
15 minutes before 9:20,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.126
20 minus 15 is five,

00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:27.446
so that's gonna get me to 9:05.

00:06:27.446 --> 00:06:29.246
And we can just make sure
we feel good about it.

00:06:29.246 --> 00:06:32.786
If he starts his phone call at 9:05

00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:34.598
and he speaks for 15 minutes,

00:06:34.598 --> 00:06:38.580
five, 10, 15, he's gonna
finish his phone call

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.298
right over here at 9:20,

00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:42.944
which is exactly what they described.
