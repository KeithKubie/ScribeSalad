need the great books and you were

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
need the great books and you were
 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:38.420
need the great books and you were
reading the great books not to be a

reading the great books not to be a
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.540
reading the great books not to be a
teacher but to let you go beyond the

book so that was how he saw of course he

would know that that wouldn't happen

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460
would know that that wouldn't happen
 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.910
would know that that wouldn't happen
very often but it was still there that

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920
 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.190
and it's certainly

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200
 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.680
in dreams of people you know that they

and often and then you get braggarts who

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560
and often and then you get braggarts who
 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.180
and often and then you get braggarts who
tell you they're doing something great

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190
tell you they're doing something great
 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.969
