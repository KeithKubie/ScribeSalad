00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.240
All right, so far we have been
discussing adding positive and

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.150
negative integers.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.740
You may have noticed that subtraction
can be thought of as adding a negative.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.400
Another way we can think of subtraction
is adding the opposite of a number.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.738
For example, if we have 6- 10,
we are subtracting 10 from 6.

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:26.668
We can think of this as adding
the opposite of 10 to 6.

00:00:26.668 --> 00:00:29.278
So what is the opposite of 10, and

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:33.020
what do we get when we add
the opposite of 10 to 6?

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.460
