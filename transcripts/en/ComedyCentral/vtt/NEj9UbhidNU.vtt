00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.335
Donald Trump is a chameleon,

00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:04.670
not just because he morphed
from liberal to conservative

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:07.173
faster than you can say
Koch brothers, but...

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.208
he looks like a lot of things.

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.911
Reddit thought his hair looked
like this caterpillar.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:15.014
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.482
Also deadly.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.552
BuzzFeed thought he looked
like this sushi... right here.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.288
(laughter, applause)

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.257
And...

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.762
I feel bad for the sushi.
That's really...

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.798
-unfair.
-Uncanny.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.933
On this program, admittedly,
we've said that he looks like

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.902
everything from a corn husk
cursed by a witch

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.371
to a dissonant bagpipe
powered by farts, but...

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.506
-(laughter) -the Internet
has found a new thing

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.642
that resembles The Donald,
and it is wonderful.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.444
Comedians,
what looks like Mr. Trump?

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.413
Is it a...

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.287
Doug Benson.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.522
(laughter)

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:00.059
-(cheering)
-A really... dank...

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:02.028
SANDERS:
I think they know you, Doug.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.230
HARDWICK:
...weed nugget.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.199
I'm not gonna fall for that.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.234
(laughter)

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.470
It's A) A weasel-like Pokémon.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.772
Yes! That's the correct answer!
Take a look. There it is.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:16.909
(cheering, applause)

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.378
-OAKERSON: Good grab.
-This, uh...

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.347
(cheering continues)

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.351
This angry weasel
with the tiny hands

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.720
and the bad hair
looks just like Donald Trump.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.388
This is Yungoos. Yungoos.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.724
And just like in Pokémon,
Trump wants to catch 'em all!

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.726
He just means foreigners.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.761
-Uh...
-(audience groaning)

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.964
Hey, man,
I didn't (bleep) do it.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.799
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.969
Pokémon are known for attacks
like Blaze Kick and Comet Punch,

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.971
so, comedians,
now that PokéDon is here,

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.106
what's one
of his special attacks?

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:48.374
Big Jay.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:50.042
How about the Immigrant Launch?

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:53.412
-(laughter)
-All right, points. Yeah. Yeah.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:56.883
-Vance.
-Man Tan Splaining Spray.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.552
-Yeah, all right.
-(laughter)

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:00.620
Doug.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.955
-Tiny Hand Slap.
-(laughter)

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:04.257
All right.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.125
-Points.
-(applause)

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.361
Ow. Stop it!

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.527
Stop it! Stop it!
