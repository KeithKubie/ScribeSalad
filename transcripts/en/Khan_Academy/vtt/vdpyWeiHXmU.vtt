00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:01.123
- What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.123 --> 00:00:04.284
is get some practice
visualizing what happens

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:07.213
if we were to try to rotate
two dimensional shapes

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:08.505
in three dimensions.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:09.757
Well what do I mean by that?

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:11.963
Let's say I started with a right triangle.

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:16.112
So let's say my right
triangle looks like this.

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.036
So let's say it looks like that.

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:21.684
Right over there.

00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:24.749
And so this is a right angle.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.721
And let's say that this
width right over here

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:33.721
is three units and let's say
that this length is five units

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.987
and now I'm gonna do
something interesting.

00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:39.696
I'm gonna take this two
dimensional right triangle

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:42.064
and I'm gonna try to rotate
it in three dimensions

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:47.064
around this line, around
the line that I'm doing

00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:48.759
as a dotted magenta line.

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:52.519
So I'm gonna rotate it around
this line right over there.

00:00:52.822 --> 00:00:56.073
So if I were to rotate
it around this line,

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:58.370
what type of a shape am I going to get?

00:00:58.604 --> 00:00:59.455
And I encourage you --

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:00.887
It's going to be a
three dimensional shape.

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:02.041
I encourage you to think about it,

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.595
maybe take out a piece of paper, draw it,

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:05.474
or just try to imagine it in your head.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:08.456
Well to think about it
in three dimensions,

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:09.206
what I'm going to do is try to

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:10.638
look at this thing in three dimensions.

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:12.379
So let me draw this same line

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.610
but I'm gonna draw it at an angle

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.884
so we can visualize the whole
thing in three dimensions.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.894
So imagine if this was
sitting on the ground.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.021
So that's our magenta line,

00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:24.552
and then I can draw my triangle.

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:27.005
So my triangle would
look something like this.

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:30.528
So it would look like this.

00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:34.545
So once again this is five units,

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:37.469
this is three units,
this a right triangle.

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:39.429
I'm gonna rotate it around the line,

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:40.541
so what's it gonna look like?

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:43.252
Well this and this right over here

00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:46.015
is gonna rotate around and it's gonna form

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:49.258
a circle with a radius of three, right?

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:51.649
So it's gonna form, so it intersects,

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.923
if that was on the ground
it's gonna be three again.

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:56.918
And let me draw it down so
it's gonna keep going down.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.087
Whoops.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.743
We don't want to press the wrong button.

00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:02.500
So it's gonna look something like this.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.293
That's what the base is gonna look like.

00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.168
But then this end right over here

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:07.306
is just gonna stay at a point

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:09.271
because this is right
on that magenta line.

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.756
So it's gonna stay at a point.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.522
And so if you were to
look at the intersect

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:14.447
so it would look something like this.

00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:16.786
So it would look like
this and then you'd have

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:19.136
another thing that goes like this

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:21.422
and so if you were to
take a section like this

00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:23.535
it would have a little smaller circle here

00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:25.902
based on what this distance is.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:30.638
So what is the shape, what is
the shape that I am drawing?

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.742
Well what you see, what
it is, it's a cone.

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:35.462
It's a cone and if I shade it in

00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:37.335
you might see the cone
a little bit better.

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:41.884
So let me shade it in so you see the cone.

00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:45.938
So what you end up getting is a cone

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:48.650
where it's base, so I'm shading it in

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.529
so that hopefully helps a little bit,

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:52.899
so what you end up getting is a cone

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.427
where the base has a
radius of three units.

00:02:56.867 --> 00:02:58.052
So let me draw this.

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:01.559
This right over here is
the radius of the base

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.200
and it is three units.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.707
I could also draw it like this.

00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:07.053
So the cone is gonna look like this.

00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:10.403
And this is the tip of the cone

00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:15.258
and it's gonna look just like this.

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:16.860
And once again let me
shade it a little bit

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.849
so that you can appreciate that

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.798
this is a three dimensional shape.

00:03:21.287 --> 00:03:24.190
So draw the cone so you can shade it

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:26.914
and we can even construct the original

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.755
so that, well or we can
construct the original shape

00:03:29.755 --> 00:03:32.195
so you see how it
constructs so it makes this,

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:34.026
the line, that magenta line,

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:35.719
is gonna do this type of thing.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.358
It's gonna go through
the center of the base,

00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.021
it's gonna go through
the center of the base

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.971
just like that.

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:47.779
And our original shape, our
original right triangle,

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.485
if you just took a cross section of it

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:55.287
that included that line you
would have your original shape.

00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:56.562
Let me do this in orange.

00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:01.734
So the original shape is right over there.

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:02.755
So what do you get?

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:07.755
You get a cone where the radius
of the base is three units.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:09.719
Interesting.
