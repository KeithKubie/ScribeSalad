00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.421
- [Voiceover] Hello Grammarians

00:00:01.421 --> 00:00:02.303
Hello Paige,

00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:03.136
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.026
- [Voiceover] Hello apostrophe!

00:00:05.026 --> 00:00:06.199
Today we're going to start talking about

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:08.866
a different piece of punctuation

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:13.833
and that piece of
punctuation is the apostrophe

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:15.084
it kind of looks like a comma,

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:18.660
but it's one that floats in the air

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.082
Here's the ground, here's the word ground,

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.582
And if we say Paige's dog Atti

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:34.411
we're using the apostrophe,
not shown to scale obviously

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.151
in one of its three
different applications.

00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:40.318
So the apostrophe can do three things.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.834
Thing number one: it can
stand in for missing letters.

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:48.082
- [Voiceover] So when
an apostrophe stands in

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:51.883
for missing letters that's
called a contraction

00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:54.549
- [Voiceover] So what does that look like,

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.688
what does a contraction
look like in context?

00:00:57.688 --> 00:00:59.351
- [Voiceover] So another
way to say something like

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.588
"I did not eat the cookie." Is to say

00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:03.755
"I didn't eat the cookie."

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:11.055
- [Voiceover] So that
apostrophe there represents

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.048
the 'O' being taken out
and everything being

00:01:13.048 --> 00:01:15.795
squished together into
this new word 'didn't'

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:19.080
So "Did not" gets (sucks) together,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.531
and then we attach this
apostrophe to show that

00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:26.389
we've contracted, or shortened
or shrunk, these two words.

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.752
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:27.752 --> 00:01:29.296
- [Voiceover] Paige, join
me on screen number two

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:31.283
and let's talk about thing number two.

00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:32.501
- [Voiceover] Let's go.

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.582
- [Voiceover] So the second
thing that an apostrophe can do

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:38.260
is show that something belongs to someone,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.799
what we call possession.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.935
- [Voiceover] So you
can use an apostrophe to

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:46.018
say something like "That's
David's cursed skull."

00:01:49.507 --> 00:01:50.499
- [Voiceover] It's true.

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:51.958
It's been in my family for generations.

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.125
But what is going on here?

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:58.836
What is this doing the same work as?

00:01:58.836 --> 00:02:01.300
- [Voiceover] So the
sentence basically means

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.448
that cursed skull belongs to David.

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:07.260
This first sentence, "That's
David's cursed skull"

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.898
is kind of just an easier way to say that.

00:02:09.898 --> 00:02:12.947
- [Voiceover] So apostrophes
can show contraction

00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:14.227
much like we're also doing

00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:17.414
in this part of the sentence
as well with "That's",

00:02:17.414 --> 00:02:19.879
because this is a shorter version of

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.462
"That is David's cursed skull."

00:02:23.307 --> 00:02:27.049
but we're condensing that or
contracting that into "That's"

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.434
but it's also being used
for its second purpose here

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:32.117
which is "David's", and
this is what we call

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:34.379
the possessive or the genitive case.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.397
Saying that, this cursed
skull belongs to me.

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:40.395
Paige, what's the third
use of apostrophes?

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:41.374
It's pretty rare.

00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:45.147
- [Voiceover] The third use
does not happen very often,

00:02:45.147 --> 00:02:48.870
but apostrophes can occasionally be used

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.212
to make words plural.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.864
- [Voiceover] Okay,
because I was always taught

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:56.052
never to use apostrophes
to pluralize stuff.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.481
Like the plural of book is books,

00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:00.731
not "Book's". That's wrong.

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:02.779
- [Voiceover] Yeah, so there a--

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.599
- [Voiceover] This is the plural,

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.182
and this is something belonging to a book.

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:11.716
- [Voiceover] Right, the book's pages.

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:13.230
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.057
- [Voiceover] So there's
really only one case

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:17.820
where you'd want to use an apostrophe

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.090
to make something plural.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.459
- [Voiceover] What is that case?

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.624
- [Voiceover] That case is when you're

00:03:22.624 --> 00:03:26.169
trying to make the plural
of lower case letter.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.336
- [Voiceover] Like, "I'm
really bad at drawing 's's."

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:32.740
- [Voiceover] Right. If you
didn't have that apostrophe

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.439
there, it might kinda
just look like (hisses)

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.821
- [Voiceover] So I could say, for example,

00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:40.488
"I like to draw j's"

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:45.619
and "Remember to dot your j's and i's"

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:49.871
Like that, to denote that their plural,

00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:51.947
to indicate there's
some kind of separation

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:54.912
between this lowercase letter
and this lowercase letter.

00:03:54.912 --> 00:03:56.029
And that we're trying to say that

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.958
there are multiple j's and i's.

00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.278
- [Voiceover] Right. Especially
with something like i's,

00:04:01.278 --> 00:04:02.620
if you didn't have that apostrophe there,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.572
it would probably just look like

00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:05.080
you were trying to write the word is.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.133
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:07.714
So this is kind of a work-around.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.280
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.203
- [Voiceover] So this
usage is extremely rare,

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:13.719
that's why I put it in parentheses,

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.886
because I really want to
de-emphasize this last usage.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.406
Super rare.

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:21.762
So more importantly the first

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.657
two things are the most important.

00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:26.310
Number one, contractions
make stuff shorter like

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.739
"I did not eat the cookie." to

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:29.368
"I didn't eat the cookie."

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:32.293
And possession, showing ownership.

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:35.697
So instead of saying "That
cursed skull belongs to David"

00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:39.353
you would say "That is
David's cursed skull."

00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:41.096
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:41.931
- [Voiceover] And that's an overview

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.634
of the three powers of the apostrophe.

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:46.947
You can learn anything, David out.

00:04:46.947 --> 00:04:48.899
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
