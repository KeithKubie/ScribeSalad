FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.280
senior vice president,
Vic Gundotra.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.220
VIC GUNDOTRA: Well,
hello, everybody.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.700
Hello.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.280
On behalf of Google, let me
extend our warmest welcome to

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.690
all of you.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.930
To the over 6,000 people here
at the Moscone Center in San

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.140
Francisco, welcome.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.970
And to our Google I/O viewing
parties that are happening all

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.510
around the world, over 350
different parties with over

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.190
30,000 in attendance, welcome.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.810
And finally, let me also welcome
the over 1 million

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.530
people who will be watching
this event

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.870
live stream on YouTube.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.640
Welcome

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:05.080
to Google I/O. [APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.910
VIC GUNDOTRA: This is our fifth
year, and we're going to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.950
make this Google I/O
incredibly special.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.070
Our teams have worked very
hard to put on something

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.410
really great for you.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.840
And we still have some
surprises left.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.385
At the end of the day, however,
it's not just about

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.520
the hard work our
teams have done.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.060
This conference is really
about you, developers.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.210
When you think back over the
last five years, things like

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.420
Google Chrome or Android
were in their infancy.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.490
We owe, in no small measure, the
success of our efforts due

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.420
to your support.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420
Thank you.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.260
Thank you for betting with
Google, and thank you for

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.370
supporting us.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.800
Thank you for spending three
days of your life here at the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.370
Google I/O conference.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.990
We hope you're going to
absolutely love it.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.240
Now one small favor
to ask, please.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.340
If you have a hot spot, please
turn the hot spot off, as it's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.570
going to greatly increase our
chances of having a successful

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.440
set of demos.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.150
With that, let's get
this started.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.720
Please join me in welcoming
director of Android product

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.557
management, Hugo Barra.

00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:31.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.400
HUGO BARRA: All right.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.710
Good morning, everyone.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.590
And welcome to the Android
keynote at I/O 2012.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.500
Last year on this stage,
we talked about

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.250
momentum, mobile, and more.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.840
Momentum, accelerating of
Android across the world.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.410
Mobile, everything we're
doing to innovate on

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.180
smartphones and tablets.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.150
And more, extending the Android
ecosystem well beyond

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.610
the typical mobile device.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.940
This year, we're continuing with
the same three themes and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.640
picking up right where
we left off.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.370
Let's start with momentum.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.040
Last year right here, we
announced that Android had

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.460
crossed the mark of 100
million devices.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.430
100 million was a huge milestone
for us back then.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.460
It's been a pretty busy year,
and I'm thrilled to announce

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.240
our latest milestone.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.820
Ready?

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.140
400 million Android devices.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.540
HUGO BARRA: 400 million is a
pretty huge number, but we're

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.600
definitely not slowing down.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.470
Last year right here, we
announced that we were seeing

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.780
400,000 new Android devices
activated every day.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.720
Well, today, 1 million new
Android devices are activated

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.510
every single day.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.960
HUGO BARRA: That's about 12
new Android devices every

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.700
second of every day.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.140
[CHEERS]

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.710
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.650
More devices in the hands of
more people in a truly global

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.150
phenomenon.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.580
Take a look at this chart.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.880
What you see here is a heat
map representation of the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.040
growth in Android devices
throughout the world

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.420
over the last year.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.950
Places like Japan, South Korea,
and France grew between

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.810
200% and 300% in these
12 months.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.670
But what's even more impressive
is that the

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.946
developing world is adopting
Android at

00:04:33.946 --> 00:04:36.300
an even faster pace.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.390
Very large markets, like Brazil,
India, Thailand, and

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.510
Indonesia, all grew around 500%
over the last year alone.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.410
Really, really exciting.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.542
And we're continuing to build
and innovate just as fast in

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:52.310
the Android team.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.040
Today, we want to share with you
what we've been working on

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.060
since we launched Ice Cream
Sandwich late last year.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.170
I'd like to introduce you
to our newest release.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.120
You guys ready for this?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.060
[CHEERS]

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.970
HUGO BARRA: Android
4.1 Jelly Bean.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:16.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.170
HUGO BARRA: Jelly Bean builds
upon what we created with Ice

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.160
Cream Sandwich.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.310
We want things to be simple,
beautiful, and really smart.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.800
There are a few things
about Jelly Bean we

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.980
wanted to cover today.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.110
Project Butter, a
performance-focused effort

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.990
that went deep into the
guts of the platform.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.550
We'll then talk to you about
a number of delightful

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.260
improvements that we've made
throughout the entire system.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.730
And finally, we'll show you
the new Google Search

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.614
experience on Android.

00:05:44.614 --> 00:05:45.550
[CHEERS]

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.440
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.160
To tell you about Project
Butter, please welcome Android

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.242
engineering director,
Dave Burke.

00:05:54.242 --> 00:06:04.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.790
DAVE BURKE: Thanks, Hugo.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.850
Our brain's visual cortex is
especially sensitive to the

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.020
physics of motion.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.580
It notices delays of as little
as 10 milliseconds.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.530
So with Jelly Bean, we put a lot
of effort into making the

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.090
user interface fast,
fluid, and smooth.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.960
This is the project that
we call Project Butter.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.810
The first thing we did was
improve the system frame rate

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.530
and make it consistent.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.670
We took the display refresh
signal, called vSync, and

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.310
extended it to drive the entire
Android framework at 60

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.420
frames per second.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.750
That's one heartbeat about
every 16 milliseconds.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.400
And now everything runs in
lockstep, application

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.950
rendering, touchscreen
processing, screen

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.560
composition, and display
refresh.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.360
In Jelly Bean, we also
introduced triple buffering in

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.290
the graphics pipeline.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.310
And this allows the GPU, the
CPU, and display to all run in

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.230
parallel without waiting
on each other.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.250
The result is a more consistent
rendering

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.900
framework, and everything
feels a lot smoother.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.550
Scrolling, paging, animations,
they're all buttery smooth.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.550
Next, we focused on improving
touch experience by solving

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.080
two problems.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.000
The first problem is that touch
events are reported

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.140
independently of
screen update.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.490
In Jelly Bean, we now actually
anticipate where your finger

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.630
will be at the time of screen
refresh and use that position

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.460
to draw the display.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.900
This results in a more
reactive and

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.910
uniform touch response.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.050
The second problem relates to
how devices conserve power.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.330
They actually dial the CPU back
to a lower frequency when

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.700
there's not much activity in
the system, and if you

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.700
interact with the system in that
state, it can potentially

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.090
take 10s of milliseconds
for the CPU

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.360
to ramp up and respond.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.380
And this can lead to
a sluggish UI.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.970
So in Jelly Bean, we introduced
the concept of

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.540
Touch Input Boost.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.090
Now when you interact with the
screen, we'll instantly ramp

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.190
the CPU up.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.700
It's literally putting the full
power of the CPU at your

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.360
fingertips.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.200
Now, one of our goals when we
started to work in Jelly Bean

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.660
was to be able to measure
and improve interactive

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.790
performance in a
scientific way.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.860
So we created a new tool
called systrace.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.680
And systrace collects data
directly from the Linux kernel

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.070
and uses that to produce an
overall picture of what the

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.970
system is doing.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.530
The data's represented as a
group of vertically stacked

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.880
time series graphs.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.570
And in this particular
application example, you can

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.580
see that there's a rendering
interruption that's much

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.076
longer than 16 milliseconds.

00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:29.520
And this results in
dropped frames.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.130
When you look at the data, it's
pretty easy to correlate

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.159
that with the database
interruption here.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.159
So you know what to fix.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.400
Systrace comes with the
Jelly Bean SDK.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.289
And it's a really useful tool
for device manufacturers and

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.809
for you guys to optimize
the performance of your

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.120
application.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.320
So how noticeable are these
changes in practice?

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.790
Well, we got out a high-speed
camera to compare a stock

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.320
device running Ice Cream
Sandwich against a device

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.890
running the latest Jelly Bean.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.628
Let's take a look.

00:08:57.628 --> 00:09:03.070
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.170
DAVE BURKE: So this is a really
sophisticated camera

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.730
capable of capturing 4 million
pixels at a rate of up to 300

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.980
frames per second.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.950
Device on the left is running
Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.500
Device on the right,
Jelly Bean.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.405
So let's take a look at the
launcher animation.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.260
So the Jelly Bean device has
a much higher frame rate.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.815
It feels a lot smoother.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.890
Let's take a look at
another example.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.773
Let's look at the Quick
Contacts animation.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And again, the Jelly Bean
device on the right, it

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.575
animates much more smoothly and
much more consistently.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.550
And it just feels much more
silkily smooth, and that's the

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.166
triple buffering and
vSync in action.

00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:59.080
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.370
DAVE BURKE: So these
improvements apply across the

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.730
whole system, and they apply
to all applications.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.490
And it's something that we're
going to continue to improve

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.580
on in future Android releases.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.280
If you want to learn more about
this, we've got a really

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.020
good session tomorrow called
For Butter or Worse.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.770
And to butter you up even
further, let me

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:16.950
pass you back to Hugo.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.710
Thank you.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.940
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, Dave.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.300
Well, Jelly Bean is not only
the fastest and smoothest

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.330
version of Android yet, but
we've also made a ton of

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.630
improvements throughout.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.500
We've touched every corner of
Android, and it all comes

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.110
together in a way that's
really delightful.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.400
So let's jump right in.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.850
I have Randall here from the
Android product team to help

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.380
me with demos.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.490
And first of all, people spend
a lot of time on the home

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.580
screen in Android because we've
always let you customize

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.870
it the way you want with
apps and widgets.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.200
But when you've got a lot of
stuff on your home screen,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.470
adding another widget or getting
things to fit just

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.470
right can be a little
bit difficult.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.100
So we solved that problem
in Jelly Bean.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.350
Let's go to the device.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.240
So here's a home screen
with a bunch of apps.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.970
Now, Randall is going to pick up
a widget from another home

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.340
screen and move it
to this one.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.590
Now watch what happens.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.100
Everything gets out of the way
and aligns perfectly around

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.360
the widget.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.420
But what if the widget is too
big, and there isn't enough

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.870
room for it on the
home screen?

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.390
Well, here's another
home screen that

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.950
has even more apps.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.660
Watch what happens now when
Randall moves that widget to

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.910
this screen.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.410
It magically re-sizes
on its own.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.540
And if you want to do some
spring cleaning in Jelly Bean,

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.930
you can just pick up a widget
and toss it off with a

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.330
familiar gesture.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.270
You can do the same thing with
apps, as many as you want.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.770
That's probably enough,
Randall.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.300
Thanks.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.760
Let's go back to slides.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.360
So we also made text input on
Android a whole lot better.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.710
In Jelly Bean, we refined and
retuned our dictionaries.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.300
They're much more accurate,
more relevant.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.150
And the keyboard learns
intelligently over time.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.830
We've also added a bigram
prediction algorithm which

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.480
guesses the next word you're
going to type before you

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.695
start typing it.

00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:36.510
It's really cool stuff.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.730
But sometimes your hands aren't
free to type, which is

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.990
why Android supports
voice typing.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.450
Now, while voice typing works
really well when you have a

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.960
data connection, if you don't
have one, it doesn't work.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.060
And it can actually be slow if
you have a bad connection.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.595
So in Jelly Bean, we shrunk the
Google Speech Recognizer

00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:55.250
that runs in our data centers--

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:02.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.120
HUGO BARRA: We shrunk the Google
Speech Recognizer to

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.590
fit on the device itself.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.440
So if you have a poor connection
or if you're

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.470
offline, you can still
type with your voice.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.430
Why don't we go to the device?

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.140
Let's show you that live.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.080
So Randall's going to put his
phone in airplane mode, and

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.930
he's going to use his voice
to write an email.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.210
Now watch what happens.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.880
And do listen carefully, because
this is one of the few

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.510
times when we let him speak.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.140
RANDALL: This is a
demonstration of

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.930
voice typing, period.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.850
Words appear even though
I don't have

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.100
a connection, period.

00:13:44.496 --> 00:13:44.988
HUGO BARRA: There you go.

00:13:44.988 --> 00:13:51.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.660
HUGO BARRA: All right.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.020
Let's go back to the slides.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.390
We're launching offline voice
typing initially for US

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.990
English, and we're
going to add more

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.500
languages pretty soon.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.820
Now, we also wanted to make sure
that Android works well

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.310
for everyone, particularly given
how quickly Android is

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.230
growing around the world, like
I showed you earlier.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.620
So in Jelly Bean-- if
we could go back a

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.870
couple slides, please.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.790
So in Jelly Bean, we've improved
support for Arabic

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.000
and Hebrew.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.750
We've added a new Arabic font
to the platform, and we're

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.910
also adding 18 new input
languages, including Persian,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.160
Hindi, and Thai.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.160
Let's go to the next
slide now.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.180
There you go.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.050
Making sure Android works for
everyone also means improving

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.320
accessibility.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.780
With Jelly Bean, we're
introducing gesture mode,

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.080
which enables blind users to
reliably navigate the UI using

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.820
touch and swipe gestures in

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.220
combination with speech output.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.050
It's really, really awesome.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:58.515
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:01.770
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.800
We've also added platform
support for external Braille

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.710
input and output devices
via Bluetooth.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.870
And if you want to learn more
about accessibility on an

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.540
Android, stop by the Sandbox
just outside to see some

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.260
awesome Android devices with
integrated Braille support.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.660
So that's accessibility.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.150
Now let's talk about camera.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.450
Well, Ice Cream Sandwich made
it possible to snap photos

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.080
really quickly.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.830
The Jelly Bean camera app makes
it possible to review

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.880
photos you've already
taken really,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.400
really quickly as well.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.050
Let's show that live.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.730
Let's go to the device.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.760
So Randall is snapping
some photos here.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.880
And you'll notice that there's
a new animation of the photo

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.250
flying out to the right.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.130
So that tells you with a simple
wipe, you can bring it

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.520
back into view and look at
the photo you just took.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.240
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.460
From here, you can tap and share
this photo, as you know,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.830
or you can keep swiping
to look at the

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.190
other photos you took.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.250
If you want to go through these
photos really quickly,

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.280
just pinch to go to
Film Strip view.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.460
And then you can scroll
much faster from here.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.900
And if you don't like a photo,
you can easily get rid of it

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.312
by just swiping it away.

00:16:24.312 --> 00:16:27.210
Pretty cool, right?

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.950
And if you delete a photo by
accident, you can always tap

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.490
Undo and bring it right back.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.320
So that's camera.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.570
Pretty cool.

00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:41.360
In Ice Cream Sandwich, we
introduced Android Beam, which

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.810
lets you share things like web
pages, contacts, maps, and so

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:51.370
on between devices using NFC by
just tapping them together.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.720
Today, more than a million
NFC-enabled Android devices

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.370
are shipping every
single week.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.350
And that number is
growing quickly.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.600
In Jelly Bean, we're introducing
two new Android

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.130
Beam features.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.960
First, you can send someone a
photo or video by just tapping

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.710
your phones together.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.640
And second, you can instantly
pair and connect your phone

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.180
with an NFC-enabled Bluetooth
device, like a speaker or a

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.780
headset, by just tapping
it with your phone.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.150
It takes one second.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.450
Absolutely brilliant.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:22.915
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:22.915 --> 00:17:23.380
HUGO BARRA: Let's keep going.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.630
Thank you.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:32.660
One of the signature features
of Android is notifications.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.400
Android notifications
are great.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.570
They show you what's important,
they never get in

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.800
your way, and they're accessible
from anywhere.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.960
In Jelly Bean, notifications
show you more information.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.980
They're actionable.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.480
They expand and collapse.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.250
They have full-bleed photos.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.240
They're beautiful, and
they're customizable.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.935
So you guys can build amazing
notifications into your apps.

00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:55.140
I really want to
show you this.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.390
Let's go to the device.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.860
So here at the top, there's a
missed call from Hiroshi.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.130
Rather than opening the phone
app and calling him back, you

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.890
can do that right from the
notification itself.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.890
Just tap on Call Back.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.186
It's really quick and easy.

00:18:11.186 --> 00:18:14.180
Now, if you leave the phone app
while you're in this call,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.870
when you're done, you can just
go back to Notifications and

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.670
hang up straight from there.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.820
It's awesome.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.320
Now the Gmail notification
moves up and

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.440
automatically expands.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.310
You no longer need to open the
Gmail app at all to see what's

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.480
going on in your inbox.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.490
It's all right there.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.730
Nothing important right now, so,
Randall, why don't we just

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.300
swipe that away?

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.720
Now here's a calendar
notification.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.950
And you can see that there's
a meeting here at 10:30.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.140
Now, if you're running late or
you can't make it to the

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.080
meeting, you can easily email
everyone in the meeting and

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.520
let them know.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.540
Just type in Email Guests.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.100
And because you'll usually be in
a rush when you do this, we

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.575
give you a set of canned
responses.

00:18:55.575 --> 00:18:58.240
You can choose any of these, or
of course, write your own.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.230
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.220
Let's go back to
Notifications.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.500
So we can see that Romain shared
a photo on Google+.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.140
Now you can actually see the
full-bleed photo right here in

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.200
Notifications.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.500
And you can +1 it or even
share it right into your

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.250
circles all without
opening the app.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.530
Here is a notification
from Foursquare.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.410
You can quickly like or
comment on a friend's

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.580
check-in, again, without
having to open the app.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.770
There's this TuneIn Radio.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.290
It's a great Android app for
listening to radio stations

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.640
from around the world.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.340
When I have a song playing and I
can see this beautiful album

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.880
art, I can control my music.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.700
And I can actually quickly
favorite a song from here

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.220
without opening the app.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.470
Now let me also show
you a quick trick.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.490
Notifications expand on their
own as they bubble up to the

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.630
top, as you've been
seeing so far.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.970
But you can also make them
expand or collapse whenever

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.220
you want with a simple
two-finger gesture.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.470
Watch this.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.080
In the expanded Pulse news
notification here, I can see

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.020
news stories complete with
photos and headlines.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.640
Really, really powerful stuff.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.150
So those are Jelly Bean
notifications.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.310
They expand, and they collapse
when you need them.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.630
They're actionable, and they
can show you a ton of new

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:25.890
information.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.400
And just like in Ice Cream
Sandwich, you can dismiss all

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.060
notifications at once
with one simple tap.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.620
Android makes your
life easier.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.550
Simple tasks should never
require complex procedures.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.950
Now let's talk about search.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.830
From the very beginning,
Android had

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.940
search at its core.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.420
With Jelly Bean, we took a
hard look at search and

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.530
redesigned it from
the ground up.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.730
First, a new UI.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.230
Second, faster and more
natural voice search.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:01.040
And third, a new feature we're
calling Google Now.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.920
Let's start with the new UI.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.720
Last month, we introduced
the knowledge

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.990
graph in Google search.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.570
The goal is for Google to
understand that the words you

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.260
use when you're searching are
not just words, but real

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.320
things in the real world.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.740
In Jelly Bean, we're using the
power of the knowledge graph

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.790
to show you search results
in a new, richer way.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.690
For example, if you want to
know what movies Angelina

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.750
Jolie has starred in, we'll
show this card.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.840
Or if you ask how much the Earth
weighs, you'll see an

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.760
answer like this.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.370
If you're searching for the
weather in New York, we'll

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.490
show you a card with the
weekly forecast.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.660
If you want to find a nearby
Starbucks, we'll show you a

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.050
card with a quick map of some
stores close to you and a

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.890
shortcut to take you
to Google Maps.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.900
Now let's show you what we've
done with Voice Search.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.480
Sometimes you'd rather just
speak your search query or ask

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.560
a question.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.050
In Jelly Bean, voice search
is much faster.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.140
It's also better at

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.940
understanding natural language.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.570
And it speaks answers back to
you using the power of the

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.500
knowledge graph.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.150
Let's go to the device and
show you this live.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.340
Randall, why don't you show
us a few more examples.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.920
You can talk.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.985
RANDALL: I'm gonna ask
a few questions,

00:22:10.985 --> 00:22:15.030
and Google will respond.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.070
Who is the prime minister
of Japan?

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.010
[ELECTRONIC BEEP]

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: The prime
minister of Japan

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.610
is Yoshihiko Noda.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.230
HUGO BARRA: Try a few more.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.620
RANDALL: We'll try
another one.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.940
What is the definition
of robot?

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.040
[ELECTRONIC BEEP]

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: Robot.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.230
A machine capable of carrying
out a complex series of

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.390
actions automatically.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:43.640
RANDALL: That's pretty
appropriate.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.690
Try another.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.652
How tall is the Space Needle?

00:22:54.652 --> 00:22:55.580
[ELECTRONIC BEEP]

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:05.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Space Needle
is 604 feet tall.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.620
RANDALL: We'll give
it one more try.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.180
Show me pictures of
pygmy marmosets.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:26.050
[ELECTRONIC BEEP]

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:26.820
HUGO BARRA: That's great.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.650
Now notice that if you go back
to the results, if you swipe

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.550
away that card, there's
a wealth of additional

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.290
information from the web on
pygmy marmosets, which, as I'm

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.070
sure you know, are the smallest
monkeys in the world.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.160
Google will always give you web
search results for all of

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.400
your questions.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:44.850
Thanks, Randall.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.279
Let's go back to slides.

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:48.235
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:48.235 --> 00:23:49.485
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:59.590
Now, the third part of the new
Android search experience is

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.650
called Google Now.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.810
Today's smartphones
are powerful.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.460
They can do pretty much
anything you ask.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.610
Search the web, give
you directions,

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.820
traffic info, anything.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.160
But smartphones are only as
smart as you tell them to be.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.330
They rely on you to
do everything.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.660
You have to enter a search
query, you have to type in a

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.620
street address, and you have
to ask for traffic in a

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.170
particular area.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.700
But with Google Now, that
starts to change.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.540
Google Now gets you just the
right information at just the

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.660
right time.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.260
And all of it happens
automatically.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.060
So how do we do this?

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.190
If you choose to, Google Now
uses things like your search

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.140
history, your location history,
and your calendar to

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.090
figure out what information
you might need and when.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.640
Let's see a few examples
on slides.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.840
Traffic.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.810
Google Now figures out
when you commute from

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.010
home to work and back.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.250
It'll then tell you how long
the commute on your usual

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.500
route is going to be.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.770
And it'll give you
a faster route if

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.220
there's a lot of traffic.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.270
Next, public transit.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.500
When you're near a bus stop or
on a platform at a subway

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.010
station, Google Now tells you
when the next bus or train

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.260
will arrive.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.730
Places.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.520
Google Now will show you bars,
restaurants, and places of

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.760
interest around you as you
walk down the street.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.620
And when you're in a restaurant
trying to figure

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.500
out what to order, Google Now
will tell you what that

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.430
restaurant is best known for.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.940
Next, appointment.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.260
When you have a calendar event,
Google Now will help

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.560
you get there on time.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.520
For example, if you normally
take the bus to get around,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.510
Google Now will tell you when
to leave based on how long

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.890
it'll take you to walk to the
bus stop, when the next bus

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.520
arrives, and how long that bus
ride will take, so you get

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.770
there on time.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.790
Flights.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.720
If you have an upcoming flight
that you've searched for,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.390
Google Now keeps you up
to date on the status.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.600
It tells you which terminal to
go to, and it updates you if

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.425
there's a delay, all
automatically.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:18.690
Sports.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.430
Google Now keeps you updated on
your favorite sports teams

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:22.710
in real time.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.060
You'll see scores and
upcoming games.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.210
And the best part is you
don't need to set up

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.350
your favorite teams.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.980
You've already done that by
searching for them on Google.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.310
Travel.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.180
Google Now knows when
you're traveling.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.290
And if you're traveling
internationally, Google Now

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.380
will give you interactive cards
for currency conversion

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.430
and translation.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.150
It also conveniently tells you
what time it is back home.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.420
And there's tons more.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.920
I'd like to welcome on
stage [? Barish ?]

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.340
[INAUDIBLE], Google Now
product manager.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.370
[? Barish ?] is going to show
you how Google Now helps him

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.250
navigate his day.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:00.510
[? Barish. ?]

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.910
[? BARISH: Thank you, ?]

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.160
Hugo.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.480
Hi, everyone.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.340
I'm really excited to show
you how Google Now

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.020
can work for me.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.460
So let's get started.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.140
The easiest way to get
to Google Now--

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.080
there are two ways.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.880
You can either tap on the Search
box, or you can simply

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.870
swipe up from the bottom
of the screen.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.510
And when you do that,
you see the familiar

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.890
Google search box.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.310
You also see a beautiful header
that changes based on

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.600
your time and location.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.740
You also see the Google
Now cards beneath it.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.190
So let's start with
the first one.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.620
Google Now is telling
me that I have a

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.890
meeting at 10:30 AM today.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.250
It's also telling me that this
meeting is 16 minutes away

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.100
from where I am.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.590
Google Now also notifies me when
it's time to leave, so

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.000
I'm not late for my meeting.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.110
Here, it tells me that I
need to leave by 10:14.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.130
Google Now knows that
I'm a Giants fan.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.540
And right now, it's telling me
that there's a Giants game

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.940
coming up in a few hours.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.410
And this card is going to keep
me updated with the scores,

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.790
and I know what's happening
in real time.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:17.050
If I wanted to, I can buy
tickets from here real easily.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.070
Let's think about when you
want to figure out a

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.030
place to get lunch.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.450
Google Now knows that I'm not
here too often, and I don't

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:25.700
know the area too well.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.990
So it's showing me a few places
nearby, including some

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.440
restaurants.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.750
Let's take a look.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.320
Zero Zero looks pretty good, so
I'm going to tap on it and

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.440
get more details.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.980
This takes me to Google Maps.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.630
And from here, I can get a
wealth of information.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:41.960
I could also book a
table if I wanted.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.330
Let's go back.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:51.070
And Google Now has also figured
out that I go to the

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.260
gym usually around lunch time.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.310
And it's telling me that the
gym is 29 minutes away.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.410
So I want to get a work
out, but I was

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.860
going to take a flight.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.040
And it looks like my
flight is delayed.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.810
So I have enough time
to actually go and

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.960
squeeze in a work out.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.050
Google Now is also telling me
that my flight is delayed, and

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.800
I'm only 19 minutes away
from the airport.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.260
It's also telling me that when
I get to the airport, I'm

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.070
going to go to terminal two.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.210
That's a quick demo
of what Google Now

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.860
can do for me today.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.670
Your cards will get
smarter and more

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.270
accurate as you use them.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.000
And we're just beginning.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.970
We'll be adding more
cards over time.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:30.702
Thank you.

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:34.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.770
HUGO BARRA: Thanks,
[? Barish. ?]

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.150
That was great.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.510
So that was an overview of
Jelly Bean for you guys.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.800
Project Butter, a bunch of
delightful improvements like

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.430
easier home screen organization,
offline voice

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:51.010
typing, a new camera app,
and awesome expandable

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.260
notifications.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.170
Lastly, you got a preview
of the new Google search

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.350
experience on Android.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.600
Can't wait for you guys
to actually try that.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.240
Now I'm sure you all want to
know when you can get your

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.070
hands on Jelly Bean.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.060
We're going to roll out over
the air updates to Galaxy

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.900
Nexus, Motorola Xoom, and Nexus
S and also release Jelly

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.052
Bean to open source starting
in mid-July.

00:30:16.052 --> 00:30:17.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:17.036 --> 00:30:18.286
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:30:21.956 --> 00:30:26.770
But we're making the SDK
available to you today as a

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:27.310
developer preview.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.090
You can download it right now
from developer.androi

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.340
d.com/jellybeans
dkdeveloperpreview.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.220
The SDK is built for you guys,
Android app developers.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.550
But as you know, chipset
vendors and device

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.100
manufacturers develop for
Android too, to bring us their

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.660
awesome hardware.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.580
So today, we're announcing the
Android Platform Development

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.650
Kit, or PDK for short, which
is like the SDK, but for

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.340
Android hardware developers.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.300
It contains the necessary source
code and low-level API

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.750
documentation required to port
Android to your hardware if

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.460
you are a hardware developer.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.350
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:16.660
PDK will be available to Android
device partners two to

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.260
three months before the platform
release date of all

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.028
future Android versions.

00:31:22.028 --> 00:31:22.476
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:22.476 --> 00:31:24.270
HUGO BARRA: Thanks.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.460
And we've actually started
with this release.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.430
A beta version of the Jelly
Bean PDK has already been

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.100
available to a few partners for
the last few weeks, and

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.360
they've been providing
us valuable feedback.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.210
We've incorporated that
feedback, and now it's

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.970
available to everyone
on an ongoing basis.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.050
PDK enables Android OEMs and
chipset makers to innovate in

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.160
parallel with Google and ensure
the latest Android

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.660
release can be well optimized
for their hardware.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.410
So that's what we're doing
on the platform side.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.210
To tell you about what we've
been doing on Google Play,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.990
here's Android engineering
director, Chris Yerga, fresh

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.240
out of the salon.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.250
CHRIS YERGA: Thank you, Hugo.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.000
Those hair jokes
never get old.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.500
So this past March, we announced
Google Play, your

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.580
digital entertainment
destination not just for apps

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.490
and games, but also for movies,
music, and books.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.260
Google Play is entirely
cloud-based, which means that

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.450
all of your content is
always available

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.640
across all of your devices.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.010
And Google Play is Android
apps, lots of apps.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:40.400
Today, there are more than
600,000 apps and games in

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.520
Google Play.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.560
And we're seeing more than
1.5 billion installs

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.830
every single month.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.270
And we've just reached a total
of 20 billion app installs

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.520
across Google Play.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:55.250
It's incredible.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.160
It's billion with a B. And
there's no way we could have

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.650
done that without the support
of everybody in this room.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.760
Developers are the lifeblood
of our ecosystem.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.120
So thanks for all your hard work
and support in achieving

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.370
this amazing milestone.

00:33:10.698 --> 00:33:13.860
Now, over the past year, we've
launched a number of features

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.530
to support you as developers
and help

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.970
you build your business.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.390
Android apps are available
in 190

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.660
countries across the globe.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.940
And paid apps are available
in 132 of those countries.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.490
You have flexible ways to
monetize your apps.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.870
You could use an ad-supported
model, paid applications, an

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.140
in-app billing, which you have
embraced very successfully.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.490
Just a year after the launch of
in-app billing, more than

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.880
50% of our apps revenue now
comes from in-app billing.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.070
And so we wanted to keep
that momentum going.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.650
With the recent launch of
subscription billing for

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.340
applications, we now enable you
even more ways to monetize

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.260
your Android apps
in Google Play.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.220
We're also giving users more
ways to pay for your apps.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.570
We've expanded carrier billing
to a dozen additional carriers

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.480
across five different
countries.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.070
And we're continuing
that momentum

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.030
by adding new partners.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.500
We've also given you insight
into your business with

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.900
additional metrics in the Google
Play Developer Console,

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.150
easier ways to distribute your
apps with APK expansion files,

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.909
and ways to connect with
users with the

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.850
ability to reply to reviews.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.739
And for aspiring new developers
out there, we've

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.770
launched Android Training, a
collection of free online

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.800
classes to help you learn
best practices.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.630
And today, we're announcing
several new features for

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.870
developers as part
of Google Play.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.870
So first, we know that you spend
a lot of time and money

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:36.754
writing great apps.

00:34:36.754 --> 00:34:39.270
And so we're constantly at
work trying to help you

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.120
protect your investments.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.830
We're introducing app encryption
in Jelly Bean.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.120
From Jelly Bean forward--

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.130
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:47.530
CHRIS YERGA: That's fine.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:48.179
You can love it.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:48.830
Come on.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:55.190
CHRIS YERGA: From Jelly Bean
forward, paid apps in Google

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.460
Play are encrypted with a
device-specific key both

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.170
before they're delivered
to the device and

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.900
stored on the device.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.920
We're also announcing
smart app updates.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.770
So today when you update an
app, your users have to

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.320
download the entire APK again.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.760
Clearly, this wastes bandwidth
and battery life, and we can

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.950
do better than that.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.910
With smart app updates, users
will only download the parts

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.960
of the APK that have changed.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.910
We looked at some of the most--

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:25.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.150
CHRIS YERGA: I've read through
this stuff so many times, I

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.070
don't know what parts are going
to be exciting to you.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.530
But the team is very excited
about this as well.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:36.890
And on average across the most
popular apps we looked at, a

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.880
smart APK update is
about a third the

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.930
size of a full update.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.990
So it's going to be much easier
for you to have your

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.660
users on the latest version.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.520
It's a win for carriers,
developers, and users.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.060
And the best news about
it is we handle it

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:50.940
automatically for you.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.130
You don't need to do anything.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.568
And it's supported on
Gingerbread and above.

00:35:54.568 --> 00:36:00.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.470
CHRIS YERGA: So for a couple
years now, we've offered

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.540
developers a service we call
Android Cloud To Device

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.300
Messaging, which lets you send
data to apps while they're

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.450
running in the background
without having to implement

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.390
your own sync solution.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:16.020
It's been amazingly successful
with the developer community.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.340
We deliver billions of C2DM
messages every single day.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.600
Now we're ready to take C2DM
to the next level.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.430
And we're announcing Google
Cloud Messaging, which adds

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.220
great new features like message
multicasting, message

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.690
payloads, and more.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.340
But I think the best feature--

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.480
hopefully, you all agree--

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.590
is that Google Cloud Messaging
is completely free for all

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.190
developers, and there are
no quota limitations.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:47.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.550
CHRIS YERGA: If you want to
learn more, we're going to

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.090
have a special session
on this tomorrow on

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.110
Google Cloud Messaging.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.630
I would urge you to attend.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.980
So lots of exciting developer
announcements.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.410
But Google Play is also about
great digital content, movies,

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.240
music, and books.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.080
Google Play has thousands
of movies to rent.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.600
You can watch new releases,
blockbuster films, and your

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.680
favorite classics on your
Android phone, tablet, or even

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.650
on the web.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:13.520
Google Play also has millions
of songs from your favorite

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.040
artists, whether it's an indie
band, rock legend, hip hop

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.350
stars, and everyone
in between.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.920
And you can also bring all the
songs you already own to

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.250
Google Play and store up to
20,000 of them for free in our

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.260
music library.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.100
So you could listen to them
anywhere as well.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.690
And finally, Google Play is also
the world's largest ebook

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.590
collection with more than 4
million titles available.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.030
And all of this content is
stored in the cloud, so it's

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.890
available whenever you want,
wherever you are.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:43.700
And today, we're bringing more
content to Google Play.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.990
It starts with movie
purchasing.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.010
Now along with rentals, your
favorite movies are available

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.020
for sale on Google Play, which
means that they'll be yours to

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.350
watch as many times
as you like.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.770
And we're also adding TV to
the video experience.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.560
You'll be able to purchase
episodes or entire seasons of

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.180
your favorite TV shows.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.290
It's perfect for when you have
a spare half hour, or you're

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:05.220
on the bus or something.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.690
And it really works well
with a mobile device.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.460
All of this is launching
today on Google Play.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.450
And we've partnered with some
of the biggest names in the

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.850
entertainment industry,
including Disney, ABC Studios,

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.356
NBC Universal, Sony Pictures,
and Paramount.

00:38:19.356 --> 00:38:27.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.030
CHRIS YERGA: Finally,
magazines are

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.960
coming to Google Play.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.210
We've partnered with top
magazine publishers, including

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.710
Hearst, Conde Nast, and
Meredith, so you can enjoy

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.400
hundreds of titles right from
your Android phone or tablet.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.590
This includes premium magazines,
like Esquire,

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.370
Wired, and Family Circle.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.370
Buy single issues
or subscription.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:49.560
And we offer 14-day free trials
on our most popular

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.330
magazines to encourage
you to try it out.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.640
We've got all this great content
on Google Play, music,

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.910
movies, books, and now TV
and magazines as well.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:02.630
You can enjoy it anywhere, on
your phone, on the web, or on

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.570
your tablet.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:09.900
And speaking of tablets,
I think Hugo has a

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.150
few words to share.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.410
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, Chris.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:24.340
Well, it's always been a goal
of the Nexus program to

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.130
provide you with the best of
Google experience, access to

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.790
the latest software coupled with
an Android experience the

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.330
way that Google envisions it.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.660
We wanted to take that model
one step further.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.230
We wanted to design a best of
Google experience that is

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.620
optimized around all this great
content available in

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.800
Google Play.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.630
We wanted a device that lets you
immerse yourself in all of

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.570
that media.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:48.770
We wanted you to be delighted
when you read books,

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:52.250
magazines, watch movies,
and play games.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:56.720
So we partnered with a great
company, ASUS, to help us

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.995
build just that device.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.190
And today, we're introducing
Nexus 7.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.380
It's a beautiful
7-inch tablet.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.450
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.190
It's built for Google Play.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.600
It's running Android
4.1 Jelly Bean.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.140
And here it is.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:30.830
Nexus 7.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:34.040
And by the way, we're really
pleased to have Jonney Shih,

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.920
the chairman of ASUS, here
in the audience today.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.360
Jonney, please stand up.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:50.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.690
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.410
So let me tell you a
bit about Nexus 7.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.970
It's super thin, light,
and portable.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:01.170
And yet, we've managed to pack
a lot into this device.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.840
First of all, the display.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.470
1280 by 800 HD display, which
is perfect for reading and

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.060
watching videos in
stunning clarity.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.370
Performance.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:16.092
Tegra 3 chipset with
a quad-core CPU.

00:41:16.092 --> 00:41:16.564
And--

00:41:16.564 --> 00:41:18.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.590
HUGO BARRA: Wait,
there's more.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.530
So Tegra 3 chipset with
a quad-core CPU

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.350
and a 12-core GPU.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:33.090
That's basically 16 cores,
which makes everything,

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:36.440
including games, extremely
fast and smooth.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.800
Front-facing camera,
perfect for Google+

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.980
Hangouts and video chatting.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.880
All the connectivity options
you'd expect, Wi-Fi,

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.140
Bluetooth, and NFC.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.720
Gyroscope and accelerometer,
essential for

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.225
high performance gaming.

00:41:50.225 --> 00:41:56.310
And battery, up to nine hours
of video playback and up to

00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:03.040
300 hours stand-by time.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.660
And best of all, it's only 340
grams, just about the weight

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.490
of an average paper book.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.670
It fits perfectly in one hand.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.680
You can put it in a
purse or a bag.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.810
It doesn't tip over when you're
reading or watching a

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.140
movie in bed.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.620
It just feels right.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.190
That's Nexus 7.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:29.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.960
HUGO BARRA: Music,
movies, books,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.520
magazines, apps, and games.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.010
All the great content from
Google Play right at your

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.000
fingertips.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.270
Now to show you Nexus 7 in
action, here's Chris Yerga

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.520
once again.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:50.850
CHRIS YERGA: Thanks, Hugo.

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.090
We designed the Nexus
7 experience with

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.350
three goals in mind.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.280
Create the best possible Google
Play experience, make

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.130
all your favorite Google apps
work beautifully, and support

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:03.030
the next generation
of apps and games.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:05.950
Nexus 7 is made for
Google Play.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:10.260
When you power it on, your
content is front and center.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.930
Right here on the home screen is
my library, containing the

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.000
content I've recently been
reading, listening to, or

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.540
watching on any of my devices.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.880
So earlier, I was reading The
Bourne Dominion on my phone.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.140
So we can tap on the cover
there and pick up exactly

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.670
where I left off on
that other device.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.940
Nexus 7 is an ideal device
for reading books.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.530
The form factor and the
weight are just right.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.300
It has the portability of
a paperback backed by a

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.390
cloud-powered personal
library of books.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:41.990
Now I'd like to show
you the magazine

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.970
experience on Nexus 7.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:46.950
Here's the new Google
Play magazines app.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.470
And just like your
coffee table, the

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:49.620
newest stuff is on top.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.410
You can swipe through and
find something that's

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.180
interesting to read.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.060
Why don't we go ahead and, uh--

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.310
Esquire.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:01.310
Once I bring it up, I can tap
on it and bring up a list of

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.890
page thumbnails on the bottom to
quickly swipe through, find

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.010
an article that I'm interested
in reading.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.860
So yeah, that one looks good.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.710
And once we open it up, you
look at the content.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.250
It just looks beautiful
on Nexus 7.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.260
But if I want to focus maybe on
something that's a little

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.270
bit more of a pure reading
experience, I can tap on the

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.480
View Text link and get the
contents of the article in a

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.450
form that's optimized
for that.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:25.960
Still looks beautiful
on Google Play.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.420
From here, I can also navigate,
and bring up a table

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.050
of contents, and quickly pull
up any other article.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:39.250
So now let's look at some
interactive features.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.690
So why don't we go to
Shape magazine.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:45.470
And here from the cover, since
this is an interactive title,

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:49.030
I can tap on any of the
interesting articles

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:51.472
there and get to a--

00:44:51.472 --> 00:44:54.020
I think he wants to work on his
abs, so he's going to pick

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.250
the flat abs.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:57.340
So we've gone beyond print
replica here and added

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.430
interactive elements to custom
fit the text to the device,

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.970
keeping everything readable
without impacting the design.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.870
Randall can drag up to expand
the content right here on the

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:10.040
page, and even tap on the link
to jump into an exercise

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.630
routine, and get further details
on those all-important

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.550
ab exercises that Randall
likes to do, all without

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.010
leaving the page.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.700
So that's our premium
magazine reading

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.644
experience on Google Play.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.450
Nexus 7 is also ideal for
watching movies and TV

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.330
wherever you are, long plane
rides, road trips with the

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.350
family, or just sitting at home,
watching on the sofa.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.070
So let's open the Google
Play movies and TV app.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.660
And here you see all
of your movies.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.260
We can swipe over
to see TV shows.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.020
And you can get to your personal
videos as well.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.870
So why don't we pick
something?

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.770
Astute observers will note
that I'm a Parks and

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:51.680
Recreation fan.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.870
So why don't we tap on Episode
1 there and start

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.578
watching some TV?

00:45:57.578 --> 00:45:58.522
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:00.180
-Who are the suits?

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.658
-They want me to
run for office.

00:46:02.658 --> 00:46:05.610
-Oh my god, Leslie, yay.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:06.594
-I know, right?

00:46:06.594 --> 00:46:07.086
Yay.

00:46:07.086 --> 00:46:07.578
-Yay.

00:46:07.578 --> 00:46:08.070
-Yay.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:08.766
-Yay.

00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:10.510
Wait, what does that mean
about you and Ben?

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:11.110
-I don't know.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:12.856
I think it's going
to be really bad.

00:46:12.856 --> 00:46:13.354
-Uh-oh.

00:46:13.354 --> 00:46:14.840
Do you want to go back
to saying, yay?

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.330
-Yes, please.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:15.777
-Yay.

00:46:15.777 --> 00:46:18.459
-Yay.

00:46:18.459 --> 00:46:18.910
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.310
CHRIS YERGA: Video looks
stunning on Nexus 7.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:22.820
You can see the individual
hairs on

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.070
Ron Swanson's mustache.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.380
So in here, you have access to
the movies and episodes you

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.940
purchased and links to the store
for other episodes of

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.330
the season.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:36.010
And you can, of course, also
download your TV shows for

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.850
offline use if you're going to
be somewhere without Wi-Fi,

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.190
like on a plane.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.960
So that's finding content
I already have.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.340
What about discovering
new content?

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.850
With Nexus 7, we're introducing
a powerful new

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.140
recommendations engine for
discovering content that's

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.950
relevant to you.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.070
We present this information on
beautiful and dynamic widgets

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.360
on your home screen.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.560
Here you can see that we've
set ours up for

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.050
recommendations for apps,
books, and movies.

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.300
But you can customize it to show
the content you're most

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.460
interested in.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.260
And if you don't like a
particular recommendation,

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.860
just dismiss it, and
you'll get another.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.370
These widgets are intelligent.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.580
And they'll get smarter
and more accurate the

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.710
more you use them.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:16.200
Now, sometimes new content
finds you.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.560
Maybe you hear a song you like
on the radio or TV, but you

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.080
don't exactly know what it is.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.820
We've added a "What's
this song?" widget.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.290
You just tap on it, and it
will identify the music

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.270
playing and give you a link
to the Play Store.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.520
So you can buy it instantly.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.690
So the device is beautiful,
but let's go back to the

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.940
slides for a second.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:44.830
Nexus 7 is the perfect device
to use all the Google

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.080
applications you already
know and love.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.340
Gmail on Nexus 7.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.590
It's a perfect size to read and
respond to your emails.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:52.380
Chrome.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.830
Your favorite websites look
beautiful on the HD display.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.420
And this is the first device
that's ships with Chrome as

00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.670
the standard browser.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.500
Let's go back to the device
and take a look at some of

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.930
those apps.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.310
Why don't we start
with YouTube?

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.940
So the new YouTube app has a
great tablet-optimized design.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.340
You got your channel feed
here on the left.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.700
And you can just swipe over.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.900
Why don't we pick something
here to watch and get some

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.150
video going?

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.800
You've got high-def YouTube
right in the

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.090
palm of your hand.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.110
It's the YouTube that you
already know and love, but

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.940
optimized for Nexus 7.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.190
Now in addition to exploring a
huge amount of videos online,

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.220
you can also explore the
world around you.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.290
So let's take a look
at Google Maps.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.600
Now, in Google Maps, you can
find your way around with the

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.800
features you are already
familiar with, like

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.910
turn-by-turn navigation, public
transit, live traffic

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:56.010
in Street View.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:59.950
But what about getting to know
a place before you get there?

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.190
I heard about a local bar called
District, so let's go

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.070
check it out.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.190
We can tap here and get all this
great information about

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:08.950
the restaurant, including
Zagat reviews

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:10.370
from Google+ Local.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:13.740
And I can also scroll down
and tap on See Inside.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.290
Once I do, I'm inside the bar.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.490
I've got this nice view.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.880
And for an even better
experience, I can turn on

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.770
Compass mode.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.210
So why don't you go ahead
and do that, Randall?

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:37.230
Now we've had this feature
for a little while.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.370
But what we've done in the
latest version is hook it up

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.330
to the gyroscope, which makes
it incredibly smooth, and

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:45.770
fast, and very responsive.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.510
It's just like being there.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:50.340
Now, as we announced, we're
also adding support for

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.650
offline maps, so you can save
the data for an entire city

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.280
locally on the device and be
able to use maps without a

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.080
data connection.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.330
Simply tap on the menu.

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:06.830
It's as easy as bringing up
the menu and tapping Make

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:07.670
Available Offline.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.770
And you're good to go.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.390
So those features are all in the
latest version of Google

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.690
Maps shipping with Nexus 7.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:18.320
Now I want to talk to you
about Google Currents.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.830
Currents brings you all the
great content that the web has

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.555
to offer in a mobile magazine
format that looks incredible

00:50:23.555 --> 00:50:25.440
on Nexus 7.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.520
My morning routine is, I open up
Currents first thing in the

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.290
morning every day to
check out the news.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.450
Subscribe to a number
of feeds.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:34.030
You have trending stories
here around the top.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:37.760
But why don't we tap into The
Daily Beast and take a look at

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.080
what articles are there?

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.200
So here we have a list
of recent articles.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.170
We can swipe through and read
in a reading mode that's

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:47.500
actually built on the same
technology that the magazines

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.300
web view is.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.760
So it has that same
beautiful look.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.510
And you can see the content here
is pulled straight from

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.270
the web and beautifully
formatted for Nexus 7.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:58.340
Now, behind all of this
great content is

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.000
the power of Google.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.410
So what we've done is
we baked Google

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.110
Translate right into Currents.

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:05.780
So we can go to the menu, and
I can translate everything

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.320
into another language.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.960
And within a few seconds
of doing that--

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.760
Randall, I believe,
picked Arabic.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.750
So we're going to see
this entire edition

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.000
translated into Arabic.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:27.720
Currents is another Google app
that works great on Nexus 7.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.740
With its quad-core CPU,
gyroscope, and accelerometer,

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:34.450
Nexus 7 is a serious
gaming device.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:36.940
We'll start with the
game Horn from

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.570
Phosphor Games in Chicago.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.670
Horn is an epic adventure, set
in a richly detailed world

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.390
with the kind of environment
never before

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:45.580
seen on a mobile device.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.320
You've got lens flares,
environmental effects, and

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.920
even individually rendered
leaves on the trees.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.900
So as Randall takes the express
elevator down here, we

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.660
can see that in addition
to the graphics looking

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:01.690
beautiful, the animation
is very fluid.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.460
And it just controls
beautifully.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.750
This is the kind of experience
that, until recently, you

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.260
would not have been able to
see anywhere out of a

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.900
dedicated gaming console.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.620
So Horn is really putting all
those 12 GPU cores to work.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.800
But of course, not everything
in Horn

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.645
is shiny and beautiful.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:35.790
Let's cut there.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:40.650
We don't want to ruin the
surprise, but it ends badly.

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:47.010
So going from alive to dead,
we're gonna take a look at

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.180
Dead Trigger from
Madfinger Games.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.710
They're a developer
located in Prague.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.350
Now, while for some games--

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:53.610
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:56.630
CHRIS YERGA: All right, got my
Pragues over here, nice--

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.470
guns and zombies would be enough
of a selling point.

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.500
But Dead Trigger uses the
computational power of the

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.010
Nexus 7 to create everything
from-- you see these water

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.070
droplets that are refracting
and going

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.690
down here on the lens.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.720
You've got realistic fogs
and, of course,

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.970
lots and lots of blood.

00:53:17.275 --> 00:53:19.630
He was supposed to do a head
shot there, and he did it.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.390
Give it up for Randall.

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.915
Nice job.

00:53:20.915 --> 00:53:29.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:34.020
CHRIS YERGA: Who says mobile
gaming has to be casual?

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.890
So now that you've seen
everything Nexus 7 can do,

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:39.950
Hugo, I think we all have one
remaining question, which is

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.930
how can I get one?

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:44.290
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, Chris.

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:45.540
That was awesome.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:54.960
So Nexus 7, built to bring you
the best of Google in a super

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.230
thin, light, and portable device
that's optimized for

00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:59.120
Google Play.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.465
It's a fantastic device that we
want to get into the hands

00:54:01.465 --> 00:54:03.260
of as many people as we can.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.070
That's why starting today, we're
making Nexus 7 available

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:10.460
starting at only $199.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:16.670
And when you buy your Nexus 7,
we'll also give you a $25

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:21.790
credit to spend in the Google
Play Store, as well as some

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:23.840
great content to build
out your library.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.350
You'll get the Transformers,
Dark of the Moon movie from

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:30.570
our friends at Paramount
Pictures, the book The Bourne

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.910
Dominion, and free magazine
issues of Popular Science,

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:37.540
Food Network, Conde Nast
Traveler, and others.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.970
Starting today, you can order
Nexus 7 directly from Google

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:43.710
Play with orders shipping
in mid-July.

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:47.350
It's available in the US,
Canada, the UK, and Australia,

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.600
with more countries to follow.

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:58.760
Now, Android was always
meant to go

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.970
beyond phones and tablets.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:05.490
Last year at I/O, we showed you
a sneak peak of a new kind

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:10.280
of Android media device which
we called Project Tungsten.

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.910
We've been really busy since
then, and now we want to show

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:14.490
you what we've created.

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:18.830
And to do that, please welcome
Joe Britt and Matt Hershenson.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.910
JOE BRITT: Thank you, Hugo.

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:36.840
You just saw an amazing tablet
for enjoying all your great

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.360
Google Play content, but
we want to go further.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.630
We're entering a new era in
consumer electronics where the

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:47.490
combination of hardware,
software, and the cloud is

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:50.910
opening up an entirely new
world of possibilities.

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:53.760
With Project Tungsten, we
brought together the power of

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.600
Android and Google Play to
develop the first consumer

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.350
electronics product Google has
ever designed and built from

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:01.710
the ground up.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.098
We call it Nexus Q.
Let's take a look.

00:56:05.098 --> 00:56:13.250
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:15.110
-I think most people have no
idea what it is when they

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:16.360
first look at it.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:22.915
-We're trying to create
something that is unexpected.

00:56:22.915 --> 00:56:23.945
-Powerful and--

00:56:23.945 --> 00:56:25.195
-Mysterious.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.310
-There was a point in time where
consumer electronics

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.160
were a physical thing, a
transistor radio, or a

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.355
cassette player, or a Walkman.

00:56:50.355 --> 00:56:53.740
And then the software element of
it became very important in

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.440
terms of the experience.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.170
And now I think we're entering
this era where consumer

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:00.080
electronics is the
hardware, and the

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.900
software, and the cloud.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.180
-Q is a small, Android-powered
computer, and it connects to

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.240
all of the media that you have
stored in the cloud.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.370
The fact that it was going to be
in your home meant that it

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:13.320
needed to be not only

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.557
functional, but also beautiful.

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:24.370
-Google products are used by
millions and millions of

00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:27.570
people every day on the
web and mobile side.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.220
How that translates into
physical products, it raises a

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.590
lot of interesting
opportunities.

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:35.834
-This is how you get the
software from the device to

00:57:35.834 --> 00:57:36.380
your phone.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.820
-Now that we're moving into
an era where devices are

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:42.060
controlled from your phone or
your tablet, we can allow

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:45.800
people to use their devices to
control their entertainment in

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.920
a very simple way.

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.190
-People's stereo systems, they
weren't very much revered.

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:52.100
But when you go around to
people's houses, you would

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.450
never touch them.

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:55.960
The idea here is that people can
be inquisitive, play with

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.210
it, but also start using
it interactively.

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:00.780
-And it's the sort of thing
that you think, why can't

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.870
everything do this?

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.810
Isn't this the right way
that music should be?

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:16.180
-This really is a third-wave of
consumer electronics, and

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.120
it's all about the cloud.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.000
Nexus Q is just the beginning.

00:58:25.158 --> 00:58:33.910
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:34.920
JOE BRITT: Thank you.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:38.610
We're really excited to unveil
Nexus Q. It's a small,

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:40.850
Android-powered computer
that's designed to

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.660
live in your home.

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:46.660
It plugs into the best speakers
and TV in your house,

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.950
and it's always connected
to the cloud.

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:52.360
Nexus Q tightly integrates with
Google Play, so you can

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.590
easily stream music and video.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:57.210
You use your Android phone or
tablet to control it, but

00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:58.750
you're not actually streaming
content from

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:00.170
your device to it.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:02.630
Instead, Nexus Q pulls
your content

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.590
directly from Google Play.

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:08.270
So in other words, you use
your phone or tablet to

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:10.430
control the cloud.

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:13.090
Now, before I show you how this
works, Matt's going to

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:15.490
tell you about all the design
and engineering that went into

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:17.380
creating Nexus Q.

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.620
MATT HERSHENSON: Thanks, Joe.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.760
When we started developing this
product, we wanted to

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.990
build something really
special, not just

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:24.510
another black box.

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:26.990
The industrial design
is totally unique.

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:29.230
And what we've managed to put
into this small sphere is

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.280
nothing short of incredible.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.950
The heart of Nexus Q is an OMAP
4460 which is the same

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:36.950
chip used in Galaxy Nexus.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:39.810
It also has a state of the
art, audiophile grade

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.180
amplifier built right in,
so you can hook your

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.020
speakers right up.

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:47.930
And at 25 watts, this small
sphere can really fill a room

00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:51.200
with beautiful, clear,
crisp sound.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.620
Of course, music and video
today are digital.

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:58.050
Some would say, analog outputs
are a little old-fashioned.

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:02.290
Nexus Q has optical digital
audio and micro-HDMI outputs,

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:05.850
so you can stream music and
1080p video to the best

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:09.570
speakers and the best
TV in your home.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:13.450
Nexus Q has dual band Wi-Fi and
ethernet, as well as NFC

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:16.530
and Bluetooth which lets you
set it up in a few minutes

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.200
right from your phone.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.580
There's also a micro USB port to
connect future accessories

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:26.371
and encourage general
hackability.

01:00:26.371 --> 01:00:32.030
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.410
MATT HERSHENSON: Always
popular and

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:34.910
always a great feature.

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:37.110
The hardware is pretty cool,
but what brings Nexus Q to

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.910
life is Android.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:42.270
Joe's gonna show us
what it can do.

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:44.740
JOE BRITT: Let's take a look
at Nexus Q in action.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:48.370
So Matt made me move my living
room to the stage here today.

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.250
And I'm going to start by
playing some music for you.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.770
So up here, let's go
to the device.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.940
And we can see that this is
Randall's device, and he's

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.600
gone into the Google
Play music app.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.320
Here we can see his entire
music collection.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.070
We can see his play lists.

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.980
As he scrolls around, we can
also see his artists, albums,

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.010
and so on, all stored
in the cloud.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:13.370
Now Randall is going to choose
a room to start playing music

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:17.680
in, and he's picking
the living room.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.600
Let's see what music he picks.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.070
And it looks like he
picked "The Need

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:23.990
Superficial" by Oddisee.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.180
You have very good
taste, Randall.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.080
And it's very appropriate
because building Q has been a

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.205
bit of an odyssey.

01:01:30.205 --> 01:01:31.455
[MUSIC - "THE NEED SUPERFICIAL"
BY ODDISEE]

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.190
JOE BRITT: It sounds
really good.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:43.750
And as you can hear, it
starts playing right

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.130
away from the cloud.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.380
[MUSIC - "THE NEED SUPERFICIAL"
BY ODDISEE]

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.890
JOE BRITT: Now, we wanted the
experience of listening to

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:55.790
music to be more than just
great quality sound.

01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:59.100
Part of what makes Nexus Q so
cool is that listening to

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.540
music can also be visual
and interactive.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.580
It lights up with a ring of
LEDs around the perimeter

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.740
which respond to the
music as it plays.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.310
And if you have it hooked up
to a TV, you'll see this

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.330
visualizer as well.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:14.180
If you have more than one Nexus
Q, you can play music

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.850
throughout your entire house.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.060
You just pick the rooms you
want, and it'll play your

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.660
music in sync.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.910
Now for example, Randall's
going to

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:25.230
show us how this works.

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.890
He's going to add the green room
Nexus Q, so the rest of

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:30.950
the team back there can enjoy
the music in perfect sync with

01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:34.030
the living room here on stage.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.630
Mobile devices have made music
more of a personal and

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:38.900
sometimes isolating
experience.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.890
But music is often best
enjoyed with friends.

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:44.810
That's why we made Nexus
Q the first ever

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:46.640
social streaming device.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.690
It's a cloud-connected jukebox
where everyone brings their

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:51.680
own music to the party.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.500
Your friends can just start
adding songs from their own

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.710
Google Play music libraries to
Nexus Q. Let me show you how

01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:58.700
this works.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.270
I'm going to ask Matt and my
friend, Chris, to help me out.

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.240
Where did Chris go?

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.400
Oh, here comes Chris.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.380
Chris, please come on over, and
have a seat on the sofa.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.460
So now Randall is going to start
playing another song

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.230
from his Nexus 7.

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.340
And once he does that, we
can see the music queue.

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:19.710
[MUSIC - "THE NEED SUPERFICIAL"
BY ODDISEE]

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:21.840
JOE BRITT: And-- oh, Randall
picked the same song.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.290
So we've already heard
this song.

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:27.900
So let's give somebody else
a chance to play the DJ.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.630
Matt, what would you
like to hear?

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.020
MATT HERSHENSON: Well, how
about this song "All the

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.840
Lights" by FAWN.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.840
It reminds me of those cool
lights on Nexus Q.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.760
JOE BRITT: Nice.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.490
And so Matt is going to
use his device to add

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:43.602
a song to the queue.

01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:46.970
And what we should see is that
song added to the queue.

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:47.730
And there it is.

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:48.810
Look.

01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:50.256
So how about another
one, Matt?

01:03:50.256 --> 01:03:52.240
MATT HERSHENSON: OK.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.540
Pretty cool.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.090
I'm gonna do some more.

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:58.370
How about this song "Dark
Star" by Polica?

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:03.520
JOE BRITT: That's a
really cool song.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.370
So you can see that the songs
Matt just added appeared right

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:09.030
in the queue on Randall's
device.

01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.470
So everybody who has a device
is able to see the queue of

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:13.070
music that's going
to be played.

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:14.390
Chris, what do you
have to add?

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:16.220
CHRIS: I think I'm going to
add this really great, new

JD McPherson.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:20.920
But I'm not interested in
waiting around, so I think I'm

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.905
just going to take right over.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.890
digital library with you.

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.630
And as a social streaming
device, Nexus Q lets anyone

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.620
connect and start playing
videos from

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.095
their phone right away.

01:05:15.095 --> 01:05:17.390
Have you guys seen any
movies lately?

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:19.690
MATT HERSHENSON: What do you
guys think about Transformers,

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:20.900
Dark of the Moon?

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.840
CHRIS: I hear it's
pretty good.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.180
But I always think, is there
more than meets the eye?

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.470
MATT HERSHENSON: (SINGING)
The robots in disguise.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:29.150
JOE BRITT: Do we have
that movie?

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:31.760
MATT HERSHENSON: I have it
in my library right here.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.230
JOE BRITT: OK, cool.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:33.260
Let's check it out.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:36.950
So Matt's going into Play
Movies and TV App

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:37.870
on his Nexus 7.

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:39.560
And all he has to do is
choose the living

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.260
room TV and hit Play.

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.040
MATT HERSHENSON: I
was watching it

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.450
at home last night.

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:46.520
I'm going to start it up here,
and it's going to pick up at

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.430
the very same spot where I left
off when I was playing it

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:51.518
at home last night.

01:05:51.518 --> 01:05:52.016
Check it out.

01:05:52.016 --> 01:06:06.960
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.690
CHRIS: I always liked
Bumblebee.

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.090
-Well, he's dead.

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.340
MATT HERSHENSON: It's awesome.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.810
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:14.060
JOE BRITT: OK, cool.

01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:22.320
So you just saw how easy it was
for Matt to play a movie

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.230
from his collection on my TV.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.200
No messy authentication or
configuration needed.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.690
It just works.

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:30.240
And remember, what's really
cool here is that Matt is

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.890
controlling what's happening
from his Android tablet, but

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.520
the movie is coming directly
from the cloud.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.830
Now, it's always fun to watch
YouTube videos with friends.

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:41.430
And Nexus Q works great
with YouTube.

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:44.100
Just like with music, you and
your friends can play your

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.140
favorite YouTube videos right
on Nexus Q. And again, the

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.200
content comes from the cloud.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.180
So Randall's going to go into
the YouTube app and search for

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.960
Android in space.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.380
Some of the guys on our team
worked with a student who had

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.190
a great idea to send an Android
figurine into space.

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:01.790
So let's take a look at that.

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:02.279
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:12.530
JOE BRITT: So that's
really cool.

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:14.080
But now let's take a look
at another video.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.020
Matt, what would you
like to see?

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.610
MATT HERSHENSON: There's this
is cool video of these guys

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:21.890
beatboxing on a Google+
Hangout on

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:23.870
their Galaxy Nexuses.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:24.410
Let's play that.

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.730
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:25.570
JOE BRITT: Cool.

[BEATBOXING]

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:42.280
JOE BRITT: So as you can see,
Matt was able to just take

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.396
over the TV straight
from YouTube.

01:07:44.396 --> 01:07:46.690
No more passing around
a keyboard or laptop.

01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:49.700
Everyone is in control.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.480
So that's Nexus Q.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.610
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.240
JOE BRITT: Amazing hardware
with an integrated app.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.520
It streams music, movies, and
TV from Google Play, as well

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.640
as YouTube.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.620
And what's really cool is that
it's the world's first ever

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.810
social streaming device.

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:05.410
Nexus Q will sell for $299.

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:07.430
It'll be available in
the US to start.

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:10.080
And you'll be able to purchase
it right from Google Play.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.450
You can place a pre-order
starting today, and we'll

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.620
begin shipping orders in July.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.350
Thanks, everyone.

01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:17.923
And here's Hugo to
wrap things up.

01:08:17.923 --> 01:08:23.330
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:25.010
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, guys.

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:26.899
That was pretty awesome.

01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:30.569
Well, we hope you guys liked
what you saw here today.

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:35.460
400 million Android devices,
Jelly Bean, Google Play, Nexus

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:38.670

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:42.970
Now, the Android ecosystem would
be nothing without our

01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:44.680
developer community.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.609
So I wanted to thank you guys
for your incredible support.

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:49.488
Thank you.

01:08:49.488 --> 01:08:56.180
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.640
HUGO BARRA: We hope you enjoy
the 26 dedicated Android

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.149
sessions plus all the Sandboxes
that we put together

01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:05.210
for you here at Google I/O.
There's a lot to see.

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:07.500
And look forward to seeing
you at the party tonight.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.750
Thank you.

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:15.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies
and gentlemen,

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:18.029
once again, Vic Gundotra.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.279
VIC GUNDOTRA: Hello
again, everybody.

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:26.210
It was exactly one year ago
today, and it was a day that I

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:28.270
don't think I'm ever
going to forget.

01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:32.670
You see, it was the eve before
we unveiled Google+, and I was

01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:33.990
pretty nervous.

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:38.810
After all, we had no idea how
people were going to react.

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:42.560
It's amazing that tomorrow
morning will be our one-year

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.000
anniversary.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.720
Thank you all for your
support for Google+.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:53.510
And because of your support, we
gain momentum every week.

01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:56.250
And we're just more than
a little bit excited.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:59.570
We really think we're onto
something special.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.820
To give you an example of what
that something is, let's go to

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.800
this video.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.150
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.280
-Everyone good to go?

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:05.770
-Good to go.

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:05.890
-I'm good.

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.730
-I'm gonna click on
Start Broadcast.

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:08.980
Hi, everybody.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:12.360
Once again, we're going to have
our virtual star party

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.710
working the telescopes today--

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:14.750
-I love science.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.660
I love communicating
and exploring

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.530
about space and astronomy.

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:20.780
So when Google+ came out, I
thought, wouldn't it be cool

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.500
if we could get a telescope
streaming an image right into

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.470
the Hangout?

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:28.770
-We've got Mike Phillips, and
he's in North Carolina.

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:30.300
We've got Gary Gonnella.

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.750
What's your view, Gary?

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:33.970
-The Monkey Heads in the
upper part of Orion.

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:35.940
-Before this was impossible.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.990
But now we're getting people
from Mexico, and South

01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:41.070
America, and South
Africa, Malaysia.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.950
We're starting to capture
the whole Earth.

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:46.015
Because suddenly, there is a way
we are able to bring all

01:10:46.015 --> 01:10:48.692
these people together
and put on a show.

01:10:48.692 --> 01:10:51.650
-Oh, too close.

01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:54.220
-I think everyone's
ready but Mike.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.600
Oh, I think I see something.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.460
Can you move it a little
down, Mike?

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.920
There it is.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.445
Oh, man, look at that.

01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:13.170
-Being able to look out into
space gives us context for how

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:16.300
we live in our day-to-day
experience.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:21.130
It shows us that we're part
of this bigger universe.

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:22.420
-Gary, you've got the
Rosette for me?

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:22.950
-I do.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.925
-I mean for us, I mean for
us, for everyone to see.

01:11:25.925 --> 01:11:26.570
Not just me.

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:27.470
-Don't kid us.

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:29.140
It's for you, Fraser.

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.050
-It's for me, yeah.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.680
-Now we have Saturn is green.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.748
You guys are just [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:35.748 --> 01:11:36.220
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.260
VIC GUNDOTRA: Sorry you missed
the first part of that video.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.610
But I think it got
the point across.

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:43.620
Because of people like Frank
and Pamela, we now have a

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.900
vibrant community of astronomers
on Google+.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.370
Yes, astronomers.

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:49.210
And you know what?

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:52.080
There are Frank and Pamelas
for all other kinds of

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.140
subjects too.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.520
From health, to knitting, to
sports, to photography, to

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.000
music, even nuclear physics.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.230
Yes, millions of people are
finding ways to connect with

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:04.630
each other, to share
their passions,

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:06.350
to find their community.

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:09.740
And they're doing
it on Google+.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:13.470
Now Google+ is at the heart of
our efforts to really create a

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:16.230
simpler, more intuitive
experience

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:18.420
for all Google users.

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.690
You should think of
it in two parts.

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:22.750
The first is our social
[? spine. ?]

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:26.290
Once you've logged in and
upgraded to Google+, we want

01:12:26.290 --> 01:12:29.340
to present you with one seamless
experience, not a

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:32.250
series of disconnected
products.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:38.460
So far, in just one year, over
250 million people have

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:42.520
upgraded to Google+, with 150
million of those being 30-day

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:49.170
actives, and 50% of that number
signing in every day.

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:53.750
Those daily active users spend
more than an hour with Google.

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.110
Now, the other part is our
social destination.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:58.150
Now that part is growing
quickly.

01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:01.360
And it really began with a
base of zero last year,

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.810
because we're building a
brand-new community.

01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:05.670
There, we're seeing
really impressive

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:08.100
engagement and fast growth.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.830
Active Google+ users are now
spending more than 12 minutes

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:13.710
a day in the stream.

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:17.590
That's up from 9 minutes
just a few months ago.

01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:20.780
Now you might be asking, well,
Vic, what comes next?

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.120
And the answer there
lies in mobile.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.420
The growth of smartphones
has been spectacular.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.600
It has been a sea change for our
industry, and the same is

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.430
true for Google+.

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:38.180
We now have more users engaging
with Google+ from

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.580
mobile than from desktop.

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:41.640
Let me repeat that.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.630
We had more people using
Google+ from

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:45.790
mobile than from desktop.

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:48.550
This is a significant
situation and one

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:50.290
we take very seriously.

01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:52.890
In fact, if you've been watching
us, over the past

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:56.530
several weeks, you've seen us
upgrade our mobile clients for

01:13:56.530 --> 01:14:00.400
iOS and for Android to
really great reviews.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.930
So thank you.

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:05.980
Yet we keep hearing the same
requests from users, which is,

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.830
hey, Vic, when are we going
to get a native

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:12.490
tablet version of Google+?

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.740
Well, your answer is you're
going to get it today.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.222
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:23.120
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now, I could spend
an hour talking to you

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.740
about this new application.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.140
I believe it's the
best version of

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.210
Google+ we've ever designed.

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:31.250
But my trusty friend, Matt, and
I instead are just going

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:32.945
to highlight a few
of the features.

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:39.930
If we switch over to demo--

01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:40.280
there we go.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.980
The first thing you'll notice is
a stream that's gorgeous, a

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.460
stream that's fast,
fluid, beautiful.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.080
Photos pop.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.620
Text is crisp.

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:52.610
Even actions like +1 and
Comments are not just

01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:55.420
prominent, they're playful.

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.920
We're also stylizing the stream
in such a way that it

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.390
makes it very easy to scan
while still highlighting

01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:02.490
what's important.

01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:06.700
So for example, photos,
text, videos all have

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:07.810
a distinctive look.

01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:09.880
So it's easy to know
what someone is

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.430
sharing at a glance.

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:15.180
At the same time, we look for
posts that are becoming very

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:17.260
popular with more engagement.

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:21.270
And we make them bigger, so they
help grab your attention.

01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:25.230
This stream just feels great
to use, and I can't wait to

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.010
get it into your hands.

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:29.480
Now the second thing I want to
show you is, of course, one of

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.220
the foundations of Google+
which is the Hangout

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.440
experience.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.330
And Hangouts, as you know, is
live, multi-user video.

01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:42.140
But on a tablet, it enables a
kind of intimacy that's not

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.840
possible on other devices.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.400
You can really just hold the
tablet in your hand, lean

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.400
back, and enjoy your friends'
and family's company.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.990
Now in this case, Matt
is inviting some

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:55.440
people to join him.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.500
On both screens here, you see
the invite experience or the

01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.570
ringing experience.

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:00.510
It's gorgeous.

01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:03.170
You can swipe to answer it just
like a call, or you can

01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:04.330
accept the Hangout.

01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:06.390
And now, of course, you could
see everyone in the Hangout.

01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:09.400
We've muted the audio so that
we don't get feedback.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.520
But you can see, it's typically
what you see in

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.460
Hangouts, people just
having fun.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.970
And of course, you
can pin videos.

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:19.570
You can swipe left and right
to see who's in the room.

01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:22.680
And my favorite feature,
Google+ Hangouts will

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.500
automatically switch video based
on whoever's talking to

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.400
really make it feel like
a live conversation.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.900
You can see they're having
lots and lots of fun.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.660
Now there's a lot more other
improvements in the app that

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.600
we just don't have time to
show you, things like

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.970
brand-new navigation, a new
ribbon bar, a new place to see

01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:47.290
notifications, brand-new
profiles that make it fun to

01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:49.310
explore other people's
content.

01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:51.310
It's just fantastic.

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:55.510
Now, if you're an iPad user,
we've got you covered too.

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:59.290
In fact, everything we've just
shown you is launching on the

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:01.600
iPad as well coming soon.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.930
Let's switch to the iPad.

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:05.440
And you'll note--

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.510
so I'll wait till you
get it up-- on

01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:07.920
the iPad, it's gorgeous.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.960
You get this beautiful stream.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.060
You get the same immersive
Hangouts.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.940
You get all the new navigation,
the new profiles.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:20.110
And it looks just gorgeous
on that retina display.

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:25.160
So that's the Google+ tablet
app rolling out for Android

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.400
today, available for
the iPad very soon.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.380
What do you think?

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:33.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:38.050
VIC GUNDOTRA: Well, although
we've just updated the Android

01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:41.380
smartphone app barely a month
ago, we have an additional

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.660
surprise for you.

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.820
All those improvements that you
just saw for tablets are

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:49.450
coming to the Android
smartphone

01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:51.230
today in Android Play.

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:52.590
It's also available
for your phone.

01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:53.840
So enjoy that.

01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.900
Now we have one more Google+
announcement today.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.730
And it goes back to really why
we started the project in the

01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:07.540
first place, to really bring
real-life sharing to software.

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:10.360
Think about the time that you
spend with the people that you

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.830
love, your family, your
best friends.

01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:16.690
Think about where you spend
that time with them.

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:18.420
It's likely at a barbecue, a

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:21.270
restaurant, a picnic, a wedding.

01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:25.350
The common theme here is that
these are all events.

01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:28.280
Events have a wonderful way
to bring people together.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.330
They allow you to create and
share cherished moments.

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:36.090
Yet unfortunately, the substance
of a real-world

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:38.920
event is lost online.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.110
Just consider the state of
today's online tools.

01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:45.530
Online event tools basically are
glorified web forums that

01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:47.450
ask you, are you going?

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:48.750
Yes or no.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.820
They kind of help you
manage who you're

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.460
inviting to the party.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.650
But what happens when
the party starts?

01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:56.760
Well, what about after
the party?

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.800
Today's online tools bail when
you need them the most.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.690
In life, we plan, we party,
we keep in touch.

01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:06.660
We think software should make
all of that more awesome

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.160
before, during, and
after your event.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.880
That's why today we're so
excited to be announcing

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.320
Google+ Events.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.730
Now, for the next few moments,
I'm going to show you how you

01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:23.970
can use Google+ Events
before, during, and

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:25.670
after your next party.

01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:27.550
Let's start off with before.

01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:31.350
Now, perhaps the most important
thing we do is

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.700
invite someone.

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:36.340
When you invite someone to your
home, or to a wedding, or

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.560
even to your favorite
restaurant, that's a deeply

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.080
intimate act.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.580
You're handpicking who's going
to be in the room.

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.110
So we think that who you're
inviting should

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.910
feel special too.

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:52.310
And so that's why we've designed
a product to offer

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:55.600
lots of ways to send absolutely
beautiful

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.130
invitations in something we
call cinemagraphic themes.

01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:00.720
I'll show you that
in a moment.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.150
We also understand that you
need to manage the entire

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:06.250
process, and we've built in
great management tools,

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:09.820
including deep integration
with Google Calendar.

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:11.430
Let's just show you.

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:16.130
Matt, here, is going to invite
some friends to a brunch.

01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:17.490
Wait till we switch to demo.

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.200
So Matt's going to
use the product.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.460
He is going to click on the
Calendar button there

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.600
in the Share box.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.180
And he's going to now start
inviting people to a brunch in

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:29.440
Half Moon Bay.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.200
It's a city about 30
miles from here.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.260
It happens to be his hometown.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.960
And he'll fill in some
basic information.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.000
Now he'll choose a theme.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.080
Now here's where it gets
really amazing.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:44.390
We have over two dozen of
these cinemagraphs,

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:47.070
beautifully animated themes.

01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:49.670
You may not be able to see the
subtle animation in the

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:52.010
audience, but some of these
are just amazing.

01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.745
Lights flicker.

01:20:52.745 --> 01:20:53.980
You can see the barbecue.

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.290
That's one of my favorites.

01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:58.770
And we really professionally
built some amazing ways to

01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:01.120
make your guests feel special.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.230
Now, since this is a beach
brunch, why don't you pick a

01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:05.400
beach theme?

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.760
And he'll go ahead
and set that.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.650
Now, finally, Matt will add
guests whether or not they're

01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:12.860
on Google+.

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:16.560
He just adds their emails, and
then he sends the invitation.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.940
Now let's see what it's like
to receive the invitation.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.460
In this case, we're
going to switch.

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.720
We're going to pretend to be
Lindsay, one of Matt's

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.340
imaginary friends.

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.810
Yes, he has lots of imaginary
friends still.

01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:32.870
Now, from Lindsay's viewpoint,
she gets this beautiful event

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:34.120
post in the stream.

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.380
And when she hovers over that,
it unfolds just like you might

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:41.460
with an invitation you
received in the mail.

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.420
Lindsay can check her schedule
right from the post with

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.950
Calendar integration.

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:47.860
And she can see that
she's free.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:50.270
And so she'll say, yes,
that she's going.

01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:52.730
Now if you jump over to
Lindsay's calendar, a

01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:56.420
brand-new feature in Google
Calendar, first, the social

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.380
event has been added.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.370
Matt's photo is in the corner.

01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:03.210
And if she clicks on that,
she gets that beautiful

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:05.140
cinemagraph integrated
right in.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:05.630
Isn't that awesome?

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:10.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.950
VIC GUNDOTRA: She can even see
the beautiful faces of her

01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:14.360
friends who are going.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.510
All of these small details, we
think, help set the mood for

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:20.960
your event, the right mood
right from the start.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.130
Now finally, we can
click through into

01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:25.380
the event page detail.

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:29.280
And there, once again, Lindsay
can pull down on the invite,

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.880
get that beautiful experience.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.180
She can see updates
from the host.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.320
She can see photos.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.490
She can see who else is going.

01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:39.830
Let's go back to slides.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:42.230
So we think that the combination
of cinemagraphs,

01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:44.960
Calendar integration, those
other things that we showed

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.300
you really make it both a
beautiful and a useful way for

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.570
you to manage your party.

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:52.190
But that's just before
the event.

01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:55.280
Now let's talk about
during the event.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.220
Now, it's no surprise that
during the event,

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.520
photos are a big deal.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:02.130
Just taking a photo causes
people to smile and laugh.

01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:05.310
They help us relive the
event when it's over.

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:07.740
But you know what
the problem is.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.590
Today, with the proliferation
of devices and smartphones,

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.000
everyone's photos get lost.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.160
They're with all the guests,
and they never,

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.550
ever come back together.

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:19.880
So no one can enjoy
them in one spot.

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:23.440
With Google+ Events, we have a
groundbreaking feature, my

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.940
favorite feature
of the product.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.760
And it's called Party Mode, and
it fixes those problems.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:32.090
Once you've enabled Party Mode
on your device, all new photos

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:35.680
automatically get added to
the event in real time.

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.190
As more and more guests turn
on Party Mode, all those

01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:41.410
photos instantly appear.

01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:43.970
In this way, Google+
Events gives your

01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:46.230
party a visual pulse.

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:49.260
We've even added a live slide
show that you can show during

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.720
the event to make it fun.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.450
Let's show you.

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.150
Let's go back to demo.

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:56.840
Matt's obviously in the mood.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.380
His brunch has already
started.

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:02.950
Now, because it's already
started, Android knows that

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:04.280
this is the correct time.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.630
And it sends him this
notification.

01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:11.290
Now, at Matt's discretion, he
can choose with one click to

01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:15.000
take that first photo and
turn on Party Mode.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:15.700
Go ahead, Matt.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:16.280
Take your picture.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.650
All right, very good.

01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:21.840
Now, if you note at the top,
the green icon stays there.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.790
So you always know when
Party Mode is on.

01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:28.210
And as guests turn this on, they
can control the settings

01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:29.630
right there in Notifications.

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:33.150
Let's go back to the Events
landing page.

01:24:33.150 --> 01:24:36.520
Now, on the Events landing page,
you get to see all the

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.030
photos stream in.

01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:40.740
People who are at the event who
are taking pictures, they

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:42.200
will just show up right here.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.730
I guess you can see the brunch
is going on over there.

01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:46.570
And they just stream
in real time.

01:24:46.570 --> 01:24:51.440
That's a lot of fun to just
watch as it happens.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.070
Now, in addition to having
this view, we built in

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:56.120
a slide show view.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.100
So, Matt, if you go to the top
there, it says, play the live

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.150
slide show.

01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:04.160
And if you click during the
event, we'll go to an

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.060
absolutely gorgeous full-screen
light box.

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:10.720
And your guests' photos will
appear instantly after they've

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.590
taken those pictures.

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:12.510
Isn't that just great?

01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:19.540
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.240
VIC GUNDOTRA: We've
talked about

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.080
before, during, and after.

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.310
Let's switch back to slides,
and let's talk

01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:25.580
about after the event.

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.600
After the event, what happens
when the guests go home?

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.830
Well, we reminisce about the
event, we might think of

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.990
something that was very special,
and we try to hold on

01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:39.160
to those memories.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.320
Because getting everyone's
photos and videos, we've given

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.280
up on that.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.560
Well, not anymore.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.360
As you saw with Party Mode,
Google+ will send emails to

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.140
all your guests and ask them to
upload photos they may have

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.550
taken from other DSLRs.

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:55.740
And then we'll do something
amazing.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:59.790
We'll put all of them in one
place in chronological order.

01:25:59.790 --> 01:26:00.750
Let me show you.

01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:03.820
Let's show what the Events
page looks like.

01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:06.170
Now, one of our teammates, Dave,
recently got married.

01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:09.070
And like any good engineer, he
decided to test Events at his

01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:10.290
own wedding.

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.470
Now what you're looking at
is really his wedding.

01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:13.970
So thank you, Dave,
for doing this.

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.020
Let's skip the top there
for a second, and

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:20.130
let's look at this.

01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:21.000
What you're seeing here--

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.350
Matt, if you just
scroll down--

01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:25.700
is literally all the photos from
all the guests who had

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.120
Party Mode turned on.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.540
And if Matt moves over any one
of those photos, in the bottom

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:35.240
right-hand corner, you can see
the pictures of the guests who

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.130
contributed that photograph.

01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:40.000
We automatically put them
in chronological order.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
So from the ceremony to the
reception, you can see the

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.250
event from different
perspectives.

01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:47.730
It's the first time you've been
able to go do this in a

01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:49.090
beautiful way.

01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:53.240
Now if you go all the way to the
top of the stream there,

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.380
we also do something else
that's pretty cool.

01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:59.490
We analyze all the photos, and
we look at the photos that got

01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:02.610
the most engagement, either
comments or +1.

01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:05.850
And there, at Events Highlights
at the top, we give

01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:07.170
you the most popular photos.

01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:09.880
So, Matt, if you click on that
top one, you can see that was

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.380
the photo that got the most
engagement from his wedding,

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.600
the most engagement
from his guests.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.360
Absolutely gorgeous.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.160
Now in addition, if there was
a photo of you and you are

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.700
tagged in a photo, your
photos would be there

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.030
right at the top.

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:26.250
Now, what if you have a friend
and you just want to see

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:27.660
photos that they took?

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.280
Well, you can see the different
photographers who

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.890
had Party Mode turned on
and who contributed.

01:27:32.890 --> 01:27:35.030
In this case, Matt clicked
on Denise.

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:37.300
And now he's seeing
all of the photos

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:40.790
coming just from Denise.

01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:45.200
When you consider what Google+
Events does for before,

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.110
during, and after an event, it
really speaks to what we're

01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:50.870
trying to do with
Google overall.

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:51.900
SERGEY BRIN: Hey, Vic.

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:52.670
VIC GUNDOTRA: Sergey.

01:27:52.670 --> 01:27:54.302
SERGEY BRIN: I've got a really
cool event for you.

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:55.264
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:55.264 --> 01:27:58.640
SERGEY BRIN: How you doing?

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:02.450
VIC GUNDOTRA: Guys, we're going
to do something pretty

01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:03.760
magical here.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.470
And we have a special
surprise for you.

01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:06.120
SERGEY BRIN: We've
got something

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.170
pretty special for you.

01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:09.260
It's a little bit
time-sensitive, so I apologize

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.120
for interrupting.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.600
We've seen some really
compelling demos here.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.840
They were slick, they
were robust.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.950
This is going to be
nothing like that.

01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:22.840
This can go wrong in about
500 different ways.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.160
So tell me now, who wants
to see a demo of Glass?

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:34.750
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:37.010
SERGEY BRIN: So we've been
really excited to test it for

01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.950
a few months.

01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:39.540
The unit I actually really
want to show

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.210
you, I lent to a friend.

01:28:42.210 --> 01:28:44.540
And he's going to be
here momentarily.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.820
My friend's JT.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:49.700
He does a lot of skiing, base
jumping, wingsuiting, all

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.340
sorts of crazy things.

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:53.370
And he's actually
pretty close by.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.700
He's just about a mile
overhead right

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.140
now with his buddies.

01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.850
They have a few Glass units.

01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:02.350
If you guys can maybe afford to
wait that couple minutes--

01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:03.751
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:05.001
SERGEY BRIN: --maybe they'll
bring them down.

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:14.300
We're about to get into a
Hangout here with JT.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:18.150
Hey, JT, JT, can you hear me?

01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:20.014
JT: Yes.

01:29:20.014 --> 01:29:21.820
SERGEY BRIN: Hello, hello.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.640
We might have a few
technical issues.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:29:24.170 --> 01:29:25.760
JT: Can you hear me?

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.260
SERGEY BRIN: Yeah, yeah.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:29.340
Hey, we're just down
here in Moscone.

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.020
I've got a few thousand
people here.

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:35.180
I was hoping to maybe get that
unit I lent you down here.

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.630
And I thought maybe you guys
could show us a fun time on

01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:39.910
the way down.

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:42.700
JT: Yeah, if you can hear
me down there, I've been

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.860
listening to your speech
through the Hangout.

01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.450
It's pretty cool.

01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:48.390
SERGEY BRIN: Cool, cool.

01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:50.760
I see you and friends are
[? plenty ?] close by there.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.580
Any chance we can get a little
view out the window?

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.555
JT: Heck, yeah.

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:56.190
Yeah, it's beautiful up here.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:58.984
We had a visual on Moscone
a minute ago.

01:29:58.984 --> 01:30:00.335
SERGEY BRIN: This is a
Hangout from Glass.

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:09.348
JT: I'm gonna come in a little
closer, and I think we're

01:30:09.348 --> 01:30:12.350
going to get you that device
pretty quickly actually.

01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:14.270
SERGEY BRIN: I see the roof
of Moscone there.

01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:18.070
So if you guys can be safe,
but get it down here in a

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:22.160
hurry for us, we'd love
to watch that.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.810
JT: OK, yeah, you'll
have to stand by.

01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:27.560
We've got our wingsuits, so
we've got a pretty good range.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.450
It's kind of interesting.

01:30:28.450 --> 01:30:32.200
People have watched us fly
many times before.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.870
But I don't think that the
world's ever tagged along live

01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:36.120
for a ride.

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.520
Nobody really knows the
outcome of this jump.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.870
We're feeling really
confident about it.

01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:43.220
How you feeling, Pete?

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:46.200
SERGEY BRIN: Well, we're
all rooting for you.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:46.810
What do you guys think?

01:30:46.810 --> 01:30:47.670
Should they go for it?

01:30:47.670 --> 01:30:48.662
[APPLAUSE]

01:30:48.662 --> 01:30:50.150
SERGEY BRIN: Oh, let's do it.

01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:52.630
JT: We're not in position
yet, huh, Julian?

01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:54.130
About one minute, Sergey.

01:30:54.130 --> 01:30:55.920
Maybe you've got to entertain
the crowd a little.

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.440
SERGEY BRIN: Well, let's
look at the view down.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.790
That looks like a
long way down.

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:06.060
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
turn it sideways.

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:06.865
JT: Oh yeah, there's
the ballpark.

01:31:06.865 --> 01:31:08.180
MALE SPEAKER: This is
good stuff here.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.932
JT: Yeah, Moscone Center.

01:31:09.932 --> 01:31:11.280
I've got a visual on you.

01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:18.860
SERGEY BRIN: So this is one of
the things as we've been

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:22.050
experimenting with Glass, just
the ability to really share.

01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:23.430
And we've posted
some pictures.

01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:26.090
But as we start to experiment,
being able to share what

01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:29.100
you're seeing live is
really amazing.

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.980
And we don't know what's
going to happen here.

01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.410
These guys are all
really good.

01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:34.390
They're trained.

01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:36.580
And I have great confidence.

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:42.312
But this is a demo that--

01:31:42.312 --> 01:31:42.780
all right.

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.540
Doors open.

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:44.790
Doors open.

01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:50.280
Happy flight.

01:31:53.005 --> 01:31:54.670
MALE SPEAKER: You know what?

01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:56.948
We can jump.

01:31:56.948 --> 01:31:57.896
MALE SPEAKER: Let's do it.

01:31:57.896 --> 01:32:00.152
JT: It's gonna be beautiful.

01:32:00.152 --> 01:32:03.606
Yeah, look at that.

01:32:03.606 --> 01:32:06.272
Hello, San Francisco.

SERGEY BRIN: I'm on pins

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:15.668
JT: Everybody's super happy?

01:32:15.668 --> 01:32:16.516
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:32:16.516 --> 01:32:17.766
MALE SPEAKER: Nice and
close in there.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.430
SERGEY BRIN: They've got to get
the right place, so they

01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:23.680
can hit the roof.

01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.780
I'm going to take a
few pictures to

01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:28.938
record this for posterity.

01:32:28.938 --> 01:32:30.890
And they're off, yeah.

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.070
And they're flying.

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.790
Look at that.

01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:41.070
Look at that.

01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:42.890
You can see Moscone

Live Hangout through
Google Glass.

01:32:49.472 --> 01:32:55.940
We've got four skydivers, and
they're under canopy.

01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:15.090
Vic, hey, look.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:16.710
This is a Hangout on Air.

[LAUGHTER]

01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:22.610
SERGEY BRIN: So it's a little
bit tricky landing on a

01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:24.380
building, as you
might imagine.

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.740
I don't know if you ever tried
this kind of thing before.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:31.680
But you can see all their
perspectives now.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.660
They're going to have to line
up one after another to get

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:35.910
down to the roof here.

01:33:40.170 --> 01:33:42.370
It's a pretty big roof actually,
which is great for

01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:43.620
their landing.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:49.090
And you can see there's a
little yellow arrow that

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:51.170
they're aiming for.

01:33:51.170 --> 01:33:53.630
It's pretty exciting.

01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:55.245
Hopefully, they land it.

01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:03.930
And they're coming in.

01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:05.180
First one's coming in.

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.970
All right.

01:34:08.970 --> 01:34:30.130
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:33.170
SERGEY BRIN: So how
you, folks?

01:34:33.170 --> 01:34:34.420
Thank you.

01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:37.940
So the roof is a little
bit big there.

01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:41.610
So it would take a while to
run down the length of it.

01:34:41.610 --> 01:34:44.220
So we got actually a few bikers
up there for this

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.420
eventuality.

01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.260
We got them wearing Glass too.

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:50.545
And there's our little
package.

01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:56.136
Let's see if we can get
it here in a hurry.

01:34:56.136 --> 01:34:56.530
Here we go.

01:35:00.826 --> 01:35:02.076
Yeah, whoo hoo.

01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:06.060
Here they come down.

01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:16.455
And there's only one good way
down the side of a building.

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.063
It's pretty high up there
if you haven't

01:35:24.063 --> 01:35:25.690
been up there before.

01:35:25.690 --> 01:35:26.740
Don't try this at home, kids.

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:28.210
These are trained
professionals.

01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:31.544
MALE SPEAKER: All right, now
we gotta get down there.

01:35:31.544 --> 01:35:34.540
Want to unplug me?

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.525
SERGEY BRIN: Here
they're going.

01:35:36.525 --> 01:35:37.400
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.248
Wait, wait.

01:35:38.248 --> 01:35:39.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:35:39.622 --> 01:35:40.970
No, no, no, we're
on the third--

01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:43.630
OK.

01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:45.790
Close call.

01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:48.500
Sorry about that.

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.620
So this is pretty wild.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:54.495
I've never seen that
perspective before.

01:35:57.770 --> 01:36:01.640
And I'm really looking
forward to this.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.660
We got a couple more bikes.

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.790
It's a little bit
of a long way.

01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:05.040
I apologize.

01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:11.624
Don't run anybody over.

01:36:11.624 --> 01:36:12.874
Oh, oh.

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:20.130
All right.

01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:21.540
Please stay in your
seats, folks.

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.880
Don't get into the aisles.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.060
Please keep the aisles clear.

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.310
Here they come up.

01:36:30.364 --> 01:36:31.614
Yeah, whoo hoo.

01:36:34.738 --> 01:36:36.682
Yeah, that was awesome, man.

01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:42.840
That was pretty amazing.

01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:49.260

for our bikers.

little picture of you there

01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:02.580
with my Glass.

01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:03.830
Thank you, guys.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.673
Some of our athletes who are
performers, I just wanted to

01:37:08.673 --> 01:37:10.000
give them another big
round of applause.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.960
We've got the rappelers
in the back.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.210
Let's sign them up.

01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:29.400
And the skydivers should be
chasing close behind them.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.620
Thank you, guys, so much.

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.870
That was amazing.

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:45.670
Thanks, guys.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.300
Well, come on up, guys.

01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:55.820
You're already here.

01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:56.020
Come on up.

01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.270
Take a bow.

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:05.930
These are the rappelers, all the
bikers you saw up there.

01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:08.166
And there's the skydiving crew
coming down the aisle.

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.455
Hey, JT.

01:38:23.455 --> 01:38:23.920

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.586
SERGEY BRIN: That was amazing.

01:38:25.586 --> 01:38:27.030
Hey, thank you, guys.

01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:28.170
We were worried about you.

01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:28.990
That was awesome.

01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:31.160
Thank you all so much.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.390
Now maybe we should tell you
a little bit about Glass.

01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:35.500
All right, guys, have fun.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.270
You can meet them.

01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:38.590
They'll be out and around if
you want to chat with them.

01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:39.300
Thank you so much.

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:42.230
Now here's what--

01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:46.350
no, no, this is the wrong one.

01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:48.960
Wait.

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.350
We're gonna have to--

01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:51.360
I think we're going to
have to do it again.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.070
JT: I'd be happy to.

01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.400
SERGEY BRIN: All right.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:53.910
We'll find a time.

01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:55.380
We actually might find a time.

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.170
If you want to see behind the
scenes and maybe catch some of

01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:03.060
that activity through Hangout,
tune in tomorrow.

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:06.450
But now I just want to tell you
a bit about how we made

01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:09.550
that happen and why we're
so excited about Glass.

01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:11.480
And to tell you that, I have
Babak and Isabelle.

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.914
Please welcome them aboard.

01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:24.360
BABAK PARVIZ: Good morning.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.900
So what can I say?

01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:28.730
Awesome.

01:39:28.730 --> 01:39:31.410
I wanted to take a minute and
tell you what was the device

01:39:31.410 --> 01:39:33.330
that enabled this beautiful
demonstration

01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.860
that we just saw.

01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:38.250
The devices that we used were
Google Glass prototypes, and

01:39:38.250 --> 01:39:39.865
quite similar, actually,
to what I'm

01:39:39.865 --> 01:39:43.520
wearing at the moment.

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.080
This device includes--

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:48.320
which by the way, is not that
that you see behind me,

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.050
slightly different--

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:53.980
has a display, so I can see
visual information right now,

01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:55.730
images, video.

01:39:55.730 --> 01:39:59.260
It has a camera to capture
picture and video.

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:02.610
So it has a pretty powerful
processor to process

01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:06.140
information and a lot of memory
to store information.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:09.050
In order to interact with this
device, you have a touch pad

01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:10.310
on the side.

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.390
You also have a little
button here.

01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:13.310
So I'd like to take a picture
of you right now,

01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:16.370
which I just did.

01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:20.900
We have microphones, so we can
collect audio information.

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:23.600
We also have a small speaker,
so I can receive audio

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.760
information.

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.250
The device also has a
number of sensors.

01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:31.170
So we have gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and a compass.

01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:34.880
So it's aware of its location
with respect to my body and is

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:41.740
also aware of its location in
the broader physical world.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:44.450
And lastly and very importantly,
it has multiple

01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:46.750
radios for data communication.

01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:49.200
To give you a bit about the
history of our group, we

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.560
started about two, two and a
half years ago to incorporate

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.810
this much technology into a
very small form factor.

01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:58.030
And the picture that you see
behind me, this is a good

01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:00.530
friend of mine, one of the
pioneers of wearable computing

01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:02.040
and one of our team members.

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.190
This is Thad Starner.

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:05.065
We had to hack things
together--

01:41:05.065 --> 01:41:08.010
we're sort of a hacky,
informal group--

01:41:08.010 --> 01:41:10.690
to get the technology on
people's bodies to make it

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.410
wearable and test
out the ideas.

01:41:13.410 --> 01:41:16.130
So we started from this point
two, two and a half years ago.

01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:19.040
And through a lot of hard
work by our team, and

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.460
experimentation, we made
progress and reduced the form

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:26.170
factor to what you see here.

01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:29.670
Now I would like to invite the
lead designer, Isabelle, to

01:41:29.670 --> 01:41:32.230
talk about some of the design
philosophy that has gone into

01:41:32.230 --> 01:41:33.690
this device.

01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:34.940
ISABELLE OLSSON: Thank you.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:46.490
So we created Glass so that
you can interact with the

01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:49.220
virtual world without
distracting you

01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:51.320
from the real world.

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:55.050
And one clear example of this is
that we decided to actually

01:41:55.050 --> 01:41:58.190
position the display
above your eye.

01:41:58.190 --> 01:42:01.540
And Glass as a whole is designed
to be close to your

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.840
senses, but not blocking them.

01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:13.860
And this picture shows so
clearly how we don't want

01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:16.460
technology to get in the way.

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:19.670
The baby looks into
the Mom's eyes.

01:42:19.670 --> 01:42:21.090
They connect.

01:42:21.090 --> 01:42:24.410
And while doing that, she can
capture this beautiful moment

01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:25.660
without any distractions.

01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:33.530
And whether it's with family or
friends, we want to empower

01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:38.760
people to use technology
naturally, like in this moment

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.010
of celebration.

01:42:45.630 --> 01:42:50.480
So we wanted to pack all this
amazing technology into this

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.600
product to let you do amazing
things with it.

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:58.110
But that's also a slight
conflict, through that if this

01:42:58.110 --> 01:43:03.920
is not ridiculously light, it
doesn't belong on your face.

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.790
And we didn't only want to make
it physically light, but

01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:09.920
also visually light.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.360
We don't want to compete too
much with the user's own

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:15.490
individuality, so no superfluous
detailing.

01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:20.230
And we really tried to reduce
it to its core essence.

01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:24.740
And one of the results of this
is that our latest prototype

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:27.560
weighs less on your nose
than many sunglasses.

01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:44.680
So when it really dawned on me
that we were onto something

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.280
was when I started seeing people
in our team posting

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.150
pictures on Google+ while
running with it.

01:43:56.950 --> 01:44:02.910
And if it's not super
comfortable and super sturdy,

01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:05.530
how would you be able to show
off your serve like this?

01:44:05.530 --> 01:44:07.090
This is Max on our team.

01:44:07.090 --> 01:44:08.455
He wanted to brag
a little bit.

01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:16.440
But sometimes you want to do
less conventional sports, like

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.787
jumping into ball pits.

01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:32.100
So we want Glass to work for
many people and most

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:34.160
situations.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:40.160
And realizing that, we needed
to create a scalable design.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.550
We decided to put all the
components off to one side,

01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:48.160
creating an asymmetrical design,
but that's balanced.

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:51.090
And what this allows us to do
is to design different form

01:44:51.090 --> 01:44:53.170
factors for the frames.

01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:55.570
And this is something we're
experimenting a lot with.

01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:59.070
And here you can see Mike, Liza,
and Maddie wearing their

01:44:59.070 --> 01:45:02.450
favorite styles.

01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:06.650
BABAK PARVIZ: So we have this
incredibly powerful platform,

01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:10.430
lots of capability integrated
into a very small

01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:11.830
form factor, wearable.

01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:14.220
And you might be wondering, what
is the impetus for our

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:17.560
team to embark on this journey
to build this system?

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.800
And what are the uses that
we envision for this?

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.730
What's the reason for people
actually to put

01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:23.510
this on their head?

01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:29.790
Broadly speaking, we have two
broad regions of aspiration.

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:33.800
The first one has to do with
communicating through images.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.270
And the second one with very
rapid access to information.

01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:40.260
If you think about actually
how we connect to people

01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:42.100
today, we might have
a conversation

01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:42.920
or we may call them.

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.840
So there's an audio way of
connecting to others.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.430
We may send them an SMS.

01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:49.450
We may send them an email.

01:45:49.450 --> 01:45:50.320
We may send them a letter.

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.080
So we use letters of alphabet
or writing to convey our

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.290
emotions to other people of
how we feel at that very

01:45:56.290 --> 01:45:58.640
moment or at any given
point in time.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.330
And we believe, actually,
communication with images and

01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:05.680
access to devices that empower
people to communicate with

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.940
images in new ways are truly
revolutionary and may actually

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:14.370
enable people to connect
in new and

01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:16.190
potentially better ways.

01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:20.660
Now, wearing a glass has certain
unique aspects to it.

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:24.260
For example, when you have a
companion camera that's always

01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:27.000
with you, you can catch fleeting
moments in your life

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.760
that otherwise would
be always lost.

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:30.950
So this is an example
of a group member

01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:33.140
walking on the beach.

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:34.690
I'm sure many of you
in the audience

01:46:34.690 --> 01:46:36.750
like myself are parents.

01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:40.720
And many, many times, you've
asked and wished that, oh, I

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.240
wish I had a camera with me
right now to capture this

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:44.960
unique moment with my family.

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.230
When you have Glass, you can
actually capture those moments

01:46:49.230 --> 01:46:52.460
and have those memories forever
recorded for you.

01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:55.440
This is pretty important,
actually, when we

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:58.250
enable such a thing.

01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:01.050
Another unique aspect of Glass
is that this is genuinely the

01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:05.550
first-person point of view
through your eyes

01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:06.500
as you see the world.

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:10.060
This is one of our team members
finishing a race.

01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:14.160
And you can see actually how it
felt at that very moment,

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:16.860
basically going through
a very long run.

01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:20.970
Or you might have a moment of
respite, and this is how the

01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:25.830
world looked to you as you were
enjoying a few seconds of

01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:30.400
break through your busy day.

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.990
And going back to the theme of
family, you can actually

01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:37.820
record how your life looked
like with your loved ones

01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:41.270
through the first person
point of view.

01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:42.830
Quite important, I think,
and it could

01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:45.770
be very, very powerful.

01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:48.170
And honestly, there are some
moments that you may not want

01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:50.050
to record forever, but
sometimes it happens.

01:47:50.050 --> 01:47:51.440
So this is--

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:52.500
oh, yeah.

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:53.140
This is Will.

01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:54.010
He's sitting right here.

01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:56.170
He's one of our team members,
and he's just practicing pool.

01:47:56.170 --> 01:48:00.260
So these things can
also happen.

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:03.100
ISABELLE OLSSON: So you've seen
all these unique moments

01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:06.560
that our team members have
captured just using the device

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.710
for a couple of months.

01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:13.280
So all this footage is from our
team using Glass, which is

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.580
pretty incredible.

01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:20.140
But what really excites me about
this is not only the

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.590
unique perspective from your
point of view, but how easy

01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:26.450
and seamless it is to share.

01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:29.170
And I think this encouraged
people to do

01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:32.030
new things with it.

01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:34.740
We just saw how it is to
jump out of a plane.

01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:37.730
And you can experience these
moments where you feel like

01:48:37.730 --> 01:48:38.310
you're there.

01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:40.120
And you don't actually
even need a Glass

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.660
device to do that.

01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:48.060
So here is, for example,
learning new things.

01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:53.030
This is Beau going through, step
by step, how to create

01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:56.390
very tasty dumplings.

01:48:56.390 --> 01:49:00.660
And I think there is something
really powerful about this.

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:10.210
And sometimes it's all about
feeling like you're there.

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:13.110
This stream of pictures
showed up.

01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:16.180
And I was sitting at my desk,
a little bit bored,

01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:17.190
and this comes up.

01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:21.150
And I had this visceral reaction
that I got so much

01:49:21.150 --> 01:49:22.180
anxiety all of a sudden.

01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:26.030
I could totally relate to
Stephen sitting in this chair.

01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:27.770
And these pictures continuously

01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:29.300
showed up in real time.

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:33.260
And I was also able to write
little comments and say, dude,

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:34.650
it's all going to be OK.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:44.270
And sometimes it's not
about grand things.

01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:49.740
Sometimes it's only about
communicating an emotion or in

01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.120
a situation.

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.610
And this is Mike walking on
the street in New York and

01:49:56.610 --> 01:49:59.045
looking for some empathy from
his friends in California.

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.960
BABAK PARVIZ: So the second main
aspiration that we have

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.060
for Glass is to enable
people to access

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.435
information very quickly.

01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:19.980
Nowadays, if you're looking for
answers to your questions,

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.110
you may do a variety
of things.

01:50:21.110 --> 01:50:24.280
You may seek a friend and
ask them, what is the

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.360
answer to my question?

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.270
You may go to the library
and go through books.

01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:31.220
But more likely than not, you
will reach to your pocket,

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:33.360
take out the cell phone, unlock
it, and do a search.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.700
And you get some amazing
results back, actually.

01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:39.250
We saw some incredible
technology just now

01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:41.030
demonstrated by Android.

01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:43.500
And what we aspire to
do is to make that

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.190
even much, much faster.

01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:49.990
And some day, we would like to
make this so fast that you

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:53.360
don't feel that you have a
question, you have to go seek

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.820
the knowledge somewhere, bring
it back, and analyze it.

01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.920
We would like it to be so
fast that you feel you

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.790
know it that fast.

01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:02.620
And that day may not be today.

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:04.300
That day may not be tomorrow.

01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:06.330
But at least that's
our aspiration.

01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:09.570
And we would like to be able
to empower people to access

01:51:09.570 --> 01:51:12.490
information very,
very quickly.

01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:16.800
And in practice, basically, they
feel more knowledgeable

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.910
about certain topics.

01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:22.810
Now, there are different types
of information that you might

01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:25.090
have in front of you.

01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:27.710
So for example, you could
be in a place.

01:51:27.710 --> 01:51:29.920
You would like to have
information about this place

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.850
without disconnecting from your
physical environment.

01:51:32.850 --> 01:51:34.970
You might also want
to know how to

01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:37.200
navigate to the next place.

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:39.260
There's a lot of interesting
information

01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.170
actually in this scene.

01:51:41.170 --> 01:51:43.050
Or you may be biking,
and you want to know

01:51:43.050 --> 01:51:43.980
how fast you're going.

01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:46.160
Obviously, you don't want to
disengage from the physical

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:48.560
world, go to the computing
world, and come back.

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.950
You want to remain engaged with
the physical world in a

01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:54.760
very unhindered way and still
get the information that you

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.660
would like to have.

01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:00.280
Another thing that may come
up is that you may face an

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.680
entirely new and unexpected
situation.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:05.300
This is a picture from a friend
of mine, [INAUDIBLE].

01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:08.200
He's a team member, and he was
sent to the market by his wife

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.140
to do some shopping.

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:12.720
And you just are baffled
at what you're seeing.

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.050
And you would like to have
information right at that very

01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:17.465
moment in front of you without
disengaging from

01:52:17.465 --> 01:52:18.930
the physical world.

01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:21.320
So we are very excited about
this possibility.

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.930
And I am particularly excited
to present this to you.

01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:28.680
Because the crowd here, the
people who are watching are

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:31.540
some of the smartest developers
in the world.

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:34.290
And I think you would actually,
hopefully, help us

01:52:34.290 --> 01:52:37.400
to figure out what kind of
information we should bring

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:40.230
here and put in front
of people's eyes.

01:52:40.230 --> 01:52:44.930
The possibilities are
just incredible.

01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:48.000
ISABELLE OLSSON: So we shared
a little bit about our

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.570
perceptive on Glass, and from
our team, and pictures, and

01:52:51.570 --> 01:52:57.030
videos, and also some of the
incredible things you can do.

01:52:57.030 --> 01:53:03.925
But what really sums it up
for me is this video.

01:53:03.925 --> 01:53:05.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:07.210
-This is baby June.

01:53:07.210 --> 01:53:08.400
Our family is in France.

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:11.340
So for us, it's really important
to show them how

01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:14.690
she's growing, how
she's changing.

01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:18.190
With babies, it's really hard
to grab the right moments.

01:53:18.190 --> 01:53:21.500
A smile just lasts for a few
seconds, and that's all.

01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.980
When you use a big camera,
she gets really

01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:25.570
focused on the camera.

01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:30.280
She's smiles at faces,
not at devices.

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.710
Every day, we try to go
out for a little walk.

01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:34.660
June really loves being
in the stroller.

01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:36.270
Everything is new for her.

01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:39.010
So we really like to take
funny pictures of her.

01:53:39.010 --> 01:53:41.390
I think she enjoyed it.

01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:43.090
-Hey, salud.

01:53:43.090 --> 01:53:44.000
-Bon jour, [? uncle. ?]

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.315
How are you?

01:53:44.315 --> 01:53:46.106
-I'm good, but I
miss you guys.

01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:50.765
-We have these little American
glasses that

01:53:50.765 --> 01:53:52.612
she likes to wear.

01:53:52.612 --> 01:53:55.490
It's kind of amazing for us
French to have this little

01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:57.210
American girl at home.

01:53:57.210 --> 01:53:58.366
-Au revoir, [INAUDIBLE].

01:53:58.366 --> 01:53:58.862
[BABY CRYING]

01:53:58.862 --> 01:54:00.112
-Oh, no.

01:54:04.814 --> 01:54:11.680
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.890
SERGEY BRIN: Thank you,
guys, very much.

01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:17.840
And I'm so jazzed that that
actually worked, the whole

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:20.120
bit, [? the air ?] ship,
everything, and this

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.170
presentation.

01:54:21.170 --> 01:54:23.820
I wasn't really expecting
it to.

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:27.230
But I wanted to tell you, well,
you've seen a whole

01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:28.010
bunch of stuff.

01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:30.130
I'm personally really excited
about Glass in

01:54:30.130 --> 01:54:31.290
my day-to-day usage.

01:54:31.290 --> 01:54:34.220
I've had moments with
family like that.

01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.090
And there are all kinds
of things this

01:54:36.090 --> 01:54:38.620
can capture and share.

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:44.420
But obviously, capturing images,
videos, even sharing

01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:48.250
video, that's only a part
of what a wearable

01:54:48.250 --> 01:54:49.630
computer can do.

01:54:49.630 --> 01:54:53.430
And we've highlighted a few
other little things here.

01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:57.840
But why are we showing
you basically

01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:59.520
this kind of utility?

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.880
And there are basically
three reasons.

01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:04.380
The first is because we've
just found it incredibly

01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:06.940
compelling since we made
these and started using

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:08.770
them out and about.

01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:11.030
We've just found that
to be amazing.

01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:15.490
The second is it's actually one
of the things we can show

01:55:15.490 --> 01:55:22.342
you, because you all can't
experience what it's like to

01:55:22.342 --> 01:55:23.990
have all this information
available right

01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:25.670
here just like that.

01:55:25.670 --> 01:55:28.300
And so there are other kinds of
things that we use it for.

01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:32.440
But it's hard to demonstrate.

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.890
I guess you could put one glass
on top of another glass,

01:55:34.890 --> 01:55:37.620
and then you'd see what
we experience.

01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:40.640
But that might be awkward.

01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.580
So you haven't had a chance
to experience it.

01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:46.620
And third, we're a pretty
small team.

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:51.360
And we've only had so much time
to try various kinds of

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.240
functionality.

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:55.540
And in fact, every day, we've
been getting great ideas from

01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:58.260
inside, from outside, from
all around the world.

01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:02.250
And that's why we really want
to involve all of you.

01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:05.690
This developer community is
going to be key to us.

01:56:05.690 --> 01:56:10.800
And that's why today, I'd like
to announce the Google Glass

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.050
Explorer Edition.

01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:18.050
It's going to be something that
we'd like to get in the

01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:21.350
hands of people who are really
passionate about it, who want

01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:24.290
to be among the earliest
to get this device.

01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:27.320
This is not going to be a
consumer device in a sense.

01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:29.045
It's going to be rough
around the edges.

01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:34.380
You have to want to be
on the bleeding edge.

01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:36.080
And that's what this is
really designed for.

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:45.670
[APPLAUSE]

01:56:45.670 --> 01:56:51.080
SERGEY BRIN: So it's only
available for pre-order here

01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.070
at I/O. I apologize for
this right now.

01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:57.000
It's only for US-based
I/O attendees.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.040
It's just a bunch of regulatory
stuff that we have

01:56:59.040 --> 01:56:59.920
to get through.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:04.050
And so we'll try to broaden
the base over time.

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:07.310
We're trying to get it out to
people as early as we can, so

01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:08.930
we can get that feedback.

01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:15.220
It will be $1,500.

01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:19.220
We plan on shipping to
you early next year.

01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:22.540
I know a lot of the things we
discussed here are like, you

01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:23.690
can get in them,
[? do your whatnot. ?]

01:57:23.690 --> 01:57:25.550
This is a really
new technology.

01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:29.830
And we really want to get all
of you to help shape it.

01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:35.040
And that's why we really want
to get it out into the hands

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.780
of passionate people as
early as possible.

01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.800
So by the way, you
can get that.

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.940
There's going to be
a booth set up.

01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.520
It's just going to be outside
on your right.

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.670
And you can stop by there
anytime today or tomorrow

01:57:46.670 --> 01:57:48.090
during the conference.

01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:50.360
Right now, we're only accepting
orders at the

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:50.870
conference.

01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:55.020
So this is not, as I said,
a mass consumer order.

01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:59.420
And I have some clean
up I have to do.

01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:01.360
So I apologize also.

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:05.110
I interrupted Vic's
presentation.

01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:12.230
So what I'm going to do is,
first of all, I want to thank

01:58:12.230 --> 01:58:14.400
Isabelle and Babak so much
for presenting up here.

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.976
And another round of applause
for all the people who brought

01:58:16.976 --> 01:58:18.226
this together.

01:58:23.650 --> 01:58:25.800
And please, let's see.

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:26.940
Is Vic ready?

01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:29.216
Vic, I'm so sorry.

01:58:29.216 --> 01:58:30.530
But thank you all very much.

01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:31.880
We're going to see you around
the conference.

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.353
See you around the booths.

01:58:40.230 --> 01:58:41.050
VIC GUNDOTRA: Thank you.

01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:43.780
Of all the things when I woke
up this morning I wasn't

01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:48.980
expecting was that I was going
to have a Taylor Swift moment.

01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:50.720
Thanks, Sergey.

01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.300
Larry, our other co-founder,
has a very

01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:55.200
famous saying at Google.

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.710
He says, you should have a
healthy disrespect for the

01:58:57.710 --> 01:58:58.830
impossible.

01:58:58.830 --> 01:59:00.530
And I think what Sergey
just showed you is

01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:02.060
an example of that.

01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:03.940
When your boss comes to you and
says, hey, we're going to

01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:06.230
jump out of an airplane, we're
going to land on the roof of

01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:09.570
Moscone, and then we're going
to bike it in, you must be

01:59:09.570 --> 01:59:12.040
working at Google.

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.770
It was really exciting to see
something that magical.

01:59:14.770 --> 01:59:17.780
Let me just wrap up on Events,
and I've got some final

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:20.440
announcements to make.

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.510
In fact, the best way to wrap up
on Events is let's just go

01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:23.140
to that video.

01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:24.650
And I'll make a final
comment after that.

01:59:24.650 --> 01:59:26.214
Let's play the video.

01:59:26.214 --> 01:59:26.671

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:34.780
VIC GUNDOTRA: When you think
about what we're really trying

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:38.700
to do with Google+ Events for
before, during, and after, it

02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.130
really speaks to what
we're trying to

02:00:40.130 --> 02:00:42.820
do with Google overall.

02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:46.560
The best thing is for computers
to have your back.

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.570
And then you don't have
to worry about them.

02:00:48.570 --> 02:00:51.770
You can focus on what makes
people the happiest, on

02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:55.320
living, and on loving,
and not messing

02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:57.230
with annoying computers.

02:00:57.230 --> 02:01:00.640
With Google+ Events, all you
have to do is show up at your

02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:05.090
event, hang out with your
friends, take some photos.

02:01:05.090 --> 02:01:06.690
And we think that's a plus.

02:01:06.690 --> 02:01:08.400
So we're super excited.

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:13.340
Now, we thought the best way to
kick Google+ Events off is

02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:16.940
to have our first official
event tonight, and you're

02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:19.580
going to be invited.

02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:22.180
That event tonight is an
after-hours party, and that

02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:24.860
will become the first official
Google+ Event.

02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:28.930
We have Train and Paul Oakenfold
available tonight.

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:34.630
It's gonna be fun, lots
of food, lots of other

02:01:34.630 --> 02:01:35.520
entertainment.

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:38.990
I've just got to ask for you,
please download the new

02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:42.200
Android version available in
Google Play later today.

02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:46.300
That version will have all
the Events integration.

02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:48.230
And you'll be able to
turn on Party Mode.

02:01:48.230 --> 02:01:51.280
I'm going to go backstage in a
few minutes and send all of

02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:52.490
you invites.

02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:54.850
And so expect an
invite from me.

02:01:54.850 --> 02:01:57.490
We'll see how many contributing
photographers we

02:01:57.490 --> 02:02:01.160
can get tonight at the party.

02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.080
One more thing.

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:03.120
That's right.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.700
Hugo, can you join me onstage?

02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:12.030
Thank you, Hugo.

02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:17.310
I think you have some exciting
news for these folks.

02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:18.950
HUGO BARRA: I do indeed.

02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:24.430
Well, because you guys are our
most dedicated developers, we

02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:26.025
think it's really important
for you to be able to

02:02:26.025 --> 02:02:30.790
experiment early with all the
stuff you saw here today, all

02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:34.180
of your devices in your media
working together.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:38.140
So we've put together for you
an Android developer pack.

02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:47.100
All 6,000 of you are going to
be walking away today with a

02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:57.820
brand-new Galaxy Nexus
phone, and a

02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:00.012
brand-new Nexus 7 tablet.

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:15.310
You're going to get the latest
OTA of the Jelly Bean preview

02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:17.745
version a couple of hours
after you power them on.

02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:24.710
Shall I keep going?

02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:25.700
VIC GUNDOTRA: One more.

02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:26.520
HUGO BARRA: OK.

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.290
Well, you're also going to be
the very first ones to get

02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:57.040
your hands on a shiny,
new Nexus Q.

02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.260
VIC GUNDOTRA: So thank
you to the generosity

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:01.740
of the Android team.

02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:03.760
Thank you all for
your support.

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.560
Please don't run out, and
get these devices.

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.590
They will be available today
at 4:00 PM onwards on the

02:04:10.590 --> 02:04:12.670
ground floor at gear pick-up.

02:04:12.670 --> 02:04:17.050
You must have both your badge
and an ID with you.

02:04:17.050 --> 02:04:19.250
So please, if you're standing
in line, make sure you have

02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:21.620
your ID with you, and you
can pick them up.

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.040
Once again, thank you.

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.720
We'll see all of you tonight
at the after party.

02:04:29.887 --> 02:04:30.350
