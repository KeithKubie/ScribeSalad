James: Hi YouTube, I'm Jim Schiro, the CEO
of Zurich Financial Services.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.410
And as they know, I'm in Davos, there's a
lot of dialogue going around regarding the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.430
current economic crisis.
The responsibility that people must take for

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.640
that crisis.
And yes I think as part of the financial services

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.290
community, we have to say we didn't deliver
on our promises and we failed to deliver on

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.970
those promises.
I had the opportunity to participate in a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.360
panel discussing the importance of values.
I think values are important; executives should

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.839
be accountable to living up to those values.
I'm not sure that the publication of a series

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.829
of ethics policies -- I think most companies
have a policy that says these are the ethics

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.499
we expect for executives.
I think the important thing is we have to

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.429
hold executives accountable for living those
ethics more and those policies.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.049
I think that's really the foundation of the
values that excellent companies do have.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.190
So I'm optimistic as we go through this process
that we will see a greater light shine on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.700
those people who are truly living the values
of their organization.
