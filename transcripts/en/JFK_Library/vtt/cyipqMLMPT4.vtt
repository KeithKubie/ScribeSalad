00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.209
(happy music)

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.614
- [Speaker] In real life,
they could pass a new law

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.081
which actually might happen.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.020
If you've been following the news, okay,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.683
so, major budget problems, all along.

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:25.214
But in 2011 there was...

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:27.480
- I want you to think about
the programs, what does it

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.431
mean to cut these programs,
what does it look like?

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:32.957
- There were about 19 million veterans

00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:34.457
in the US in 2015.

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:38.643
- I know that the
transportation could obviously

00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:41.259
be improved, and what everyone
has said is completely true.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:44.516
But I don't know if it's worth
adding, putting it up there.

00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:46.163
- We might just need to reallocate it.

00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:48.814
Because maybe it's not
being used properly or

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.725
can be, being used better.

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:52.832
I thought it was gonna be
much easier, definitely.

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:55.387
I thought, it was gonna be something that

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:56.220
we could all work out.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.167
I thought people would share my beliefs.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.208
Obviously. People had different beliefs.

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:03.861
In the news, I read a lot
about how certain things

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:06.310
that the government does is ineffective

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.343
and not working, so I
thought that it would be

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:11.447
easy to take away those things
that might not be working

00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:13.832
for people, or reallocating funds.

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:16.230
And I realized that just, monetarily,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.860
that didn't really work out.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.833
When you hear 10 billion
dollars cut, you're, okay,

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.522
10 billion dollars cut, but
then when you realize that

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:25.177
certain amount of people are
gonna lose health insurance,

00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:28.289
or won't have access to
clean water for example

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.044
and just seeing that
manifest in chip form was

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:32.880
really frightening.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.363
- I do think you know, the
lower end of categories

00:01:35.363 --> 00:01:39.419
like energy and agriculture
need more chips.

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:42.590
I came in thinking that,
you know, of course we were

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.678
gonna learn important things
but it was gonna be boring

00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:47.606
and it wasn't gonna be
a lot of fact based.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.353
Which was the opposite
of what I think now.

00:01:49.353 --> 00:01:51.153
When you're cutting from a category

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.663
and you don't necessarily get
the funding from that category

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.560
you don't think that
it will have, you know,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.765
a drastic effect on
the nation but it will.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.265
- Quarter billion.

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.137
- And I think you should
change your mind set

00:02:03.137 --> 00:02:05.080
and what you define as boring.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.433
Because a lot of these
categories effect us,

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.606
on a day to day basis and we don't know.

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:10.631
- [Daniel] Can I ask a question?

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.603
- You sure can.
- [Daniel] Okay

00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:14.174
- You know, everyone was in their bubble,

00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:17.549
and they come together and
they're hearing, points

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.877
of view that they don't generally
hear in their daily lives.

00:02:20.877 --> 00:02:25.571
- We took 10 billion out of
the 44 2 point billion dollars

00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:29.738
in highways and our justification
is that it's pretty much

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:34.655
that there's more important
topics to be spending on.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.425
- Okay, highways, don't
worry about the potholes,

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:39.917
don't worry about the
bridges falling down.

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:42.329
There are more important things.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.257
- So by pushing them, they're
beginning to see, okay,

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:50.240
it's not just oh we're gonna
cut from conservation efforts.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.077
What does it mean if there
are streams that are being

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:55.838
polluted near someone's home.
- And that we don't really

00:02:55.838 --> 00:02:59.008
need to make more aircraft,
when there's nothing wrong

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:00.680
with the ones we have now.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.350
- [Nina] That's to federally
subsidize healthcare.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.610
- If you do this, it's gonna
hurt these people in this way

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.008
and these people in these way,

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:09.506
and that there are
people behind the numbers

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:13.168
and that that's really
important to consider.

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:15.668
(happy music)
