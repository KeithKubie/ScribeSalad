00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.560
so a recent set of controversies has to
do with the funding by the federal

human and animal genetic material

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
human and animal genetic material
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129

sometimes called chimeras but there was

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
sometimes called chimeras but there was
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.720
sometimes called chimeras but there was
actually a broad or group of us and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
actually a broad or group of us and
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.400
actually a broad or group of us and
again the method is to think about a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
again the method is to think about a
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.290
again the method is to think about a
large number of cases it's helpful to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
large number of cases it's helpful to
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.990
large number of cases it's helpful to
think about very different cases so to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
think about very different cases so to
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.980
think about very different cases so to
use some real cases imagine you mixed

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990
use some real cases imagine you mixed
 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.740

took a gorilla treated the gril exactly

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
took a gorilla treated the gril exactly
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.079
took a gorilla treated the gril exactly
as it is but were able to generate a

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089
as it is but were able to generate a
 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.750

human looking face right so a gorilla

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
human looking face right so a gorilla
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.119
human looking face right so a gorilla
with a human face how would we think

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
with a human face how would we think
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.449
with a human face how would we think
about that entity third example

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:55.459
about that entity third example
 

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:58.069
about that entity third example
humanized and immune system took a mouse

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
humanized and immune system took a mouse
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.229
humanized and immune system took a mouse
and we do this we have these at Harvard

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
and we do this we have these at Harvard
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.539
and we do this we have these at Harvard
for example and created an immune system

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549
for example and created an immune system
 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.880
for example and created an immune system
in order to test drugs think about HIV

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
in order to test drugs think about HIV
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190
in order to test drugs think about HIV
for example that was humanized so not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
for example that was humanized so not
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.680
for example that was humanized so not
the brain but just the immune system was

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690
the brain but just the immune system was
 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.050
the brain but just the immune system was
very human-like and last example is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
very human-like and last example is
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.600
very human-like and last example is
actually valve replacements heart valve

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
actually valve replacements heart valve
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.820
actually valve replacements heart valve
replacements so Jesse Helms the senator

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
replacements so Jesse Helms the senator
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100
replacements so Jesse Helms the senator
had a pig valve replacement years ago

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
had a pig valve replacement years ago
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050
had a pig valve replacement years ago
right so there's a piece of an animal in

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
right so there's a piece of an animal in
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660
right so there's a piece of an animal in
him right so these are four examples of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
him right so these are four examples of
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.790
him right so these are four examples of
different kinds of mixing and the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800
different kinds of mixing and the
 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.340
different kinds of mixing and the
question is which are okay which are not

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
question is which are okay which are not
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.160
question is which are okay which are not
okay why can we generate some principles

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
okay why can we generate some principles
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.760
okay why can we generate some principles
so what might be wrong with mixing human

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
so what might be wrong with mixing human
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.370
so what might be wrong with mixing human
and animal parts so one thing they might

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
and animal parts so one thing they might
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230
and animal parts so one thing they might
be wrong is that we think it will

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
be wrong is that we think it will
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.570
be wrong is that we think it will
confuse the boundaries between humans

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580
confuse the boundaries between humans
 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.190
confuse the boundaries between humans
and animals right them right now we have

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
and animals right them right now we have
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.740
and animals right them right now we have
a pretty clear distinction while many

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
a pretty clear distinction while many
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.360
a pretty clear distinction while many
people love their dogs and their cats

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370
people love their dogs and their cats
 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.910
people love their dogs and their cats
like members of the family they are able

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
like members of the family they are able
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160
like members of the family they are able
to say this is not a member of my family

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
to say this is not a member of my family
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.590
to say this is not a member of my family
this is not a member that has the same

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
this is not a member that has the same
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.140
this is not a member that has the same
rights as my family member in a world

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150
rights as my family member in a world
 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.000
rights as my family member in a world
where we had much more of a continuum

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010
where we had much more of a continuum
 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.890
where we had much more of a continuum
between animals and human beings those

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900
between animals and human beings those
 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.899
between animals and human beings those
distinctions would become difficult

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
distinctions would become difficult
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.580
distinctions would become difficult
now just because they become difficult

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
now just because they become difficult
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740
now just because they become difficult
doesn't mean that that's wrong right we

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
doesn't mean that that's wrong right we
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.479
doesn't mean that that's wrong right we
just post Russ a new problem and maybe

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
just post Russ a new problem and maybe
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.279
just post Russ a new problem and maybe
it would illustrate a problem we should

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
it would illustrate a problem we should
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.559
it would illustrate a problem we should
be thinking about altogether so I'm not

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
be thinking about altogether so I'm not
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.179
be thinking about altogether so I'm not
particularly sympathetic to that

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189
particularly sympathetic to that
 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.429
particularly sympathetic to that
argument different argument though is to

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439
argument different argument though is to
 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.120
argument different argument though is to
say

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
say
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.790
say
human beings are particulars of

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
human beings are particulars of
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.710
human beings are particulars of
capacities and there's a dignity to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
capacities and there's a dignity to
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.070
capacities and there's a dignity to
being human being and if we were to mix

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
being human being and if we were to mix
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.750
being human being and if we were to mix
enough animal material into a human

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
enough animal material into a human
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640
enough animal material into a human
being the thing that we would have would

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650
being the thing that we would have would
 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.740
being the thing that we would have would
not be something new but would be a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
not be something new but would be a
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.600
not be something new but would be a
human being that could not flourish as a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
human being that could not flourish as a
 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.060
human being that could not flourish as a
human being being undignified human

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
human being being undignified human
 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.510
human being being undignified human
being a kind of entity that is one that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
being a kind of entity that is one that
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.720
being a kind of entity that is one that
really is unable to really experience

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
really is unable to really experience
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.190
really is unable to really experience
what it is to be human

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
what it is to be human
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.230
what it is to be human
now again you might push on this and say

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240
now again you might push on this and say
 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.960
now again you might push on this and say
well yes that's true they would not be a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
well yes that's true they would not be a
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210
well yes that's true they would not be a
human being and they would not be that

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
human being and they would not be that
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.410
human being and they would not be that
so they have all the capacities of the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420
so they have all the capacities of the
 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.540
so they have all the capacities of the
human beings I think imagine having some

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
human beings I think imagine having some
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.950
human beings I think imagine having some
of the capacities of human being would

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960
of the capacities of human being would
 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
of the capacities of human being would
being stuck in a rack body for example

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970
being stuck in a rack body for example
 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.450
being stuck in a rack body for example
sure there'd be ways in which you would

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460
sure there'd be ways in which you would
 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.400
sure there'd be ways in which you would
not flourish as a human being but why

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
not flourish as a human being but why
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.960
not flourish as a human being but why
not think of you as flourishing as a new

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
not think of you as flourishing as a new
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.630
not think of you as flourishing as a new
kind of entity right and in particular

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640
kind of entity right and in particular
 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.740
kind of entity right and in particular
you might actually think that might be

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
you might actually think that might be
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.260
you might actually think that might be
an obligation to create some kinds of

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270
an obligation to create some kinds of
 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.290
an obligation to create some kinds of
chimeras so if for example we think of a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300
chimeras so if for example we think of a
 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.330
chimeras so if for example we think of a
big bird from Sesame Street sounds like

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340
big bird from Sesame Street sounds like
 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.620
big bird from Sesame Street sounds like
a silly example but it's a good one

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
a silly example but it's a good one
 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.230
a silly example but it's a good one
right big bird talks Big Bird has

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240
right big bird talks Big Bird has
 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.390
right big bird talks Big Bird has
friends big bird goes to school been in

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
friends big bird goes to school been in
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.800

I guess but he seems to have a pretty

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
I guess but he seems to have a pretty
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.730
I guess but he seems to have a pretty
good life right imagine we could take

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740
good life right imagine we could take
 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.740
good life right imagine we could take
regular birds and turn them into big

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
regular birds and turn them into big
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.440
regular birds and turn them into big
birds by doing something to them right

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450
birds by doing something to them right
 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.690
birds by doing something to them right
when we think of that as improving a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700
when we think of that as improving a
 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.340
when we think of that as improving a
little birds life but we think about

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350
little birds life but we think about
 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.470
little birds life but we think about
that as hurting a human beings life

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480
that as hurting a human beings life
 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.540
that as hurting a human beings life
right through this mixture hard

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550
right through this mixture hard
 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.790
right through this mixture hard
questions right but at least it might be

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800
questions right but at least it might be
 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.930
questions right but at least it might be
possible that we think we're doing

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
possible that we think we're doing
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.900
possible that we think we're doing
animals a favor by doing this and other

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
animals a favor by doing this and other
 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.400
animals a favor by doing this and other
answers might say it depends a lot on

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410
answers might say it depends a lot on
 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.770
answers might say it depends a lot on
the specifics of the case right there

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
the specifics of the case right there
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.180
the specifics of the case right there
are changes we could make to human

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
are changes we could make to human
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.150
are changes we could make to human
beings by mixing an animal DNA that

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160
beings by mixing an animal DNA that
 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.190
beings by mixing an animal DNA that
might make them better and there are

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
might make them better and there are
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.390
might make them better and there are
changes we could make to human beings

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
changes we could make to human beings
 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.460
changes we could make to human beings
and make them worse and worse from moral

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
and make them worse and worse from moral
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.010
and make them worse and worse from moral
perspective so for example I've it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020
perspective so for example I've it
 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.260
perspective so for example I've it
turned out that there was to use an

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270
turned out that there was to use an
 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.000
turned out that there was to use an
example in the literature we could give

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
example in the literature we could give
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.340
example in the literature we could give
human beings night vision so they could

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350
human beings night vision so they could
 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.930
human beings night vision so they could
see at night like some animals through

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940
see at night like some animals through
 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.630
see at night like some animals through
mixing in a little animal DNA you might

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640
mixing in a little animal DNA you might
 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.130
mixing in a little animal DNA you might
think that would be great right we could

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140
think that would be great right we could
 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.110
think that would be great right we could
do more search and rescue we'd be better

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120
do more search and rescue we'd be better
 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.420
do more search and rescue we'd be better
drivers there'd be less fatalities on

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
drivers there'd be less fatalities on
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.590
drivers there'd be less fatalities on
the other hand if the result was to

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
the other hand if the result was to
 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.539
the other hand if the result was to
produce human beings that had much

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
produce human beings that had much
 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.970
produce human beings that had much
stronger aggression or violence or claws

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980
stronger aggression or violence or claws
 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.650
stronger aggression or violence or claws
or something like that you might think

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660
or something like that you might think
 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.969
or something like that you might think
that's worse because we're gonna do more

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979
that's worse because we're gonna do more
 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.219
that's worse because we're gonna do more
harm and that would suggest the answer

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229
harm and that would suggest the answer
 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.050
harm and that would suggest the answer
about whether we ought to have chimeras

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060
about whether we ought to have chimeras
 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.740
about whether we ought to have chimeras
are not on what

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750
are not on what
 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.450
are not on what
fine can only be answered in a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460
fine can only be answered in a
 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.310
fine can only be answered in a
particular istic way about thinking

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320
particular istic way about thinking
 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.860
particular istic way about thinking
about a particular case I will say and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
about a particular case I will say and
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.300
about a particular case I will say and
this is kind of referencing some work by

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310
this is kind of referencing some work by
 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.160
this is kind of referencing some work by
my friend Hank really at Stanford that

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170
my friend Hank really at Stanford that
 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.530
my friend Hank really at Stanford that
there are particular kinds of changes

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540
there are particular kinds of changes
 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.670
there are particular kinds of changes
which from a sociological perspective

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680
which from a sociological perspective
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.330
which from a sociological perspective
seem to bother us more and he describes

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340
seem to bother us more and he describes
 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.730
seem to bother us more and he describes
them as kind of brains balls and faces

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740
them as kind of brains balls and faces
 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.860
them as kind of brains balls and faces
so brains turns out we're very disturbed

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870
so brains turns out we're very disturbed
 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.170
so brains turns out we're very disturbed
by the idea of human brains or humanized

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180
by the idea of human brains or humanized
 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.540
by the idea of human brains or humanized
brains in animals much more disturbed by

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550
brains in animals much more disturbed by
 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.210
brains in animals much more disturbed by
the humanized brain mice than we are by

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220
the humanized brain mice than we are by
 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.120
the humanized brain mice than we are by
the humanized immune system mice for

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130
the humanized immune system mice for
 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.970
the humanized immune system mice for
example the other is balls we tend to be

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980
example the other is balls we tend to be
 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.920
example the other is balls we tend to be
very nervous when we think about the

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930
very nervous when we think about the
 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.960
very nervous when we think about the
idea and this is kind of crazy and out

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
idea and this is kind of crazy and out
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.690
idea and this is kind of crazy and out
there imagine you could create an animal

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700
there imagine you could create an animal
 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.960
there imagine you could create an animal
that had the ability to reproduce it's

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970
that had the ability to reproduce it's
 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.140
that had the ability to reproduce it's
it's gonads its reproductive system was

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150
it's gonads its reproductive system was
 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.900
it's gonads its reproductive system was
human so that you'd have animals mating

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910
human so that you'd have animals mating
 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.880
human so that you'd have animals mating
and producing human beings and animals

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890
and producing human beings and animals
 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.860
and producing human beings and animals
right that's the kind of thing I think

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870
right that's the kind of thing I think
 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.050
right that's the kind of thing I think
disturbs a lot of people is an idea and

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060
disturbs a lot of people is an idea and
 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.510
disturbs a lot of people is an idea and
the last is face is the idea of having

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520
the last is face is the idea of having
 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.390
the last is face is the idea of having
animals with human faces for example I

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400
animals with human faces for example I
 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.310
animals with human faces for example I
think just disturbs a lot of people even

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
think just disturbs a lot of people even
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.330
think just disturbs a lot of people even
though you might say a face is a face

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340
though you might say a face is a face
 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.270
though you might say a face is a face
but it's a marker of human being isn't

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280
but it's a marker of human being isn't
 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.650
but it's a marker of human being isn't
the way we relate to each other and I

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660
the way we relate to each other and I
 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.990
the way we relate to each other and I
think there was just a strong

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000
think there was just a strong
 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.840
think there was just a strong
sociological pushback against that

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850
 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.239
