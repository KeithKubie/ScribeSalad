00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.073
Narrator: THE CHINESE BUILT
A VAST STRUCTURE

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:10.744
USING BILLIONS OF TONS
OF SOLID STONE AND BRICKS.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.951
IT SAT ON A STURDY FOUNDATION
OF HUGE GRANITE BLOCKS.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.188
SMOOTH BRICKS MADE
THE SHEER WALLS

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.224
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SCALE.

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:30.363
EMBATTLEMENTS PROTECTED
THE DEFENDERS AT THE TOP.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.934
RUBBLE WAS CRAMMED
BETWEEN THE BRICK FACES

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:38.371
TO CREATE A STABLE CORE.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.541
AND SMOOTH STONES PAVED THE TOP.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.311
NEARLY 23 FEET HIGH
AND OVER 16 FEET THICK,

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:47.647
THIS WALL WAS IMPENETRABLE.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.850
WHENEVER VISITORS
REACH THE WALL,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.019
THEY ALWAYS TEND TO ASK
THE SAME QUESTIONS.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.122
AND ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS IS,
WHY IS THE WALL HERE

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.259
AND NOT OVER THERE
OR OVER HERE?

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.528
Narrator: WILLIAM STUDIES
THE LANDSCAPE AROUND

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.396
THE GREAT WALL TO UNDERSTAND

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.566
WHY THE CHINESE BUILT
WHERE THEY DID.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.368
Lindesay: FROM THE TOP
OF THIS WATCH TOWER,

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.705
I CAN SEE PRECISELY
WHY THE WALL IS HERE.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:16.208
DOWN HERE, LOW GROUND,
ASCENDING, ASCENDING,

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.944
AND THIS IS THE PEAK.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.047
AND THE WALL IS TAKING
THAT PEAK LINE

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.882
TO THE PEAK OVER THERE.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:26.319
I MOVE TO THE RIGHT,
AND THE WALL DESCENDS.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.322
LEVEL OF THE MOUNTAINS
FALLS AWAY DRAMATICALLY.

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:32.858
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTELY
PERFECT LINE

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:34.360
FOR THIS SECTION OF WALL.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:39.331
Narrator: THE WALL'S BUILDERS
FOLLOWED THE HIGH GROUND,

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.901
BUT THEIR PATH WAS NEVER
A SIMPLE, STRAIGHT LINE.

00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.738
Lindesay: INITIALLY, I COULDN'T
SEE ANY LOGIC

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:49.875
IN THAT SEEMINGLY HAPHAZARD
ROUTE THAT THE WALL TOOK.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.578
BUT ACTUALLY,
ALL OF THESE TWISTS

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:56.015
AND TURNS, I BELIEVE,
ARE FOR A PURPOSE.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.752
IT IMPROVED THEIR OPPORTUNITIES
IN TERMS OF LINES OF FIRE.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.587
NOT ONLY IN THE FACES
OF THE ENEMY,

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:03.156
BUT FROM THE SIDE.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.559
Narrator:
THE CHINESE BUILT THE GREAT WALL
TO FOLLOW THE TERRAIN,

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:11.965
RISING 4,921 FEET
TO THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.573
THEY POSITIONED WATCH TOWERS
492 FEET APART

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.842
TO MAXIMIZE THEIR KILL ZONES.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.813
AND CLEARED THE TREES
FOR TWO MILES

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:30.516
SO RAIDERS WERE IN CLEAR VIEW.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:34.554
SPURS EXTENDED THE LINE OF SIGHT
TO GUARD AGAINST ATTACKS.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.958
Lindesay:
NO ENEMY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:44.097
WOULD WANT TO FIGHT
WITH THE CHINESE RIGHT HERE.
