00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Kyle Johnson is here to
talk about "Inception and Philosophy."

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.470
He's the editor of the book, among--.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.990
He's also the frequent contributor to other
volumes of the Blackwell Philosophy and Popular

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.660
Culture series, including Heroes in Philosophy.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.749
And he's here to talk today about Inception
and why--.

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:20.880
What's the premise of the--?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.220
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: It should've won Best Picture.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.369
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Why Inception should've
won Best Picture.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.029
It's a very cogently argued philosophical
argument, which I think you will all enjoy.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.100
And without further ado, let's welcome Kyle
to Google.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.100
[applause]

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.190
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Thank you very much, Tyler.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.199
So, just to make sure, who's seen Inception?

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.199
Good.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.199
All right.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.920
'Cause if you haven't seen it, you almost
can't spoil Inception because it's unclear

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.660
what's going on in Inception, right?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.239
So, there's no ending to spoil necessarily.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.059
But what I do wanna argue today is that Inception
should have won Best Picture.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.260
And I should warn you that there's gonna be
a lot of stuff flying at you here.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.860
The words on the slides are really for my
benefit.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.829
The pictures are for your benefit, so don't
feel like you need to read everything.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.830
The Power Point is designed such that you
can just go through the Power Point by yourself

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.840
and understand it.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.960
So, don't be overwhelmed by some text-heavy
slides as it were.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.229
But I'm going to argue that Inception should've
won Best Picture.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.920
Now, I really don't actually care that much
about whether or not it won Best Picture.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.159
Like, I wasn't crying the night the Oscars
were on, whenever it didn't win.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.280
But the reason I think it didn't win is because
the Academy didn't understand it.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.549
I think it went right over their heads.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.649
[laughter]

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.689
And so what I'm really attempting to do here
is I'm attempting to explain, by telling you

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.329
why it should've won, I'm going to explain
the movie.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.049
I'm gonna help you understand the movie about
what it was about, about even what happened

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.049
in it.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.720
Like, what actually is going on in the plot.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.359
And I'm gonna show you how philosophy can
help you understand the movie.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.380
And I think maybe you can even really truly
understand the movie without it.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.480
And so, that's a lot of what the book tries
to do is help you use philosophy to understand

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.510
Inception.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.099
And then, once you understand it, we go off
and we explore other philosophical issues

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.319
that are raised by the movie.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.830
So, some things that they may have missed.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.650
One thing that the Academy probably missed
about Inception was that the movie itself

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.909
is an analogy--it's an allegory--for movie-making.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.010
That the dream team, each element of the dream
team has an analogous element to those who

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.010
make a movie.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.800
So, Cobb, who orchestrates everything, he's
the director.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.090
Ariadne, who designs the dreams, she's the
screen-writer.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.500
Saito, who bankrolls the whole thing, who
buys the whole airline instead of just buying

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.930
out first class, he's the production company.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.300
He's the bankroll.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.970
Arthur, who organizes everything.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.060
He's the producer.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.849
Eames, who puts on characters--literally portrays
the sexy blonde--or Browning, the Godfather,

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.849
he's the actor.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.750
Yusuf, who has the technical savvy to chemically
concoct the chemical they use to put themselves

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.650
under to make the whole thing possible, he's
special effects.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.490
Fischer, the mark, he's the audience.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.090
And we even see things like this, where we
see Eames as Browning.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.970
You see Eames in the mirror there.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.599
He's actually sitting at an old-time vanity
mirror like an actor would.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.310
And so, we have this direct analogy with movie-making
itself where Inception is actually an analogy

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.189
for movie-making itself.

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:53.120
Here's something else that they probably missed.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:22.200
[music plays]

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:57.420
I believe it was Hans Zimmer who did the music
for Inception, has admitted in interviews

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.250
that it's not just the intro.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.010
Every piece of music all the way throughout
the film is based on different parts of that

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.570
Edith Piaf track, either sped up or slowed
down to different tempos.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.530
And he just took those elements, took it,
sped it up, slowed it down, and then composed

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.920
the music for the film based on that.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920
That is cool.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.970
That is really cool and it's something that
most people missed about the film.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.630
And in fact, Inception itself is an inception.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.570
You may think that Inception is impossible.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.790
In fact, they even talk about that in the
movie that it's impossible to get into someone's

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.300
mind an implant an idea in there and make
them think that it was their own idea.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.850
But that's just what movies do.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.410
That's all movies do is--.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.470
It's not all they do, but that's one big thing
that they do is they incept ideas into us.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.190
Inception probably incepted into you the idea
that reality may not be actually real, but

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.410
instead is a dream.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.820
Inception happens all the time.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.490
And that's what the whole point of advertising
is.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.180
Inception.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.590
And so, but these are not even--.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.440
This is just, this is tawdry stuff.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.522
This is just little tiny things that you may
have missed.

00:06:01.522 --> 00:06:02.990
This is not even the big stuff.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.140
Kinda cool, but not the big stuff.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.140
Here's the big stuff.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.230
Or at least, starting with the big stuff.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.550
Just, just getting started.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.830
On the surface, the movie is a great action
film with some cool special effects and a

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.160
clever cliffhanger.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.590
At the end and he spins the top to see if
he's really in reality and they fade to the--.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.050
They go to the top.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.050
Is it gonna fall?

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.050
And they cut out.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.050
You don't know.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.680
That's kinda cool, right?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.630
Unraveling the movie would seem to simply
require discovering the answer to the question,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.630
"Did the top fall?"

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.240
And if you knew whether the top fell or not,
then you'd know whether Cobb was home and

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.370
the movie can be nicely wrapped up.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.900
The first step to understanding Inception
is realizing that the answer to that question,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.830
"Did the top fall?" doesn't matter at all.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.630
Even if we knew whether or not the top fell,
we would still not understand the movie.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.070
Even if the top falls, Cobb could still be
dreaming.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.790
And in fact, I think he probably is.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.630
Now, I'm gonna give you an argument for why.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.910
So first, we have to start out asking ourselves
how do totems work.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.100
'Cause Cobb's top was not the only totem in
the movie.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.300
Arthur's got a totem.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.330
It's the die.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.450
Ariadne's got a totem.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.450
It's the bishop.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.450
There's some others as well.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.110
You're never supposed to let anyone else see
how your totem works.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.800
You don't even want anyone else to touch your
totem.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.720
Because if they do, they might feel how it's
weighted in the real world and then your totem

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.800
will not be able to tell you whether or not
you're in one of their dreams.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.970
So for example, Arthur's totem is the loaded
die.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.030
If Ariadne touched his totem, she might get
inkling about how it's weighted in the real

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.030
world.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.080
And she would know that whenever he rolls
it in the real world, it always comes up a

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080
five.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.310
So, he can't let her touch that because if
she touches that, then if he's in one of her

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.400
dreams and he rolls his die in her dream--.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.360
Well, she knows it's supposed to come up a
five and so she would dream it would come

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.360
up a five.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.830
So, you can't let anyone know how your totem
behaves in the real world.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.490
If she does touch it, then it will not be
able to tell Arthur whether or not he is in

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.490
her dream.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.910
This is why he doesn't let her touch it.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.200
This is also why Ariadne refuses to let Cobb
touch her totem, the bishop.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.360
If he gets an inkling as to how it works and
how it's weighted in the real world and how

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.050
it falls, then it won't be able to tell her
whether or not he's in one of his dreams.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.080
So since, but here's the thing.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.490
Most importantly, what this means is that
totems can only tell you that you're not in

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.520
someone else's dream.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.390
Arthur even specifically says that in the
film.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.760
It can only tell you if you're in someone
else's dream.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.300
It can't tell you whether or not you're in
your own dream.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.470
So, even if the top falls in the end, Cobb
could still be dreaming because he could still

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.150
be in his own dream because he knows how his
totem works.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.610
So even if it falls, he could still be in
his own dream.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.200
But it gets worse.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.430
Cobb reveals too much.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:00.410
When Ariadne calls totems an "elegant solution
for keeping track of reality,"--this is right

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.230
after he'd asked to see hers and she said,
"No, you can't see it."

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.230
And he says, "Good job.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.890
You shouldn't let anyone know how your totem
works."

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.650
Right after that, she says, "It's an elegant
solution for keeping track of reality."

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.220
And asked if it was his idea.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.020
And he says, "No, it was Mal's actually.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.130
This one was hers.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.930
She would spin it in the dream and it would
never topple, just spin and spin."

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.960
He just did what he told her never to do--tell
people how your totem works.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.580
He just told her how it works.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:31.790
So now, the totem is no good for telling him
whether or not he's in one of her dreams because

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.400
now she knows how it works.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.650
And since she designed all the dreams of the
inception, it can't tell him whether or not

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.460
he's out of the inception or not because tops
would fall.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.680
She knows how it works in all the dreams in
the inception.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.820
And worse yet, the top was originally Mal's.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.890
That was her totem.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.260
It's not his.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.460
She knows how it works.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.000
So, it can't tell him whether or not he's
in her dream, either.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.290
So, even if the top falls at the end, he could
still be in his own dream.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.830
He could still be in Ariadne's dream.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.200
He could still be in Mal's dream.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.240
Now, he thinks Mal is dead of course, so he
doesn't have to worry about that.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.290
But the problem, of course, is she might have
been right.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.040
And if she was, she's still alive.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.010
We'll talk more about that in a little bit.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.050
But it gets even worse.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.220
Those three people that it could be, that
he's still dreaming in, he's in their dream.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.080
But it gets worse.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.080
Think about how the other totems work.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.650
Arthur only knows what number his die falls
on in the real world.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.240
Only Ariadne knows how her bishop is weighted
in the real world.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.560
There's another totem.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.660
Eames' totem, the poker chip.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.460
It's not exactly stated in the film, but you
can tell because he's always playing with

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.460
it.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.460
That's his totem.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.460
And it's not quite clear how it works, but
if you think about it you can figure it out.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.050
There's one line in the film where Cobb talks
about the misspelling on his chip.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:53.180
And, if you went to ComiCon this year, one
of my contributors, Lance, showed me this

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.180
picture.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.180
This is from ComiCon this year.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.650
They had Eames' totem on display.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.520
And if you look, it says "Mombasa District
Casino, one hundred Shillings."

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.810
It's a Mombasa Casino casino chip.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.210
But it's misspelled.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.430
There's an extra "S" in Mombasa.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.570
And this is how his totem works.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.960
If he looks at his poker chip and he sees
that extra "S" he knows he's in the real world

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.470
'cause he put it there.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.150
But if he looks at his poker chip and it's
spelled correctly, it doesn't have that extra

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.150
"S."

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.420
Then he knows he's in someone else's dream.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.370
But with each one of these totems, notice
that their behavior in the real world is unique.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.380
It's loaded.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380
It's weighted.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.450
It has an extra "S." In the dream, it behaves
ordinarily.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.200
Roll the die and it rolls random.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.360
But Cobb's totem is backwards.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.730
How does it behave in the real world?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.590
Like all tops behave in the real world.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.960
It falls down.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.110
Its behavior in the dream is unique.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.040
All the other totems, how they behave in the
real world is unique, and in the dream is

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.350
ordinary.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.230
His is ordinary in the real world, unique
in a dream.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.160
It's backwards.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:11.680
And since not only do Mal and Cobb, obviously
and Ariadne know that his top would fall in

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.120
the real world, we know his top would fall
in the real world.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.400
That's what tops do.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.560
Everybody knows that.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.760
If Cobb was in one of your dreams and he spun
his top, what would you dream that it would

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.760
do?

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.210
Well, I'd dream that it would fall 'cause
that's how I think they behave in the real

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.880
world.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.380
Cobb, even if the top falls at the end, he
could still be in anyone's dream.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.700
The top falling at the end tells us nothing.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.920
It is a red herring.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.690
It is there to distract you to think you've
got it figured out.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.370
Oh, if I only knew if the top fell I'd have
it all figured out.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.020
No, you wouldn't.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.710
[laughter] And this is not a mistake.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.050
This is not an oversight.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.240
This is intentional.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.570
Cobb himself is shown as an unreliable source
of information in the film.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.680
"You notice how much time Cobb spends doing
the things he never says to do,” is actually

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.860
a line from Arthur in the movie.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.860
We see that.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.350
We actually see two versions of some of the
events of the film that he recounts.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.760
Like, whenever he is, when he and Mal are
laying on the train track in Limbo, the first

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.620
time we see it, they're young.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.900
And then later, when we see it again, they're
old.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.650
Well, which is it?

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.810
Cobb tells us himself that he tries to alter
his memories.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.980
What is he saying?

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.730
Is any of it accurate at all?

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.170
Is that really how totems work?

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.180
We don't know.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.220
That's the beauty of it.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.930
That ending was much more clever than you
thought.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.980
Much more clever than you thought.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.430
What's clever is the magic trick that no one
pulls on us.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:46.150
No one has misdirected you, trying to make
you pay attention to the wrong thing--the

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.540
top--to try to find out whether Cobb is still
dreaming.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.360
So, what you're doing at the end of the film
is like, "Oh, I wonder if he's still dreaming."

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.279
And so, you're looking down here at the top.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.279
Will it fall?

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:57.279
Will it fall?

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.279
Will it fall?

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:04.150
While you're looking, what's actually going--the
clue--is up here on the upper-right.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.930
You need to be watching and listening to those
children whenever they first meet Cobb after

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.040
he's back home.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.360
You need to be listening.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.870
That's where the clue is, but you didn't hear
it 'cause you were looking at this.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.040
Cobb has misdirected you.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.040
Now, to tell you.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.380
The children say something here that's very
illuminating.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.230
But to understand why it's illuminating, I
need to give you a little background.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.540
And the background is this.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.050
We see in the movie that the subconscious
works its way through dreams.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.730
The most obvious example is the train in Limbo.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:40.370
The train from Limbo barreling down in Yusuf's
kidnap dream in the middle of that city street.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.580
The subconscious element, part of Cobb's subconscious
is working its way through a dream.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.610
This is not the only example.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.060
Two really good examples.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.870
That random string of number that Fischer
arbitrarily gives as a combination to his

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.870
father's safe.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.870
Right?

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:54.870
They're in the kidnap dream.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.530
He's like, "Now tell me the first five, the
first six numbers that come right to your

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.530
head right now."

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.840
And he says, "Uhh, I don't know.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.430
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one."

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.870
"You'll have to do better than that."

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.890
And they haul him off.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:09.900
Well, that five, two, eight, four, nine, one
starts showing up in the dream after that

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.730
again and again and again.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.400
It's the combination of both safes in Eames'
snow fortress dream.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.230
It's the fake telephone number that Eames
gives as the sexy blonde and it's also in

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.730
Arthur's hotel dream.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.170
In addition, Mal and Cobb's anniversary suite
number, where she jumps from the window is

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.100
three, five, oh, two.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.940
That number is also on the train that barrels
down through the middle of the street and

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.100
the taxi they hail in that dream is two, zero,
five, three.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.100
It's that same number backwards.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.210
So, there's a napkin.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.070
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.230
That's the phone number that the sexy blonde
gives Fischer.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.700
There's the hotel room numbers in Arthur's
hotel room dream.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.210
Five, two, eight, and four, nine, one.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:58.649
And then if you were to look at Fischer put
in the combination for the safe, you see there

00:15:58.649 --> 00:16:02.990
five, two, eight, four, nine, one for the
safe that is in the snow fortress.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.610
It's hard to see here 'cause the picture isn't
very good, but you'd see three, five, oh,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.610
two here on the door.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.380
Especially if you have it in Blu-Ray, you
can see the three.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.380
five, oh, two there.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.150
You can see the three, five, oh, two on the
train there, as it barrels down through the

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.310
middle of the city street.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:20.950
And then, the two, zero, five, three on the
taxi that they hailed in that same dream.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.630
Subconscious elements worked their way through.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.670
Well, another subconscious element has worked
its way through.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:33.370
Both at the beginning and ending of the film,
we see that Saito dreams of a mansion on an

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:39.020
ocean--a house, as it is described in the
script, "a house on a cliff."

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.920
When Cobb returns to his children at the end
of the film and asks them what they have been

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.680
doing, they say, "They are building a house
on a cliff."

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.540
Turn the captions on and you'll see it right
there in black and white.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:02.820
It looks like a subconscious element of Saito--Saito's
subconscious--is working its way through into

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.120
the dream that is at the end of the film.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.510
It's working its way through.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.449
Peeking out that subconscious.

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:11.990
Now, why think that Cobb is in Saito's dream
specifically?

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.360
Not his own dream or someone else's dream?

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.850
Well, here's the thing.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.650
Think about where, if you exit Limbo.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.380
If you commit suicide in Limbo, where do you
go?

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:28.550
Well, we only actually have two examples in
the film of where you go when you exit Limbo.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.720
And that's Ariadne and Fischer.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.000
At the end of the film, they go down there
to find Fischer.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.040
She kicks him off the building.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.140
He falls and he wakes up.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.190
And a little bit later, she throws herself
off.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.190
She falls.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.190
She wakes up.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.190
But where did they go?

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.150
Back to the real world?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.150
No.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.480
They go one layer up.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.670
They go to the snow fortress dream--Eames'
snow fortress dream.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:51.291
They go one layer up and then Fischer finishes
the inception there.

00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:54.860
And when Ariadne gets back, they ride the
kicks back up the layers.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.260
But you only go one layer up when you exit
Limbo, not back to the real world--not all

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.380
the way back to the front.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.630
One layer up.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.810
That's it.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.940
So, at the end of the film--you can barely
see the picture there--but at the end of the

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.410
film, whenever Saito, when Cobb finds Saito
in Limbo and he's got his gun, if he were

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.530
to shoot himself in the head, where would
he go?

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.450
Or wouldn't he go where everyone else goes
when they exit Limbo, one layer up.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.290
And that would be to Eames' snow fortress
dream.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.000
But everyone's already left that dream layer.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.840
So, he would find it empty, ready for the
taking.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.200
He would fill it with his own expectations,
his own assumptions, his own subconscious,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.680
and that would be to find himself on the plane
after the inception was complete.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.590
Once Cobb shoots himself after that, he would
pop up to that same level, find Saito's airplane

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.010
dream and would go back to his kids in that
airplane dream.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:51.730
And notice that they could be there for ten
years--the way dreams work--before they finally

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.760
realize that they were still dreaming.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.679
So it's entirely possible, based on a consistent
interpretation of the film, that Cobb was

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:01.679
still dreaming.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.620
Even if the top fell he would still be dreaming.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.450
He'd be in Saito's dream as a dream that he
created once he got Eames' snow fortress dream

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:13.610
layer that was empty once he woke up from
Limbo only going one layer up.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.170
So, Inception is more complicated than you
think.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.860
What's clever about the ending is not the
fact that it's a clever cliffhanger.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.360
It's clever because it tricked you into thinking
it was a clever cliffhanger when it wasn't

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.980
a cliffhanger at all.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.720
You should've already suspected that he was
still dreaming and realize that the top was

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.460
a red herring.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.880
That's what's clever about it.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.480
Nolan misdirected it.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.580
At first, you were confused.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.330
Then, you thought you had it figured out.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.110
But then, you start to think about it and
everything you thought you figured out, you're

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.790
not confused about, you actually misunderstood.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.790
That's what's beautiful about it.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.140
It lends itself to multiple interpretations.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.180
Are we convinced that it was better than The
King's Speech yet?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.180
[laughter]

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.970
Come on.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.790
But we've only scratched the surface.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:03.370
If we think about Saito and where you go when
you exit Limbo, if when you exit Limbo you

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.930
just go one layer up, like Ariadne and Fischer
did.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:12.590
Then where did Mal and Cobb go when they exited
Limbo, when they put their head on the train

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.010
tracks and they exited Limbo?

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.660
Would they have done what everybody else does?

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.210
Go one layer up?

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.090
Well, what would be on that layer?

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.929
Would that be the real world?

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:27.260
Well, Cobb actually tells Ariadne, whenever
he's recounting the events that preceded their

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.799
meeting, that they entered Limbo after experimenting
with--.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.620
Let me get the quote exactly right here.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.400
"After exploring the concept of a dream within
a dream."

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.490
They were doing multi-level dreaming and he
pushed them too far.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.420
He went too deep and they landed in Limbo.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.180
But that means that they entered Limbo after
going through a multi-level dream.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.760
So, when they woke up from Limbo, where would
they have gone?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.760
Would they have just gone one layer up of
that multi-level dream?

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.750
We see them awake on this apartment floor
hooked up to a passive device, but is that

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.929
the real world or wouldn't that just be the
lowest level of the multi-level dream they

00:21:05.929 --> 00:21:09.260
used to get into Limbo in the first place?

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:14.720
The real world in which the whole plot of
the movie takes place could actually be a

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.720
dream.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.140
Maybe the whole movie is a dream from beginning
to end.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.660
Forget about the end.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.059
The whole movie looks like it may be a dream.

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:29.400
And in fact, Nolan leaves us many clues that
suggest exactly this.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.270
So, if you look at the Mombasa chase scene
that's supposed to happen in the real world,

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.650
it has very many dream-like elements.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.730
The overhead shots establish that Mombasa
is like a maze.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:44.549
The agents that are after him literally pop
in and out of nowhere inexplicably.

00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:50.700
And the walls of buildings literally close
in around him just like they do in dreams.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.040
So, we see that it Mombasa is like a maze.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.059
We see Cobol agents that come out of nowhere.

00:21:56.059 --> 00:21:59.690
It's a blurry pic, but if you look at when
he's in the cafe and he gets called out and

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.350
he starts to run, literally from out of nowhere,
there's an agent that comes and tackles him

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.350
from the right.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.350
There's no way.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.559
He was just there.

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:11.220
Literally appearing out of nowhere [whispering]
just like they do in dreams.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.280
And the walls close in around him.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.790
They look like they're fine here and as I
try to go through it squeezes and squeezes

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.800
and the walls literally are closing in around
me.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.420
Just like they do in dreams.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:27.370
Eames--clue number two--Eames is a dream forger,
but looks like he forges in reality.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:32.100
Eames as a dream forger, appearing as others
in dreams and magically lifting Fischer's

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.330
wallet in Arthur's hotel room dream as the
sexy blonde.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:41.720
If you look closely, whenever he's lifting
his wallet in the hotel room dream, he doesn't

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.720
actually touch him.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.040
He doesn't actually get anywhere close to
him.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040
He just has the wallet.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.040
It just appears.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040
Which is fine.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040
He's dreaming.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040
He can do that.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040
He's a dream forger.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.040
He can just forge the wallet.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:58.400
Yet in the real world, Eames forges casino
chips and he lifts Fischer's passport in the

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.690
airplane in exactly the same way.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:07.790
So, Eames picks pockets in the real world
just like he does in a dream without even

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.179
touching him.

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.400
Watch the scene and you'll see he can't even
come close.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400
It's like, Eames is there.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400
They're sort of close.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.290
And the poof, he has the passport inexplicably.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.890
Eames bets his last two chips in the real
world and the script calls them his last two

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:22.890
chips.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.890
And he's broke.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.549
He even says, "You've gotta buy if we're gonna
bring over beer.

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:26.570
You gotta buy."

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.220
And then he goes to the cashier and just magically
poof, here's chips.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.410
Cashes them in.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.190
He's literally dream-forging right there in
the real world.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.740
The script even describes it.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.210
He mysteriously produces two stacks of chips
that he then cashes in.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.600
Clue number three.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.240
Mal's suicide.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.590
You can't see it here.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:51.860
Consider where Mal sits during her suicide
attempt.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:58.480
What supposedly happened was she trashed their
hotel suite and then climbed out on the ledge.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.920
But if she did that, she would be on the same
side of the building as their room.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.540
He would be able to look out the window and
look and she would be out there on their side

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.540
of the building.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.140
That's not where she's at.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.890
She's in the window of another hotel room
across the way.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:15.890
And it is another hotel room.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.790
If you look behind her, you'll see the same
things that are behind Cobb.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.790
It's another hotel.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.190
I mean, the window of another hotel room.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.360
That doesn't make any sense.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.000
How did she get over there?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.230
And in fact, Cobb doesn't even realize it
doesn't make sense.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.200
He's asking her, "Please come back in.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.560
Come back in."

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.809
As she can just walk across that gap?

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:36.130
It doesn't make any sense.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.210
That's exactly the kind of thing that you
watch and you don't really think about it,

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.340
but then you think about it a little bit later
and that doesn't make much sense.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.740
Just like in a dream.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.910
Weird things happen in dreams and they seem
perfectly normal, but then when you wake up

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.010
you go, "Yeah, that didn't make much sense.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.360
How did I not know that I wasn't dreaming?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.530
How did I not know that I was dreaming?"

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.040
How do you not know that he wasn't dreaming
right there?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.410
He's gotta be.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:01.240
His father-in-law, Miles, even tells him to
"come back to reality," at one point.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.940
And this is my favorite clue.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:08.030
The song the dreamers use to herald the end
of a movie is that Edith Piaf song that we

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.919
listened to before.

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:12.260
It means "No, I regret nothing" in English.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.669
When the song is done, the dream is over.

00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:14.669
That's what heralds the end of the dreams.

00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:16.140
The song is done, dream is over.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.460
The running time of the original recording
of that song that they use in the film is

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.190
two minutes and 28 seconds.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:30.100
Inception is, to the second, two hours and
28 minutes long.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.190
Exactly.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.190
Watch your Blu-Ray player.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.740
Watch it click down.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.800
Exactly two hours and 28 minutes long.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.679
Could it be, just like with shared dreaming,
when the movie is done and the song is done,

00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:43.929
the dream is over?

00:25:43.929 --> 00:25:47.370
The entire movie, I think, is a dream.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:52.470
Now, the thing is, you can't--.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.050
There's always two sides to every coin.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.870
No clue is gonna settle this one way or the
other.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.919
And there are clues that suggest that the
real world is indeed real.

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.700
This is a good Nolan--.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.309
Anybody know where this is from?

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:05.960
It's a Batman reference 'cause no one does
Batman

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960
Two.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.980
But there's two sides to every coin.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.740
Let's look at a couple of clues that the real
world may actually be real.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:16.160
So for example, if you look at Cobb's kids,
whenever he's flashing back they're younger.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.610
And at the end, they're actually wearing slightly
different clothes and they're older.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.169
And they're actually played by different actors
and actresses.

00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:24.200
Two different actors there.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.280
So, some may suggest that they really did
age and he's back in the real world.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.809
Others have suggested that Cobb's totem is
not really the top.

00:26:32.809 --> 00:26:37.049
It's his wedding ring and that whenever he's
in the real world he doesn't wear the wedding

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:38.360
ring, except the flashbacks.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.580
And then when he's dreaming, he's still wearing
the wedding ring.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.330
And this includes the end of the movie.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.631
If you look at the end of the movie, whenever
he's checking in with the ISA agent, he's

00:26:46.631 --> 00:26:47.820
not wearing his wedding ring.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.000
That's gonna indicate that the end of the
movie is also real.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.760
But the truth is, pointing to the movie and
clues in the movie is never going to settle

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.000
anything.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.410
The movie is ambiguous and Nolan, himself,
has admitted that he intentionally made it

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:04.410
ambiguous.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.960
It's supposed to be open to interpretation.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.549
Nothing will definitively prove anything one
way or the other.

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:12.460
The dream clues could merely indicate that
Cobb is losing his grip on reality.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.690
But now the dream clues could merely reflect
Cobb's assumption that he's not dreaming when

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.370
he really is.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.910
The answer to the question of whether or not
the entire movie is a dream is what philosophers

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.730
would call "under-determined."

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.169
There's not enough evidence there to settle
the issue.

00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:31.070
But this is where philosophy can come to the
rescue.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.500
Philosophers and scientists know how to deal
with under-determination.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:41.310
For example, any scientific data can be accounted
for by many possible hypotheses.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.780
But we're not just stuck.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.660
We have ways of delineating and deciding which
ones we should prefer.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.360
Scientists prefer the most adequate hypothesis,
the one that's most fruitful and simple and

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.039
wide-scoping and conservative.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:54.100
[Kyle Johnson coughs]

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.470
Excuse me.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.299
This is what we did whenever we were debating
about the heliocentric versus the geocentric

00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:03.350
view of the universe, or the solar system
at least.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.620
Is the sun the center or the Earth the center?

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.220
Well, the Earth being the center required
all these weird retrogrades and planets were

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.970
revolving around points and blah, blah, blah.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:11.970
And it's really complicated.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:12.970
Or this was simple.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:13.970
They all go around the sun.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:14.970
Very simple.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.780
And so, we ended up selecting that, after
we killed a few people.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.780
Apart from that--

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.780
[laughter]

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:25.120
we ended up selecting this even before we
could experimentally identify that it was

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.289
definitely the right one as opposed to this
because it was simpler, because it was more

00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:30.380
adequate.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.380
And so, philosophers--.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.020
We really can't do that with an interpretation
of Inception.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.820
And philosophers have more guns in our arsenal.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.730
Philosophers, when presented with ambiguity,
like ambiguous statements--that kind of stuff--we

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.660
employ the principle of charity.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:49.220
When it's unclear what someone means, you
choose the most charitable interpretation--the

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.410
one that entails the speaker is not an idiot,
or not misinformed.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:57.050
So, which interpretation of Inception is more
charitable?

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.820
Which one makes it a better movie?

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.990
I think it's the all-dream interpretation
that makes it better.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:09.960
And the reason why is because if it's not
all a dream, there's some significant criticisms

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.270
that can be leveled against the movie.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:17.630
For one, all of the characters, except for
Cobb, are completely one-dimensional.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.000
Arthur, Ariadne, Fischer, Saito.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.429
They don't even have last names, much less
a past.

00:29:26.429 --> 00:29:28.340
They're all just there for Cobb.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.020
They just do what Cobb wants them to do.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.000
Even Ariadne, who shows just a little sliver
of free will when she initially rejects the

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.600
idea of being an architect--"I'm outta here.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.490
I can't share my subconscious with someone
like you."--and she walks out.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.960
Cobb just says, "Oh, she'll be back."

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.960
And then what does she do?

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.960
The next thing?

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.340
She comes back.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.860
They're completely one-dimensional.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.910
They're only there for Cobb.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.100
That's not good writing and Nolan doesn't
usually do one-dimensional characters.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.549
Even, somebody gives me Batman's, his butler.

00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:00.460
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Alfred.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.370
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Alfred.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.370
Right.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.390
Even Alfred's got a past and he's a complicated
character in Batman.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.780
That's not Nolan's style.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.860
The editing in the real world is sloppy.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.919
There's quick jumps from here to there and
you're not quite sure how you got from here

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.370
to there and why are they doing this now?

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:22.590
There's all these really weird jumps in the
real world in regards to just mere editing.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:27.670
And that chase scene in Mombasa and he's got
all the agents on him and then Saito shows

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.990
up out of nowhere.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.010
What are you doing in Mombasa?

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.190
"I had to protect my investment."

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:32.220
Really?

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:36.340
That's a little cheesy.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.120
That's not exactly the best way out of that
situation.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.410
But if it's all a dream, the characters are
one-dimensional because they're just projections

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.350
of Cobb's subconscious.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.780
They each represent a different aspect of
Cobb.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.780
And if you watch the movie with that in mind,
you'll see that each one of them plays a different

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.980
role in his subconscious.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.980
One's the planner.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.250
One's more daring.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.250
One's the moral conscious.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.980
You can even divide it in id, ego, and superego.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.720
You see all of these elements.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.760
The sloppy editing?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.020
Well, we see that same sloppy editing when
we know that Cobb is dreaming.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.360
You jump from place to place to place in a
dream not realizing how you got there because

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.670
that's what you do in dreams.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:20.010
He's doing the same thing in the real world,
jumping from place to place to place.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.690
And yeah, that Saito line is a little bit
cheesy--I have to protect my investment.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:29.500
But as a subtle clue that Cobb is actually
dreaming, that is brilliant.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.730
A much more charitable interpretation.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:37.750
Now, you might think that it's not too charitable
'cause if the whole movie is a dream, well

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.850
then why would you care?

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.460
Why would I want to watch a movie about a
dream?

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.600
Nothing's really happing so I don't really
care.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.880
Well, that's the thing.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.590
It's a movie.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.590
It's fiction.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.520
Yeah, it doesn't really happen 'cause it's
a dream.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.520
It doesn't happen anyway.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.520
It's a movie.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.520
[laughter]

00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.240
Why would you care more about a movie about
a dream than about a fictional movie about

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.950
events that didn't happen anyway?

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.120
They all didn't happen.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.030
This is the paradox of fiction that Tyler
was talking about a little while ago.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.500
Why do we care about events that we don't
know are happening?

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.750
Well, I'm not exactly sure how to solve that
paradox, but I know that the paradox arises

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.060
whether or not the movie is about a dream
or not.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.440
And so, it doesn't make it a worse movie.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.549
In fact, it makes it pretty cool 'cause it
could be a metaphorical story about how a

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:22.600
disturbed mind handles its own dementia.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.679
I mean, there's all kinds of cool interpretations
that can go with it I think that are really,

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:28.170
really interesting.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:33.770
Now, you might wonder if we could solve all
this if we just asked Nolan himself.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:34.770
[laughter]

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.350
Is the whole movie a dream or not?

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.441
And Nolan's even said that he does have a
view.

00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:43.370
Like, I approached him with a certain interpretation
in mind and I know what I think is real and

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.240
what's not.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.429
But does that matter?

00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:51.980
Does Nolan get to dictate how his film must
be interpreted?

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.650
Or, if he makes it ambiguous, is it open to
us?

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.791
If he wanted it to be interpreted a certain
way, he had to put in something there to make

00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:00.230
it be interpreted that way.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:05.299
And if he intentionally makes it ambiguous,
then my interpretation is just as valid as

00:33:05.299 --> 00:33:06.299
his.

00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:08.510
Is that the way art works?

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.420
Or does authorial intention matter?

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.710
That's what the first chapter of my book is
about.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.200
It raises this issue about whether or not
the entire movie is a dream and then talks

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.240
about whether or not the authorial intention
view is correct.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.010
Inception should have won Best Picture.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:30.419
Either the Academy didn't understand it or
they didn't interpret it charitably.

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:35.549
If they had done either, they would have realized
that it was much better than a film about

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:38.960
a stuttering English monarch.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.230
Clearly a better film.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:45.450
But even though it didn't win Best Picture,
Inception still wins Plato's Academy Award--it

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:49.980
looks like Rodin's Thinker--because of its
philosophical depth, because of the plethora

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:54.200
of philosophical questions that it raises
and, of course, I tackle in my book, "Inception

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.720
and Philosophy: Because It's Never Just a
Dream,” published by Wiley Blackwell.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.220
So, some of the other--not all of them--but
some of the other topics that we cover in

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.220
the book.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:08.040
If we can't tell whether or not Cobb is dreaming,
can we tell whether we're dreaming... right

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.079
now?

00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:10.490
Could this be a dream?

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.750
Can you be certain?

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.179
The answer is no, you can't.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:17.379
This is a classic, philosophical, skeptical
problem.

00:34:17.379 --> 00:34:21.700
And once we realize we can't tell for sure
whether the real world is real, how do we

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.950
deal with that angst?

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:29.230
How do we deal with the kind of tension, the
kind of mental anguish that causes us?

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.739
Coleman's got a chapter about that.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:33.319
Perhaps we should just have faith that the
world is real.

00:34:33.319 --> 00:34:35.769
Maybe that's a way out of it.

00:34:35.769 --> 00:34:37.619
But when is faith rational?

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:38.700
Is faith ever rational?

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.440
Faith is belief without evidence.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.480
A lot of times, that's not rational.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.310
Like, I could believe without evidence that
there's an elephant behind me, but that's

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.969
not rational.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.629
When is faith, if ever, rational?

00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:53.190
Cobb doesn't think it's always rational.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.399
Mal asked him to take a leap of faith right
out that window and he refused.

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:59.529
So, when is it rational to take a leap of
faith, if ever?

00:34:59.529 --> 00:35:02.979
That's what my chapter is about.

00:35:02.979 --> 00:35:08.299
Can you be held morally responsible for what
you do in your dreams?

00:35:08.299 --> 00:35:11.079
You might think they don't have real-world
impact, but what if you thought it was real?

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:15.770
Don't sometimes your intentions matter if
you thought it was real and you had that chance

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.440
to cheat on your significant other in your
dream and you did it?

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.489
Aren't you a bit morally culpable?

00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:24.539
Wouldn't they be upset if they found out that's
what you did in your dream?

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:26.210
That's another good chapter.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.630
Are real paradoxes, like the pin rose steps,
possible?

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.789
That's Tyler's chapter.

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:33.769
Is Inception really possible?

00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:36.190
Isn't that, for example, what advertisements
do?

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.069
And if it is possible, what are the kind of
ethics that go along with that?

00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:40.890
And does that threaten free will?

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.700
We don't think that Fischer gets moral responsibility.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.510
He doesn't freely choose to break up his father's
company.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.680
But if inception happens all the time in the
real world, are we morally responsible for

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.680
what we do?

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.559
Do I really freely choose to eat that McDonald's
hamburger when I'm bombarded with advertisements

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:57.349
all the time that make me want a McDonald's
hamburger?

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:59.969
What is time?

00:35:59.969 --> 00:36:06.779
What exactly is time and can it really slow
down in a dream, or speed up in a dream?

00:36:06.779 --> 00:36:11.200
Would you really want to live in Limbo, a
utopia, a perfect world?

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.609
Or would you eventually get bored with that?

00:36:14.609 --> 00:36:16.259
Are utopias even possible?

00:36:16.259 --> 00:36:21.829
Those are all issues that I talk about--that
I and my authors, of course--, my contributors

00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:25.109
talk about in the book.

00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:27.589
So, that's my presentation and I thank you
so much.

00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:29.099
I'm ready for questions.

00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:34.329
I'd love to hear what you think.

00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:35.329
[applause]

00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:38.809
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: I'm just curious.

00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:44.780
You mentioned Freudian psychology or it sounded
more Freudian, but I have a writing teacher

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.819
who really got enthralled with it.

00:36:47.819 --> 00:36:50.460
He actually has a really good blog.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.740
His name is Scott Myers and he was talking
about it from a Jungian perspective with the

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.950
dream interpretation and it seems to lend
itself a lot to that.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.759
I'm just wondering if you get into that in
your book at all.

00:37:02.759 --> 00:37:03.759
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: No.

00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:04.759
I'm sorry.

00:37:04.759 --> 00:37:05.759
I don't.

00:37:05.759 --> 00:37:06.759
I'm not familiar with it at all.

00:37:06.759 --> 00:37:09.650
I wish I would've known about it so I could,
but I don't.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.729
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Well, you might, since you're
so into this, you might look into some Jungian

00:37:13.729 --> 00:37:14.729
stuff.

00:37:14.729 --> 00:37:15.771
I can give you a list of books or whatever.

00:37:15.771 --> 00:37:16.771
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Great.

00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:17.771
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Yeah, cool.

00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:18.771
OK.

00:37:18.771 --> 00:37:19.771
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Cool.

00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:20.771
Thanks.

00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:21.771
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: That's OK.

00:37:21.771 --> 00:37:22.771
I don't need a mic.

00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:29.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You do for the recording.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:34.210
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: OK.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:38.289
I was wondering if you had a link to the Power
Point presentation at all.

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.259
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: I'm sure we can do that.

00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:41.259
I could--.

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.259
I'll tell you what.

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:45.920
When I get home, I will post it on my website,
so just google David Kyle Johnson.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.259
My webpage for King's College will pop up
and you can download it there.

00:37:49.259 --> 00:37:52.059
Cliff, can we make it available somehow through--?

00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:53.059
&gt;&gt;Cliff: Yeah.

00:37:53.059 --> 00:37:54.359
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: OK.

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:55.359
Awesome.

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:59.319
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Yeah, I'm hoping that I almost
bombarded you a bit.

00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:02.730
And really, almost everything I covered in
there is in here.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.730
So.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:09.170
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: So, how many times did you have
to watch the movie to get all this?

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.170
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:11.170
That's a good question.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.729
So, quite a few times.

00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:17.540
I also took to just watching specific parts
as I was editing the book and seeing what

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.089
I needed to see.

00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:21.630
A number of other things were also, like--.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.150
Here's I think a really fun, cool part of
the book.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.999
If you add up all the times that all my contributors
and I watched the movie, it's gotta be hundreds

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:31.269
and hundreds and hundreds of times.

00:38:31.269 --> 00:38:37.369
And one of the ways I took advantage of that
was I created a Google Doc--Google Docs are

00:38:37.369 --> 00:38:40.969
so cool--and I gave a link to every one of
my contributors.

00:38:40.969 --> 00:38:45.589
And I started a little appendix of cool things
that you might have missed about the film.

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:48.480
And I let all my contributors just dump stuff
on there.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.329
And after they were done, I went through and
edited.

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:54.059
And so, the end of the book is an appendix
that is the result of like, hundreds and hundreds

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:58.130
and hundreds of watchings of the movie that
have all these cool, little things that you

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.390
may have missed upon the first watching of
the film.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:12.109
So, off the top of my head, a cool one is
the fact that Dom--one second--Dom, Robert,

00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:21.170
Eames, Arthur, Mal, Saito, put them in the
right order, they spell dreams.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.130
Those kind of cool things.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.710
The stuff about Inception being analogy.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.920
There's all kinds of stuff.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.059
We even have a catalog of exactly what those
two kids were wearing before and after, at

00:39:32.059 --> 00:39:34.930
the end of the movie and see exactly how different
their outfits were.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.089
It's very, very detailed.

00:39:36.089 --> 00:39:37.890
That's in the appendix.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:38.890
Go ahead.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.920
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: So, about the kids.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.349
You didn't mention this specifically, but
I suspect you probably did turn it up that

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:47.430
you never see the kid's faces until the end.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.430
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Right.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.430
Until the end.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.430
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: So, I don't know what the significance
of that might be.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.430
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:52.979
I mean, that could be a clue that he's really
awake.

00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:55.740
It could be just a clue that he thinks he's
really gotten back home.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.460
And so, he can finally see his kid's faces
at the end.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.950
I mean, it could be a clue either way.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:01.950
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Cool.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:08.160
So, the other deeper question that I had is
I read that clue about the wedding ring months

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.160
ago.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.239
I don't know if you read "The Last Psychiatrist."

00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:11.239
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: I don't think so.

00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:12.239
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: It's a great blog.

00:40:12.239 --> 00:40:13.819
It's worth checking out.

00:40:13.819 --> 00:40:15.680
But he did a thing in there where he mentioned
it.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.009
And so, I was talking this over with a bunch
of friends and one of them had to watch the

00:40:19.009 --> 00:40:20.309
movie again.

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:27.130
And his claim, the way he interpreted that,
was that Cobb actually destroyed his totem

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.049
in the real world.

00:40:29.049 --> 00:40:32.950
Because he knew it so well, he didn't need
to actually have it present.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:38.759
He only knew that it behaved the way he didn't
expect it in the dream, then he was in someone

00:40:38.759 --> 00:40:39.759
else's dream.

00:40:39.759 --> 00:40:41.430
And there's no reason to actually have it.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:46.049
And the whole thing about having Mal's totem
was just in remembrance of her and wasn't

00:40:46.049 --> 00:40:47.049
actually his totem.

00:40:47.049 --> 00:40:48.049
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Interesting.

00:40:48.049 --> 00:40:49.049
So, he doesn't have a totem at all.

00:40:49.049 --> 00:40:51.210
So, his wedding ring's not even his totem,
or his wedding ring is his totem?

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.930
He destroys it in the real world.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:53.930
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: His wedding ring was--.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.160
He doesn't need it because he knows how it
behaves and he doesn't want anyone else to

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.300
discover it, is one way of interpreting that.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.300
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Right.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.920
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: And I don't know if that's actually--.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.859
I don't know if that affects anything said
actually.

00:41:03.859 --> 00:41:05.599
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: I mean, it still doesn’t
cause--.

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:08.630
It still doesn't solve the problem because
he could still be in his own dream.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:09.799
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Yeah.

00:41:09.799 --> 00:41:12.920
But it's an interesting thing though about
that.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.089
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:15.089
Absolutely.

00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:20.009
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: Did you circle back with Christopher
Nolan to validate any of your observations?

00:41:20.009 --> 00:41:22.359
&gt;&gt;Kyle Johnson: No, I haven't.

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:23.359
I wish I could.

00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:25.719
I'd love to sit down and talk with Christopher
Nolan.

00:41:25.719 --> 00:41:26.829
I wasn't able to do that.

00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:31.319
We did scope through his interviews and that
kind of stuff to see what he said.

00:41:31.319 --> 00:41:36.520
So like, one thing I know then--but this raises
the issue of whether or not Arthur can determine

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.269
the meaning of his movie or not--one thing
I know is, one other kind of dream clue is

00:41:40.269 --> 00:41:44.349
the fact that the company that's after Cobb
is Cobol.

00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:45.349
C-O-B-O-L.

00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:46.509
Cobol, Cobb, Cobol.

00:41:46.509 --> 00:41:47.789
He's after himself?

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:49.249
That really looks--.

00:41:49.249 --> 00:41:51.369
And Nolan himself said, "Yeah, that's just
a coincidence.

00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:55.009
We had to change the name of that company
multiple times for legal reasons."

00:41:55.009 --> 00:41:57.609
It looks like that's just a coincidence, not
really a clue.

00:41:57.609 --> 00:41:58.609
Right?

00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:01.809
But again, maybe it could still serve as a
clue if the author doesn't get to determine

00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:03.920
the absolute meaning of his film.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.920
But I wish--.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:15.140
If you've got some contacts, let me know and
I'd love to sit down and talk with him.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.140
[laughter]

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.609
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Last question.

00:42:18.609 --> 00:42:26.880
&gt;&gt; MALE #4: So, do you think the fact that
Mal's and Edith Piaf was both played by Marion

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.579
Cotillard was also a clue?

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:30.209
&gt;&gt; Kyle Johnson: I don't think it was a clue.

00:42:30.209 --> 00:42:31.880
No one actually talked about that as well.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.510
And he basically said something like, I don't
read too much in this.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.200
It's kind of a cool thing.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.251
But don't read too much into it.

00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:38.251
It's not--.

00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:39.251
But that is--.

00:42:39.251 --> 00:42:43.270
The actress who plays Mal also plays Edith
Piaf in the movie about her life.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:44.599
It's the same actress.

00:42:44.599 --> 00:42:45.599
She's pretty cool.

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.880
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Very cool.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.039
We'll have some time afterwards for more specific
Inception and Dragon Tattoo questions.

00:42:51.039 --> 00:42:52.309
Thank you very much for speaking at Google.

00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:53.309
&gt;&gt; Kyle Johnson: Thanks.

00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.310
[Applause]
