00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is subtle. I would actually prefer the red path.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The reason is as the robot is facing the right side over here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
it can't take a 45-degree turn onto the green path.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It should slowly move around the corner, go down here, and slowly move to the right.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The greet path might be shorter, but it requires two 45-degree instantaeous turns,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which are unfeasible for the robot.

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
To some extent, we'd like to find a smooth path that is executable by the robot.
