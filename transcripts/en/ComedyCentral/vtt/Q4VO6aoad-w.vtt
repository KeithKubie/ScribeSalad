00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.806
Hey man. Ah, yeah I've been
thinking about it.

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:07.074
It's too soon.
I can't do this.

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.476
Aww, come on mate,
it's been three months.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.978
Alright, it's time
to get back out there.

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.179
It's just a date, it's not like

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.947
you're going into
the Hunger Games.

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:15.916
Alright, I'm just
going to say it.

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.652
It's weird that you're always
referencing your own movies.

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:21.488
Oh, sassy Josh, you are
catching fire, buddy.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.625
Yeah, see like that
doesn't make any sense.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.026
Just remember two things: 
be yourself

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.461
and always compliment her nose.

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:28.762
It's a classic Hemsworth
one-two-punch.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.963
That worked with Miley?

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.832
Listen, I'll be right there
with you. Fly, Mockingjay!

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.700
Wait, I have one other-

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.845
Hey. Sara?

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.046
That's me.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.481
I'm Josh.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.682
I like your sweater.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.285
Thank you. I love your nose.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.821
Did you just say you
like my nose?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.659
No. Excuse me, though. Sorry.
Hey.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.494
How's it going?
Did you do the nose thing yet?

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.695
She loved it, didn't she?

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.131
What are you talking about?
We just talked five seconds ago.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.700
Yeah, I know,
I'm just so excited.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.802
Hey, tell her
you love her scarf.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.504
Okay, I'm going to go now.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.074
Wait a second, how did you-
Ah!

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:18.445
It's me. Get back to her,
you're doing good.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:26.320
I'm sorry. I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.855
What I meant to say of course
is I love your scarf.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.760
Thank you. I like your taste.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.129
This is good, okay.
Good.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:39.032
Josh. Josh. Josh.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.600
What the fuck are you
doing down there?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.302
Did you mention the scarf yet?

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.105
Ask her if she seen
Love Song.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.406
Please stay out of this.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.774
Girls love the Love
Song, I was in it.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.643
I know. I know you were in that.

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:52.045
You're ruining this for me.
Stay down, stay down.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.513
He's talking to his penis.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.248
Why do I always get
the psychopaths?

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.550
I need you to stay down there.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.186
If I need you later
I will call you, okay?

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:05.592
Let's order, we should order.
Waiter.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.795
Ah, I see you're ready
to order Josh.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.130
I mean, complete stranger.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.934
Ah, isn't it romantic.
You two must be on a date.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.737
Isn't it Romantic is actually
a new film, by the way.

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.071
Yeah, we know that.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.207
I didn't know that and I
don't care.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:23.744
Bullshit. How's Josh doing,
he's such a good guy isn't he?

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.445
Josh, wait wait wait.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.581
My friend, Liam.

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:30.083
This is just a costume,
I'm not really a waiter.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.085
Just like in the movies.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.721
Just giving my friend
Josh a little dating help here.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.392
You were Cyrano de
Bergerac-ing me?

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.093
Oh Latin! She's a smart one.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.830
Hey, did Josh compliment
your nose yet?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.067
Excuse me, Liam. I'm just going
to go to the restroom.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.342
She's going the wrong way.
She's actually using the exit.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.543
Yep, there she goes.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:57.944
Or she's going to pee
in the street.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.913
That's a bit weird,
isn't it?

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.915
You don't need
something like anyway.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:04.885
Come on, let's get
some beers on you, eh?

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.287
Waiter? Real waiter?

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.127
Hey, who's your favorite
Hemsworth?

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:17.798
You're in the top three.

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:19.499
That's good.
