the animation style let's talk about

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110
the animation style let's talk about
 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.290
the animation style let's talk about
that really quick so I think it was

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300
that really quick so I think it was
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.029
that really quick so I think it was
pretty solid but there was a few times

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039
pretty solid but there was a few times
 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.830
pretty solid but there was a few times
where it kind of everyone seems sort of

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840
where it kind of everyone seems sort of
 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.540
where it kind of everyone seems sort of
off the model like the heads got really

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550
off the model like the heads got really
 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.519
off the model like the heads got really
small a couple times in the bodies sort

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529
small a couple times in the bodies sort
 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:26.930
small a couple times in the bodies sort

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830
CGI like one sinestro's core like to the
 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.760
CGI like one sinestro's core like to the

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770
lander before that he makes the battery
 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.969
lander before that he makes the battery
yeah it makes some really exactly it

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979
yeah it makes some really exactly it
 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.909
yeah it makes some really exactly it
looked totally out of place sometimes

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919
looked totally out of place sometimes
 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.740
looked totally out of place sometimes
that's what killed me okay times the CGI

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750

I did love what there's a couple other
 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.610
I did love what there's a couple other
CG moments in here at the beginning I

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620
CG moments in here at the beginning I
 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.700
CG moments in here at the beginning I
think when house test flight simulator

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710

his sort of connection to earth and his

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:09.350
his sort of connection to earth and his
 

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.069
his sort of connection to earth and his
connection to Carroll and his nephews

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079
