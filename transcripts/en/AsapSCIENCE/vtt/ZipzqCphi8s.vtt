00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.819
Oh, dogs! A best friend that always has your
back - in fact, studies have shown that men

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.580
are 3 times more likely to get a girls phone
number if they have a dog by their side!

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.099
And do you ever feel like your dog just “gets”
you? It turns out that humans and dogs both

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.830
respond to emotional sounds. When your dog
hears you crying or laughing, the response

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.700
in their brain is similar to that of a human's.
In fact, they interpret your crying as another

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.870
dog whining.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.880
Which may make you want to cuddle your buddy
- but did you know that dogs often curl up

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.200
into a ball when sleeping to conserve body
heat and protect their most vulnerable organs

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.150
in the abdomen from predators? Comfy! If you’re
not always around to cuddle, leaving them

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.550
some clothes that smell like you will actually
help them with separation anxiety.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.940
And while you may think you have the smartest
dog, animal psychologists believe most dogs

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.680
are about as smart as a 2 year old human.
Dogs can understand more than 150 words, count

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.480
up to 5, and notice simple errors such as
1+1=3. Dogs are also capable of solving spatial

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.809
problems; they learn the location of hidden
treats, find the fastest route to the park

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.770
and operate mechanisms such as latches and
simple machines.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.090
And by the way, dogs aren’t completely colourblind
as many people think! But unlike the three

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.400
specialized receptors in our eyes to distinguish
colours, dogs only have two. Because of this,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.451
they see black, white, blue and yellow. Meanwhile,
their brains don’t interpret red and green,

00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:25.030
but instead see grey.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.149
Of the 75 million domesticated dogs in America,
labradors are the most popular, but the most

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.770
intelligent dog breeds are Border Collies,
Poodles, and German Shepherds. However, these

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.409
are measures of intelligence that compare
to our own; dogs are amazingly smart in other

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.499
ways. You’ve probably heard of drug sniffing
dogs, but did you know that dogs can sense

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.850
seizures, detect low blood sugar and can sniff
out cancer? In one study, dogs were able to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.909
identify 30 of 33 cases of prostate cancer
by smelling participant’s urine. It is believed

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.079
that dog’s highly sophisticated sense of
smell can detect variation and the presence

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.179
of volatile organic compounds.

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.030
Their sense of smell is 10,000 to 10,000,000
times more sensitive than humans depending

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.599
on the breed. A secreted fluid from their
nose helps them smell by capturing scent chemicals

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.750
in a thin layer of wet mucous on their nose.
In fact, for a dog, breathing is different

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.650
than smelling. A small fold of tissue called
the alar fold separates the flow of air depending

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.069
on whether they are sniffing or breathing.
Which also allows them to pick up pheromones

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.129
in the air to help locate and determine the
readiness of possible mates. Tinder for dogs!

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.959
On top of it all, humans really do love dogs!
A recent study found that dogs activate the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.290
same hormonal response that triggers us to
love and care for our own babies. Accompany

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.041
that with studies showing decreased stress
and anxiety, and it’s clear why they have

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:48.629
become such an important part of our lives.
They truly are Woman and Man’s best friend!

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.629
Unless you’re a cat lover...in which case
you should watch our scientific debate on

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.010
Cats vs Dogs, where we try and figure out
which precious pet is truly the best! Head

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.480
on over to that video to help us decide which
side wins!
