As well as adjusting type attributes.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.340
CSS can also be used for other graphical
effects, in particular using CSS for

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.400
shadows is supported by
all modern browsers and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.240
much better than using image hacks.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.119
Likewise for rounded corners,
gradient, and animations.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.170
Do be aware, however,
that there is a processing and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.470
rendering cost to using CSS shadows,
rounded corners, and so on.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.100
And this is especially
significant on mobile.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.050
So, if you really want these effects,
use CSS, but use them sparingly.
