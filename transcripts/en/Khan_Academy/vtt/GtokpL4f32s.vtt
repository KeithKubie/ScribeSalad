00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.249
- [Instructor] Sunil and his
friends have been using a group

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:06.580
messaging app for over a
year to chat with each other.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.390
He suspects that, on
average, they send more than

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.230
100 messages per day.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.830
Sunil takes a random sample of seven days

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.710
from their chat history and
records how many messages

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.700
were sent on those days.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.840
The sample data are
strongly skewed to the right

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.350
with a mean of 125 messages
and a standard deviation

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.770
of 44 messages.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.170
He wants to use these
sample data to conduct

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.736
a t test about the mean.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:39.610
Which conditions for performing this type

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.930
of significance test have been met?

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.590
So let's just think about
what's going on here.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.980
Sunil might have some
type of a null hypothesis.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.600
Maybe he got this 100, maybe
he read a magazine article

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.590
that says, that on average,
the average teenagers

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.850
sends a 100 text messages per day.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.780
And so maybe the null hypothesis
is that the mean amount

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.370
of messages per day that
he and his friend send,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.910
which was signified by
mu, maybe the null is 100,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.120
that they're no different
than all other teenagers.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.140
And maybe he suspects,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.790
and actually they say it right over here,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.723
his alternative hypothesis
would be what he suspects.

00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:17.723
That they send more than
100 text messages per day.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.280
And so what he does, is he takes a sample

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.370
from the population of
days, and there's over 365.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.500
They said they've been using
the group messaging app

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.970
for over a year.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.042
And he takes seven of those days.

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:34.730
So, n is equal to seven.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.930
And from that he calculates
sample statistics.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.280
He calculates the sample mean,
which is trying to estimate

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.650
the true population mean, right over here.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.910
And he also is able to calculate

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.050
a sample standard deviation.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.820
And what you do in a significance test

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760
is you say, well what is the probability

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.240
of getting this sample mean or
something even more extreme,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.260
assuming the null hypothesis.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.280
And if that probability is
below a preset threshold,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.420
then you would reject the null hypothesis

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.920
and it would suggest the alternative.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.510
But in order to feel good
about that significance test

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.124
and be able to even calculate
that p-value with confidence.

00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:19.170
There are conditions for performing

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.390
this type of significance test.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.460
The first is, that this
truly a random sample.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.490
And that's known as the random condition.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.290
And you've seen this before
when we did significance tests

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.518
with proportions, here
we're doing it with means.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:36.050
Population mean, sample
mean, in the past we did it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.910
with population proportion
and sample proportion.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.810
Well the random condition,
it says it right here,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.120
Sunil takes a random sample of seven days

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.310
from their chat history.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.307
They don't say how they did it,

00:02:46.307 --> 00:02:47.140
but we'll just take their word for it,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.520
that it was a random sample.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.611
The next condition is sometimes
known as the independence,

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:57.269
independence condition, and
that's that the individual

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.890
observations in our sample
are roughly independent.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.030
One way that they would
be independent for sure

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.990
is if Sunil is sampling with replacement.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.750
They don't say that,
but another condition,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.260
so either could have replacement,
sampling with replacement.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.360
Or another way where you
could feel it's roughly

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.740
independent is if you're
sample size is less than

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.740
or equal to 10% of the population.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.923
Now in this situation, he took seven,

00:03:28.923 --> 00:03:31.770
he took a sample size of seven.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.330
And then the population of
days, it says that they've been

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.520
using the group messaging
app for over a year.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.540
So they've been using
it for over 365 days.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.690
So seven is for sure less
than or equal to 10% of 365,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.500
which would be 36.5.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.227
So we meet this condition,
which allows us to meet

00:03:49.227 --> 00:03:51.107
the independence condition.

00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:53.110
Now the last condition is often known

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.550
as the normal condition.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.327
And this is to feel good that
the sampling distribution

00:03:58.327 --> 00:04:01.250
of the sample means, right over here,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.920
is approximately normal.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.720
And this is going to be
a little bit different

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.370
than what we saw with significance test

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.270
when we dealt with proportions.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.090
There's a few ways to feel good

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.020
that the sampling distribution
of the sample means

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.240
is normal.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.470
One is, is the underlying
parent population normal.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.470
So parent population normal.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.210
Now they don't tell us
anything that there's actually

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.906
a normal distribution
for the amount of time

00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:34.879
that they spend on a given day.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.670
So we don't know this one for sure.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.770
But sometimes you might.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.840
Another way is to feel
good that our sample size

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.560
is greater than or equal to 30.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.510
And this comes from the
central limit theorem

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.560
that then our sampling
distribution is going to be

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.010
roughly normal.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.205
But we see very clearly our
sample is not greater than

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:55.063
or equal to 30, so we don't
meet that constraint either.

00:04:55.063 --> 00:04:58.066
Now the third way that we could feel good

00:04:58.066 --> 00:05:00.359
that our sampling distribution
of our sample mean

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:04.848
is roughly normal, is if our sample,

00:05:04.848 --> 00:05:09.848
is if our sample is symmetric
and there are no outliers,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.800
or maybe say no significance outliers.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.060
Now is this the case?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.750
Well it says right over here,
the sample data are strongly

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.830
skewed to the right with
a mean of 125 messages

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.000
and a standard deviation of 44 messages.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.230
So this strongly skewed to the right,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.080
it's clearly not a symmetric sample data.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.810
And so we don't meet any
of these sub-conditions

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.340
for the normal condition.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.530
And so we do not meet the normal condition

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.500
for our significance test.
