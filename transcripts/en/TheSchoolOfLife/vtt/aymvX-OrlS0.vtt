00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Many of us are wandering the world bearing a lot of emotional damage.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.920
We may be depressed, anxious, or very difficult around sex in relationships.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.600
We might ask ourselves where the difficulties came from.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.220
It's a continually weird provocative and yet, in our view, extremely accurate answer,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.960
that the damage comes almost always from childhood.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.300
Especially early childhood.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:33.580
How we were cared for as infants and children, has a disproportionate effect on how we will relate to others in adulthood.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.960
What we need above all else is a responsive parent;

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.760
An adult who looks after our needs with sensitivity and kindness.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.180
This is quite literally life defining and life saving.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.520
It sounds like nothing much and nothing too hard.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.380
But without this kind of responsive love, we are wounded for life.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.300
Many of us have been.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.240
Researchers have become ever better at showing the effects of neglect on children.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.440
One of the world's leading expert is Dr. Edward Tronick,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.460
director of the Child Development unit at Harvard University.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.040
Together with his team, he's responsible for one of the great experiments in the history of psychology,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.120
known as: The Still Face Experiment.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.680
Babies, this young, are extremely responsive

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.820
to the emotions, the reactivity and the social interaction

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.120
that they get from the world around them.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.940
This is something that we started studying 34 years ago.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.920
When people didn't think that infants could engage in social interaction.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.380
In this Still Face Experiment, what the mother did was:

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.600
she sits down and she's playing with her baby who's about 1 year of age.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.220
"My good girl!"

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.040
And she gives a greeting to the baby, the baby gives a greeting back to her.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.660
This baby starts pointing at different places in the world,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.440
and the mother is trying to engage her and play with her.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.220
They're working to coordinate their emotions,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.740
and their intentions. What they want to do in the world.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.920
And that's really what the baby is used to.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.980
And then we ask the mother to not respond to the baby.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.340
The baby very quickly picks up on this.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.580
And then she uses all of her abilities to try and get the mother back.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.920
She smiles at the mother,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.720
she points. Because she's used to the mother looking where she points.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.760
The baby puts both hands up, in front of her and says "What's happening here?"

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.860
She makes that screechy sound at the mother.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.180
Like: "Come on! Why aren't we doing this?"

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.240
Even in these 2 minutes, when they don't get the normal reaction,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.640
they react with negative emotions,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.640
they turn away, they feel the stress of it.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.440
They actually may lose the control of their posture because of the stress that they're experiencing.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.940
Watching the baby get distressed can be highly triggering.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.520
If a child can get so upset over a few seconds of cold and unfeeling behavior,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.200
we have a sense of what can happen over years or more of neglect.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.220
No wonder some of us don't feel so well inside.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.580
We had an equivalent of a "Still-Face"-parent for our first decade and more.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.960
But knowing how vulnerable we are, it shouldn't merely sadden us.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.940
We can take stock of how we've been failed and understand the link between the past and our present difficulties.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.280
Psychological research, like the Still Face experiment, is at the forefront of helping us to understand ourselves emotionally.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.640
Shedding scientific light on the origins of our sadness and complexity.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.280
Along the way, the experiment proves something else beyond doubt.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.740
Love isn't a luxury. It's a gateway to our very survival and sanity.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.380
Most books that want to change us, seek to make us richer or thinner.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.760
This book wants to help us be nicer,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.480
less irritable, more attentive, warmer people.
