00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.960
SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.480
And sorry to keep you waiting.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.938
We were trying to
get all the sound

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:13.060
ready for a
beautiful performance

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.780
that we will se today.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.030
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.280
I'll be hosting the
king of ghazals.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.670
Today it gives me great
pleasure to be here doing that.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.760
And before I invite Mr.
Pankaj Udhas on stage,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.810
I will say a few words about him
and give a brief introduction.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.790
So as you all know, Padma
Shri award winner Pankaj Udhas

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.620
has been in the music industry
for more than three decades.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.330
He started his journey with
ghazal singing in the '80s,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.580
and produced many
amazing albums,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.280
like "Aahat,"
"Mukarrar," "Tarrannum."

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.100
And then he made his
debut in the film industry

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.230
with a very iconic song
that we will talk about.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.770
I'm sure it resonates a very
beautiful chord in our hearts

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.310
with that song that we
will share with you.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.120
And he continues to do a
lot of work, even today.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.940
He will be talking about
some of his recent projects.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.330
He's also very involved
in a lot of non-profits

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.990
that he will talk about today.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.870
So without further
ado, let me invite

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.730
Mr. Pankaj Udhas on stage.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.600
Please give it up.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.099
A warm round of applause.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.973
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.830
PANKAJ UDHAS: Thank you.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580
Thank you so much.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.930
SPEAKER: All right, sir.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.260
Please have a seat.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.590
[INAUDIBLE] fans, [NON-ENGLISH]
Googlers, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.810
I just wanted to give
you a very warm welcome.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.820
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.210
PANKAJ UDHAS: Thank you.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.250
SPEAKER: So today, we
are the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.262
Thank you very much.

00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:50.470
PANKAJ UDHAS: Thanks so much.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.880
SPEAKER: And as we were
talking over lunch,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.090
you have come to the Bay
Area many, many times.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.290
PANKAJ UDHAS: Oh, yes.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.337
SPEAKER: But this is your
first time at Google.

00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:57.420
PANKAJ UDHAS: Google, yes.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.830
SPEAKER: So can you share a
little about your experience

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.547
over the years in Bay area,
and how is it different today?

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:04.630
PANKAJ UDHAS: Well, it's--

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.366
first of all, a very good
afternoon to everyone here.

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:13.480
And it's indeed a pleasure to be
here in this part of the world,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.821
and especially at the
Google headquarters.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.760
As I shared with
you this afternoon,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.490
when I was talking
to the immigration

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.480
officer on my
arrival, he asked me

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.040
as to have I been to this
part of the world before?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.990
And I told him that I
first came to United States

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.020
for a concert tour in 1986,
which makes it about 32 years.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.307
So he looked at my face
and he says, are you sure?

00:02:52.307 --> 00:02:53.440
[LAUGHING]

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.386
SPEAKER: Like, that
was before I was born.

00:02:55.386 --> 00:02:55.949
[LAUGHING]

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:57.740
PANKAJ UDHAS: And he
was a young gentlemen.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.640
He couldn't believe
that I had been

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.240
coming to this wonderful
country for 32 years now.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.470
Well, yes, Bay Area is one
of my favorite destination

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.520
in the United States.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.980
A lot of warmth, a lot of--

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.810
like, the sunshine people are
very, very warm, very bright,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.380
very receptive, very hospitable.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.000
And the best part is
that the response here

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.700
is always overwhelming.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.460
The last concert, which I did
here about two years back,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.260
was sold out on my arrival.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.360
And this time, also.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.770
In fact, when I arrived
here, I got the news

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.950
that the concert tomorrow,
which is happening tomorrow,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.390
is sold out.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.590
And with so much of response,
and so much of demand,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.920
they decided that they want
to do one more concert.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.340
So they've announced a second
concert on the 4th of March.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.480
So that's what Bay Area is.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.840
And I think that's
really wonderful.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.010
SPEAKER: Yeah, I think we
all love to have you here.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.160
And as you said, your
show tomorrow is sold out.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.530
But there is a second
show, so for those of you

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.599
who have not bought
the tickets, we'll

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.519
give you information about that.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.350
So I wanted to actually get
started with your journey.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.920
PANKAJ UDHAS: I would say
that it's more of a destiny.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.020
It's more of--

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.770
I guess, sometimes, you
feel that you are destined,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.790
or you are sent
here to do a job,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.610
or you are sent here to carry
out a particular mission.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.670
When I was growing up, I
grew up in the radio era.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.460
When I was growing up,
when I was a child,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.920
there was no television.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.370
Obviously, there
were no computers,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.180
and there were no
mobile telephones.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.490
And so the only source of
entertainment was radio.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.730
And I think the first
influence during those years

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.790
was Begum Akhtar, the
famous ghazal singer,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.560
I used to listen to--

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.800
I was quite intrigued because
I was too small to figure out

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
as to who she was,
what she sang,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.840
but her voice and her style
really appealed to me.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.580
And then slowly,
I inquired and I

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.790
got to know that she
was India's pride,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.080
and she was the first lady who
popularized this form of music,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.730
which is ghazal.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.840
And she had peculiar voice.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.540
Her voice was very,
very different

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.230
than the normal female
voices, so it really

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.440
suited this kind of singing.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.510
And I guess that
impression lasted forever.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.860
And I think that that
was my initiation

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.680
into ghazal singing that was--

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.830
that's when I got inspired.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.290
And then I started following
this form of music religiously.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.970
And then, obviously, came
the issue of language,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.910
because ghazal, as
you know, basically--

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.940
the medium, the
language is Urdu.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.770
And it was, again, a coincidence
that my eldest brother, Manhar

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.030
Udhas, was a very
famous playback singer.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:48.050
Manharji was learning Urdu
from a very, very renowned Urdu

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.700
teacher.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.130
Manharji was learning
only because he

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.560
was pursuing playback
singing, and he

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.250
wanted to really make
his diction very refined,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.140
and he wanted to make sure that
whatever he sang was perfect.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.070
So for that, he
was learning Urdu.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.680
And it was his teacher who
actually really inspired

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.990
me, who really, in
fact, impressed me.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.100
And one fine day, with
a lot of hesitation,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.410
I gathered courage to ask him
if he could teach me Urdu.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.660
And he readily agreed.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.310
He said yes.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.540
And let me tell you that
his first reaction was like,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.150
he was aghast, because I was--

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.660
SPEAKER: How young
were you at that time?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.860
PANKAJ UDHAS: I'm
talking the BEP era.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.550
So I was like, obviously,
studying in college,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.500
and I was swayed by that ear.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.626
So I had long hair, and I
used to wear bell bottoms.

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:55.053
SPEAKER: I'd love to
see a picture of that.

00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:56.020
[LAUGHING]

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.670
PANKAJ UDHAS: So he
was like, are you sure

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.150
of you want to learn Urdu?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.460
And I said yes.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.230
So he said, fair enough.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.570
And then he started teaching me.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.770
I think that made me
even more determined

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.510
that I wanted to pursue this
particular form my music.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.040
And with him, I read a
whole lot of Urdu poets,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.990
starting from what
we call Ustad poets,

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:28.770
poets like [INAUDIBLE],,
and all those stalwarts.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.490
So I think that
really sort of got me

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:37.990
into this entire
ghazal singing form.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:46.020
And I think this ultimately, I
guess, once I got in the world,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.562
this ultimately
became a passion.

00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:50.520
SPEAKER: Yeah, that we
can see in your singing.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.820
PANKAJ UDHAS: And that
passion continues even today.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.110
SPEAKER: Yes, definitely.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.050
So now, let me ask
you how you ventured

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.930
from this ghazal singing thing
into the Bollywood industry,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.570
and when did that
happen, and what

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.760
was your overall
experience with that?

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.860
PANKAJ UDHAS: Well,
as far as cinema,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.910
as far as indie films
are concerned, again,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.770
it's a great story to tell.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.020
It's a great coincidence.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.950
Not very many people
know about it,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.520
but probably I saved it from
my book, which I'm writing now.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.300
And hopefully, I'll release it--

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.460
I'll launch my book
by end of this year.

00:09:31.562 --> 00:09:33.270
SPEAKER: We would love
to have you again.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.470
Sorry to just say that.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.950
PANKAJ UDHAS: Yeah, sure.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.500
SPEAKER: When you do
your book signing,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.541
we'd would love to have
over and talk about that.

00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.770
PANKAJ UDHAS: I'll come back
when I'm ready with my book.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.280
Certainly, I'll do that.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.230
So when I was in
college, I still

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.410
remember one day-- in
those days, as I said,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.660
we didn't have mobile
telephones and things like that.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.850
So my older brother
came to college,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:05.430
and he told me that there was
an urgent need for a film song.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.300
There is a wonderful music
composer, a lady composer

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.490
called, [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.510
[INAUDIBLE] is a very
famous music director.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.510
She's done music
for many movies.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:25.180
So she was composing for a
film which had a new star cast.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.300
All the actors in that
film were newcomers.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.870
So they wanted a
different voice.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.480
They wanted a young voice.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.160
And I'm talking
about the era when

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.910
we had stalwarts like
[INAUDIBLE],, maestros

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.950
like [INAUDIBLE],,
and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.810
SPEAKER: I see.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.330
PANKAJ UDHAS: So I
went to the studio,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.830
and I was told that we've
selected you to sing a song.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.850
And I rehearsed the song.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.560
And next day, I
recorded the song.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.640
And this was a film
called "Kamna."

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.460
And the film was released
and, obviously, with new star

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.780
and with not much to--

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.970
not much of a gloss.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.340
The film was not a big
success at the box office.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.890
But the song was released,
and it played on the radio,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.890
and there was a small record.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.220
In those days, there
were no cassettes.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.130
It just a record.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.430
So that's how I started.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:39.390
And I guess I was
probably 20, 21 years old.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.360
And then somewhere
in my heart, I

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.120
knew that I was up against
a huge competition,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.350
because they were
all great maestros,

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:56.420
and I was a newcomer, basically.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.580
However, I tried
and, obviously, I

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.450
didn't succeed as a
playback singer in cinema.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.940
So obviously, my heart
was always with ghazals,

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.600
and cinema, though it was an
attraction, I wouldn't lie,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.820
but it was never
the first choice.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.860
The first choice
was always ghazals,

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.270
and even today, it's ghazals.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:31.240
And then got to the stage
event, this particular film

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.140
was being made.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:39.480
"Naam" And there was a
situation in the film where

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:48.910
the lead actor, the
protagonist, Sanjay Dutt,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.820
had left the country
and was living abroad.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:57.700
And there was a
situation that the story

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.860
required for him to come back.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.830
So how do you bring him back?

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.210
So there were many discussions.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.600
And they were all
legendary people involved

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.730
in making of that film.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.610
But Rajendra Kumar,
the famous actor,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.130
was the producer of the film.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.780
And Mahesh Bhatt was
directing the film.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.100
And Salim Khan, who's
part of [INAUDIBLE] team.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.280
And [INAUDIBLE] was writing
the screenplay and story.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.700
[INAUDIBLE],, they
were doing music,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.440
and [INAUDIBLE] she
was writing songs.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.280
So they were all
legendary people involved.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.060
And obviously, everyone
had a different opinion.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.180
So it took them a
while to figure out.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.540
But I guess the storywriter
Salim Khan was very adamant.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.900
He was very sure that
he wanted a real life

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.230
singer to portray and to
perform the song in the film.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.680
SPEAKER: Right, right.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.990
PANKAJ UDHAS: Because
he felt that it

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.980
should be a singer,
a popular singer, who

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.600
should sing this song.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.680
So it looks very authentic.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.284
And so--

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:11.950
SPEAKER: Yeah, I was
going to just share

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.700
with people who don't know
what song you're talking about,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.340
which would bring
somebody back home.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.640
Why don't you give
them the name of song?

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.460
PANKAJ UDHAS: It is is the
famous "Chithi Aayi Hai."

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.630
So after many
discussions and all,

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.120
they tried to
figure out as to who

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.490
was the popular singer then.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.480
So obviously, they
all discussed,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.830
and they felt that they
needed a young popular singer,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.510
and they all decided
that it was me.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.220
So that's how they picked
me to sing this song,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.180
and they said that they
wanted me to perform

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.830
this song in the film as well.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.650
There was a very funny
incident, in fact,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.580
because I still remember that
Rajendra Kumar called me up,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.780
and I had seen him
from my childhood.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.660
And he had those hit films.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.150
And I was a big fan of his.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.780
And especially, Rajendra Kumar
had done a lot of musicals.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.990
He had attended
many movies where

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.190
music used to be fantastic.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.130
So I used to love those films.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.100
So when he called me
up, I was like, really

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.800
thrilled to receive his call.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.530
And he probably
hadn't realized--

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.180
so he, just in
that excitement, he

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.950
told me that, Pankaj, you
are acting in my film.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.230
So I was like,
acting in your film?

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:45.610
So he said-- to me I
didn't want to commit

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.020
right away, because
when he said acting,

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.860
I was a little skeptical.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.850
So I said, can I call you
back and let you know?

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.220
So he said, OK.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.970
And then I didn't call
him back because I

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.520
was scared to call him
back because I was not

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.170
prepared to be an actor.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.350
Because with difficulty,
I had made a name

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.970
in the field of singing,
and I said when am I

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.970
going to start acting now?

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.240
So I held back.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.270
So I didn't return his
call for a couple of days.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.460
He called my eldest
brother Manharji

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.560
because they were very friendly.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.630
So he called my brother
and told my brother

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:29.270
that your younger
brother does not

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.871
have any decency, because
he's not returned my call.

00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:32.370
[LAUGHING]

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.130
SPEAKER: You got in trouble.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.310
PANKAJ UDHAS: And so I got
a call from big brother.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.020
He says, you should do this.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.945
You know, because he's such a
senior actor, and how can you--

00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:45.860
so I told him I said, there
is no other reason for me

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.230
not returning his
call, but I said,

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:56.360
I'm only rather unsure
whether I want to act or not.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.590
SPEAKER: So this was not
a very common thing that

00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.930
used to happen in those times.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.440
PANKAJ UDHAS: Yes.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.190
SPEAKER: This was the
first time that they

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.920
experimented with this.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.369
PANKAJ UDHAS: So he told
told me, in that case,

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.450
call him up and tell him
that you don't want to act.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.290
I said, fair enough.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.540
I was shaking.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.869
I called him up.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:19.740
And I said, sir, sorry I didn't
return your call, because I

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.069
got taken aback
because, I said, I'm not

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.260
prepared to be an actor.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.210
So he laughed loudly.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.859
And he said, oh god.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.660
He said, no, no, no.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.400
He said, we don't expect
you to be an actor.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.490
But we want you to appear
in the film as Pankaj Udhas,

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.330
and we want you to
appear as yourself

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.900
and sing the song
so that we can say

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.740
that this is Pankaj Udhas
performing in an auditorium.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.520
And that's how the
song came about.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.840
SPEAKER: It was a huge success.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.550
That song was like phenomenal.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.082
It just placed you on
the map of Bollywood.

00:17:56.082 --> 00:17:58.040
And so I want you to come
back to the question.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.740
You said you tried, and
then you got this fame--

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.960
PANKAJ UDHAS: So
just see the fate

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:08.150
and just see the destiny, that
something where I was probably

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.500
refused, rejected, or
not exactly rejected,

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.380
but I was, I would say,
overlooked probably.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.480
And suddenly, I find
that all those people

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.710
want to jam with me and
wanted me to work for them.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.820
So I guess it's at the end of
the day, I think it's destiny.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.570
SPEAKER: And after "Naam,"
you did many other playbacks.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.060
PANKAJ UDHAS: Oh, yes.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.410
I did.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.130
SPEAKER: Many, many.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.130
PANKAJ UDHAS: Yes, many.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.070
SPEAKER: But then you
continued this journey

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.870
towards ghazal
singing and towards--

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.640
PANKAJ UDHAS: I always--

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.710
my focus was always
ghazal singing,

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.150
and I always wanted to--

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.950
I guess I've reached
a stage in life

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.090
now that, for me,
ghazal singing is not

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.900
just a commercial
venture that I pursue.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.150
Or it's not something
which I pursue

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.950
for the sake of money or fame.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.620
I think I've reached
a point in life

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:09.750
that I pursue it because I'm
very passionate about it.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.870
I want to spread it
across the world,

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:19.400
so that I want a lot of young
talented singers to dig it up.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.440
Because if you want
this particular genre

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.710
to really prosper
and go forward,

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:33.470
then you need a bunch of young
performers, young singers,

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.527
to come by and take
it up seriously.

00:19:37.527 --> 00:19:38.360
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.790
PANKAJ UDHAS: And for me, it's
more of a mission now in life

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:46.470
than just singing
and performing.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.720
I think I have devoted
nearly 40 years of my life

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.630
to this form of music.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.780
And I don't want that
this form of music

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.380
should suddenly vanish.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.470
SPEAKER: I agree.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.530
PANKAJ UDHAS: So I
certainly want that,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.800
whatever I can contribute.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.230
SPEAKER: So one thing you said
that when you approached Urdu

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.090
teacher, and you said
yourself, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.430
We just don't see that kind of
dedication in ghazal singers

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.640
today to focus on diction.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.530
What has changed?

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.850
Why is it not that
zeal to do things right

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.890
and to do it perfectly?

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.710
PANKAJ UDHAS: I
guess what I see--

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.020
I'm not talking like an old.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.380
I don't think I'm that old.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:43.140
But what I see today is that the
level of patience has run out.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:49.580
And nobody wants to spend years
together to pursue something,

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.290
to achieve something.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.010
I guess there is
a sense, there's

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.770
a feeling, that you want
to do something very fast.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.970
You want to achieve lots, and
you want to achieve it fast.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:07.070
And that's where, I think,
even the artists, that's

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:12.650
why the singers do not want
to pursue this form of music.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:17.820
Because I guess
everyone wants a hit.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.780
Everyone wants that.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:26.880
You do something, and suddenly,
you become a YouTube sensation.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.050
You have 5 million,
10 million hits.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:35.490
And so I think ghazal
singing basically calls

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.510
for a very serious approach.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:43.830
And it's very
conservative, and it's

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.290
very time-consuming as well.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.870
So I think you really
need to have patience

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:54.430
to pursue this form of
music to be successful.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:59.670
So, I mean, if any
youngster who wants

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.510
to follow or pursue
this form of music,

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.100
my advice is that you
got to be very patient.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:13.770
You got to learn to take
everything in your stride

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.220
in terms of success, or if
you are unsuccessful also,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.030
because there is no
guarantee that you can

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.927
become an over night sensation.

00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:23.760
SPEAKER: Good, good.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.520
So that's a good message
for [INAUDIBLE],, hopefully

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.384
some of us.

00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:29.050
So you see a lot of
people sitting here.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.580
There are also people
watching you over live stream,

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.500
because we allow people who
cannot come to this campus,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.560
allow them to be able to
view the chat elsewhere.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.850
So you brought up YouTube.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.190
I wanted to ask you
a little bit about,

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.200
what is your thought
of technology

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.370
into the world of music?

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.390
We see a lot of your videos, and
ghazals, and albums on YouTube.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.930
How do you feel that it has
helped the music industry?

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:58.380
PANKAJ UDHAS: Well, it's a
great, great platform for--

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:03.600
I would say that for established
singers, it's brilliant.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.760
But I would say,
even for singers

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.880
who are struggling singers who
are trying to make it in life,

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.430
or singers who are--

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.910
YouTube has opened up
a whole new avenue.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.200
Because let's face it--

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.644
I'm talking about the
Indian perspective.

00:23:23.644 --> 00:23:25.810
I'm not talking about the
international perspective.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.690
But if you look at the
Indian perspective,

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.180
as far as India
is concerned, I'm

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.950
sure you know about
India as much as I know.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.660
That in India,
there are two things

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:46.590
which are the most popular, I
would say, subjects in India.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.800
One is Bollywood, and
the other is cricket.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.890
I mean, there's nothing which
is as popular as these two

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.640
things in India.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.050
So when you talk about
music, India always

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.510
was dominated by
Bollywood music.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.350
And not for now, but always.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.980
SPEAKER: Always, yeah.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.630
PANKAJ UDHAS:
YouTube, fortunately,

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:12.900
has opened up a new avenue for a
whole lot of singers who cannot

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.930
make it big in Bollywood,
who may not make it big

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:20.850
in Bollywood, or who probably
do not have the means,

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.230
or maybe they do not have
an access to Bollywood.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.960
For all those singers, I
think its a great platform.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.980
If they have the talent, it
will get recognized right away.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.830
And there couldn't
be anything which

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.130
could be more rewarding than
YouTube, because you know it

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.140
instantly.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.710
If your song is
popular on YouTube,

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.190
you'll know by the
number of hits.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.440
You know by the number
of views, how many views,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.880
and you'll immediately know that
your song is liked by people.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.760
So I think it's
a great platform.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.957
It's a wonderful platform.

00:24:57.957 --> 00:24:58.540
SPEAKER: Good.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.890
Very nice.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.040
Another question I
wanted to ask you

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.930
was about the creative process.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.720
Because people who do
playback boxing in Bollywood,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.700
do you go there, somebody
has done the lyrics,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.920
somebody has done the music,
you just go memorize your part.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.570
But ghazal singing and
producing an album, what you do,

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.470
figuring out--

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.440
share with us something about
that whole creative process.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.120
How do you come up
with the project?

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.680
How do you select songs for it?

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.630
What is that?

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.430
PANKAJ UDHAS: When I
started, I remember

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.730
my early years of music.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.490
When you introduced me,
you talked about albums

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.120
like "Aahat" and "Mukarrar."

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.530
During that period, I
remember that I had an option.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.330
I had a very dear friend.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.130
Unfortunately, he's no more.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.105
He was a poet.

00:25:48.105 --> 00:25:52.880
[INAUDIBLE] was his name,
and he was a brilliant poet.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.900
He was kind of a
guide, kind of someone

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:05.550
who guided me regularly as far
as Urdu poetry is concerned.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.210
So we were sitting
one day, and we

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:16.940
were discussing as to how
the Urdu poetry, the content

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:24.710
is relevant to this
generation of listeners.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.050
And we came to a
conclusion then poets

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.610
like [INAUDIBLE],, all
brilliant poets, Ustad poets,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.180
as we call them.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.760
But in terms of
for the audiences,

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.520
people had limited
access to that Urdu,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.390
which was written somewhere
in the 17th, 18th century.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:52.830
So we kind of took a
conscious decision that,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:58.140
why not approach the
poetry in a different way,

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.960
so that we can
reach out to larger

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.360
audiences across the world.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.150
And the first ghazal we
came across, which qualified

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:15.420
or which suited our purposes,
was Jim [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.490
Because the poet
was written-- this

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:26.700
was [INAUDIBLE] late
18th century poet.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.590
But he wrote it so simply
that [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.070
So very simple to understand,
but wonderful meaning.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.910
Because, as you know, that
in Urdu, when you do it

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:48.930
talk about a couplet, it has
about 20 different layers

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:49.940
of meaning.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.950
It's not just one meaning.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.580
You can uncover so many layers.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:01.580
And when we tried to
figure out [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.360
when you do a
literal translation,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.940
it means that you are talking
with some beautiful person who

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.990
is very close to you, and you
are so very fortunate to have

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.310
that person.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.980
Then if you open
up layers, then you

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:21.580
realize that the poets, most
of the poets, they was Sufi,

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:26.790
and they had such a major
spiritual approach in life.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:33.300
So actually, what the poet was
trying to say is that it's God

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:41.360
Almighty, the people who
have that superpower or that

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.270
spiritual leader close
to them, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.710
SPEAKER: Right.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:29:00.000
PANKAJ UDHAS: So that means
that poetry is unbelievable,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.870
and it's so simple.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.050
But at the same time,
it's so very effective.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.745
So that's when we
started talking

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.050
about the creative process.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.980
That's when I started
focusing on poetry, which

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:18.960
would have less of difficult
Persian words, Arabic words,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.900
more of Hindu.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:26.864
And that's how I got into this
particular creative process.

00:29:26.864 --> 00:29:28.280
SPEAKER: And I
think you're right.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.620
What you brought to
the ghazal industry

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.660
was an ability to
others to enjoy,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.920
not just somebody who
understands Urdu at that level.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.170
But a common man can also
appreciate it and learn it--

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.260
PANKAJ UDHAS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:46.380
And you'll be surprised that the
kind of following which I have

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.990
is beyond a
Hindi-speaking audience.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.800
And I think that really
makes me feel wonderful.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.570
I think it's a
great satisfaction.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:02.160
For example, last month,
I did a concert in a place

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.160
called Calicut in Kerala.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.286
And there were 6,000 people.

00:30:08.286 --> 00:30:09.007
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:10.590
PANKAJ UDHAS: And
nobody would believe

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:16.230
that 6,000 Keralites would
understand what I'm singing.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.890
But yes, they understand each
and every word of what I sang,

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:24.180
because they have followed
my music, they know my music,

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.420
and they know what
exactly I'm singing.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.150
So I think that
it's a great feeling

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.170
to reach out to all these areas.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.490
SPEAKER: So continuing with this
thought of creative process,

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.180
I think one of the things
we sent out to Googlers

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.290
is see if somebody could
suggest some poetry or a couple

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.410
of lines, and see how
you fit music to that.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.110
Because like I said, and
reiterating that Bollywood

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.370
is very different.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.000
But your creative process
about taking the words,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.020
absorbing the meaning.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.210
So if you wanted to share.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.840
So a couple of Googlers
sent some poetry,

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.200
and Pankaj is going to look
at that and then share with us

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.570
some of the process
that he goes through

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.640
to put music around words.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.355
PANKAJ UDHAS:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:11.355 --> 00:31:12.320
Yeah, it's--

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.808
SPEAKER: And we are putting
him on the spot a little bit.

00:31:14.808 --> 00:31:16.077
[LAUGHING]

00:31:16.077 --> 00:31:18.660
PANKAJ UDHAS: I think I'll need
my harmonium to work on this--

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.451
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.570
But I think in ghazal singing,
music and the feeling of it

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.020
is very important equally.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.770
PANKAJ UDHAS: Yes.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.200
How do you express?

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.990
Most important is
your expression.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:48.500
Because they say there is
a very common expression

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.450
in most the poets.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:55.010
They say that
[NON-ENGLISH],, poetry,

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.430
they say is [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.090
Poetry is not something
which you can transfer it.

If you don't feel it,
then it's not right.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.660
So you've got to feel the words,

words are all about.

may not realize this,

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.630
but we just took a print-out
of this poem written

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.900
by one of the Googlers, and
handed it to Pankaj and said,

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.790
can you use this to compose?

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.040
Very, very impressive.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.489

SPEAKER: Now that he has
the harmonium in front,

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.849
I was going ask him to sing
the very famous song we

00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:49.625
were talking about,
"Chithi Aayi Hai."

request the audience, that

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.180
PANKAJ UDHAS: Yeah, but I
must share this with you,

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.100
not to inspire
you, anyone of you,

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.115
because I'm sure that you all
are doing very well in life.

00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:08.060
And I remember--

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.360
[LAUGHING]

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.770
The reason why I use the word
inspire, because I remember I

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.290
was doing a concert
in Jaipur, and there

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.860
was this gentleman who came
to see me after the concert

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.750
and gave me a book.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:31.550
And he opened the front
cover, and inside, he

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.830
had written "Dedicated
to Pankaj Udhas."

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.270
So I said, thank you very
much for the dedication.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.770
And he said, no, the reason why
he had dedicated the book to me

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:46.340
was that he was here
in Silicon Valley,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.270
and he was a software engineer.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.840
And he said he was doing
very well, extremely well.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.690
And I'm talking about when
"Chithi Aayi Hai" was--

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:04.700
the film was released
in the late '80s.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.690
So he said he heard the song.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.870
And then he said he kept
on listening to the song.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.350
And he said, one fine day,
he just packed his bags

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:16.664
and came back to India.

00:36:16.664 --> 00:36:18.020
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.270
PANKAJ UDHAS: And he said,
when he came back to India,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.760
he didn't know what he
would do with his life

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.780
because here, he had a
fantastic job and whatever.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:33.050
So he said he tried his
luck with a startup,

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.040
start his own venture.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.270
And fortunately, he did
extremely well, better

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.300
than what he was doing here.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.510
So he said that inspired him to
write the book about his life,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.964
and he dedicated the book to me.

00:36:46.964 --> 00:36:48.380
But that doesn't
mean that you all

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.550

SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] I have
heard this song so many times.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.200
Still, [NON-ENGLISH],,
I get goosebumps,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.210
and it brings tears to my eyes.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:19.960

Beautiful song.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.820

little bit, I wanted

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.000
to talk a little bit
about the nonprofits

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.170
that you're involved in.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:29.440
PANKAJ UDHAS: Yes.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.939

share a little bit about that.

00:40:31.939 --> 00:40:34.780
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.400
PANKAJ UDHAS: I guess so
during my growing up days

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:51.960
and during the process, I always
felt that we, as human beings,

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:57.830
could do so much for so
many people who are probably

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:03.260
less privileged, or maybe
people who need support,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.020
people who need help.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.600
And I always felt that
when God has given you

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.800
something very
special, like a talent,

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:21.090
you can share that
talent to help somebody.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:25.120
Because you probably,
you were a chosen one.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.970
And that means that your
responsibility becomes doubled,

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:36.150
because that means that you
are required to do something

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:39.720
extra, something more.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.420
And I don't know, but
all along my life,

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.620
I didn't like the word
charity, because I always

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.170
felt that that is
nothing like charity.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:54.990
I feel that what you do
is your duty as a human,

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.370
as a human being.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.720
That you do something for
your fellow human being.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:06.120
You are not obliging him,
or you're not doing charity.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.560
What you're doing is you're
trying to help somebody.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.500
And I grew up with this
attitude in my life.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.510
And I still remember that I
was doing a concert in Mumbai

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:24.930
for a fundraiser, for children
who have this genetical blood

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:28.230
disorder called thalassemia.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:34.490
And at that point,
I had no clue.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:38.230
I had no idea as to what
thalassemia was all about.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:46.350
So I was invited to visit the
center where they were treating

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.140
thalassemic children in Mumbai.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:53.220
And I went to visit the center.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.780
And I was taken around.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:02.450
And when I saw those children,
and when I saw their plight,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:09.740
I felt that there is
something like being deprived

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.262
that is something like
being unfortunate,

00:43:13.262 --> 00:43:14.470
especially in those children.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.310
Because this is such a dreaded
blood disorder, that the child

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.260
needs a blood transfusion
every three weeks.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.970
The child needs to take
one injection every day,

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.920
which is given through a pump.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.260
The pump is tied to the stomach
for eight hours every day.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.350
It's a whole process,
where you feel

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:44.150
that what has the child
done to go to all this?

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:49.800
I was so moved, so I
joined that organization,

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.490
and I told them, I said,
I'll work with you.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.350
And I started working with them.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:59.950
It's nearly 30 years now that
I've been working for them.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:03.600
The, I wouldn't say
consolation, but I

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.460
would say the only bright
part, or the only good part

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.070
about this whole
process is that when

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:15.810
I joined the whole
organization, there

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.670
was no cure for thalassemia.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:22.960
Today, there is bone
marrow transplant,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.770
which can cure the
child of thalassemia,

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.200
and the child leads
a normal life.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.690
So what I have done is
that we have been focused

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.940
on bone marrow transplant.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.910
In the last three years, we
got more than 50 children

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.990
bone marrow transplant
done in India.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.930
And today, those 50 children
jumping, running around.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.952
They have no thalassemia.

and that's God right there.

If you're privileged,
if you are blessed,

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.770
then I think it's
our duty to share it

more and more support on that.

is nothing but awareness.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:19.160
Because it's a genetically
inherited blood disorder.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.390

you can stop it, for sure.

is kind of a secrecy.

As soon as I finish
the North American

I start working on that project.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:54.930
It's a project which involves
another legendary artist whom

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.890
I'm collaborating with.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.920
And we're working on
a project which should

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.270
be one of its kind, hopefully.

I'm here at Google,

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:18.432
So first of all, why are there
so many ghazals around alcohol?

00:47:18.432 --> 00:47:19.705
[LAUGHING]

00:47:19.705 --> 00:47:22.080
PANKAJ UDHAS: Yesterday Sonny
asked me the same question.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.670
SPEAKER: Oh, really?

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:23.970
PANKAJ UDHAS: On the radio.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.210
Yeah.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:27.120
But [NON-ENGLISH].

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:33.534
This is not my
fault. [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:47:33.534 --> 00:47:34.706
SPEAKER: [NON-ENGLISH]

00:47:34.706 --> 00:47:36.330
PANKAJ UDHAS: Because
what has happened

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.630
is that all these numbers
which you mentioned,

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.790
they were not
recorded in one day.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.940
That were not
recorded in one album.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:47.550
These numbers happened
over a period of 30 years.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.300
SPEAKER: I see.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.633
PANKAJ UDHAS: But because you
want to enjoy these songs,

00:47:50.633 --> 00:47:53.970
and because you want to have
your drink, so you compiled

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.350
all these songs, you
have your playlist.

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:02.310
And you say, OK, Pankaj Udhas,
[NON-ENGLISH],, Pankaj Udhas,

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:06.570
[NON-ENGLISH],, Pankaj
Udhas, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:12.540
But it's not my fault. I have
never propagated this subject.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.510
I've been, in fact,
in India, I've

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:18.150
been approached to
endorse these brands.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.610
I've been approached
to endorse tobacco.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.370
I've been approached to
endorse [INAUDIBLE] masala.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.880
But I have taken
a policy decision

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.140
that I would never ever
endorse any of these brands,

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.220
because I don't want to
encourage this stuff.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.340
So--

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.140
SPEAKER: See, again,
this is a sign

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.180
that you are thinking
about things rather

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.350
than just being an artist.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.925
Because I see a lot of popular
Bollywood stars who don't--

00:48:42.925 --> 00:48:44.550
PANKAJ UDHAS:
[INAUDIBLE] alcohol, yes.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:45.480
SPEAKER: Anything.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.310
Anything, [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:47.810
Whatever.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:51.480
Whatever we feel that we don't
want our kids to be exposed to.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.610
They're endorsing
all those items, So.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:55.480
We appreciate artists
like yourself--

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:55.730
PANKAJ UDHAS: Thank you.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.430
SPEAKER: --who put
some thought into it,

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.000
rather than just [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.850
Yes, thank you.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.250
So why not one
ghazal on that topic?

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.320
PANKAJ UDHAS: No, but I
will instead of saying--

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.480
someone was asking me so.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:12.360
The rest, you can come for the
concert and listen, for sure.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:19.284
But I will [NON-ENGLISH].

00:49:19.284 --> 00:49:25.236
