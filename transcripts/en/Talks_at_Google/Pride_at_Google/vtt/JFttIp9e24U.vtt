00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:07.244
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK,
hi, welcome, everybody.

00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:11.300
This is the second speaker
series for the month of Pride.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.100
Today we are joined by
Wilson Cruz and [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.886
Wilson is a GLAAD national
spokesperson as well as

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:22.970
a representative and advocate.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.960
And you've also
probably seen him

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.580
in shows like "Ally
McBeal," "Grey's Anatomy,"

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.390
and on "Rent."

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.832
So without further ado,
Wilson Cruz, please.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:36.201
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:38.450
WILSON CRUZ: OK, I don't
need to look at that all day.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.950
Hi.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.090
How are you?

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.620
Thanks so much for coming
out and joining us here

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.730
in the room.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.900
I understand there's
lots of people watching,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.240
or hopefully lots of people
watching from their desks

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.130
here on campus at
the Googleplex.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.390
So welcome to all of you.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.710
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.200
And thank you for
having me here today.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.030
I'm actually really proud to
be here to speak to all of you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.310
and to meet all of you.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.150
It's pretty amazing
for me because I'm not

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.740
very technologically advanced
to be on the campus of Google.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190
I mean, I can barely
turn the computer on.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.060
But I do have an
app that I would

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.280
like to pitch for you today.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.040
No, I'm kidding.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.200
I'm just kidding.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.300
How many times do you
guys get to hear that when

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.310
somebody comes and visits?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.070
I am a disruptor, but I'm
a completely different kind

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.630
of disruptor.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.760
I am very proud to be
here during Pride Month.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.090
But for me and everyone at
GLAAD-- which is where I work

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.600
and the organization
that I represent--

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.570
every day is Pride Month.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.120
Every day is Pride Day.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.580
And for almost 30 years, GLAAD
has been using the stories

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.450
in the media to
shape the narrative

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.010
and to provoke dialogue
about LGBT equality

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.360
so that everyone, no matter
who you are or where you are,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.310
can live the life that you love.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.120
First, I'd like to ask,
is there anyone here,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.390
by a show of hands who
identifies as L, G, B, or T,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.310
or Q, for questioning?

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.810
Yeah?

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.920
Oh, nice.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.210
Big.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.800
Most of the people in the
room, for those of you

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710
who are watching
from your desks.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.040
Is there anyone here who
identifies as an ally?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.890
Thank you very much.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.930
We would be nowhere without you.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.800
But if you did not raise
your hand, no pressure.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.680
But actually, pressure--
pressure first

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.120
to be inclusive of
our entire community.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.230
And second because part
of the idea of Pride Month

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.090
is about being out and
open about who you are

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.080
and what you represent.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.110
For anyone that's feeling a
little bit shy or not sure

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.120
if it's safe to identify at LGBT
or even as an LGBT ally here

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.000
today, I hope that by the
time we finish here today,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.290
I have been able to
convince you otherwise,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.470
that this really
is a safe place.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.770
That's what I do at my
job every day at GLAAD.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.470
But really, it's
been my life's work.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.910
It really has been my life.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.710
Because at GLAAD,
it's always personal.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.940
My relationship with
this organization

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.470
started almost 20 years ago.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.790
I know, you're thinking,
you're barely 20 yourself.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.130
But no, alas, I am not.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.500
It actually started 20
years ago around 1995,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.060
when I had the pleasure of
accepting the Outstanding Drama

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.920
Series GLAAD Media Award for my
very first television series,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.590
"My So-Called Life."

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.750
For those of you who may
have not watched it by now,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.190
I played the very
first gay teenager

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.660
on primetime television,
Rickie Vasquez.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.020
And it was through
this experience

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.570
on "My So-Called
Life" that I witnessed

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.410
the power of how media
can effect change.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.930
I saw how one story,
my story, really,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.890
if handled responsibly
and accurately,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.700
could change
perspectives and lives.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.000
People came to know
Rickie and to love him.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.090
Because finally
there was a story

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.030
of a young person on a
journey of self-discovery

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.410
and of self-acceptance that
was being told honestly.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.260
And viewers grew to
understand and to love him

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.130
because of this.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.430
And among those viewers
was my very own father.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.210
You see, just a few
months before we actually

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.730
started filming the series,
I came out to my own dad.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.190
And it did not go well.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.930
He actually kicked
me out of my house

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.080
because I told him
that I was gay.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.160
And we did not speak
for almost a year.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.510
But he broke his silence when
he turned on the television

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.600
one day and watched an episode
of "My So-Called Life" in which

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.540
my character, Rickie, was
thrown out of his own home

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.640
and beaten because he had
come out to his family.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.820
My father watched that episode
and afterwards picked up

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.260
the phone and said that he
wanted me to come home to talk.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.890
So through the years,
when I've received letters

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.960
from young people
or I've met people

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.280
who were affected by that show
who said that Rickie saved

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.170
their lives or helped them to be
able to speak to their parents

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.660
about who they really
are, I could tell them

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.960
that I honestly understood
what they meant by that.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.110
Because Rickie did
that for me as well.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.380
That's the power
of storytelling.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.350
And I've experienced it over
and over again in my career,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.200
whether it was playing
Rickie Vasquez or Angel

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.070
in "Rent" on Broadway or playing
Dr. Junito Vargas on the LOGO

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.960
series "Noah's Arc."

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.950
These were both gay
characters living with HIV.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.900
I've learned that
stories like these

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.100
serve as not only
entertainment but as vessels

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.087
of empathy, which can
lead to acceptance.

00:06:07.087 --> 00:06:08.920
Those are the opportunities
that I've always

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.880
looked for as an actor.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.680
They've been the most satisfying
and gratifying experiences

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.460
of my life, to be able to
not only do what I love

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.700
and also be able to inform
people about what our lives are

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.640
really like-- that to
me is a perfect marriage

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.610
and a perfect experience for me.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.960
And many people throughout my
career for the last 20 years

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.630
are always asking me
if I'm afraid of being

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.930
typecast in just gay roles.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.240
And I hate that question.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.130
I really do.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.750
Later on, we're going to do Q&amp;A.
And I'll answer any question.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.660
But that question
always gets to me.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.730
Because I'm always
like, well, do

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.434
you think that they ask Brad
Pitt or Ryan Gosling or George

00:07:00.434 --> 00:07:01.850
Clooney if they're
afraid of being

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.545
typecast in straight roles?

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:04.820
No, they don't ask them that.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.230
Being straight or gay doesn't
define a character to me.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.908
It's just an aspect
of who that person is.

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:21.070
It's incredible to me that
they think just because you're

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.730
playing a gay
character that he's

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.120
just like every other gay
character you've ever played.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.736
But LGBT people are
varied and complicated.

00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:31.860
Every character I've played
has been an individual.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.050
And every one has
been different for me

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.170
and has helped me
illuminate what

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.640
it means to be a queer
person in the world,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.020
whether it was an ambitious
political operative

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.780
on "The West Wing" or the
nanny for the youngest

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.040
Salinger child on
"Party of Five"

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.320
or a man doing all he could to
make his domestic partnership

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.230
ceremony in Seattle
feel as special

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.301
as a wedding on
"Grey's Anatomy."

00:07:57.301 --> 00:07:59.550
I've worked to make these
people and their experiences

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.102
real and honest and as
complicated as all of us are.

00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:06.560
And I'm proud to say that I
continue to be fortunate enough

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.330
to be given that opportunity,
to be an actor who

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.490
tells the stories
of our community.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.940
And today, as a
matter of fact, I'm

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.760
very proud to say that today
is the DVD release of a film

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.900
that I was proud to do
with Lukas Haas called

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.830
"Meth Head," which takes
a look at the effects

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.610
of meth addiction
in our community

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.960
and how it affected
this gay couple.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.919
I've seen how devastating that
drug has been to our community.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:41.650
And I think the film does a
really great job of depicting

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.590
what that's like
for a lot of people.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.240
And this fall, I'll be part
of one of the most anticipated

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.600
new series to come
to television on Fox,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.940
called the "Red
Band Society," where

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.060
I'll be playing a nurse
alongside Oscar winner Octavia

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.590
Spencer.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.140
It takes place in the
pediatric ward of a hospital

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.330
as we help guide the lives
of a group of young people

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.697
who live in that pediatric ward.

00:09:09.697 --> 00:09:11.780
And we help them through
this very difficult time.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.070
And they create a bond.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.760
And they create this society
they called the Red Band

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.660
Society.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.530
Because once you have
your first surgery,

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.175
they all get a red band.

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:23.550
And the show itself
will actually

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.910
include many LGBT
characters, including

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.900
mine, who has a very odd
name-- Kenji Gomez-Rejon.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.570
Do I look like a Kenji?

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.480
But I'll take it.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.640
These are the kinds of stories
I came to GLAAD to tell.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.620
I wanted to help GLAAD
advocate for not just

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.390
more representation in
the media but a diversity

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.650
in that representation of
LGBT people and experiences

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.580
and a more diverse
view of who we are.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.560
GLAAD's work is
comprehensive in scope

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.070
and affects every aspect
of an LGBT person's life.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.300
We work every day to
ensure that everyone

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.800
knows the truth about
who we really are

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.580
and that they feel
and understand

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.770
that we are an integral
part of the global family

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.950
with the same hopes and dreams
and aspirations as everyone

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:15.810
else.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.690
And lately, we've had
some astounding successes.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.050
And a lot of that has a lot
to do with you and people

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.270
like you.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.820
And I'll explain those
triumphs in detail.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.650
But first, let me give you
a little background on what

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.010
the state of LGBT equality
is in America right now

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.530
and tell you what our goals are.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.730
We've clearly come a long way.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.280
It's a good time to
be out in America.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.220
Last year, our nation
made a huge step forward

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.140
when the Supreme Court dismissed
DOMA, the Defense of Marriage

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.390
Act, and decided that
California's Prop 8

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.830
was unconstitutional.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.350
And props to all of you
who fought against Prop 8.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.850
That was a long-fought battle,
a long, hard-fought battle.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:05.940
I think it was the moment that
really pushed this younger

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.570
generation, this X, Y Generation
to really get involved

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.906
and really made it real for them
that this wasn't something that

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:16.530
was just going to
happen automatically.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.905
But it was something
that we were

00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:21.110
going to have to advocate
for and fight for.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.240
So I'm very proud of
the state of California

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.990
and everyone who worked so
hard to make that happen.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.800
And because of that,
marriage equality

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.519
is now legal in 19 states.

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.060
And every morning,
I have to wake up,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.730
and I have to figure out
if that's still true.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.210
Because it's happening so fast.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.210
All of us at
GLAAD-- sometimes we

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.330
have these posters
in our offices.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.560
And we have to mark very
happily the number off

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.180
and replace it with the number
19 or 20, hopefully soon.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.980
And GLAAD and
other organizations

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.190
are on the ground in the
other 31 states to make sure

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.760
that anyone can get
married to whomever

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.670
they love in any state.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.480
We still have our struggles
on the legal front

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.670
and the cultural front.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.470
But we're on our way.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.820
America's also becoming
safer for LGBT students,

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.770
since bullying has
become a national issue.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.000
Yet still today, 8
out of 10 students

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.810
report being verbally
harassed for being gay.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.690
GLAAD's Help Engage Youth
project, better known as HEY

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.770
or "Heeey!"

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.880
Spirit Day and GLSEN, which is
the Gay and Lesbian Straight

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.850
Educators Networks
Safe Schools Program,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.380
are all making a
difference so that kids

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.220
can go to school in safe
and accepting environments.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.040
And we don't just mean safe
and accepted by their peers,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.980
but by their educators
and administrators, too.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.350
The sports world has also
taken miraculous leaps

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.330
in the past year or two.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.960
Athletes like Michael Sam, Jason
Collins, and Brittney Griner

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.190
will go down in history for
breaking through the AstroTurf

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.080
ceiling.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.370
Is that a thing, the
AstroTurf ceiling?

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.110
No, it's not?

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.380
OK.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.490
Does that exist?

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.550
That'd be kind of cool,
when you think about it.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.590
But anyway, what GLAAD
does-- we work very closely

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.970
with many athletes, including
those three that I just

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.390
mentioned, on helping
them shape the narrative

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.560
of their public
coming-out stories

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.580
and to encourage
the media to cover

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.840
those stories in a fair
and non-salacious way.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.890
And now little kids
all over this country

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.760
can play tee ball and
powder puff football

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.500
and know that they can
succeed and that who they are

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.630
won't impede them from
achieving their dreams.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.310
And who knew that the 2014
Olympics would turn out

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.620
to be such a hot-button
issue for LGBT rights

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.100
and protections
around the globe?

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.820
But it did.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.360
You could not hear
the name Sochi

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.450
without thinking about
the safety and rights

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.160
of LGBT athletes and people in
Russia and around the world.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.770
And that's because of
GLAAD's work with activists

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.580
living in Russia, with news
outlets and athletes themselves

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.300
to get the message of equality
and acceptance out there.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.140
GLAAD's focus since the start
has always been on media

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.560
because we know what
a powerful force

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.780
it is in shaping opinions and
changing hearts and minds.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.050
When people know us,
when they know our story,

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.180
when they feel that
we've been in their home

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.560
on their television sets, and
they've welcomed us in in order

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.960
to share a piece
of who we are, they

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.910
feel like we're a part of their
society and their families.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.040
And when they walk into
those voting booths,

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.410
they vote with us
more often than not,

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:40.650
when that is the case.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.990
And that's why GLAAD focuses
so much on the media.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.430
That's why our work
really revolves around it.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.590
For example, transgender actress
and activist and my friend

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.230
Laverne Cox on the cover of
"Time" just a few weeks ago.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.230
It's a huge deal.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.940
For many people, Laverne Cox
is the first transgender person

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.980
that they know.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.420
And her story is powerful,
and it's changing the way

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.000
that people see
transgender people

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.780
and understand their experience.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.400
And it seems like every day,
some LGBT actor or executive

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.610
is coming out like
it's no big deal.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.260
And that's because it isn't.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.710
And it isn't anymore
because of people like you.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.380
And while LGBT people
have had huge successes

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.300
in terms of
representation on TV shows

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.100
and in films and in news
coverage of the stories

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.890
and issues that matter to us,
we still have a ways to go.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.080
And that's a priority
for GLAAD right now.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.360
But media watchdog is just
a small part of what we do.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.810
Other priorities for GLAAD
right now-- workplace

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.140
protections for
LGBT people, which

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.190
just happens to be in
the news yesterday,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.840
as I'm sure many of you heard.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.340
Just yesterday, our
president, President Obama,

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.050
announced he is expected to
sign an executive order that

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.260
would ban workplace
discrimination

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.750
against LGBT employees
of federal contractors.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.870
It's a huge, huge step.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.940
And we're very grateful
to the president

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.840
and his administration
for making that step.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.420
But we're still waiting
for both houses of Congress

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.480
to pass the Employee
Non-Discrimination

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.920
Act, or ENDA.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.330
Because today, and even
after the president signs

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.560
this executive order, if you
are not a federal employee,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.930
it will be legal for you
to be fired in 29 states

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.250
if you are gay and 32 states
if you are a transgender

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.560
person in this country.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.624
So while we celebrate the
president's announcement,

00:16:36.624 --> 00:16:38.040
we know that there's
a lot of work

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.450
to be done even afterwards.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.050
And speaking of
transgender people,

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.650
transgender rights are
incredibly important to GLAAD.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.050
Because did you know that
41% of transgender people

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.587
report attempting suicide
compared with just 1.6

00:16:55.587 --> 00:16:56.670
of the general population?

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.180
41%.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.319
That doesn't mean that
transgender people are

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.240
more likely because of who
they are to attempt suicide.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.810
It means that their lives
are made so difficult because

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.940
of the way that our
society is that that

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.040
seems like a way to go.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.099
That has to change.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.817
And that's why the stories
of Laverne Cox and people

00:17:20.817 --> 00:17:22.900
who come out as transgender
and tell their stories

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.608
are so important.

00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:25.837
And that's why GLAAD is
so committed to telling

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:26.420
those stories.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.520
There's still so much
misinformation and

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.300
misunderstanding
about trans people.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.180
And GLAAD knows
this is a priority.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.340
And it's not just talking
to the greater society

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.120
about trans people, but
it's also talking about it

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.700
within our own community.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.730
We still within
our own community

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.770
have so much to
learn-- hi, water.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.680
There's still even
within our community

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.390
so much work to do in the way
that we talk to each other

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.540
and understand each
other and our lives.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.490
So we're committed
to doing that work,

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.440
not only outside of our
community but within it.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.430
We're also working
to become more

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:15.320
connected with LGBT communities
outside of the United States.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.590
You know how bad things are in
Russia, in Uganda, in Brunei,

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.790
in Nigeria, parts of the Middle
East and other countries,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.554
where being gay can and
is a death sentence.

00:18:27.554 --> 00:18:28.970
We want to take
what we've learned

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.740
from our work on the ground here
at home in the last 30 years

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.920
and bring it to other
activists around the world.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.550
It's all part of GLAAD's
new Global Voices

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.460
program which we launched
with the Olympics.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.950
And also here at
home, we're continuing

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.420
to make it a priority to
connect with that larger

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.690
global world with
our Spanish language

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.540
and Latino media programs
and people of color.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.510
Especially meaningful to
me because, well, hello.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.810
But seriously, GLAAD is the
only national LGBT organization

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.020
with a Spanish-language program.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.060
GLAAD identified early on
that this growing population

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.120
would be integral
to our movement.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.080
And the changes we've
seen in the last 10 years

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.740
alone are staggering.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.970
You can see the effects
of our work from the way

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.350
that our news
stories are covered

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.740
on Spanish-language networks
like Univision and Telemundo,

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.720
and even in novelas
and television series.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.210
All of this made
possible by the hard work

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.130
of our Spanish-language
media department,

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.330
which I'd like to tell you
consists of two people.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:39.200
And they are hard-working,
and they get it done.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.290
Part of their most
recent work is a PSA

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.600
that we've put together that
is targeting the World Cup.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.160
And so please keep an eye
out for it because I'm in it.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.650
I mean, who else?

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.960
But it's actually a really
exciting time to be at GLAAD.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.841
I've been with the organization
on staff for almost two years

00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:04.340
now.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.910
And before that, I used
to be on the board.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.740
And I've hosted the GLAAD
Media Awards a couple of times.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.090
I have a couple of GLAAD
Media Awards myself.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.700
But I'm especially,
especially excited

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.990
about being at GLAAD
right now in this moment,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.450
because just this
January, we welcomed

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.800
our new president,
Sarah Kate Ellis, who

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.970
we welcome from the media world.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.620
And I have such huge
respect for this woman.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:36.460
She-- get this-- is a lesbian,
married to a rock musician,

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.820
yes.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:43.670
And she and her wife got
pregnant on the very same day.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.530
Bananas.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.945
They have five-year-old
twins, a girl and a boy,

00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:52.246
who are not technically twins.

00:20:52.246 --> 00:20:53.870
That's their college
essay right there.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.710
Wrap it up.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.870
But under Sarah Kate,
along with much input

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.540
from GLAAD's board of
directors and yours truly,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.940
we are taking a three-pronged
approach to the issues

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.200
as we move ahead.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.960
GLAAD's goals right now are
three-pronged-- educate,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.400
advocate, and to protect.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.970
We're educating our fellow
Americans on LGBT issues

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.350
through TV, film,
and social media.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.410
We're advocating for
LGBT people who are all

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.010
too often unprotected
or underserved.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.600
That includes LGBT kids
facing bias in schools,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.230
LGBT couples who
want to get married,

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.520
or LGBT employees
facing discrimination

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.020
in the workplace.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.860
And with our new
Southern Stories program,

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.330
we'll be focusing more and
more on our LGBT brothers

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.300
and sisters in the South,
where clearly, we still

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.970
have so much work
left to be done.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.100
GLAAD is protecting
the advances,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.410
also, we've made
recently and over

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.140
the past three decades
as anti-gay groups

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.200
push hard to create new road
blocks to equality so that they

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.760
can keep their doors open.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.590
But this is no time to let
our foot up off the gas.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.560
This is the time to push forward
and to realize the dream.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:15.430
And I try to remind people that
there was a point in 1973 when

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:22.860
Roe versus Wade was decided
on by the Supreme Court.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.750
And we thought the conversation
about abortion was over.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.220
The conversation about
abortion had just started.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:38.660
And that community who
wanted their right to choose

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.210
may have taken their
foot off the gas.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.400
And because of that,
we started to see

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.050
a lot of eroding of those
rights as years passed.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.040
And so what we at
GLAAD believe is, now

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.040
that we're starting
to see such success,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.260
we're starting to see such
advances in LGBT equality,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.990
part of our job is to make
sure that we keep those rights

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.070
and that those laws stay
in place and intact.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.500
And so it really is about
protecting those rights.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.880
And part of that, and
a large part of that,

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.290
is continuing to
have conversations

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.320
with the American people and
citizens of the world about why

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.290
these rights are important.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.730
So you will not see GLAAD
or the LGBT movement

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.160
take its foot off of the gas.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.990
We are pushing forward.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.330
And we're going to
realize the dream.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.930
And yes, part of
my work at GLAAD

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.760
includes hanging out
with huge celebrities--

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.300
it's very difficult-- at
the GLAAD Media Awards.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.170
But it's the hardest
part of my job, chilling

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.170
with JLo and Ricky Martin and
Anderson Cooper and Madonna.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.780
But I do what I have to do.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.600
And in fact, this
year GLAAD was very

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.770
proud to celebrate 25 years
of the GLAAD Media Awards.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.860
And lest you think it's
all champagne drinking,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.020
the power of the awards reaches
folks all over the world.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.710
They become a platform for
celebrities and notables

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.260
to take a stand
for LGBT equality

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.486
and come out as allies.

00:24:11.486 --> 00:24:12.860
And I brought a
video so that you

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.020
can take a look at what it's
been like for the GLAAD Media

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.870
Awards in the last 25 years.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.760
Look, I'm doing this.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.105
You should be very impressed.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.002
Ah.

00:24:29.002 --> 00:24:30.630
I know.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.210
The most impressive
thing I've done yet.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:34.710
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.938
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:41.938 --> 00:24:48.425
[NO AUDIO]

00:28:31.977 --> 00:28:34.400
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.110
WILSON CRUZ: No comments
on the hair, OK?

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.660
It was 1995.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.070
Thank you.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.175
And yes, the earring
was very in at the time,

00:28:42.175 --> 00:28:46.852
so I want to hear nothing
from any of y'all about that.

00:28:46.852 --> 00:28:47.560
Do I turn it off?

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.070
What do I do?

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.280
My hero.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.010
Thank you.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.110
But you can see that
the media awards,

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.830
while very glamorous and
glittery and we all get

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.440
dressed up and we have a great
time, is really about the fact

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.830
that a lot of those moments
that you saw in that video clip

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.420
went viral.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.250
They weren't just for
the people in that room.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.100
They were for people who were
allowed to watch those moments

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.440
and hear from people that
they recognized and respected

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.850
and could relate to.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.805
And those people, by being there
and showing their commitment

00:29:25.805 --> 00:29:28.830
to LGBT people, gave
permission to everyone

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.410
who saw them do those things
and say those things to also

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.880
be allies and also feel
comfortable with who they are.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.050
And that's powerful.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.930
We get accused of
being celebrity-driven.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.060
We're not celebrity-driven.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.240
What we are is people-driven.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.180
And we want people
to know and to feel

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.210
that they're supported
by the entire country.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.230
And some of those people
are very famous people

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:01.140
who we respect and we
hold up in our community.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.140
It's very powerful when
we think about what

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.720
somebody like
Elizabeth Taylor was

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:11.196
able to do for our movement
and the lives that she saved

00:30:11.196 --> 00:30:14.510
and she continues to save, even
today, through her foundation.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.040
So I'm very proud of
the GLAAD Media Awards.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.890
And it's also a time for us to
look at the year in the media

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.090
and say, these are the
kinds of representations of

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.950
or characters or
news stories that we

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.650
want the media to do more of.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.140
It's a way for us to
hold them accountable.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.350
It's a way for us to say thank
you for telling our story

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:43.290
and for driving forward the
conversation for LGBT equality.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.230
So it kills me every time
when I see that video.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.060
Because I think
when you look at it

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.830
and you realize
it's been 25 years,

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.150
and you think about where
we were 25 years ago,

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.280
make no mistake
that so much of that

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.140
happened because of the media
awards and because of GLAAD.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.410
And I'm very proud of being
a part of this organization.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.410
But our work today is
also in the boardrooms

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.080
and corporate communications
departments in America.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.110
Because let's face
it, corporate America

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.590
can shape the narrative
and move mountains,

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:19.730
from Capitol Hill to lunch
rooms and water coolers.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.790
I spoke about the changes
in the sports world.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.970
But corporate America
is also coming out

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.770
of the closet for equality
through internal policies,

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.200
external actions, and
gatherings like this.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.740
And that's why when
anti-LGBT laws come up

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.880
in places like Arizona like
they did earlier this year,

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.250
which would have given
businesses the ability

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.460
to turn away LGBT people
just because of who they are,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.620
we worked behind the
scenes to advocate

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.680
that national corporations
and even sports leagues

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.160
spoke out against it.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.990
We also worked
with national media

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:57.940
to make sure that the story
was being told accurately

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.300
and to combat some
of the misinformation

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.950
that our opponents
were putting out there.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.010
One of the companies that
is a leader and taking

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:10.000
a stand for this community,
for our community,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.490
is Google and has been
Google for a long time.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.050
The tech world is
progressive by nature.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.770
And you understand the
power of communication

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.770
and how to create
the platforms we

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.210
need in order to reach
people and to reach them

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.480
with this message.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.240
I don't think I'm blowing
smoke up your butts

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.660
when I say that the
work Google has done

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.140
over the past couple
of years has offered

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.220
tremendous opportunities
for LGBT equality.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.470
Last year Google
was one of hundreds

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:42.290
of companies to file a brief
with the Supreme Court arguing

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.350
that federal same-sex
marriage restrictions hurt

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.830
their businesses.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.280
But that was just
one search result

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.300
in the dozens of
search results when

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.550
you research Google
and LGBT issues.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.010
Some of that we've done
in conjunction with you,

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.760
and some you've done
all by yourself.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.460
To name a few, your
Olympic doodles

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.050
and Valentine's Day doodles--
including same-sex couples

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.330
was right in line with
the majority of Americans

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.170
who believe in diversity
and marriage equality.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.320
Second, when you
launched Google+,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.380
users were initially required to
make their gender designations

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.260
public.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.690
Some trans and gender
nonconforming users

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.030
did not love that.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:28.280
So Google+ actually became the
first social media platform

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.600
to expand their gender field
and tailor privacy settings.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.040
Next, together with GLAAD,
Google coordinated Google+

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.510
Hangouts about World AIDS Day,
the amazing documentary "How

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.830
to Survive a Plague"--
which, if you haven't seen,

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.910
you must see it-- and also to
discuss with interested parties

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:52.672
what might happen for marriage
equality in all states, Utah.

00:33:52.672 --> 00:33:56.530
Which still boggles
my mind-- I thought

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.530
that was the last one we
were going to get, honestly.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:04.370
But Google Hangouts have also
been created by your team

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.620
and with GLAAD to discuss what's
next for marriage equality

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.710
and transgender issues.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:14.420
Then Google Chrome rolled
out an "It Gets Better"

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.489
ad during "Glee," an amazing ad.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.480
It was actually nominated
for a GLAAD Advertising Award

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.630
and made history as being
one of the first national TV

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.929
commercials about an LGBT issue.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:29.020
Also, the Google
Zeitgeist "Here's to 2013"

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.570
ad was smart enough to include
images of LGBT equality,

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.630
including Cassidy Lynn
Campbell, one of our country's

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.940
first trans high school
students to be named homecoming

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.929
queen; openly gay NBA
athlete Jason Collins;

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:48.570
marriage equality; and champion
of equality Nelson Mandela.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:51.370
GLAAD was also delighted
to work with Google on last

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.630
year's Proud to Love campaign
on Google+ and YouTube.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.090
We were looking for documented
moments of love related

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:02.040
to the LGBT community, whether
it be self-love or family love,

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.310
romantic love, community
love, you name it.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.290
Then we took those images
and posted photos on Google+

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.430
or uploaded videos to YouTube.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:14.054
The GLAAD staff-- everyone--
took the challenge.

00:35:14.054 --> 00:35:16.220
And I have to say, mine is
particularly cute, so you

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.636
should go ahead
and look for that,

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:20.340
because it's worth seeing.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.210
For Pride Month
this year-- shut up,

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.510
Lauren-- we've teamed up
again for the follow-up

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.950
to that campaign, Proud to Play.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:34.170
Right now, LGBT athletes like
Jason Collins, Robbie Rogers,

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.310
Brittney Griner,
Darren Young, and more

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.110
are proud to play a role in
YouTube's newest LGBT pride

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.000
campaign.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.910
GLAAD worked with Raymond
Braun of Google and YouTube

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.210
to connect with athletes,
LGBT sports groups,

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.100
and to promote the campaign.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.810
The campaign honors LGBT
athletes, their supporters,

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.420
as well as the YouTube
creators who stand up

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.940
for diversity in
sports and elsewhere.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.540
And as part of the
campaign, YouTube's logo,

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.480
seen by tens of millions
of people every day,

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.960
features a rainbow soccer ball
and leads visitors to the Proud

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.800
to Play channel which showcases
videos of LGBT athletes

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.530
and allies speaking out
in support of equality

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.860
on the field.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:20.100
Even the Google homepage
paid homage to Proud to Play,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.110
driving googlers from across
the world to the Proud

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.230
to Play channel.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:31.060
So you have a lot to be proud of
as a member of the Google team.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.190
You guys are doing great,
great work in order

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.360
to facilitate the conversation.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.200
That's the kind of
impact you're having

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.550
on LGBT people and allies
all over the world.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.680
But you're also
making a difference

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.890
between these walls,
this workplace

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.060
with your LGBT policies.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.900
First of all, you've
got a workplace policy

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.130
for LGBT employees, and
you stand behind it.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.360
Google offered increased health
benefits for trans employees

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.680
starting in 2011.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.780
And I know you work
hard to bring diversity

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.430
to employee ranks and
encourage LGBT hires.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.230
I also hear you've got an
incredible LGBT employee

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.820
resource group, the Gayglers.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.070
I know you don't
just celebrate pride

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.810
but you inform other employees
about programs and policies

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.640
to keep this company
fair and inclusive.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.020
Some Google employees
even went out

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.060
to support marriage
equality with a really

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.180
incredible and moving
ad called "The Four."

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.580
It speaks to both the
pride of the employees

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.060
who appeared in
it and the company

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.470
that supported you in making it.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:41.370
So what can you do to make this
spirit of pride and inclusion

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.000
going-- to keep it going?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.230
What can you do to
bring in others in?

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.830
Well, as we all know,
it's not just policy

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.190
but culture at the
company that matters.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:57.150
So you can be sure to do things
like participate in Spirit Day

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.970
this fall on October 16, when
we'll all go purple in a stand

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:05.120
against LGBT bullying in
a national day of support

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.150
for LGBT young people.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.170
It's the one day a year that
the whole country comes together

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:15.310
by wearing purple, by
turning their social media

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:19.600
profiles purple in order to
say that LGBT youth should

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.020
feel safe wherever they are.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.250
You can wear purple.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.850
You can turn your
online profiles purple.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.440
You can eat eggplant if
that's what you want to do.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.990
But we work with everyone.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.240
We work with the White House,
with Oprah, with the NBA,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.370
with PepsiCo, Times
Square, the "Today" show,

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:42.840
to local schools in Wisconsin
and parishes in the South.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.650
MTV last year changed
its logo to purple,

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:50.010
and so did all of the major
league baseball teams.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:55.420
We also had every single sports
organization down to NASCAR

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.800
turned purple last year.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.830
Lots of organizations will
be doing some incredible LGBT

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.080
programming on October
16, Spirit Day.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.760
So to find out more,
you can just google it.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.440
For those of you who
identify as LGBT,

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.630
you need to continue
to be out and proud

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.170
among your colleagues
and fellow employees.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.870
Talk about your home life.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.450
Put pictures on your desk
of the people you love.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.700
They're called printed photos.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.912
They go in little frames.

00:39:25.912 --> 00:39:27.870
They don't have to be
just on your little phone

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.650
where nobody sees them.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.850
You can share your
life with people.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:38.640
It's very 20th century to
have a photo on your desk.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.790
You can continue
to be visible here

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.610
at Google and in real life.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.770
Other people will take
your stories and attitudes

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.470
with them, take
them home with them.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.830
And who knows what kinds of
minds you will be changing?

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:54.550
Who knows if the mom
in the cube next to you

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:58.210
has a gay child at home and
that is dying to come out

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.680
and wants to feel
comfortable doing that?

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.200
She can be affected
by the people

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.140
that she's met here at work.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.350
Who knows if there's
a co-worker who

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.970
wants to respond to some
discriminating or careless

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.610
words he heard on
a conference call?

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.930
You can help him do that.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.880
You can continue to
represent your company

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.450
and personal values of
inclusion, diversity,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:21.250
and equality.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.830
And you can't go wrong
just by doing that.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:27.470
And of course, I
encourage everyone

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.920
here to get involved with GLAAD.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.320
We have some amazing programs
that you can be a part of.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.910
I've mentioned
some of them today.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.490
But we also have our
San Francisco gala,

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:41.420
which takes place this
year on September 13

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.580
at the San Francisco
Hilton in Union Square.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.590
And this year, we're
really changing it up.

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.270
It's really about
the people who are

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.800
moving our movement forward.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:57.370
And we're honoring some
incredibly impressive people

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:00.300
who have taken our
movement to the next level.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.980
And a lot of that
is happening here

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.190
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.730
And we want to recognize
this community for the power

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.990
that they bring to the movement.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.470
So I encourage you
all to attend it,

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.620
to tell your friends
to come to it.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.050
It's a new kind of
event for GLAAD.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.930
And it's really
specific and special

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.240
to the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.600
And I'm actually really
very excited about it.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.040
So you can also get
on our Twitter feed.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.640
Am I allowed to
say Twitter here?

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.389
Is that OK?

00:41:33.389 --> 00:41:33.930
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:34.280
WILSON CRUZ: No?

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.780
OK.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.200
You can go to our
YouTube channel.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.630
How about that?

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.010
You can sign up for
our YouTube channel.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.910
You can follow us on Google+.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.760
You can send us your
stories and your feedback.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.502
Because we want to know
how you feel about the work

00:41:50.502 --> 00:41:51.210
that we're doing.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:55.470
And we want your input on
how we can do it better.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.340
You can share your stories,
your personal stories by going

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.740
to glaad.org/shareyourstory.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.880
That's what GLAAD stands for
today-- sharing your stories,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.650
shaping the cultural
narrative, and helping you

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.240
and your friends
and the people you

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.280
love live the life
that they love.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.340
I want to thank you personally
for having me here today.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.100
I'm very proud to celebrate
you, to celebrate Google,

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.620
to celebrate the relationship
that Google and GLAAD have

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.150
worked so hard to create
in the last few years.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.070
And that relationship is
truly changing the world.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.300
So thank you.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.150
And I'm going to take
some questions now.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:37.920
So do you need to
move the camera?

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.964
God forbid I do
anything off camera.

00:42:41.964 --> 00:42:43.422
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:43.422 --> 00:42:44.380
Is it on?

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:44.880
No.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.640
And honestly, I am not shy.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.680
I've probably answered
every conceivable question

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.900
you can come up with.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.210
So feel free.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:00.210
We can talk about GLAAD.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.960
We can talk about my career.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.260
We can talk about where
we are in the movement.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.720
We could talk about Google.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.770
Who's going to be first?

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:20.508
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:41.620
WILSON CRUZ: Right.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:46.750
So her question was to go
into a little bit more depth

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:51.440
about how GLAAD is doing
its international work.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.420
Mainly because in so
many of these countries,

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.040
if we're talking about
countries like Brunei or Russia

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.450
or the Middle East,
more visibility

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.820
can actually be very dangerous.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.870
So what we're committed
to doing is actually

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.020
working with people
who are already

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.640
working as activists in those
countries and reinforcing them

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.810
and the work that they're doing.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:23.020
A lot of these people on
the ground around the world

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.680
are creating actions.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:31.080
And they're doing what
they can how they can.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.020
So we're going in
and giving them

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.540
the wealth of our own
experience and knowledge

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.070
of how we started
here 30 years ago.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.040
And we're also coming in with
a lot of media experience,

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.090
how to engage their local media.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.670
We're not recruiting for them.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.410
What we are doing
is asking them what

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:55.490
it is that they need, what is
that they feel they need help

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:59.340
with on the ground as
far as how do they talk

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:04.710
to their local media, to their
national media, what access

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:07.730
they have to it, how to
start the conversations

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.450
with those media outlets.

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:14.230
For instance, when this
whole thing blew up in Russia

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:18.490
with these anti-gay laws
that were passed there,

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:22.700
we actually, along with
other organizations,

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.900
brought out a number
of LGBT activists

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.200
who had been working
on the ground.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.790
And we brought them here to
the States before the Olympics,

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:34.010
like months before, so that
they could meet people here

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:38.040
who were influencers
and who had experience

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.680
early on in the
movement in order

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.590
for them to get advice on
how to go about the work

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.450
that they were
doing on the ground.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:55.570
We're also giving them--
we're amplifying their voices

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:56.880
in American media.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.400
Because so much of the
media-- is this thing on?

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.480
So much of the media
in their own countries

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:07.940
aren't giving them the space
that they need or deserve.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:13.140
So what we're doing
is we're getting them

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.930
the bullhorn here in the United
States, in American media,

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.360
knowing that the media
here in the States

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.580
is spread out across the world.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:30.500
So we're shedding a light
on what's happening there,

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.680
knowing that it
will boomerang back,

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.250
even if it's just
through the internet.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:43.480
So it's really about reinforcing
them, giving them the ability

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.570
to do their work better,
and training them

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:52.710
on how to use the media locally.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.930
And we're really sticking to
our-- that's our home, right?

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:00.250
How do you amplify your message?

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:05.435
How do you get as many
eyes and ears to the story

00:47:05.435 --> 00:47:07.100
that you want told?

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:11.010
And that's the role we
see ourselves playing.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.420
And that's what we've
learned how to do best.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.370
But you're right.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:21.380
I think you're right in the
sense that it is dangerous.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.120
But we have to remember that
40 years ago, 50 years ago,

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.880
it was dangerous here.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.370
And we wouldn't be here
today if there weren't people

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:38.050
who were willing to risk their
lives so that we could get here

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:38.660
today.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.320
And the people we're
meeting in places

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.820
like Russia and China
and the Middle East

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.600
know that they're putting
themselves in danger.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.850
I think our job as a media
advocacy organization

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:57.160
is to shed a big
spotlight on them.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.490
Just at the media
awards this past year,

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:02.840
we gave out our
very first Advocate

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.410
for Change Award, which
is a global award.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.070
And we gave it to
Manny de Guerre,

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:13.240
who is the head of the LGBT
Film Festival in Russia.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.380
And she really is starting
a conversation there.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.305
And we, along with
Dustin Lance Black

00:48:22.305 --> 00:48:25.750
and with Bruce Cohen, who went
out there, and Gus Van Sant,

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.577
they really put a big
spotlight on those issues

00:48:29.577 --> 00:48:31.035
at the time of
their film festival.

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:35.260
And they put
themselves in danger.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.100
There were bomb
threats at the time.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.490
And we celebrated
her hoping that

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.250
by people hearing her story
and hearing her struggle,

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:49.360
that there would be more
and more global pressure put

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.600
on the government of Russia
to change their laws.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.444
Did that answer your question?

00:48:59.748 --> 00:49:00.692
Hi.

00:49:00.692 --> 00:49:02.580
AUDIENCE: It seems
lately that there's

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.650
been some divisiveness
in the LGBT community.

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:10.050
Particularly, I feel a
lot of trans folk upset

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:13.140
with people like Dan
Savage or with RuPaul.

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.720
Is there a role
for GLAAD in trying

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.219
to bridge those pieces
of divisiveness?

00:49:20.219 --> 00:49:22.260
WILSON CRUZ: Yeah, I think
that's exactly what we

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.284
have been doing.

00:49:23.284 --> 00:49:24.950
AUDIENCE: Could you
repeat the question?

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.116
WILSON CRUZ: Oh, yes, sorry.

00:49:26.116 --> 00:49:33.460
So the question was does
GLAAD have a place, a part

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:37.080
to play in helping
bridge a divide that

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.930
seems to be being created in
our own community in regards

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:44.890
to language, right?

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:49.480
As far as language in
reference to trans people,

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.070
there seems to be two
schools of thought.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:57.890
And really, there is a
place for GLAAD to play,

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:00.630
and we've been
playing it, which is

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:05.440
how do we manage to have this
conversation without tearing

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.240
each other apart.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:17.290
And it's been very frustrating,
I have to be honest with you,

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:20.910
because I've been working a lot
on this with the communications

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:22.950
team and the programs team.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:27.010
I can tell you how I
feel about it personally.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:33.080
And I think I speak
for our staff, as well,

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.550
which is I'm not a trans person.

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:40.510
So I have to defer
to trans people

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:45.160
when they tell me how they
want to be referred to.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:51.040
It is not my place as a gay man
to say that I have the right

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:57.080
to use a particular word in
reference to trans people.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:01.650
I'd look at it as if I
had a brother or a sister,

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:03.843
and they came to me and
they said, you know,

00:51:03.843 --> 00:51:08.070
when you use that
word, it offends me.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:15.510
As their brother, I
would stop immediately

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.010
because I love them, because
they're part of my family.

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:24.070
I don't understand what it is
that people are robbed from.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:25.830
I don't understand
what people are

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:38.750
robbed when they are asked
to respect people in the way

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.960
that they want to
be referred to.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:48.200
Had I used the word,
the T word, in the past

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.130
before I was educated about it?

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:50.690
Absolutely.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.160
I thought it was a funny word.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.100
Now that I know differently,
I do differently.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.320
Maya Angelou died just
a couple of weeks ago.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.410
And that was her
biggest lesson for me--

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:05.330
I am allowed to make mistakes.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:09.430
But once I am educated enough
to know that I made a mistake,

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:14.650
it's my job to learn that
lesson and change my actions.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:22.970
I hope that we're starting
to see that there are parts

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:25.110
of our community
who are starting

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.640
to learn that lesson as well.

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.940
There is a freedom of speech
in this country, obviously.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.280
But your freedom of speech
ends at someone else's nose.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.530
As soon as it hurts
somebody else,

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.990
I think you need
to stop, especially

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.020
when it's hurting
someone who you

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.160
are supposed to consider family.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.150
That's how I see it.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:53:00.030
How people refer to
themselves-- that's fine.

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:04.240
If you want to call
yourself something, please,

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.200
go right ahead.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.960
How you refer to other
people-- that's another issue.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:16.600
And I think we've learned
this lesson many times.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:20.950
We've learned it within our
own community a few times.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:23.880
We don't use the F word.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.750
We ask people not
to use the F word.

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:30.400
African Americans
have asked not to be

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.017
referred to as the N word.

00:53:32.017 --> 00:53:33.850
They can call themselves
that all they want.

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:35.610
They do it in rap
music all the time.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.443
If that's what they
want to do, that's fine.

00:53:37.443 --> 00:53:40.010
But I don't get that
freedom because I'm not

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:42.290
a part of that community.

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:48.040
So I think there
are lessons to be

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.330
learned from those two examples.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:54:00.830
But also, I just want us to love
each other a little bit more.

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:06.630
And it's not an attack on
somebody when you tell someone,

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.150
that word offends me.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.260
I think people are
feeling attacked.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.800
And it's not an attack.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.890
It's new information
that you get to process

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:18.590
and hopefully do
the right thing.

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.270
And I think a lot of this
comes out of the fact

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:30.460
that trans issues are part
of the national zeitgeist

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:30.960
right now.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.340
I think there's so
much education, so much

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.167
information about trans people
that we've never had before.

00:54:36.167 --> 00:54:37.750
And it's really
coming out of the fact

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:40.490
that the trans
community is empowered

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:43.290
to actually speak up
and say, you know what?

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.300
I don't like that.

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.480
I didn't like it
then, but now I feel

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.500
empowered to say
I don't like it.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:55.590
And I want you to respect
me enough to treat me

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.130
with the respect that I deserve.

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:00.350
So when people say,
oh, well, we used

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:02.610
to be able to use that
word, well, nobody

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.540
was feeling empowered enough
to say it was wrong then.

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.230
And so we're all
learning something.

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:14.910
It's a big learning curve.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:18.360
And I hope that the trans
community also allows people

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:26.090
the time and has the patience
to give people the time

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:30.410
to learn the lesson
and come around.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.230
Part of advocacy and activism
is continuing to push.

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.890
I get that.

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.600
I've been doing
it my whole life.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.730
It's really the
responsibility of the advocate

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.160
and the activist to continue
to put the pressure on.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:51.580
But we always know that it
takes a little bit of time.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.440
People don't just
change automatically.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.550
So there is give and
take on both sides here.

00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:03.630
There's the give on the LGB side
to say, OK, I'm getting there.

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.252
I understand that
it offends you.

00:56:05.252 --> 00:56:06.210
I'm going to get there.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:06.960
I'm learning.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.210
And then there's the give
on the trans side, which

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.330
is I'm going to give you
the time to get there

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:16.790
and continue to ask
you to do better.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:17.930
But it's a hard one.

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:19.790
And it breaks my
heart to see it.

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:25.670
Bueller?

00:56:30.848 --> 00:56:34.080
AUDIENCE: I'm very familiar
with your body of work.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:34.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:37.048 --> 00:56:38.381
WILSON CRUZ: Thank you for that.

00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:40.305
Thank you.

00:56:40.305 --> 00:56:41.748
AUDIENCE: It's very impressive.

00:56:41.748 --> 00:56:45.596
I feel like I've sort of
grown up with you [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.940
And I think it's really awesome
that your visibility provides

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.589
you with this forum [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.355
I think-- were you in Christina
Aguilera's "What a Girl Wants"

00:57:03.355 --> 00:57:04.820
video?

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.559
WILSON CRUZ: I was
not, but this is not

00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:08.100
the first time
somebody has asked me.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.120
And then I watched the video.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.330
And I was like,
oh, OK, I could see

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:11.500
why people would
think that was me.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.570
No, that is not me.

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:13.474
AUDIENCE: Somebody
mentioned that to me.

00:57:13.474 --> 00:57:14.682
I was like, oh, I don't know.

00:57:14.682 --> 00:57:16.100
WILSON CRUZ: No.

00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.270
Now I'm here.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:18.190
No, that was not me.

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.440
It's some really great dancer.

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.090
I'm a good dancer--
I'm not that good.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:23.084
But no, that's not me.

00:57:23.084 --> 00:57:24.750
I'm not in the Christina
Aguilera video.

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:25.960
That's what he just asked me.

00:57:28.885 --> 00:57:30.676
AUDIENCE: Out of all
the things that you've

00:57:30.676 --> 00:57:34.168
done throughout the years, what
stands out to you the most?

00:57:34.168 --> 00:57:42.280
Or what is your most
memorable project [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.980
WILSON CRUZ: Well, I
would be ridiculous

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.200
if I didn't say that Rickie
Vasquez wasn't my favorite.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.650
And mainly because--
thank you-- without him,

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.360
there wouldn't have
been anything else.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:04.180
But also because playing him
was very cathartic for me.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.320
I was 19, 20 when
I was playing him.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:13.260
And I got to go back in
time a bit to high school

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:19.780
and play my 15, 16-year-old self
and heal a lot of those wounds.

00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:26.880
And I left that stuff
sitting on that stage.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.090
I got to play it out and leave
it there and walk away from it.

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:36.090
And so it was a healing
experience for me.

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:39.790
And also, it was the
first time, right?

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:42.900
It was the first time
that we in the States

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.960
got to see what
it was like-- what

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.010
it is like-- for a
young person questioning

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:53.760
themselves and taking that
journey of self-discovery

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.050
and self-acceptance.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:59.970
And I'm really, really proud
of the way we handled it.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:05.860
We gave him the time and
the space to love himself.

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.460
And I think at the end
of those 19 episodes,

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:12.120
you really did see him embrace
himself and start celebrating

00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.240
himself as opposed to
being afraid of what

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.682
was coming to him.

00:59:16.682 --> 00:59:17.890
And I'm really proud of that.

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:20.285
I feel like we empowered
a lot of young people.

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:28.260
And now, when I look back on it,
20 years later-- actually, this

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.020
is the 20th anniversary.

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.360
August will be the
20th anniversary.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.610
And so I think about all of
the young people who grew up

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:38.400
knowing Rickie
Vasquez, who may not

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:42.850
have known a gay person
at their own high school.

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:44.580
And he could be that
person for them.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.620
And so that when they
were out in the real world

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:51.640
and they met somebody or
somebody came out to them,

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:56.110
they didn't feel that this was
some alien person, that this

00:59:56.110 --> 01:00:01.730
was someone that they
understood and could accept.

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:06.730
Do I think that he changed
a whole generation?

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.490
No, but I think he helped
educate a whole generation

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:12.120
of young people
and their parents.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.020
So I'm proud of that.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.737
I'm a singer, dancer,
actor at heart.

01:00:17.737 --> 01:00:19.070
That's what I was trained to do.

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:23.790
So the fact that I got to
be on Broadway in "Rent"

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.250
and do that for a year
and a half-- well,

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:35.350
it was almost two years-- and
play that specific role, that

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:37.760
was a dream come true for me.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.170
I grew up watching Rita
Moreno in "West Side Story."

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.480
I would put it on all the time.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.270
And eight shows a week for two
years, I got to be Rita Moreno.

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:49.613
What boy gets to say that?

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:57.130
I'm really proud
of "Noah's Arc."

01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:01.150
I think that "Noah's
Arc," while not perfect,

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:06.770
was the first time that we
saw a cast of African American

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:11.460
and Latino gay men who were
well-adjusted and educated

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:19.850
and successful and in love and
looking for love and unafraid.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.650
And I got to play a
doctor who was living

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:24.510
with HIV who was
probably the most

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.650
well-adjusted
person in the cast.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:30.600
And I think that
message is something

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.330
that we need to see more of, to
help relieve the stigma of HIV

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.940
and AIDS in our community.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.240
So I'm proud of that.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.970
It's like asking me to
choose between my children.

01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:45.420
It's very "Sophie's
Choice" to me right now.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.590
But one of the reasons why
I took the job at GLAAD

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:54.085
was so that I only want to
do things that I really love

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:55.710
and that I really
care about and that I

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:59.020
feel like I can
throw myself into.

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:03.860
And working at GLAAD helped
me work directly with studios

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:08.370
and networks to ask for
more of those kinds of roles

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:11.920
and also gave me the
time and the ability

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.240
to still pay my bills
and not take roles

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.080
that I wasn't in love with.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.280
I'm very lucky in that sense.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.640
And also helped me feel
useful in the world

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.090
while I waited for something
great to come along.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:28.860
And now I get to continue
to work at GLAAD.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.490
And somehow, I'm going to be
doing this series in the fall.

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:32.990
I don't know how
I'm going to do it,

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:35.323
because I'm going to be flying
back and forth between LA

01:02:35.323 --> 01:02:36.610
and Atlanta for a lot of it.

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:40.639
But I'm really excited
about "Red Band Society"

01:02:40.639 --> 01:02:41.680
and what's about to come.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.070
So I'm a lucky boy.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:51.086
Or an old man, depending
on how old you are.

01:02:51.086 --> 01:02:52.780
AUDIENCE: So when
you were kicked out

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.890
of the house at that
stage, what would you

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:58.325
say was your biggest
motivation or role

01:02:58.325 --> 01:03:01.235
model, the resource
that kept you going?

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.390
WILSON CRUZ: So what kept me
going when I was homeless?

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:13.510
Well, to be fair-- what
most people don't know

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:19.770
is that we made the pilot of
"My So-Called Life" in 1993.

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:22.580
And then we weren't picked up.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.190
The show wasn't picked
up for the fall,

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.930
but they held on
to us for a year.

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:36.250
And so they told us in May
that we weren't picked up.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.010
October, they told
us that we were

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:42.600
going to get picked up
for the following year.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.240
So I came out to my
dad after we knew

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.740
that we were going
to get picked up.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.580
So I came out to him in
December of that year,

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:53.280
so two months after we got
the pick-up of the series.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.000
We didn't start
filming until April.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So I lived in my car
for like four months.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.300
So what kept me going was
knowing that I had an endpoint.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.982
So as far as LGBT homeless
youth, I was lucky.

01:04:09.982 --> 01:04:11.690
Because I knew that
there was a day where

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:12.846
I was going to be
on a TV show, and I

01:04:12.846 --> 01:04:14.179
was going to be getting a check.

01:04:14.179 --> 01:04:18.950
So all I had to do was
get through four months.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:26.620
That's not the case for most--
safe to say-- LGBT young people

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.840
who are thrown out
of their homes.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.350
It kept me going
to know that I was

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:31.850
going to be able
to tell this story.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.310
Was it difficult?

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:37.000
Absolutely.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.640
And most of that,
let's be honest,

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.200
could've been avoided if I
didn't have all this Puerto

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.660
Rican pride, ego, that didn't
allow me to ask for help.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.020
I don't recommend it.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.050
I don't think
living in your blue

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:55.460
Chevy Sprint should be
experienced by anybody.

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.490
So if there is anybody out
there who's going through that

01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:02.050
and is being kicked
out of their house,

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:06.300
there are resources that you can
reach out to, and you should.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.860
I was dumb.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.700
But I also knew that
it was going to end.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.860
I just couldn't bring
myself to ask for help.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.068
That was part of the problem.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:24.330
Which is why going
through that series

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:27.360
and, like I said earlier,
experiencing a lot of that

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:32.188
and leaving it there helped heal
a lot of my issues around it.

01:05:35.626 --> 01:05:37.417
AUDIENCE: You touched
on this a little bit.

01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:39.326
But my question is,
what do you feel

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:41.936
like the most controversial
issues in our community are

01:05:41.936 --> 01:05:43.144
and the most divisive issues?

01:05:46.132 --> 01:05:48.124
I guess it's controversial
to even answer.

01:05:48.124 --> 01:05:49.568
WILSON CRUZ: Yeah.

01:05:49.568 --> 01:05:51.982
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:53.440
WILSON CRUZ: The
most controversial

01:05:53.440 --> 01:06:05.390
and the most divisive-- [SIGHS]

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:09.690
I mean, it's all
controversial, depending

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:12.421
on where you are in the country.

01:06:12.421 --> 01:06:14.920
I think there's a lot of work
to be done in the South, which

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.253
is why we're taking on the
South in our Southern Stories

01:06:17.253 --> 01:06:19.380
program.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.470
I think there are ways
into the South, though.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.210
There's a lot of work that we
can do through sports programs,

01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:30.300
through churches that
are going to allow

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:33.420
us to have these conversations.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.945
Local media is
going to be helpful.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.330
Divisive is really-- the most
divisive issue right now,

01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:45.150
I honestly think, is
the one that I was just

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:46.230
talking about earlier.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:56.360
I think the way we talk to each
other in our own community--

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:00.130
we need to be much more
mindful with each other.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:06.970
We need to be much more
empathetic with each other.

01:07:10.117 --> 01:07:11.700
And it's not just
the trans community.

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:16.160
I also saw something
recently, this conversation

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.340
around bisexuality that was
also very troubling to me.

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.950
It was a back and forth
about, oh, you're not bi.

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:29.360
You sleep with men,
so you have to be gay.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.130
And the person was like,
well, no, I actually

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:34.440
am attracted to men and women.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.600
And the person said,
well, that doesn't exist.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.867
And that's so disrespectful
and so dismissive.

01:07:41.867 --> 01:07:43.200
That may not be your experience.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.741
But that doesn't
mean your experience

01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:48.120
is everyone else's experience.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:53.030
I really want us to be able
to-- there's so much coming

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:56.830
at us from the other side,
from our real opponents,

01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:00.750
that I want us to love each
other a little bit more

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:02.210
within our own community.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:05.670
Because the same people
who hate you for being gay

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:08.820
are the same people who
hate you for being trans.

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.580
And we have the same enemies.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.720
And that's why
we're a community.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.750
We're fighting
against the same foe.

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:21.660
And the infighting isn't going
to help us get to our end goal.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.290
And our end goal is the day when
none of that matters anymore.

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:29.430
And you can just live your
life as who you really

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:33.470
are and love the
person that you choose

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:37.756
and be the person that
you choose to wake up as.

01:08:37.756 --> 01:08:40.859
That's the end
goal, not I should

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:46.233
be allowed to use this
word because, because.

01:08:46.233 --> 01:08:49.270
If you can't give me a
reason why, you should--

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:51.580
that's the thing
that gets me crazy.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.550
Why is that word so
important to you?

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:56.279
Well, because I should
be able to say it.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.170
That's not a reason.

01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:01.090
Anyway.

01:09:08.915 --> 01:09:09.415
Anybody?

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:13.721
I think we're good.

01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:15.720
Thank you so much, honestly,
for having me here.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.439
And thank you for doing this.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.860
And happy Pride.

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:22.510
[APPLAUSE]
