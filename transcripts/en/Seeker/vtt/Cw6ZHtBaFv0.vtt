00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.730
There's this gal at work who is so rude.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.850
She hates people's complicated orders, calls
security all the time…

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.850
Once, I ordered a shake and she was all like,
"You're havin' a coke."

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.570
Rude!

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.490
Greetings drones, peons and empty suits, this
is Trace here for DNews, and your rudeness

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.820
is really making it hard to work here.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.200
A new study in the Journal of Applied Psychology
found workplace rudeness is a contagious behavior.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.130
With only a single incident, rudeness can
spread through a workplace like a virus.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.960
Anyone can be a carrier and anyone can start
the cycle.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.210
Humans are social beings, and since we're
used to living in social groups, emotions

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.070
and behaviors can be contagious; we've discussed
this before.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.150
In a publication from the Association for
Psychological Science a preeminent expert

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.110
on emotional contagions Dr. Elaine Hatfield
wrote, "If we feel irritated at a client,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.950
the client is irritated at us or something
else."

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.480
This rabbit-hole goes deep.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.829
Doctors are affected by the emotions of their
patients, laughing people cause others to

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.479
laugh… it's almost in a "monkey-see monkey-do
kind of way," Dr. Hatfield said.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.109
Our emotions then bleed into our actions too.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:12.060
When sitting in a sports bar you'll likely
pick up the emotion of excited fans and unconsciously

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.060
mimic it!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.819
Even if you couldn't care less.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.999
Which is how a tiny bit of rudeness can go
a long way.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:22.779
Participants of the rudeness study were shown
a video of people being rude, then asked to

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:24.499
assess a neutral email.

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.320
Those who'd experienced rudeness, projected
rudeness onto their response.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.529
Separately, in interviews, if people felt
they'd been treated rudely, they were rated

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:34.810
as rude in future interviews with others.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.869
And it doesn't stop there, the researchers
found, “contagious rudeness” can last

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.139
a week growing in complexity and creating
first and second order consequences.

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.960
Second-order consequences are supremely complicated
mathematical equations, but here's a simple

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.859
example: David fells Goliath, and that has
an affect on Goliath's army.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:54.989
Cause and effect.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.189
His army will then either retreat, or attack
with a vengeance!

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.880
That decision starts another round of cause-and-effect
or in other words, a second-order consequence.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.289
To apply this to workplace rudeness, a person
being rude causes someone else to be rude,

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.560
which then is the cause for another round
of rudeness, and a ripple of rudeness spreads

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.050
throughout the workplace.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.060
That single incident, "changes how you interpret
the world," says the lead author of the study!

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.310
And that interpretation affects everything
about the workplace.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.090
According to a study in BioMed Research International
75 percent of people have been subjected to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.430
workplace rudeness 1-2 times a year.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.890
They found, workplace incivility can negatively
affect sleep, job-satisfaction, well-being,

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.239
and turnover, but for some reason they also
found "those who behave rudely in the workplace

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.550
experience stronger social support," reinforcing
bad behavior and keeping the cycle going!

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.989
Luckily, there's a solution.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.049
Awareness.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.680
By being mindful of our interactions with
others, and, calling out rudeness when it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.500
happens, we can stop the rudeness cycle before
it spreads, and though it might seem harmless,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.799
it can actually be pretty harmful.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.189
The rude stops HERE.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.579
We should all endeavor to stop the cycle of
rudeness, but if you haven't watched Amy and

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.170
I on Science Channel…

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.170
Rude!

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.140
Every weeknight at 9pm Science Channel shows
the DNews Minute, an original story from science

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.690
news just for Science Channel.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.920
I'm super excited about this, so if you like
the show here online, PLZ watch it on tv too.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.390
And tell your friends.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.680
Do you have strategies on how to be mindful
in the workplace?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.639
I have a lamp that reminds me not to screw
anything up.

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.700
Some people use sticky notes…

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.959
What do you do?
