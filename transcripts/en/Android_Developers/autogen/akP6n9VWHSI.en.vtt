00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.850
 Ian: Well Joanna. 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.140
 Let's write all about Android designs. 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.880
 Just to summarize, the group view is a fancy word 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.810
 For a facade --- a vision can lend her children. 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.130
 Joanna: Exactly, we really have all these interfaces 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.343
 Let's choose from them, because they are functionally different 

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:21.530
 In how to place their children. 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.363
 Ian: Yeah. 

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:24.340
 For example, linear design is always one row 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.824
 Or one column, and the frame interface has nested children. 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.760
 Joanna: Exactly, but if you want to influence 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.500
 With this overlap or column, 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900
 It is necessary to use a layout attribute. "Interface property" 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.895
 This explains to the system where these children should be. 

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:37.240
 Let's take such a facade, 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.870
 Our attractive facade defines the two children, 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.120
 But in different ways to overlap. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.920
 Ian: Uh! 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.260
 If this is the length and width of the interface 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470
 You add them to the children is really 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.760
 Rules for the father, not for the same scenery. 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.390
 Joanna: We've made it easy for you 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.150
 To understand the blog post located in 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.730
 Description Down where we are 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.690
 Well we will talk about each interface property you must 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.450
 Know it, if it is the interface 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.055
 Suitable for your application already. 

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:06.430
 Ian: It looks like it'll take time 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.532
 Joanna: Just a little bit. 

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:10.490
 Importantly, it is an important resource and you should examine it. 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.350
 It will help you build better applications. 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.320
 Ian: I'm the best apps. 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.220
 I'm the best apps. 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.120
 Joanna: Stop. 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.539
