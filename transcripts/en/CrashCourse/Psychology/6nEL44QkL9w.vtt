00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.299
Bernice has issues, and sure we all do, but
hers are getting out of hand. At times she

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.420
goes through bouts of depression that make
it hard for her to even get out of bed. Sometimes

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.839
she suffers from serious anxiety around things
like test taking, flying, lots of things.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.199
All of which are brutalizing her self-worth and
affecting her performance in work and life.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.760
She's ready to get professional help and,
lucky for Bernice, she has a lot of options.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.060
Psychotherapy, perhaps the predominant type
of psychological treatment, involves a therapist

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.860
using a range of techniques to help a patient overcome
troubles, gain insight, and achieve personal growth.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.160
Now you know by now that there are kinds of
perspectives on the human mind and lots of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.469
different philosophies on how to approach
it. So it may not come as a surprise that

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.789
there's also a variety of ways that experts
analyze and treat ailments of the mind.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.379
They each create their own kind of experience
for a person seeking help and to be honest

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.429
some approaches are better suited for treating
certain psychological conditions than others.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.920
But with Bernice as our guide we can see how
each of these techniques works and maybe in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.220
the end we can get her out of bed, feeling more calm
and confident, and back in the swing of things.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.580
He's back!

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.020
If we're going to talk about psychotherapy,
we've got to start with Freud, right? Psychotherapy,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.980
you will recall, is commonly grouped into
four major schools or orientations. The psychodynamic,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.830
existential-humanistic, behavioral, and cognitive
therapies. Freud's famous lay on the couch

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.570
and talk psychoanalysis is just one of several
related therapies in the psychodynamic family

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.840
and it was basically the first.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.810
In essence, Freud assumed that we didn't really
know or at least fully understand ourselves

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.350
or our motivations. So psychoanalysis served
as a kind of historical reconstruction that

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.840
helped patients access repressed feelings
and memories and unconscious thoughts, by

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.950
using free association and dream analysis
with helpful interpretations from the therapist

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.200
until they gained some self-insight.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.550
As you free associate, talk about your past
and answer questions, your psychoanalyst picks

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.110
up on sensitive subjects around which you
appear to show resistance. Mental blocks that

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.290
keep you from your consciousness because they
cause you anxiety. The psychoanalyst notes

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.849
these resistances and offers interpretations of what
might be going on to help promote insight.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.980
So if Bernice was visiting a psychoanalyst,
talking about her day, the therapist might

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.510
say "Tell me more about that dream with the
birds with the broken wings." Or he might

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.489
point out resistance, like, "I noticed that
when you mentioned your fear of flying, you

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.519
tend to bring up your childhood, but you never
talk about your mother. Why might that be?"

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.340
The therapist points out what may be unconscious
themes to coax them into the light. Maybe

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.560
Bernice needs to deal with a traumatic childhood
memory or the fact that her mom ran away with

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.579
a pilot or something to understand the roots
of her fear.

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.170
Today, traditional psychoanalysis is less
common. Critics have pointed out that psychoanalytic

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.310
interpretations aren't easy to prove or disprove,
which is a problem when you're trying to take

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.549
the scientific approach. Plus, psychoanalysis
tends to involve many sessions, sometimes

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.309
4 or 5 a week over a long period of time, and health
insurance just won't cover that anymore.

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.920
Therapists who have branched off from the
psychoanalytic school fall into the psychodynamic

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.299
family, which includes not just Freudian,
theory, but also ideas from Karl Jung, Alfred

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.379
Adler, Karen Horney, and others.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.299
The terms psychoanalytic and psychodynamic
are often confused, but you can think of psychoanalysis

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.599
as Freud's particular baby, while psychodynamic
theory is really the family descended from

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.669
that baby. Similar to psychoanalysis, psychodynamic
therapy focuses on helping people gain insight

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:37.200
on the impact of unconscious internal forces,
early relationships, and critical childhood

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.519
experiences. But these therapies don't dwell
on the id and the ego and superego or all

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.319
the sex stuff, at least not like traditional
psychoanalysis does.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.069
And not all psychologists are interested in
rooting through your deep unconscious recesses

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.609
like it was your underwear drawer. Some therapies
focus more on conscious material and believe

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.359
the present and future are worth more attention
than the past. These include the existential-humanistic

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.260
therapies, championed by Carl Rogers, Viktor
Frankl, Fritz Perls, and others, who emphasized

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.430
people's inherent capacity for making rational
choices, achieving self-acceptance, and attaining

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.779
their maximum potential.

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:17.629
Like the psychodynamic school, existential-humanistic
therapy is still insight oriented, but it's

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:23.319
much more about promoting growth rather than
curing illness. Instead of calling folks patients,

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.520
humanistic therapies refer to those they help
as clients or just, ya know, people.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.780
In the mid 1900s, Rogers developed a humanistic
technique called client-centered therapy.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.729
He encouraged therapists to help their client
by providing an empathetic, genuine, and accepting

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.089
environment and using active listening where
the therapist echoes and clarifies what their

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:47.580
clients are saying and feeling. Rogers believed
these techniques helped to provide a safe,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.430
non-judgmental place where clients could accept
themselves, feel valued, and work towards

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.910
self-actualization. But other therapists in
this school brought in more somber topics.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.610
Perls, Frankl, and others incorporated the
existentialist perspective, understanding

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.960
anxiety and limits to personal growth is driven
by the human impulse to deny the fact that,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.520
let's face it, we're all going to die. Sounds
a little grim, but much like the existentialist

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.819
philosophers, these theorists thought to maximize
human potential and meaning in life in the

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:22.389
face of those existential fears, helping people
access their genuine selves.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.750
So let's say Bernice sees an existentialist-humanistic
therapist and talks about her depression and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.210
how it's keeping her from living a full life.
By focusing on the present, this therapist

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.330
might suggest that Bernice is afraid and avoidant
of her true emotions, the bad and scary ones

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.720
as well as the good ones, which is why she
feels emotionally lifeless and drained. So

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.870
her therapist might say, "Say more about the
feelings that you're having right now, in this

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.060
moment, as you talk about your depression."
The therapist would listen without interpreting,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.129
at least at first, and help Bernice understand
that she was being heard and accepted, which

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.809
hopefully would give her comfort and
strength to begin dealing with the tough

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:00.560
emotions that she's been avoiding.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.470
Now if Bernice were to make her appointments
with a behavior therapist, she'd experience

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.659
quite a different session. Behavior therapists
argue that simply knowing that you're afraid

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.819
of flying, for example, won't help you from
freaking out at the thought of getting on

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.259
a plane. Instead these therapists suggest
that the problem behavior is the actual issue

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.789
and the best way to get rid of unwanted automatic
behavior is to replace it with more functional

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.080
behavior through new learning and conditioning.
In other words, behavior therapy aims to change

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.659
behavior in order to change emotions and moods.
Behavior therapy is rooted in the experiments

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.250
of Ivan Pavlov and his classically conditioned
dogs that drooled at the sound of a bell and

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.580
work by E L Thorndike and B F Skinner on operant
conditioning or changing behavior by using

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.310
positive or negative reinforcement.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.810
So say Bernice is seeing a behavior therapist
because of an intense fear of flying. We know

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.909
her fear is keeping her from personal and
career goals like going to conferences and

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.979
vacationing to Baja. But sometimes it even
effects her ability to look up at a blue sky

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.129
or flip through a travel magazine. Her therapist
might use counter-conditioning to evoke new

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:07.599
responses to the stimuli that trigger this
unwanted behavior or she may use other behavior

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:13.000
therapy methods like exposure, systematic
desensitization, and aversive conditioning

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.069
to help Bernice modify her reactions and behavior.
So she doesn't dwell on having Bernice relive

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:23.329
old memories or helping her self-actualize,
she just wants to fix the problem behavior.

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:28.039
Aversive conditioning is less common and usually
involves pairing an unpleasant stimulus with

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:32.639
the targeted behavior. A classic example is
giving someone with an alcohol problem a pill

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.460
that makes them puke when they drink.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.419
Far more common and better studied, the exposure
therapies treat an anxiety by having a person

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:44.729
face their fears by exposing them to real
or imagined situations that they typically

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:49.419
avoid. Systematic desensitization is a type
of exposure therapy that associates a relaxed

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:55.689
state of mind with gradually increasing anxiety-inducing
stimuli. Taking Bernice from, say, just thinking

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.719
about flying, to looking at photos of planes
in the air to sitting on a grounded plane,

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:02.740
to eventually soaring in the skies for reals.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.060
Behavior therapy works pretty well in treating
specific fears and problems like phobias and

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.439
it can also work for people with generalized
anxiety disorder or major depression, but

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:16.449
it often needs a boost. And we can get that
boost from the cognitive therapies, the kind

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:20.849
that teach people new, more adaptive ways
of thinking. Cognitive therapy focuses more

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:26.069
on what people think rather than what they
do, assuming that if you can change a self-defeating

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:27.999
thought, you can change the related behavior.

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:32.610
This is the approach used by founding American
cognitive therapist Aaron Beck. He and his

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.839
colleagues pioneered the Socratic questioning
method to help clients reverse destructive

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:43.169
and catastrophic beliefs about themselves,
the world, or the future at large, such as

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.430
everything that could possibly go wrong will
go wrong.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.370
Say Bernice has a big test coming up, like
a really big, all or nothing, end of the year

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.980
exam. She's freaking out and her anxiety around
the test already has her depressed, imagining

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.290
that she'll fail. If she bombs the test, she
fears that her dreams of getting into the

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:05.230
graduate programs she wants will be dashed
and her life will be over. Classic catastrophic

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.460
thinking. A cognitive therapist would actively
discuss all of this with her, challenging

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:14.160
her thinking along the way and, in the end,
help Bernice reexamine her assumptions about

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.810
what's going to happen if she does fail like
the world will not end and she will not utterly

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:24.070
fail at life. Helping her work toward thinking more
positive thoughts about herself and her future.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.550
The cognitive therapist helps patients understand
that changing what we say to ourselves is

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.670
a very effective way to cope with our anxieties
and modify our behavior. In other words, it

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.230
really is the thought that counts. Not surprisingly,
the cognitive and behavioral schools have

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.899
joined forces frequently enough that cognitive-behavior
therapies are typically considered a single

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:47.019
school, and a lot of therapists use integrative
approaches that try to use the best elements

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:48.740
of all of these schools of thought.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.399
But all of these different psychotherapies
don't always mean being alone with your therapist

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:56.730
and your thoughts. Most of them can be done
in groups, too. Group therapy fosters the

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.680
therapeutic benefits you get from interacting
with other people. Not only does it help with

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.050
the social aspects of mental health, but it
also may remind clients that they're not alone.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.050
In a similar way, family therapy treats a
family as a system, and views an individual's

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.490
problem behaviors as being influenced by,
or directed at, other family members. Family

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.120
therapists work with multiple family members
to heal relationships, improve insight and

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.870
communication, and mobilize communal resources.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.180
So, the big question remains. Does psychotherapy
work? You're going to have to wait until next

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.519
time to find out because that is what we will
be taking about, along with a look at the

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.470
biomedical approach to therapy.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.870
For now, you've learned about the major types
of psychotherapy. These include psychodynamic

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:41.130
therapy and Freud's famous psychoanalysis,
existential-humanist therapy and Roger's 

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.990
client-centered focus, and behavior and cognitive therapies.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.199
We also took a quick look at group and family therapy.
