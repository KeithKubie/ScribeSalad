00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.390
For actors, names are brands.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.389
So while it’s common for up-and-comers to
change their name prior to beginning their

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.130
career -- After all, you probably wouldn’t
have gone to see Mission: Impossible if it

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.509
starred “Thomas Mapother IV” -- it usually
doesn’t happen after they’ve appeared

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:19.530
in a film or two.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.120
Still, there are exceptions to every rule.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.890
Here are 10 Actors Who Started Their Career
Without Their Iconic Name.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.570
The Rock to Dwayne Johnson
Wrestling fans know that Dwayne Johnson used

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.250
to be “The Rock,” the musclebound People’s
Champion of the WWE.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.560
And when Johnson made his film debut in The
Mummy Returns, he was credited simply as “The

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.230
Rock,” which carried over into his starring
roles in The Scorpion King, The Rundown, and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.230
Walking Tall.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.190
For 2006’s Gridiron Gang, he began to get
credited as “Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson,”

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.340
but it wasn’t until Get Smart in 2008 that
he dropped his nickname -- at least on movie

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.340
posters.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.079
It doesn’t seem to have slowed him down
any, and he still makes appearances on WWE.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.290
Marky Mark to Mark Wahlberg
Before getting nominated for an Oscar for

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.720
his role in The Departed and opening a burger
chain with his Wahlberg brothers, Mark Wahlberg

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.040
was… a rapper?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.550
That’s right, Wahlberg began his showbiz
career as Marky Mark, frontman for Marky Mark

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.960
and the Funky Bunch.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.450
After one hit single, “Good Vibrations,”
his career took a downturn, but it was saved

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.710
by a popular series of boxer brief commercials
for Calvin Klein.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.020
No, we’re not making this up.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.550
After a few small TV roles as “Marky Mark,”
Wahlberg started going by his real name in

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.610
the Danny DeVito comedy Renaissance Man.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.560
Rebecca Romijn to Rebbeca Romijn-Stamos and
back

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.090
Rebecca Romijn began her modelling career
in 1991, when she was just 18 years old.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.300
Though she had a couple of roles under this
name -- including a bit part in an episode

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.580
of Friends -- she changed her name when she
married Full House star John Stamos in 1998.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.790
It was under the name “Rebecca Romijn-Stamos”
that she starred in the X-Men franchise, which

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.490
made her a household name for nerds everywhere.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.860
When she divorced Stamos in 2005, however,
she dropped the name again, going back to

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.860
“Rebecca Romijn.”

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.390
Can you blame her?

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.959
We wouldn’t want to be Mrs. Uncle Jesse
for the rest of our lives either.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.200
Courteney Cox to Courteney Cox Arquette and
back

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.250
Courteney Cox is another actress who changed
her name after getting married.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.409
She started her acting career in the 80s,
and even made an early appearance in the music

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.730
video for Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing
in the Dark.”

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.230
But she got her big break with the television
show Friends, one of the biggest shows of

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.230
the 90s.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.719
In 1999, Cox married her Scream co-star David
Arquette, and began going by the professional

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.420
name Courteney Cox Arquette.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.769
When ads for the sitcom Cougar Town dropped
the “Arquette” from her name in 2009,

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.519
people began to wonder if trouble was brewing
and sure enough, the Arquettes announced their

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.409
separation in 2010.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.549
Arnold Strong to Arnold Schwarzenegger
Before becoming an all-American action star,

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.189
Arnold Schwarzenegger got his first taste
of fame as an Austrian bodybuilder in the

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.109
late ‘60s and early ‘70s.

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.239
He parlayed this fame into an early starring
role in the low budget comedy Hercules in

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.790
New York, which credited him as “Arnold
Strong.”

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.969
His accent was so thick at the time that his
lines were dubbed over.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.120
The movie bombed and put his showbusiness
career on pause until 1977’s Pumping Iron,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.269
a documentary about his bodybuilding career.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.830
He gave acting another go with 1982’s Conan
the Barbarian, this time credited under his

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.400
real, name, and it was a smash success.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.430
Leaf Phoenix to Joaquin Phoenix
Joaquin Phoenix’s name has changed a few

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.430
times.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.069
He was born in Peurto Rico as Joaquin Rafael
Bottom while his parents were members of a

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.730
cult called the Children of God.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.000
When his family left the cult, they changed
their last name to “Phoenix” to symbolize

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.219
a rebirth, and Joaquin began going by the
first name “Leaf” to match the nature-themed

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.349
names of his siblings: River, Rain, and Summer.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.919
When he began acting in the 80s, he was credited
as “Leaf Phoenix.”

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.889
But after a six year break, he returned to
big screen as “Joaquin” in 1995’s To

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.739
Die For and it’s stayed the same ever since.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.049
Larry Fishburne to Laurence Fishburne
Laurence Fishburne, well known for his role

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.989
as Morpheus in the Matrix films, began his
acting career as a teenager, and went by the

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:51.989
name Larry.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.870
In one of his first major roles, “Larry”
played “Clean” in Francis Ford Coppola’s

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.870
Apocalypse Now.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.120
After that, he switched between Larry Fishburne
and “Laurence Fishburne III” before finally

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.719
settling on “Laurence Fishburne” in 1993.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:09.290
The first movie to use that credit was What’s
Love Got To Do With It, where he played R&amp;B

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.559
star Ike Turner in a film about his abusive
relationship toward wife Tina Turner.

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:17.519
That film also landed Fishburne his only Oscar
nomination.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.090
Jean Norman to Marilyn Monroe
Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortensen,

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.470
but that name didn’t even last her until
adulthood.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.580
At 16, she was married and adopted her first
husband’s name, Dougherty.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.780
Famously, she was discovered by a photographer
while working at a munitions factory during

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.100
WWII, and she began modeling under the name
“Jean Norman” shortly after.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.860
She came up with her most iconic name in 1946
when she was signed to 20th Century Fox.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.260
Apparently, she reminded an executive of Broadway
star Marilyn Miller.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.600
Paired with her mother’s maiden name, she
became Marilyn Monroe… and the rest is history.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.310
Nicolas Coppola to Nicolas Cage
It’s pretty well-known that Nicolas Cage

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.350
belongs to the famous Coppola family, and
that Cage is the nephew of famed filmmaker

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.440
Francis Ford Coppola.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.400
He was even credited as “Nicolas Coppola”
for his bit role in Fast Times at Ridgemont

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.260
High, but when his first starring role in
Valley Girl came around, he changed his name

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.260
to Cage.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Why was that?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.790
Well, he wanted avoid the appearance of nepotism,
so he named himself after Marvel superhero

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.790
Luke Cage.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.070
Nevertheless, he still went on to work with
his uncle on the films Rumble Fish and Peggy

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.970
Sue Got Married.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.980
Lisa Munn to Olivia Munn
Born Lisa Olivia Munn, this actress went by

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.630
her first name for her first few years in
Hollywood, picking up such prestigious roles

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.880
as “Girl #1” in Scarecrows Gone Wild and
“Asian Mob Girl” in The Road to Canyon

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.000
Lake, but when she got her break as Mily Acuna
in the surfing TV series Beyond the Break,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.710
she started going by her middle name Olivia,
and that’s how she gained fame as a co-host

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.310
of G4’s Attack of the Show.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.940
Since then, she’s made name for herself
on HBO’s The Newsroom and recently starred

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.770
a Psylocke in X-Men: Apocalypse, so “Olivia”
seems to be working out for her.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.820
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.700
Who else changed their name mid-career?
