00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.315
Well, today is the last day on
Laplace transform and the first

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.771
day before we start the rest of
the term, which will be spent on

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:20.450
the study of systems.
I would like to spend it on one

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.633
more type of input function
which, in general,

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:28.019
your teachers in other courses
will expect you to have had some

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.514
acquaintance with.
It is the kind associated with

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:36.958
an impulse, so an input
consisted of what is sometimes

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.730
called a unit impulse.
Now, what's an impulse?

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.580
It covers actually a lot of
things.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.610
It covers a situation where you
withdraw from a bank account.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.047
For example,
take half your money out of a

00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:56.155
bank account one day.
It also would be modeled the

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:59.792
same way.
But the simplest way to

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:03.922
understand it the first time
through is as an impulse,

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:08.519
if you know what an impulse is.
If you have a variable force

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:12.259
acting over time,
and we will assume it is acting

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.090
along a straight line so I don't
have to worry about it being a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.909
vector, then the impulse,
according to physicists,

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.116
the physical definition,
the impulse of f of t 

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:30.266
over some time interval.
Let's say the time interval

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.372
running from a to b is,
by definition,

00:01:33.372 --> 00:01:38.325
the integral from a to b of f
of t dt.

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:42.103
Actually, I am going to do the

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:46.972
most horrible thing this period.
I will assume the force is

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:50.582
actually a constant force.
So, in that case,

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:55.200
I wouldn't even have to bother
with the integral at all.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.893
If f of t is a constant,
let's say capital F,

00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:04.386
then the impulse is --
Well, that integral is simply

00:02:04.386 --> 00:02:08.417
the product of the two,
the impulse over that time

00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:12.531
interval is simply F times b
minus a.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:17.386
Just the product of those two.
The force times the length of

00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:21.500
time for which it acts.
Now, that is what I want to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.518
calculate, want to consider in
connection with our little mass

00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:29.240
system.
So, once again,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.118
I think this is probably the
last time you'll see the little

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:37.260
spring.
Let's bid a tearful farewell to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.741
it.
There is our little mass on

00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.718
wheels.
And let's make it an undamped

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:45.695
mass.
It has an equilibrium point and

00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:49.994
all the other little things that
go with the picture.

00:02:49.994 --> 00:02:54.377
And when I apply an impulse,
what I mean is applying a

00:02:54.377 --> 00:03:00.000
constant force to this over a
definite time interval.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.928
And that is what I mean by
applying an impulse over that

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:06.857
time interval.
Now, what is the picture of

00:03:06.857 --> 00:03:09.857
such a thing?
Well, the force is only going

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.928
to be applied,
in other words,

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:15.928
I am going to push on the mass
or pull on the mass with a

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:18.928
constant force.
With a little electromagnet

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:22.642
here, we will assume,
there is a pile of iron filings

00:03:22.642 --> 00:03:26.500
or something inside there.
I turn on the electromagnet.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.857
It pulls with a constant force
just between time zero and time

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:34.039
two seconds.
And then I stop.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.095
That is going to change the
motion of the thing.

00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:40.604
First it is going to start
pulling it toward the thing.

00:03:40.604 --> 00:03:44.050
And then, when it lets go,
it will zoom back and there

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.324
will be a certain motion after
that.

00:03:46.324 --> 00:03:49.705
What the question is,
if I want to solve that problem

00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:53.280
of the motion of that in terms
of the Laplace transform,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.490
how am I going to model this
force?

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.000
Well, let's draw a picture of
it first.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.351
It starts here.
It is zero for t,

00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:08.425
let's say the force is applied
between time zero to time h.

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:14.500
And then its force is turned
on, it stays constant and then

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.793
it is turned off.
And those vertical lines

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:23.192
shouldn't be there.
But, since in practice,

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:30.000
it takes a tiny bit of time to
turn a force on and off.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.310
It is, in practice,
not unrealistic to suppose that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.103
there are approximately vertical
lines there.

00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:41.724
They are slightly slanted but
not too much.

00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:44.568
Now, I want it to be unit
impulse.

00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:49.051
This is the force access and
this is the time access.

00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:53.017
Since the impulse is the area
under this curve,

00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:56.724
if I want that to be one,
then if this is h,

00:04:56.724 --> 00:05:01.111
the height to which I --
In other words,

00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:05.777
the magnitude of the force must
be one over h in order

00:05:05.777 --> 00:05:09.185
that the area be one,
in order, in other words,

00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:13.185
that this integral be one,
the area under that curve be

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:15.703
one.
So the unit impulse looks like

00:05:15.703 --> 00:05:17.851
that.
The narrower it is here,

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.222
the higher it has to be that
way.

00:05:20.222 --> 00:05:24.814
The bigger the force must be if
you want the end result to be a

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:27.555
unit impulse.
Now, to solve a problem,

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:32.000
a typical problem,
then, would be a spring.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.858
The mass is traveling on the
track.

00:05:34.858 --> 00:05:38.222
Let's suppose the spring
constant is one,

00:05:38.222 --> 00:05:41.669
so there would be a
differential equation.

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.369
And the right-hand side would
be this f of t.

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:49.993
Well, let's give it its name,
the name I gave it before.

00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:55.291
Remember, I called the unit box
function the thing which was one

00:05:55.291 --> 00:06:00.000
between zero and h and zero
everywhere else.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.038
The notation we used for that
was u, and then it had a double

00:06:04.038 --> 00:06:07.875
subscript from the starting
point and the finishing point.

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.028
So oh-- u(oh) of t.

00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:14.201
This much represents the thing
if it only rose to the high one.

00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:17.500
But if it, instead,
rises to the height one over h

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.673
in order to make that
area one, I have to multiply it

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:25.375
by the factor one over h.
Now, if you want to solve this

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:28.961
by the Laplace transform.
In other words,

00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:32.485
see what the motion of that
mass is as I apply this unit

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:34.855
impulse to it over that time
interval.

00:06:34.855 --> 00:06:38.700
You have to take the Laplace
transform, if that is the way we

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.519
are doing it.
Now, the left-hand side is just

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:44.594
routine and would involve the
initial conditions.

00:06:44.594 --> 00:06:48.183
The whole interest is taking
the Laplace transform of the

00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:51.066
right-hand side.
And that is what I want to do

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:52.988
now.
The problem is what is the

00:06:52.988 --> 00:06:56.000
Laplace transform of this guy?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.527
Well, remember,
to do everything else,

00:07:04.527 --> 00:07:08.831
you do everything by writing in
terms of the unit step function?

00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:12.656
This function that we are
talking about is one over h

00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:16.208
times what you get by
first stepping up to one.

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:20.375
That is the unit step function,
which goes up by one and tries

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:24.064
to stay at one ever after.
And then, when it gets to h,

00:07:24.064 --> 00:07:27.753
it has got to step down.
Well, the way you make it step

00:07:27.753 --> 00:07:31.988
down is by subtracting off the
function, which is the unit step

00:07:31.988 --> 00:07:35.814
function but where the step
takes place, not at time zero

00:07:35.814 --> 00:07:38.950
but at time h.
In other words,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.055
I translate the unit step
function of course with,

00:07:42.055 --> 00:07:45.033
I don't think I have to draw
that picture again.

00:07:45.033 --> 00:07:47.440
The unit step function looks
like zing.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.242
And if you translate it to the
right by h it looks like zing.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:54.030
And then make it negative to
subtract it off.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.691
And what you will get is this
box function.

00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:01.000
So we want to take the Laplace
transform of this thing.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.054
Well, let's assume,
for the sake of argument that

00:08:05.054 --> 00:08:08.771
you didn't remember.
Well, you had to use the

00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:12.657
formula at 2:00 AM this morning
and, therefore,

00:08:12.657 --> 00:08:16.712
you do remember it.
[LAUGHTER] So I don't have to

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.500
recopy the formula onto the
board.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.146
Maybe if there is room there.
All right, let's put it up

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:26.933
there.
It says that u of t minus a

00:08:26.933 --> 00:08:31.073
times f,
any f, so let's call it g so

00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:34.874
you won't confuse it with this
particular one,

00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:39.908
times g translated.
If you translate a function

00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:44.219
from t, if you translate it to
the right by a then its Laplace

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:48.530
transform is e to the minus a s
times whatever the

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.498
old Laplace transform was,
g of s.

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.254
Multiply by an exponential on
the right.

00:08:54.254 --> 00:08:58.000
On the left that corresponds to
translation.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.200
Except you must remember to put
in that factor u for a secret

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.629
reason which I spent half of
Wednesday explaining.

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:09.269
What do we have here? The
Laplace transform of u of t,

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:13.259
that is easy.
That is simply one over s.

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:15.570
The Laplace transform of this

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.879
other guy we get from the
formula.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:21.870
It is basically one over s.
No, the Laplace transform of u

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.600
of t.
But because it has been

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.659
translated to the right by h,
I have to multiply it by that

00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:33.000
factor e to the minus 
h times s.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.858
That is the answer.
And, if you want to solve

00:09:40.858 --> 00:09:44.432
problems, this is what you would
feed into the equation.

00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:47.940
And you would calculate and
calculate and calculate it.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.384
But that is not what I want to
do now because that was

00:09:51.384 --> 00:09:55.087
Wednesday and this is Friday.
You have the right to expect

00:09:55.087 --> 00:09:57.881
something new.
Here is what I am going to do

00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:01.000
new.
I am going to let h go to zero.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.799
As h goes to zero,
this function gets narrower and

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:12.600
narrower, but it also has to get
higher and higher because its

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.878
area has to stay one.
What I am interested in,

00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:20.967
first of all,
is what happens to the Laplace

00:10:20.967 --> 00:10:25.055
transform as h goes to zero.
In other words,

00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:30.000
what is the limit,
as h goes to zero of --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.639
Well, what is that function?
One minus e to the negative hs

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:37.519
divided by hs.

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:42.320
Well, this is an 18.01 problem,
an ordinary calculus problem,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.559
but let's do it nicely.
You see, the nice way to do it

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:50.879
is to make a substitution.
We will change h s to u

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:55.279
because it is occurring
as a unit in both cases.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:11:00.240
This is going to be the same as
the limit as u goes to zero.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.790
I think there are too many u's

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.395
here already.
I cannot use u,

00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:10.279
you cannot use t,
v is velocity,

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:13.720
w is wavefunction.
There is no letter.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.162
All right, u.
It is one minus e to the

00:11:17.162 --> 00:11:20.697
negative u over u.

00:11:20.697 --> 00:11:25.069
So what is the answer?
Well, either you know the

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:30.651
answer or you replace this by,
say, the first couple of terms

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:35.778
of the Taylor series.
But I think most of you would

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:38.108
use L'Hopital's rule,
so let's do that.

00:11:38.108 --> 00:11:40.438
The derivative of the top is
zero here.

00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:44.056
The derivative by the chain
rule of e to the negative u is e

00:11:44.056 --> 00:11:47.674
to the negative u times minus
one.

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.943
And that minus one cancels that
minus.

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:53.683
So the derivative of the top is
simply e to the negative u and

00:11:53.683 --> 00:11:55.830
the derivative of the bottom is
one.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:00.000
So, as u goes to zero,
that limit is one.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.797
Interesting.
Let's draw a picture this way.

00:12:03.797 --> 00:12:08.861
I will draw it schematically.
Up here is the function one

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:14.468
over h times u zero h of t, 
our box function,

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:19.803
except it has the height one
over h instead of the

00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:23.329
height one.
We have just calculated that

00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:28.755
its Laplace transform is that
funny thing, one minus e to the

00:12:28.755 --> 00:12:34.000
minus hs divided by hs.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.282
That is the top line.
All this is completely kosher,

00:12:39.282 --> 00:12:43.219
but now I am going to let h go
to zero.

00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:47.155
And the question is what do we
get now?

00:12:47.155 --> 00:12:53.577
Well, I just calculated for you
that this thing approaches one,

00:12:53.577 --> 00:12:58.135
has the limit one.
And now, let's fill in the

00:12:58.135 --> 00:13:03.829
picture.
What does this thing approach?

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:10.851
Well, it approaches a function
which is zero everywhere.

00:13:10.851 --> 00:13:17.489
As h approaches zero,
this green box turns into a box

00:13:17.489 --> 00:13:22.468
which is zero everywhere except
at zero.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:26.553
And there, it is infinitely
high.

00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:30.000
So, keep going up.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.257
Now, of course,
that is not a function.

00:13:38.257 --> 00:13:41.514
People call it a function but
it isn't.

00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:45.371
Mathematicians call it a
generalized function,

00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:48.200
but that is not a function
either.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.085
It is just a way of making you
feel comfortable by talking

00:13:53.085 --> 00:13:56.942
about something which isn't
really a function.

00:13:56.942 --> 00:14:00.885
It was given the name,
introduced formally into

00:14:00.885 --> 00:14:05.000
mathematics by a physicist,
Dirac.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.034
And he, looking ahead to the
future, did what many people do

00:14:09.034 --> 00:14:13.000
who introduce something into the
literature, a formula or a

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.307
function or something which they
think is going to be important.

00:14:17.307 --> 00:14:20.316
They never name it directly
after themselves,

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:24.145
but they always use as the
symbol for it the first letter

00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:26.948
of their name.
I cannot tell you how often

00:14:26.948 --> 00:14:31.659
that has happened.
Maybe even Euler called e for

00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:37.254
that reason, although he claims
it was in Latin because it has

00:14:37.254 --> 00:14:42.023
to do with exponentials.
Well, luckily his name began

00:14:42.023 --> 00:14:45.784
with an E, too.
That is Paul Dirac's delta

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:49.360
function.
I won't dignify it by the name

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.680
function by writing that out,
by putting the world function

00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.000
here, too, but it is called the
delta function.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.638
From this point on,
the entire rest of the lecture

00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:08.167
has a slight fictional element.
The entire rest of the lecture

00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:12.324
is in figurative quotation
marks, so you are not entirely

00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:16.334
responsible for anything I say.
This is a non-function,

00:15:16.334 --> 00:15:19.749
but you put it in there and
call it a function.

00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:23.684
And you naturally want to
complete, if it's a function

00:15:23.684 --> 00:15:27.545
then it must have a Laplace
transform, even though it

00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:32.000
doesn't, so the diagram is
completed that way.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.953
And its Laplace transform is
declared to be one.

00:15:35.953 --> 00:15:41.000
So let's start listing the
properties of this weird thing.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
The delta function,
its Laplace transform is one.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.727
Now, one of the things is we
have not yet expressed the fact

00:16:09.727 --> 00:16:13.012
that it is a unit impulse.
In other words,

00:16:13.012 --> 00:16:17.900
since the areas of all of these
boxes, they all have areas one

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.067
as they are shrunk this way they
get higher that way.

00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:25.432
By convention,
one says that the area under

00:16:25.432 --> 00:16:30.000
the orange curve also remains
one in the limit.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.384
Now, how am I going to express
that?

00:16:32.384 --> 00:16:35.723
Well, it is done by the
following formula that the

00:16:35.723 --> 00:16:39.674
integral, the total impulse of
the delta function should be

00:16:39.674 --> 00:16:41.718
one.
Now, where do I integrate?

00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:45.738
Well, from any place that it is
zero to any place that it is

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:48.736
zero on the other side of that
vertical line.

00:16:48.736 --> 00:16:52.210
But, in order to avoid
controversy, people integrate

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.890
all the way from negative
infinity to infinity since it

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.320
doesn't hurt.
Does it?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.000
It is zero practically all the
time.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.498
This is the function whose
Laplace transform is one.

00:17:06.498 --> 00:17:11.996
Its integral from minus
infinity to infinity is one.

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:15.446
How else can we calculate for
it?

00:17:15.446 --> 00:17:20.513
Well, I would like to calculate
its convolution.

00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:26.334
Here is f of t.
What happens if I convolute it

00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:31.882
with the delta function?
Well, if you go back to the

00:17:31.882 --> 00:17:35.786
definition of the convolution,
you know, it is that funny

00:17:35.786 --> 00:17:40.039
integral, you are going to do a
lot of head scratching because

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:44.362
it is not really all that clear
how to integrate with the delta

00:17:44.362 --> 00:17:46.872
function.
Instead of doing that let's

00:17:46.872 --> 00:17:50.776
assume that it follows the laws
of the Laplace transform.

00:17:50.776 --> 00:17:53.774
In that case,
its Laplace transform would be

00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:55.936
what?
Well, the whole thing of a

00:17:55.936 --> 00:18:00.258
convolution is that the Laplace
transform of the convolution is

00:18:00.258 --> 00:18:05.000
the product of the two separate
Laplace transforms.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.691
So that is going to be F of s
times the Laplace

00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:13.529
transform of the delta function,
which is one.

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:18.476
Now, what must this thing be?
Well, there is some ambiguity

00:18:18.476 --> 00:18:21.973
as to what it is for negative
values of t.

00:18:21.973 --> 00:18:26.835
But if we, by brute force,
decide for negative values of t

00:18:26.835 --> 00:18:31.782
it is going to have the value
zero, that is the way we make

00:18:31.782 --> 00:18:35.865
things unique.
In fact, why don't we make f of

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.272
unique that way to start with?

00:18:38.272 --> 00:18:41.942
This is a function now that is
allowed to do anything it wants

00:18:41.942 --> 00:18:44.770
on the right-hand side of zero
starting at zero,

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.260
but on the left-hand side of
zero it is wiped away and must

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.487
be zero.
This is a definite thing now.

00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:53.315
Its convolution is this.
And the inverse Laplace

00:18:53.315 --> 00:18:57.126
transform is --
The answer, in other words,

00:18:57.126 --> 00:19:02.009
is the same thing as what u of
t f of t would be.

00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:04.844
It's the same thing,
F of s.

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:08.467
And so, the conclusion is that
these are equal,

00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:12.799
since they must be unique.
They have been made unique by

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:16.501
making them zero for t negative.
In other words,

00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:19.966
apply to a function,
well, I won't recopy it.

00:19:19.966 --> 00:19:24.692
But the point is that delta t,
for the convolution operation,

00:19:24.692 --> 00:19:29.026
is acting like an identity.
If I multiply,

00:19:29.026 --> 00:19:33.056
in the sense of convolution,
it is a peculiar operation.

00:19:33.056 --> 00:19:36.574
But algebraically,
it has a lot of the properties

00:19:36.574 --> 00:19:39.212
of multiplication.
It is communitive.

00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:42.437
It is linear in both factors.
In other words,

00:19:42.437 --> 00:19:46.541
it is almost anything you would
want with multiplication.

00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:49.839
It has an identity element,
identity function.

00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:53.723
And the identity function is
the Dirac delta function.

00:19:53.723 --> 00:19:57.314
Anything else here?
Yeah, I will throw in one more

00:19:57.314 --> 00:20:01.171
thing.
It would just require one more

00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:04.212
phony argument,
which I won't bother giving

00:20:04.212 --> 00:20:06.963
you, but it is not totally
implausible.

00:20:06.963 --> 00:20:11.018
After all, u of t,
the unit step function is not

00:20:11.018 --> 00:20:13.769
differentiable,
is not a differentiable

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:15.796
function.
It looks like this.

00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:19.850
Here its derivative is zero,
here its derivative is zero,

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.542
and in this class it is not
even defined in between.

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:27.018
But, I don't care,
I will make it go straight up.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:31.000
The question is what's its
derivative?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.238
Well, zero here,
zero there and infinity at

00:20:34.238 --> 00:20:37.167
zero, so it must be the delta
function.

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:40.020
That has exactly the right
properties.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.569
So the same people who will
tell you this will tell you that

00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:45.956
also.
And, in fact,

00:20:45.956 --> 00:20:50.120
when you use it to solve
differential equations it acts

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.666
as if that is true.
I think I have given you an

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:57.829
example on your homework.
Let me now show you a typical

00:20:57.829 --> 00:21:02.378
example of the way the Dirac
delta function would be used to

00:21:02.378 --> 00:21:06.994
solve a problem.
Let's go back to our little

00:21:06.994 --> 00:21:09.727
spring, since it is the easiest
thing.

00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:13.715
You are familiar with it from a
physical point of view,

00:21:13.715 --> 00:21:16.965
and it is the easiest thing to
illustrate on.

00:21:16.965 --> 00:21:20.142
We have our spring mass system.
Where is it?

00:21:20.142 --> 00:21:22.210
Is it on the board?
Up there.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.017
That one.
And the differential equation

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:29.227
we are going to solve is y
double prime plus y 

00:21:29.227 --> 00:21:33.597
equals --
And now, I am going to assume

00:21:33.597 --> 00:21:37.179
that the spring is kicked with
impulse a.

00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:42.283
I am not going to kick it at
time t equals zero,

00:21:42.283 --> 00:21:47.477
since that would get us into
slight technical difficulties.

00:21:47.477 --> 00:21:52.761
Anyway, it is more fun to kick
it at time pi over two.

00:21:52.761 --> 00:21:54.283
The thing is,

00:21:54.283 --> 00:21:58.134
what is happening?
Well, we have got to have

00:21:58.134 --> 00:22:02.905
initial conditions.
The initial conditions are

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.617
going to be, let's start at time
zero.

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:08.256
We will start it at the
position one.

00:22:08.256 --> 00:22:11.921
So I take my spring,
I drag it to the position one,

00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:15.366
I take the little mass there
and then let it go.

00:22:15.366 --> 00:22:19.544
And so it starts going birr.
But right when it gets to the

00:22:19.544 --> 00:22:23.575
equilibrium point I give it a,
"cha!" with unit impulse.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:27.094
I started it from rest.
Those will be the initial

00:22:27.094 --> 00:22:31.535
conditions.
And I want to say that I kicked

00:22:31.535 --> 00:22:35.543
it, not with unit impulse,
but with the impulse a.

00:22:35.543 --> 00:22:38.569
Bigger.
And I did that at time pi over

00:22:38.569 --> 00:22:41.023
two.
So how are we going to say

00:22:41.023 --> 00:22:43.804
that?
Well, kick it means delivered

00:22:43.804 --> 00:22:47.894
that impulse over an extremely
short time interval,

00:22:47.894 --> 00:22:52.720
but in such a way kicked it
sufficiently hard that the total

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.319
impulse was a.
The way to say that is kick it

00:22:56.319 --> 00:23:02.465
with the Dirac delta function.
Translate it to the point time

00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:06.246
pi over two.
Not at zero any longer.

00:23:06.246 --> 00:23:09.041
t minus pi over two.

00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:12.493
But that would kick it with a
unit impulse.

00:23:12.493 --> 00:23:16.931
I want it to kick it with the
impulse a, so I will just

00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:20.054
multiply that by the constant
factor a.

00:23:20.054 --> 00:23:24.493
Let's put this over here.
y of zero equals one,

00:23:24.493 --> 00:23:30.000
that's the starting value.
Now we have a problem.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.841
The only thing new in solving
this with the Laplace transform

00:23:33.841 --> 00:23:36.145
is I have this funny right-hand
side.

00:23:36.145 --> 00:23:38.834
But it corresponds to a
physical situation.

00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:41.523
Let's do it.
You take the Laplace transform

00:23:41.523 --> 00:23:44.980
of both sides of the equation.
Remember how to do that?

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.181
You have to take account of the
initial conditions.

00:23:48.181 --> 00:23:51.509
The Laplace transform of the
second derivative is you

00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:55.350
multiply by s squared,
and then you have to subtract.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.000
You have to use these initial
conditions.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.504
This one won't give you
anything, but the first one

00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:05.588
means I have to subtract one
times s.

00:24:05.588 --> 00:24:09.654
That is the Laplace transform
of y double prime.

00:24:09.654 --> 00:24:13.509
The Laplace transform of y,
of course, is just capital Y.

00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:16.172
And how about the Laplace

00:24:16.172 --> 00:24:18.415
transform of the right-hand
side.

00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:22.551
Well, we will have the constant
factor a because the Laplace

00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:25.845
transform is linear.
And now, the delta function

00:24:25.845 --> 00:24:30.638
would have the transform one.
But when I translate it,

00:24:30.638 --> 00:24:33.438
pi over two,
that means I have to use that

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.828
formula.
Translate it by pi over two

00:24:35.828 --> 00:24:40.198
means take the one that it would
have been otherwise and multiply

00:24:40.198 --> 00:24:42.383
it by e, that exponential
factor.

00:24:42.383 --> 00:24:46.070
It would be e to the minus pi
over two,

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.962
that is the A times s times
one, which would be the g of s,

00:24:49.962 --> 00:24:54.196
the Laplace transform
or the delta function before it

00:24:54.196 --> 00:24:57.678
had been translated.
But I don't have to put that in

00:24:57.678 --> 00:25:01.575
because it's one.
I am multiplying by one.

00:25:01.575 --> 00:25:03.873
And to do everything now is
routine.

00:25:03.873 --> 00:25:05.908
Solve for the Laplace
transform.

00:25:05.908 --> 00:25:08.336
Well, what is it?
It is y is equal to.

00:25:08.336 --> 00:25:12.275
I put the s on the other side.
That makes the right-hand side

00:25:12.275 --> 00:25:15.689
the sum of two terms.
And I divide by the coefficient

00:25:15.689 --> 00:25:18.643
of y, which is s squared plus
one.

00:25:18.643 --> 00:25:22.450
The s is over on the right-hand
side and it is divided by s

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.536
squared plus one.
And the other factor is there,

00:25:25.536 --> 00:25:26.586
too.
And it, too,

00:25:26.586 --> 00:25:30.000
is divided by s squared plus
one.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.461
Now, we take the inverse
Laplace transform of those two

00:25:38.461 --> 00:25:40.000
terms and add them up.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.983
What will we get?
Well, y is equal to,

00:26:02.983 --> 00:26:07.822
the inverse Laplace transform
of s over s squared plus one is

00:26:07.822 --> 00:26:11.209
cosine t.

00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:15.322
Now, for this thing we will
have to use our formula.

00:26:15.322 --> 00:26:19.354
If this weren't here,
the inverse Laplace transform

00:26:19.354 --> 00:26:24.032
of a over s squared plus one
would

00:26:24.032 --> 00:26:27.016
be what?
Well, it would be a times the

00:26:27.016 --> 00:26:30.000
sine of t.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.875
In other words,
if this is the g of s

00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:41.708
then the function on the left
would be basically A sine t.

00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:43.752
But because it has been

00:26:43.752 --> 00:26:47.266
multiplied by that exponential
factor, e to the minus as

00:26:47.266 --> 00:26:50.397
where a is pi over two,

00:26:50.397 --> 00:26:53.783
the left-hand side has to be
changed from A sine t

00:26:53.783 --> 00:26:58.000
to what it would be
with the translated form.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.714
So the rest of it is u of t
minus pi over two,

00:27:01.714 --> 00:27:05.857
because a is pi over
two, times what it would have

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:09.285
been just from the factor g of s
itself.

00:27:09.285 --> 00:27:11.785
In other words,
A times the sine of,

00:27:11.785 --> 00:27:15.071
again, t minus pi over two.

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:19.000
I am applying that formula,
but I am applying it in that

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.142
direction.
I started with this,

00:27:21.142 --> 00:27:24.000
and I want to recover the
left-hand side.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.428
And that is what it must look
like.

00:27:26.428 --> 00:27:29.857
The A, of course,
just gets dragged along for the

00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:34.131
free ride.
Now, as I emphasized to you

00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:38.947
last time, and I hope you did on
your homework that you handed

00:27:38.947 --> 00:27:41.868
in, you mustn't leave it in that
form.

00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:46.605
You have to make cases because
people will expect you to tell

00:27:46.605 --> 00:27:49.131
them what the meaning of this
is.

00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:52.921
Now, if t is less than pi over
two, this is zero.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:56.078
And, therefore,
that term does not exist.

00:27:56.078 --> 00:28:00.973
So the first part of it is just
the cosine t term if

00:28:00.973 --> 00:28:05.000
t lies between zero and pi over
two.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.200
If t is bigger than pi over two
then this factor is

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.841
one.
It's the unit step function.

00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:16.060
And I, therefore,
must add in this term.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.434
Now, what is that term?
What is the sine of t minus pi

00:28:20.434 --> 00:28:25.139
over two?
The sine of t looks

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:27.120
like that.
The sine of t,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.000
if I translate it,
looks like this.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.616
If I translate it by pi over
two.

00:28:33.616 --> 00:28:38.031
And let's finish it up,
the pi that was over here moved

00:28:38.031 --> 00:28:41.056
into position.
That curve is the curve

00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:44.000
negative cosine t. 

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.776
And so the answer is if t is
bigger than pi over two,

00:28:55.776 --> 00:29:00.074
it is cosine t minus A
times cosine t.

00:29:00.074 --> 00:29:02.383
Or, in other words,

00:29:02.383 --> 00:29:07.000
it is one minus A times cosine
t.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.990
Now, do those match up?
They have always got to match

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.153
up, or you have made a mistake.
You always have to get a

00:29:17.153 --> 00:29:20.258
continuous function when you
have just discontinuities.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:22.041
Do we get a continuous
function?

00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:25.434
Yeah, when t is pi over two 
the value here is

00:29:25.434 --> 00:29:27.447
zero.
The value of this is also zero

00:29:27.447 --> 00:29:31.055
at pi over two.
There is no conflict in the

00:29:31.055 --> 00:29:33.796
values.
Values doesn't suddenly jump.

00:29:33.796 --> 00:29:38.060
The function is continuous.
It is not differential but it

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.335
is continuous.
Well, what function does that

00:29:41.335 --> 00:29:43.314
look like?
There are cases.

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:47.426
It starts out life as the
function cosine t.

00:29:47.426 --> 00:29:51.233
So it gets to here.
And at t equals pi over two,

00:29:51.233 --> 00:29:55.954
the mass gets kicked
and that changes the function.

00:29:55.954 --> 00:30:01.843
Now, what are the values?
Well, if A is bigger than one

00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:07.627
this is a negative
number and it therefore becomes

00:30:07.627 --> 00:30:11.745
the function negative 
cosine t.

00:30:11.745 --> 00:30:16.843
Now, negative cosine t looks
like this, the blue guy.

00:30:16.843 --> 00:30:21.941
Negative cosine t is a function
that looks like this.

00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:26.156
So it goes from here,
it reverses direction,

00:30:26.156 --> 00:30:31.549
the mass reverses direction
from what you thought it was

00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:36.164
going to do.
And it does that because A is

00:30:36.164 --> 00:30:40.268
so large that that impulse was
enough to make it reverse

00:30:40.268 --> 00:30:42.955
direction.
Of course it might only do

00:30:42.955 --> 00:30:47.283
this, but this is what will
happen if A is bigger than one.

00:30:47.283 --> 00:30:50.716
This will be A,
which is a lot bigger than one.

00:30:50.716 --> 00:30:55.119
If it's not so much bigger than
one it might look like that.

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:59.000
So A is just bigger than one.
How's that?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.400
Well, what if A is less than
one?

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.099
Well, in that case it stays
positive.

00:31:04.099 --> 00:31:07.849
If A is less than one,
this is now still a positive

00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:09.500
number.
And, therefore,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.275
the cosine continues on its
merry way.

00:31:12.275 --> 00:31:17.000
The only thing is it might be a
little more sluggish or it might

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.674
be very peppy and do that.
Let's just go that far.

00:31:20.674 --> 00:31:23.450
This will be the case A less
than one.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.750
Well, of course,
the most interesting case is

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:32.000
what happens if A is exactly
equal to one?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.411
The porridge is exactly just
right, I think that's the

00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:38.943
phrase.
Too hot.

00:31:38.943 --> 00:31:40.985
Too cold.
Just right.

00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:44.457
When A is equal to one,
it is zero.

00:31:44.457 --> 00:31:48.133
It starts out as cosine t.

00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:52.933
When it gets to t,
it continues on ever after as

00:31:52.933 --> 00:31:57.528
the function zero.
I have a visual aid for the

00:31:57.528 --> 00:32:02.891
only time this term.
It didn't work at all.

00:32:02.891 --> 00:32:06.331
I mean, on the other hand,
the last hour,

00:32:06.331 --> 00:32:11.060
the people who worked it were
not intrinsically baseball

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:15.445
players, so we will use the
equation of the pendulum

00:32:15.445 --> 00:32:18.713
instead.
That is a lot easier than mass

00:32:18.713 --> 00:32:20.949
spring.
This is a pendulum.

00:32:20.949 --> 00:32:25.592
It is undamped because I
declare it to be and it swings

00:32:25.592 --> 00:32:30.267
back and forth.
And here I am releasing it.

00:32:30.267 --> 00:32:34.887
The variable is not x or y but
theta, the angle through.

00:32:34.887 --> 00:32:37.238
Here theta is one,
let's say.

00:32:37.238 --> 00:32:41.858
That's about one radian.
It starts there and swings back

00:32:41.858 --> 00:32:44.125
and forth.
It is not damped,

00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:48.745
so it never loses amplitude,
particularly if I swish it,

00:32:48.745 --> 00:32:53.952
if I move my hand a little bit.
I want someone who knows how to

00:32:53.952 --> 00:32:57.816
bat a baseball.
That was the problem last hour.

00:32:57.816 --> 00:33:01.457
Two people.
One to release it.

00:33:01.457 --> 00:33:04.616
I will stand up and try to hold
it here.

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:08.827
Somebody releases it.
And then somebody who has to be

00:33:08.827 --> 00:33:13.686
very skillful should apply a
unit impulse of exactly one when

00:33:13.686 --> 00:33:16.278
it gets to the equilibrium
point.

00:33:16.278 --> 00:33:20.003
So who can do that?
Who can play baseball here?

00:33:20.003 --> 00:33:23.000
Come on.
Somebody elected?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
All right. Come on. [APPLAUSE]

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.352
Somebody release it,
too.

00:33:44.352 --> 00:33:52.036
Somebody tall to handle it all.
I think that will be me.

00:33:52.036 --> 00:34:00.000
Just hold it at what you would
take to be one radian.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.921
He releases it.
When it gets to the bottom,

00:34:04.921 --> 00:34:11.132
you will have to get way down,
and maybe on this side.

00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:15.351
Are you a lefty or a righty?
Rightly.

00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:17.929
Okay.
Bat it what part.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.968
Give it a good swat.
I will stand up higher.

00:34:22.968 --> 00:34:25.898
Help.
I'm not very stable.

00:34:25.898 --> 00:34:30.512
[APPLAUSE] A trial run.
Again.

00:34:30.512 --> 00:34:32.731
Okay.
A little further out.

00:34:32.731 --> 00:34:36.060
First of all,
you have to see where it's

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.280
going.
Why don't you stand,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.097
oh, you bat rightly.
That's right.

00:34:41.097 --> 00:34:44.000
Okay.
Let's try it again.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.187
Strike one.
It's okay.

00:34:59.187 --> 00:34:59.553
It's the beginning of the
baseball season.

00:34:59.553 --> 00:34:59.910
One more.
The Red Sox are having trouble,

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:05.000
too.
Not bad. [APPLAUSE]

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.965
If he had hit even harder it
would have reversed direction

00:35:16.965 --> 00:35:20.234
and gone that way.
If you hadn't hit it quite as

00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:24.478
hard it would have continued on,
still at cosine t,

00:35:24.478 --> 00:35:28.304
but with less amplitude.
But if you hit it exactly right

00:35:28.304 --> 00:35:31.475
--
It is fun to try to do.

00:35:31.475 --> 00:35:36.211
Toomre in our department is a
master at this,

00:35:36.211 --> 00:35:40.086
but he has been practicing for
years.

00:35:40.086 --> 00:35:45.791
He can take a little mallet and
go blunk, and it stops

00:35:45.791 --> 00:35:49.559
absolutely dead.
It is unbelievable.

00:35:49.559 --> 00:35:53.649
I should have had him give the
lecture.

00:35:53.649 --> 00:36:00.000
Now, I would like to do
something truly serious.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.502
Here, I guess.
Because there is a certain

00:36:03.502 --> 00:36:07.443
amount of engineering lingo you
have to learn.

00:36:07.443 --> 00:36:12.697
It is used by almost everybody.
Not architects and biologists

00:36:12.697 --> 00:36:16.550
probably quite yet,
but anybody that uses the

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:21.805
Laplace transform will use these
words in connection with it.

00:36:21.805 --> 00:36:25.658
I really think,
since it is such a widespread

00:36:25.658 --> 00:36:31.000
technique, that these are things
you should know.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.669
Anyway, it will be easy.
It is just the enrichment of

00:36:34.669 --> 00:36:37.844
your vocabulary.
It is always fun to learn new

00:36:37.844 --> 00:36:40.807
vocabulary words.
So, let's just consider a

00:36:40.807 --> 00:36:45.111
general second order equation.
By the way, all this applies to

00:36:45.111 --> 00:36:47.017
higher order equations,
too.

00:36:47.017 --> 00:36:50.262
It applies to systems.
The same words are used,

00:36:50.262 --> 00:36:52.873
but let's use something that
you know.

00:36:52.873 --> 00:36:55.836
Here is a system.
It could be a spring mass

00:36:55.836 --> 00:37:00.000
dashpot system.
It could be an RLC circuit.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.338
Or that pendulum,
a damped pendulum,

00:37:02.338 --> 00:37:06.214
anything that is modeled by
that differential equation with

00:37:06.214 --> 00:37:08.553
constant coefficients,
second-order.

00:37:08.553 --> 00:37:11.761
This is the input.
The input can be any kind of a

00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:13.832
function.
Exponential functions,

00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:16.372
sine, cosine.
It could be a Dirac delta

00:37:16.372 --> 00:37:18.711
function.
It could be a sum of these

00:37:18.711 --> 00:37:21.116
things.
It could be a Fourier series.

00:37:21.116 --> 00:37:24.792
Anything of the sort of stuff
we have been talking about

00:37:24.792 --> 00:37:30.094
throughout the last few weeks.
And let's have simple initial

00:37:30.094 --> 00:37:34.717
conditions so that doesn't louse
things up, the simplest possible

00:37:34.717 --> 00:37:36.668
ones.
The mass starts at the

00:37:36.668 --> 00:37:40.930
equilibrium point from rest.
Of course, it doesn't stay that

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:45.336
way because there is an input
that is asking it to move along.

00:37:45.336 --> 00:37:49.598
Now all I want to do is solve
this in general with a Laplace

00:37:49.598 --> 00:37:51.909
transform.
If I do it in general,

00:37:51.909 --> 00:37:56.099
that is always easier than
doing it in particular since you

00:37:56.099 --> 00:38:00.000
don't ever have to do any
calculations.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.119
It is s squared Y.
There are no other terms here

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:08.622
because the initial conditions
are zero.

00:38:08.622 --> 00:38:12.035
This part will be a times s Y.

00:38:12.035 --> 00:38:17.514
Again, no other terms because
the initial conditions are zero.

00:38:17.514 --> 00:38:21.646
Plus b times Y.
And all that is equal to

00:38:21.646 --> 00:38:26.676
whatever the Laplace transform
is of the right-hand side.

00:38:26.676 --> 00:38:31.040
So it is F of s.
Next step.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.724
Boy, this is an easy problem.
You solve for Y.

00:38:35.724 --> 00:38:41.553
Well, Y is F of s times one
over s squared plus as plus b.

00:38:45.197 --> 00:38:50.193
Now, what is that?
The next step now is to figure

00:38:50.193 --> 00:38:55.918
out what the answer to the
problem is, what's the Y of t?

00:38:55.918 --> 00:39:00.435
Well, you do that by taking the

00:39:00.435 --> 00:39:04.755
inverse Laplace transform.
But because these are general

00:39:04.755 --> 00:39:09.233
functions, I don't have to write
down any specific answer.

00:39:09.233 --> 00:39:13.868
The only thing is to use the
convolution because this is the

00:39:13.868 --> 00:39:18.503
product of two functions of s.
The inverse transform will be

00:39:18.503 --> 00:39:21.802
the convolution of their
respective things.

00:39:21.802 --> 00:39:26.515
The answer is going to be the
convolution of F of t,

00:39:26.515 --> 00:39:30.679
the input function in other
words, convoluted with the

00:39:30.679 --> 00:39:35.000
inverse Laplace transform of
that thing.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.289
Now, we have to have a name for
that, and those are the two

00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:43.210
words I want to introduce you to
because they are used

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.985
everywhere.
The function,

00:39:44.985 --> 00:39:48.461
on the right-hand side,
this function one over s

00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:51.789
squared plus as plus b,

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:55.636
notice it only depends upon the
left-hand side of the

00:39:55.636 --> 00:40:00.000
differential equation,
on the damping constant.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.527
The spring constant if you are
thinking of a mass spring

00:40:03.527 --> 00:40:06.221
dashpot system.
So this depends only on the

00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:08.915
system, not on what input is
going into it.

00:40:08.915 --> 00:40:11.352
And it is called the transfer
function.

00:40:11.352 --> 00:40:15.008
Is usually called capital W of,
sometimes it is

00:40:15.008 --> 00:40:18.279
capital H of s,
there are different things,

00:40:18.279 --> 00:40:22.000
but it is always called the
transfer function.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.500
What we are interested in
putting here its inverse Laplace

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.578
transform.
Well, I will call that W of t

00:40:34.578 --> 00:40:39.236
to go with the capital
W of s by the usual

00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:42.315
notation.
Its inverse Laplace transform,

00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:46.815
well, I cannot calculate that.
I will just give it a name,

00:40:46.815 --> 00:40:49.657
W of t.
And that is called the weight

00:40:49.657 --> 00:40:53.763
function of the system.
This is the transfer function

00:40:53.763 --> 00:40:57.078
of the system,
so put in "of the system" if

00:40:57.078 --> 00:41:02.040
you are taking notes.
And so the answer is that

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.775
always the solution is the
convolution to this differential

00:41:06.775 --> 00:41:11.265
equation that we have been
solving for the last three or

00:41:11.265 --> 00:41:14.612
four weeks.
It is the convolution of that.

00:41:14.612 --> 00:41:18.285
And, therefore,
the solution is expressed as a

00:41:18.285 --> 00:41:22.530
definite integral of the
function of the input on the

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.204
right-hand side,
what is forcing the equation,

00:41:26.204 --> 00:41:32.000
times this magic function but
flipped and translated by t.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.880
That says du for you guys over
there.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.599
In other words,
the solution to the

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:41.360
differential equation is
presented as a definite

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.880
integral.
Marvelous.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.360
And the only thing is the
definite integral involves this

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:52.159
funny function W of t.
To understand why that is the

00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:55.920
solution, you have to understand
what W of t is.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.000
Well, formally,
of course, it's that.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.256
But what does it really mean?
The problem is what is W of t

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:08.338
really? Not just formally,

00:42:08.338 --> 00:42:12.688
but what does it really mean?
I mean, is it real?

00:42:12.688 --> 00:42:16.495
I think the simplest way of
thinking of it,

00:42:16.495 --> 00:42:21.661
once you know about the delta
function is just to think of

00:42:21.661 --> 00:42:27.099
this differential equation y
double prime plus a y prime plus

00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:32.267
b. Except use as the input the

00:42:32.267 --> 00:42:35.291
Dirac delta function.
In other words,

00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:39.322
we are kicking the mass.
The mass starts at rest,

00:42:39.322 --> 00:42:43.942
so the initial conditions are
going to be what they were

00:42:43.942 --> 00:42:46.125
before. y of zero,

00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:49.149
y prime of zero. Both zero.

00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:53.601
The mass starts at rest from
the equilibrium position,

00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:57.128
and it is kicked in the
positive direction,

00:42:57.128 --> 00:43:02.000
I guess that's this way,
with unit impulse.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.926
At time zero with unit impulse.
In other words,

00:43:05.926 --> 00:43:10.451
kick it just hard enough so you
impart a unit impulse.

00:43:10.451 --> 00:43:15.402
So that situation is modeled by
this differential equation.

00:43:15.402 --> 00:43:19.329
The kick at time zero is
modeled by this input,

00:43:19.329 --> 00:43:23.682
the Dirac delta function.
And now, what happens if I

00:43:23.682 --> 00:43:25.646
solve it?
Well, you see,

00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:30.000
everything in the solution is
the same.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.698
The left stays the same,
but on the right-hand side I

00:43:34.698 --> 00:43:37.951
should have not f of s here.

00:43:37.951 --> 00:43:42.560
Since this is the delta
function, I should have one.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.813
What I get is,
on the left-hand side,

00:43:45.813 --> 00:43:50.963
s squared Y plus as Y plus bY
equals,

00:43:50.963 --> 00:43:56.114
for the Laplace transform of
the right-hand side is simply

00:43:56.114 --> 00:43:57.831
one.
And, therefore,

00:43:57.831 --> 00:44:02.109
Y is what?
Y is one over exactly the

00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:05.823
transform function.
And therefore its inverse

00:44:05.823 --> 00:44:09.283
Laplace transform is that weight
function.

00:44:09.283 --> 00:44:13.419
That is the simplest
interpretation I know of what

00:44:13.419 --> 00:44:18.567
this magic weight function is,
which gives the solution to all

00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:23.209
the differential equations,
no matter what the input is.

00:44:23.209 --> 00:44:27.936
The weight function is the
response of the system at rest

00:44:27.936 --> 00:44:33.000
to a sharp kick at time zero
with unit impulse.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.990
And read the notes because they
will explain to you why this

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:42.812
could be thought of as the
superposition of a lot of sharp

00:44:42.812 --> 00:44:46.956
kicks times zero a little later.
Kick, kick, kick,

00:44:46.956 --> 00:44:49.494
kick.
And that's what makes the

00:44:49.494 --> 00:44:51.894
solution.
Next time we start systems.
