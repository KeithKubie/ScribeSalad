00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:06.410
- Hello, everyone
and welcome back.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.750
My name is Yukio Lippit.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.730
I am the Faculty
Director of the Arts

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.130
at the Radcliffe Institute,
and a co-organizer

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.149
of this conference, which is
titled Game Changers: Sports,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.160
Gender, and society.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.230
I'd like to offer just
a few brief comments.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.730
Before introducing our
next two speakers--

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.140
the conference keynote speaker
Leila Ali in conversation

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.900
with our moderator
Christine Brennan.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.910
Now we trust that
by now if you've

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.930
been following the
conference you share

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.830
the conviction of the
organizers that the relationship

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.760
between sports, and gender,
and society is complex and ever

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.490
evolving, and that now
seems to be a particularly

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.030
opportune moment to
reflect upon and re-examine

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.220
its many dimensions.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.230
This morning, we
heard a panel that

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.430
did so from a historical
perspective, framed, of course,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.240
through a consideration of
the consequences of Title IX,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.060
and what it means for athletic
participation and gender

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.530
equality.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.379
This panel included a
really beautiful meditation

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.250
on this idea of sports
as a birthright--

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.840
as somehow a
fundamental part of what

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.530
it means to be human, of
sports as a basic part

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.110
of the human experience,
and the challenges

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.060
that have faced women and
people with disabilities

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.880
in staking a claim to it.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.360
We also heard in the late
morning in the panel on Gender

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.120
and Wellness of a host of
perspectives on this issue from

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.190
the NCAA perspective, from
the US anti-doping agency,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.214
and community sports, and
how to think about gender--

00:01:39.214 --> 00:01:40.630
the issue of gender
and difference

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.700
in sports from
myriad perspectives--

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.300
neurophysiological,
biomechanical.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.390
From the perspective of the--

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.180
from legal, cultural, social.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.700
We also learned why the
Scandinavian countries

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.980
are the happiest in the world.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.840
Later this afternoon, we'll be
exploring yet a different set

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.620
of issues in the panel Gender,
Media, and Popular Culture.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.300
It goes without saying
that we have now

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.030
been living in a saturated
media culture for some time

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.460
now from that
moment that was so,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.360
I think, well captured
in the movie Anchorman 2

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.970
when Ron Burgundy,
played by Will Ferrell,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.860
is being recruited
during the 1980s

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.930
by an executive for a new
24-hour news channel, GNN.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.240
And blurts out, that
is without doubt,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.382
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:35.340
You might say that the
afternoon panel examines

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.970
what happens in the wake
of the emergence of GNN,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.760
and more generally of sports
through the culture of sports,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.530
the fandoms, the
media practices,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.750
and the popular culture
with which sports

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.070
have become so imbricated.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.190
Now as a conference
organizer, I can

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.900
tell you that the
Radcliffe institute is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.320
this interesting place where the
faculty directors get together

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.860
with the dean and administrators
and propose conference themes.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.870
Then, we propose an absolutely
improbable dream list of world

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.147
experts to address them.

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:07.230
And then we go out and ask
them, and they say yes,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.150
and here we are.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.627
Amazing.

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:12.210
And nowhere is this
more the case than

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.420
with our keynote
speaker, Laila Ali.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.950
She needs no introduction.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.990
And you will find in
our conference booklets

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.500
an extensive bio for her,
as with all of our speakers.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.230
But let me just say that
in a remarkably wide

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.290
ranging achievements and
experiences as a boxing

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.400
champion and world class
athlete, actress, commentator,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.680
and past president of the
nonprofit Women's Sports

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.950
Foundation, Laila Ali
has lived or embodied

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.740
in one form or another
many of the issues that we

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.290
are addressing in
today's conference.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.660
She is an advocate
for equality for women

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.160
in the world of
professional sports

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.484
who is both powerful
and thoughtful.

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:51.150
Someone who will be
able to offer unique

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.740
perspectives on
the many questions

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.860
that emerge at the intersection
of sport and gender.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.440
And we are absolutely delighted
and privileged to have her

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.580
here.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.310
And it was a tall order to
find an interlocutor who

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.980
could activate to the fullest
this opportunity for engagement

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.380
with Laila Ali,
but we have somehow

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.030
found the ideal person--

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.430
Christine Brennan, an award
winning national sports

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.340
columnist and best selling
author whose pioneering status

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.890
in sports journalism offers
her equally unique insights

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.980
into the issues we've been
addressing throughout the day.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.830
And she has just flown in from
a blustery day in Augusta,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.550
Georgia, covering the
Masters to be here with us,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.670
and it's a real honor to be
able to have her join us today.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.380
And before welcoming
them to the stage,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.750
let me explain how
this will proceed.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.910
After Laila Ali and
Christine Brennan

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.520
conclude their conversation,
we will take questions

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.720
from the audience.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.700
A mic will be placed
in the central aisle,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.440
and we ask that you
come up to the mic,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.410
introduce yourself before
asking your question.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.416
Now I'm just going to linger
here for just a few seconds

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.790
because I'm pretty
sure that this

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.380
is the only time
in my life that I'm

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.890
going to be able to
introduce a world renowned,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.135
undefeated boxing champion.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.090
Without further
ado, please join me

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.740
in welcoming Laila Ali and
Christine Brennan to the stage.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.110
- Thank you.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.100
- Wow.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.790
Is my mic on?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.290
Yes.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.160
How are you doing?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.600
I'm really excited to be here.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.410
Honored to be here.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.590
I've already learned
a couple new words--

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.490
words I need to go
look up, thank you.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.320
But thank you so much to Dean
Elizabeth Cohen for inviting

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.210
me, and like I said,
I'm honored to be here,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.400
share my story with you.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.832
Looking forward to
discussing my story with you.

00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:43.040
I just want to start by
saying that I think all of us

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.820
know that now more than
ever, we're living in a time

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.270
where women, especially,
need to be inspired

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.722
to find that greatness within
themselves that we all have.

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:55.930
I think that we're champions.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.630
We're warriors.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.890
We're definitely athletes.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.270
We know that.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.620
That's what I love about sports.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.860
I love that sports can
be a vehicle for us

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.890
as women to find all of
those leadership qualities

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.510
that are there.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.910
One of the biggest
regrets that I have--

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.480
I have very few, aside
from some of the guys maybe

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.540
in the past I've dated,
but one of the biggest

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.870
regrets that I have is that I
didn't play sports growing up.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.180
A lot of people
assumed that I did.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.154
They also assume that I got
into boxing because my father is

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:28.820
the greatest of all
time, but I actually

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.100
didn't want to
box myself until I

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.169
saw women boxing on
television for the first time.

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.210
And I remember that moment
like it was yesterday.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.490
I was in complete awe, and
wanted to do it myself,

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.910
so I think of that now
as me being an athlete

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.550
and a role model to
other girls growing up.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.770
Not even necessarily to want
to become a boxer, but just

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.690
expanding our minds of
what's possible for us to do.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.560
So, again, I'm honored to
speak to you all here today,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.710
and I would love to go through
that story with you guys.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.570
- All right.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.310
Well, what a great
opening statement.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.694
And I was saying-- we were
just in the green room--

00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:09.110
I was saying, you know that
thing, the school yard thing--

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.925
like, my, dad can take your dad.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.870
That wasn't so good.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.650
Maybe my mom could
take your mom.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.200
- Probably not that either.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.120
I'm just joking.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.250
My mom's a little feisty.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.960
- My mom was too.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.460
OK.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.959
I'm 0 for 2.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.480
You talked to your dad.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.110
And when we were
chatting a few days ago

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.970
just to kind of prepare
for this, and what

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.410
a wonderful scene this is to
see all of you in this gym,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.210
in this historic setting.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.340
The old boys' club of
Augusta National or here?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.673
I think I should just stay here.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.640
All right.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.427
I'll stay.

00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:54.010
But we were talking,
and I said, is it

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.134
OK you talk about your dad?

00:07:55.134 --> 00:07:56.710
And you said, of course.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.870
And there's so many
ways we could go

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.430
with the greatest of all time--

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.310
Mohammad Ali-- but you
just touched upon it.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.310
So you did not really play--
you didn't play sports.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.810
You didn't think
you'd be a boxer,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.420
and as I recall, your dad
was not exactly thrilled

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.737
when you said, hey dad,
I want to be a boxer.

00:08:12.737 --> 00:08:14.320
Why don't you tell
everyone that story

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.694
because I think
it's illustrative

00:08:15.694 --> 00:08:18.310
of not only, of course,
your personal story,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.460
but also of a girl trying
to say to a dad, hey,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.250
I want to play sports, and the
dad kind of being reluctant,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.310
and then obviously
finally coming around.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.000
Right?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.980
- Well for me.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.830
I'm not just any girl, and
it wasn't just any dad.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.370
This is Muhammad Ali, the
greatest of all times.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.893
He has his youngest
daughter now wanting to box.

00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:42.309
So he didn't have
any of his kids.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:46.537
I don't think he wanted
any of his kids to box.

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:48.370
We can go into that
later, but as a fighter,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.850
I wouldn't want my
kids to box, either.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.224
So it's just one
of those things.

00:08:51.224 --> 00:08:53.840
But for me, I
decided that I want

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.040
to start training after I saw
women's boxing on television.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.030
And I was in school full
time, and I had a business--

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.560
I had a nail salon
because I started

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.110
going to school to learn how
to do nails when I was 16.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.200
And I built up my clientele,
saved up my money,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.670
I was subleasing.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.592
And I had this whole
plan, and I'm a planner.

00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:13.300
So I was like, I'm
going to go to school,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.430
I'm going to live on
my own, which I did.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.245
And I'm going to focus on
building this business.

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:20.120
And then all of a sudden
I see women's boxing

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.655
and I'm like within myself--

00:09:22.655 --> 00:09:23.530
- How did you see it.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.321
You watch it on TV.

00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:27.901
- I turned on television to
watch a Mike Tyson fight,

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.400
and I wasn't a big boxing fan,
but I watched the big fights,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.530
and then here come these women
into the ring on the under

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.010
card.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.093
So I think that was the
first time a lot of people

00:09:35.093 --> 00:09:39.040
saw women's boxing, and
that moment-- that's when

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.780
the seed was planted within me.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.490
And I remember saying,
I want to do that.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.700
And I was with my best friend
and her father, he said Laila,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.200
those women will
take your head off.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.610
And I was like, no, I can do it.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.110
I can do it.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.820
But then when I went home,
and the fear and the doubt

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.960
started to set in, and I don't
know if I'd be able to do it,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.721
meaning change my plans.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:57.970
You know, I've told everybody.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.936
I've said this is
my plan, and then

00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:01.060
what are they going to say?

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.930
What are they going to think?

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:02.638
Just all of that.

00:10:02.638 --> 00:10:04.240
I was a young girl.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.470
But that feeling
did not go away,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.940
so I thought about it
for I think about a year.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.500
I'm really bad with timelines,
but it took us about a year.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.620
And then I decided,
you know what,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.770
I'm going to go find a
trainer and start training.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.940
And I did it all on my own.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.185
I didn't ask my dad for help.

00:10:17.185 --> 00:10:19.810
I was still trying to figure out
if it was something I actually

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.594
wanted to do-- if I
had the talent to do,

00:10:21.594 --> 00:10:24.010
because I knew I was going to
be successful with this nail

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.050
business and become
an entrepreneur,

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.850
and boxing was so new for me.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.890
So I went to the gym,
started training,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.070
and at a certain point my
father found out about it,

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.892
and I had already
decided that yes, I

00:10:34.892 --> 00:10:36.100
was, in fact, going to do it.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.036
And that's when he asked me--

00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:40.660
came in town, because he didn't
live in Los Angeles-- and said,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.010
you know, I hear
that you're boxing,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.468
and you're going
to start fighting.

00:10:43.468 --> 00:10:44.570
I was like, yeah I am.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.597
He basically tried to talk
me out of it indirectly.

00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:49.930
That's how my father-- he
brings up every negative thing

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.220
that he possibly can.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.249
What happens if you
get knocked out?

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:54.790
What happens if you
get knocked down?

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.230
The whole world's going
to be watching you,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.420
and all my answers
was based on-- well,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.470
when you got knocked
down, you got back up.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.240
I don't think I want to get
knocked out, but if I do,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.220
I'm going to ask for a rematch.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.678
You know, I gave
all these answers,

00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:05.050
like what else could he say?

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.050
And he knew he was
talking to Laila,

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.480
and he knows Laila is going
to do what she wants to do.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.690
He was like, OK, he knew he
couldn't tell me not to do it,

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.837
so we had that talk.

00:11:14.837 --> 00:11:17.170
And I just said, hey, you're
either going to support me,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.010
or you're not.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.530
And he made it very clear
that he didn't really

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.240
think women should be fighting.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.820
My father was a little
bit of a male chauvinist,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.620
and so that was
something I was like,

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.432
I'm not going to try to change
your mind about that, other

00:11:30.432 --> 00:11:32.140
than I'm going to show
you what I can do.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.160
I'm going to show
you that I can do it.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.260
So I started boxing.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.275
And needless to say--

00:11:36.275 --> 00:11:37.400
maybe I do need to say it--

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.670
I did change his mind about it.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.790
Know He was like, wow,
you really can fight.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.680
Women can fight.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.200
He had a whole different
thought in his mind

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.851
when it came to
women in the ring.

00:11:48.851 --> 00:11:50.350
- Did he come to
any of your fights?

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.849
- He did.

00:11:50.849 --> 00:11:52.270
He was at most of my fights.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.644
He didn't make it to all of
them just because he was sick

00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:57.520
and couldn't always be
there, but he was there.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.110
Over half of the
fights he was there.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.400
- So when he showed up, did
he try to sneak in the back?

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.160
- Oh my dad?

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.810
No.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.310
- Right.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.780
- Every time he walked in
it was like, Ali, Ali, Ali,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.630
and he loved it.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.005
- That's good for you because
the crowd was on your side.

00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:17.740
- Well yeah, but the crowd--

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.304
was what was surreal about my
boxing career was just that I

00:12:21.304 --> 00:12:22.970
felt like I was
fighting for both of us,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.782
because he couldn't-- just with
his Parkinson's-- and I knew I

00:12:26.782 --> 00:12:29.240
could see in his eyes he would
love to be back in that ring

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.960
again and he couldn't.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.970
So I felt like I was
kind of doing it for him

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.560
and he was living
through me, as well.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.600
So when he walked
in and everyone

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.620
started chanting Ali and
then again when I came out.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.350
I never really
focused on my dad when

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.200
whether he was going to be there
or not because as a fighter,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.290
I like to just really be
focused on the mission at hand.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.059
I can't worry about
who's in the audience.

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:50.600
None of that.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.330
And then after the fight,
I always looked for my dad

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.780
and just kind of see that joy
and excitement in his eyes.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.630
- And when you look
at him, was it--

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.650
again, I know, he was
gradually losing the abilities

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.442
that obviously made him who
he was, but his personality--

00:13:07.442 --> 00:13:08.900
I mean, did you
see it in his eyes?

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.520
- Oh yeah.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.670
- What would he do to
show you how much he

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.590
was loving what you
were doing after being

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.850
so reluctant at first?

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.470
- Well, my father--

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.850
well, first of all, he told me
that he had a change of heart.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.950
So I changed his mind
about just not just me,

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.480
but women in general
being able to fight.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.810
He had to get past-- my father
is Muslim, and I'm not--

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.430
and a lot of people
assume that I am,

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.970
but that was an issue
just wearing a sports bra

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.514
and shorts in the ring with him.

00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:39.680
And I was like, dad, really?

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.330
That's what you're
thinking about?

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.420
But just being able to watch
me in the ring as a fighter

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.970
and not seeing a woman, per
se, but seeing a fighter.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.310
And he knows that you
have to respect the game.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.450
He knows how hard it is to train
and to prepare and all of that,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.270
and it has nothing to do with
being a woman or being a man.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.610
So just for him to be able
to see past all of that

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.500
and show me my respect,
and at the same time,

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.630
be so surprised because he
wasn't there to see me train.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.140
He didn't know when
he was going to see.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.848
And then to be able
to see the way that I

00:14:05.848 --> 00:14:07.130
was able to dominate.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.520
And then, of course, it's
like, you're just like me.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.060
Now you want to take credit, OK.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.862
- So a few years after this,
through Billie Jean King

00:14:17.862 --> 00:14:19.820
and everyone at the
Women's Sports Foundation--

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.820
some of the folks have
been around obviously here

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.244
at the conference--

00:14:24.244 --> 00:14:25.910
the wonderful Women's
Sports Foundation,

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.565
which does so much good work,
they basically kind of twist

00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:31.190
your arm and pretty soon you're
president of the Women's Sports

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.780
Foundation.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.800
That's Billie Jean King for you.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.550
- She got me good.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.430
- Right, you say
hello, and now you're

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.410
president of the Women's
Sports Foundation.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.350
She knew what she was doing
because of your personality,

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.050
because of everything that
you've just described for us.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:50.210
So what did you take from your
personal experience and taking

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.230
a dad-- in this case the
most famous dad in the world,

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.990
one of them--

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.970
and turning him
around and saying,

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.190
hey, you can look at me as
an athlete, not as a girl.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.230
It's not just a girl
playing a sport.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.780
This is an athlete playing--
what did you then take,

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.150
and how did that
help you as you then

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.930
went to this global role of
being the face of women's

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.352
sports for a couple of years?

00:15:10.352 --> 00:15:12.560
- This is one of those
questions I'm going to answer,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.143
and I get so deep I I'm going
to forget what the question was.

00:15:15.143 --> 00:15:17.300
- It's OK, that's why I'm here.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.120
- Thank you.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.620
- Now if I forget,
we're in trouble.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.510
- Right, right.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.640
The thing is that the way I
approach my career and life

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.962
is that I never really worried
about what my dad thought,

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.170
or what anybody else thought.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.150
I worried about what I
thought about myself.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:37.130
So for me, I had something
to prove to myself first,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.890
and I have really high
expectations of myself.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.540
So with my father,
I was just like--

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.950
I've always been confident.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.730
I know I get that same
confidence from him

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.650
because I had been training,
and I knew what I could do.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.740
I had already proved to
myself that I can do this,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.200
and I can be a champion, and
you're just going to sit back

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.430
and you're going to watch.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.950
So for me, I was not
really concerned even

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.361
with him going in because
it didn't hurt my feelings.

00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:02.360
I wasn't like-- I can't
believe my own father is

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.300
not-- it's just like,
look, peace, see you later.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.297
I'm about to go do this,
and you can come along

00:16:08.297 --> 00:16:09.130
for the ride or not.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.900
So that was one thing
that took the burden off

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.110
of myself to feel like
I had to please my dad

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.340
or change his mind.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.560
I felt like that was
going to happen naturally,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.570
and that's the same
way that I've just

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.750
approached the sport and life.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.670
It's too much to have
to worry about what

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.200
everybody else is thinking.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.620
If I just stay focused on what
my goals are and be in the best

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.770
that I can be because that
takes so much energy and focus

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.300
and dedication to begin with,
then you can't do anything

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.670
but change your mind
at the end of the day

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.420
because it is what it is if
you're honest with yourself.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.780
You know, so I think that
that's what changes--

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.880
when people think women
can't do something,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.530
you see someone
do it, they think

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.450
they can't because maybe
they've never seen it before,

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.130
but as soon as you see it,
you learn something new,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.610
it changes that information.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.150
You're like, oh, so
I think right now

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.790
my focus is just being
the best that I can be,

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.990
and then inspiring
others along the way.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.040
But I try not to put that burden
on myself of I have to do this,

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.690
and I have to do that, and I
have to please this person.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.190
I think that a lot
of times as women

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.200
sometimes we do that
because we feel--

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.770
and that's not to say that
I don't feel responsible

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.020
and I don't make smart
choices along the way,

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.339
because I do take being a
public person and a role model

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.839
very seriously.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.359
There's opportunities
that come up that I have,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.730
and I'll turn them down
just because of the way

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.739
it might come off, or
just because the message

00:17:31.739 --> 00:17:32.530
that it might send.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.590
Even though it might be
something I'm OK doing,

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.430
I always have to think
about the long term effect.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.180
And I don't know if
anyone's ever noticed,

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.677
but you don't really ever
see me showing too much,

00:17:41.677 --> 00:17:43.010
or having too much cleavage out.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.680
And a lot of people might
assume it's because I'm Muslim.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.430
I'm not.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.500
It's just that I don't
like for young girls

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.960
to feel like you
have to pose nude,

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.240
or you have to do
certain things.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.490
And at the same time, there
are some women that do it,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.823
and I don't judge them for that.

00:17:55.823 --> 00:17:58.240
Maybe they choose to do that,
but that's not who I am,

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.270
and that's not the image
that I want to send.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.800
So here we are, and what
was the question again?

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.300
I have so much I want
to say, I was like--

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:07.940
- No, no.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.100
Actually there's some
really great nuggets

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.600
of things I'd love to pursue.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.430
But the Women's Sports
Foundation and being

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:18.444
the president-- so
now you've got this--

00:18:18.444 --> 00:18:20.110
I was at the dinner
and you're speaking,

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.350
and you're the face
of women's sports.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.520
You're no longer the
boxer, you've now

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.640
graduated to this global role.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.570
I guess the question was, your
experience and how then you

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.780
were able to say, if the field
hockey people came to you

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.500
or if someone--

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.170
can maybe give us, if there
were moments-- maybe not--

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.570
of where you gave advice,
or you were in meetings,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.350
or you could see sports
starting to emerge,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.100
which we see in the
Olympics all the time.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.530
Obviously we see in the
NCAA women's basketball.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.899
And now this is your
entire landscape

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:51.940
that you are involved with
for a couple of years.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.648
- So when Billie Jean
first approached me

00:18:53.648 --> 00:18:57.810
about being the president of
the foundation, I was reluctant,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.190
and hesitant because
I was like wow,

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.860
I didn't even grow
up playing sports.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.800
And there's so much there
as far as just organized

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.960
sports and collegiate
sports and all these things.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.430
And just never played
it, and there's just

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.346
this whole vocabulary
that goes along with it.

00:19:11.346 --> 00:19:14.020
I can't even really
have the conversation.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.940
So I was like, I don't
know if I'm the one.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.330
She's like, no you are the one
because you're that person.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.880
We want to get more
girls involved in sports,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.857
and you're someone who's
saying that I regret

00:19:23.857 --> 00:19:24.940
that I didn't play sports.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.370
And you see the importance
of it, and how it could have

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.700
enriched my life, right?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.099
So I was like OK, I'll do it.

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:34.640
And, of course, then
being around all

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.030
these different women and
sitting in board meetings

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.330
and listening to all the
issues is really overwhelming.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:45.320
But the fact that we're
in a time when we still

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.410
see all the
disparities, then that

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.680
means that we need strong
women that can stand up

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.684
and can say something
that can inspire others.

00:19:53.684 --> 00:19:55.100
So it doesn't
really matter what I

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.990
did and didn't do,
as long as I can have

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.280
that conversation with people.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.044
So yes, now I'm an
advocate for sports,

00:20:02.044 --> 00:20:03.710
even though I didn't
play it growing up.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.668
I'm like, no, my kids
are going to play sports.

00:20:05.668 --> 00:20:09.102
I want the confidence building--

00:20:09.102 --> 00:20:11.060
what you learn about
yourself-- the discipline,

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.110
working as a team.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.790
All these things
you learn in sports

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.290
that you can apply to so many
different areas of your life.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.480
All of these successful
women that I've met

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.590
said they believe that a
large part of their success

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.210
is because they played sports.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.090
You learn so much about
yourself and about the world

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.200
through sports.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.775
And as we've been
talking about--

00:20:30.775 --> 00:20:32.150
I know you guys
have been talking

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.608
about the importance
of it, and how

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:40.160
it kind of plays into society
in so many different ways

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.212
and all of that.

00:20:41.212 --> 00:20:42.920
And it's true, and
I've seen that myself.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.420
So that's why I think
Billy asked me to be

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.647
a president of the foundation.

00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:51.730
I will always be involved
with the Women's Sport--

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.521
because once you get
in, you don't get out.

00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:56.786
Once you get in--

00:20:56.786 --> 00:20:58.160
- It's like the
Hotel California.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.750
- Right, right.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.020
- Here we are, the
45th anniversary

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.910
of Title IX in a
couple of months.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:09.200
And so many good things,
as you mentioned.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.319
But what you touched on a
few moments ago about the way

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:15.110
you handle yourself,
and the way you dress,

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.430
it is fascinating isn't it?

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.030
Because you talked to some
young athletes who maybe appear

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.830
in the ESPN Body Issue, or even
the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.660
Issue, which tends to be almost
all-female, where the ESPN Body

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.660
Issue is actually male
and female, which I think

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.380
is better.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.450
But they're like hey,
no problem, right?

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.432
And I'm reminded of back in--

00:21:34.432 --> 00:21:36.140
Jenny Thompson, the
great Olympic swimmer

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.214
who posed topless with her
arms like this or whatever

00:21:39.214 --> 00:21:40.130
in Sports Illustrated.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.171
I asked Donna de Varona--

00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:43.520
the great Donna de Varona--
the Olympic gold medalist.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.170
And she said, I
kind of like it when

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.180
they keep their clothes on.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.820
And so you know, there's
kind of like that old school

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.470
feeling, right?

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.920
But we also want to understand
that these women believe

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.530
it's a sense of freedom,
even if us old people--

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.350
not you, me-- would
go, wait a minute,

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.660
you're playing to the lowest
common denominator, which

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.240
is, the male gaze,
or you're playing

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.160
to that male dominated
sports world.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.190
So when you talk
to a young person--

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.300
I assume you do some
mentoring, do you

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.232
find that young girls are
receptive to this, they want

00:22:17.232 --> 00:22:18.440
to hear what you have to say?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.970
Or they're kind of
like, hey, that's great,

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.060
but I'm going to
do my own thing,

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.970
and if I'm sleeveless
every day of the year

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.760
and wearing almost no
clothes, no problem.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.387
And how do we make sense
of that, do you think?

00:22:28.387 --> 00:22:30.470
- Everyone has a right to
make their own decision,

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.710
I just try to offer them
a different alternative.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.150
I think that you can--

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.580
you naturally as a woman want
to be-- you want people to say,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.630
oh you're pretty, and sometimes
people go to different lengths

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.060
in order to get that response.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.340
They want to sometimes show
their body in a magazine

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.590
and be nude so people go,
oh, my God, did you see her?

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:49.970
And maybe something else
will come from that.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.260
Or maybe they have
people around them,

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.000
like their agents, that
are like, no you can do it.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.875
You're an athlete, this
is an athletic thing.

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:57.590
So it just really
depends on whether or not

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.780
you can do it and sleep at
night, and for me that's

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.820
not something that I ever wanted
to do because I feel like you

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.778
can be just as strong
and you can be beautiful,

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:06.430
and you can be powerful
with your clothes on.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.210
But some people
feel like they want

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.210
to make a statement by
taking their clothes off.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.430
To each their own.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.010
But with the young
girls, I try to just--

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.050
I think that if you love
yourself and you have

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.560
confidence in yourself, and
you know what your values are,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.830
then it will be easier
to make those decisions

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.271
when you're faced with them.

00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:27.020
Because there is going
to come a time when

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.500
you're going to have to decide.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.250
- Right, and you think
about, for example,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.220
Brandi Chastain with the winning
penalty kick in '99 and she

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.760
takes off her shirt, and
twirls it over her head.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.530
An iconic moment, and you see
her abs and how cut she is.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.280
And then people say, oh, well
that this a sign of sex--

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.220
or whatever that was--

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.530
and then the flip side is, well,
there were probably millions

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.180
of women that exact
day on the beach--

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.860
it was July 10 of 1999--

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.900
women throughout the
country on the beach

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.750
with less on than Brandi
had at that moment.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.154
So these conversations, I think,
are with us probably forever.

00:24:00.154 --> 00:24:01.820
- And I didn't have
a problem with that.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.020
She just took off for shirt.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.311
She had sports braw underneath.

00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:05.330
It was just a moment.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.840
I don't think she really
thought that through.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.298
I'm going to take off my shirt
and show them how sexy I am.

00:24:09.298 --> 00:24:13.180
Lot of times male athletes
will take off their shirt,

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:13.840
and they can.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.880
But she happened to
have a sports bra,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.399
so that was a little different.

00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:17.690
- And she was a big soccer fan.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.648
As she explained for
anyone who hasn't followed

00:24:19.648 --> 00:24:22.764
this thing since I opened this
up, she watched men's soccer.

00:24:22.764 --> 00:24:25.180
And when they score a big goal,
they take their shirt off.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.430
And so she said, why not?

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.650
And then she did, too.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.890
And that was a pretty big goal,
I think we can safely say.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.260
Cover of Time, Newsweek,
people and Sports Illustrated.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.730
No story in the
history of stories

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.410
has ever been on the
cover of Time, Newsweek--

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.050
not even your dad has been on
the cover of Newsweek, People,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.080
and Sports Illustrated.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.746
Well, I don't think
People existed maybe

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:44.350
when he was doing his thing.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.080
That's my story.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.110
I'm sticking with it.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.770
But that's how big
a deal that was.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:49.910
- Wow.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.631
- You know Julie Foudy?

00:24:51.631 --> 00:24:53.880
You know some of those guys--
the women's soccer team.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.910
I actually competed
against Brandi

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.040
on Chopped--
cooking competition.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.030
- And who won?

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.900
- I won.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.936
She wasn't the only one.

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:06.560
I think it started out with four
people or something like that.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.117
- Anyone who wants to beat
out Brandi Chastain, I

00:25:09.117 --> 00:25:09.950
heard you just lost.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.300
- She was so good, though.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.270
She really was.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.840
And she made a minor mistake.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.810
And, no, seriously-- she
made a minor mistake.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.109
No, in her defense--

00:25:19.109 --> 00:25:21.650
because I thought it was going
to be her and I in the finals,

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.470
and she burned
herself, and I think

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.640
that got her so flustered that
she forgot to put her sauce

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.744
or something on.

00:25:28.744 --> 00:25:30.410
If you don't watch
Chopped, you wouldn't

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.290
know what I'm talking about,
but she left out an ingredient,

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.240
and that automatically
gets you out.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.010
But she could have won it.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.110
I was watching her like--

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.680
OK, I got to watch her because
she was doing her thing.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.640
- On my notes here, I
didn't have Chopped.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.070
But, what you just said--

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.605
so here we are, and
we're talking about you

00:25:50.605 --> 00:25:52.480
and we're talking
about Brandi, and we're

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.480
talking about crossing
over into our culture,

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.180
and we all know exactly
what we're talking about.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.570
And generation ago, it was
Billie Jean, or Chris Evert--

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.250
maybe a generation and a half.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.690
But there are so many women now
who we have a household name--

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.650
Mia Hamm, how about
women's hoops?

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.440
The entire women's Olympic
basketball team, Mia Moore,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.180
on and on and on it goes.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.570
I mean, I'm bullish about
where women's sports is.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.170
I mean, it's interesting
time in our country.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.090
You may have heard
there was an election.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.270
Where do women stand?

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.630
But I'm really-- I think
the glass is half full,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.740
and I'm very positive.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.340
Are you?

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.695
- I am, yes--

00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:33.820
especially when we're
talking about women's sports.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.770
I just love that we see women
in every sport now pretty much.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.260
And I love that my
son is growing up

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.190
where he can see women boxing,
he can see women in the UFC,

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.350
he can see women wrestling, he
can see women playing football.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.070
He's out there on the field
playing soccer with girls.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.980
My daughter is on his
baseball team right now.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.410
So just that they're going
to open up their mind

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:57.280
and not think.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.830
That's where it starts with us
just at a very young age where

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.260
we've been conditioned
to think a certain way,

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.050
and that there's the
possibilities that are there.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.520
So I think that this
newer generation of kids

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.440
will grow up thinking different.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.890
- What you're describing--

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.210
you're racing not only of Title
IX female, but a Title IX male.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:16.961
- Yes, definitely.

00:27:16.961 --> 00:27:19.168
- And I don't know if many
of you thought about this,

00:27:19.168 --> 00:27:21.677
but you think of these young
men at this certain age,

00:27:21.677 --> 00:27:24.010
and for example, the USA--
we talked about it at lunch--

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.120
USA women's hockey.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.670
The big battle they just
had and a major victory

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.970
that they had in terms of wages.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:35.440
Well who jumped in right away,
but the NHL players and Major

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.490
League Baseball.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.900
And we're talking about men and
women in their 20s, basically,

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.030
so they're born in the '90s.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.980
So those Major League
Baseball players

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.740
were exactly like your son--

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.260
watching their sisters
cheering for them,

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.430
or the girl next door.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.309
They were playing sports.

00:27:53.309 --> 00:27:54.850
- I don't know about
you, but I think

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.990
this is such an under reported,
kind of under the radar

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:04.930
piece of our culture that I
don't talk about in my columns.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.570
Do you feel like
we're maybe missing it

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.257
as some of these issues
that it just isn't quite as

00:28:09.257 --> 00:28:10.840
popular as talking
about whatever else

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.881
is going on in the world?

00:28:11.881 --> 00:28:13.390
- I hadn't thought
of that question,

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:15.730
but now that you
asked me, yes, I think

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.430
it needs to be covered more.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.599
So maybe we need to start that
conversation, keep it going.

00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:24.140
- What else do we
need to cover more?

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.374
I am looking for a column
idea for next week.

00:28:28.374 --> 00:28:29.290
- I just gave you one.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:29.873
Take that one.

00:28:29.873 --> 00:28:32.642
- I know, exactly.

00:28:32.642 --> 00:28:34.600
We said we wanted to have
a conversation here--

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.160
and by the way, we've got
about 15 minutes or so,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.510
and then we definitely want
to take your questions,

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.051
so that is the most
important thing--

00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:41.654
and we can actually even go to
questions sooner, if we want.

00:28:41.654 --> 00:28:43.570
If you're sick of my
questions, we can go on--

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.110
- No, like your questions.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.200
- One thing that I have
fun thinking about,

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.990
and so I'll kind of
start the conversation--

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.260
what's it all going to look
like in 50 years or 100 years?

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.960
Where will women be?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.104
The 10-year-old girl today--

00:29:00.104 --> 00:29:01.270
or how old is your daughter?

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.460
- My daughter just turned
six a couple of days ago.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.293
- There you go-- your
six-year-old daughter.

00:29:05.293 --> 00:29:07.070
When she is 46--

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.850
40 years from now-- what
does this world look like.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.410
There's no wrong
answer, obviously.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.620
We have no idea.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.360
But your son.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.890
And the world that he's in.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.130
I mean, do we have 50
women in the Senate?

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.042
Hopefully.

00:29:22.042 --> 00:29:24.250
Have we had a woman president,
after woman president,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.340
after a woman president, in
the '30s and '40s and onward?

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.610
You know what I'm saying?

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.340
And I think the lowest--

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.872
the thing that will
be the tie between all

00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:35.080
of these successful women
will be because they played

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.680
sports because of Title IX.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.321
- Definitely, I think it
will definitely be a big--

00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:42.820
I'm sorry, playing
sports definitely

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.987
have a big impact on the success
of individuals in the future.

00:29:47.987 --> 00:29:49.570
And I just know that
with my daughter,

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.560
I'm raising her to believe
she can do anything

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.300
that she wants to do.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.640
She's super feisty.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.480
And I like it.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.840
That to me is like a
positive word in my house.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.750
She has her own mind.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.290
Now, it's a struggle for
me, don't get me wrong,

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.470
but I always have to remind
myself OK this is good.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.600
I just have to shape
her and mold her,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.706
because Sidney is like--

00:30:12.706 --> 00:30:14.830
everything is like, I'm
going do what I want to do,

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.289
when I want to do it.

00:30:16.289 --> 00:30:18.080
And she doesn't have
any limits on herself.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.080
She says mom, I came out
of your boxing belly.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.350
You know she's,
like doing this--

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.110
I don't want my daughter to
become a fighter, per se,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.450
just because of the
business of boxing.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.481
Like I mentioned, I wish that I
would've played sports earlier,

00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:33.730
because I think I would have
been out there with Venus

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.810
and Serena, or out there on the
soccer field in the Olympics,

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.690
and I didn't even have
the opportunity to go

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.690
to the Olympics because boxing
was not-- female boxing--

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.220
was not an Olympic sport.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.330
So men's boxing was.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.180
My father got to go to the
Olympics, but I didn't.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.430
So it now is, and there's
a young girl named

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.390
Claressa Shields who won gold.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.049
And she--

00:30:55.049 --> 00:30:55.840
- I think it twice.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.770
- Yes, twice.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:57.820
- '12 About 16.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.320
- Yeah.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.480
- Isn't a movie being made
about her life, I think?

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.790
- I know there was a
documentary made on her already,

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.590
but I don't know if
they're doing a movie,

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.840
but she's turned pro since then.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.214
So I love just watching her.

00:31:08.214 --> 00:31:09.630
She's actually in
the weight class

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.590
that I was in, so I love
watching her, and just watching

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.510
how her career is
unfolding, and I

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.280
try to give her some
advice along the way.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.484
- But for me, my
daughter-- like I said.

00:31:20.484 --> 00:31:21.900
I want her to play
sports, and get

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.890
everything she needs out of it.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.660
And if she decides
that she wants to be

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.070
a professional athlete, great.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.920
Because I think as
parents you have

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.830
to be careful not to push your
kids in a certain direction.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.410
I want them to be open to do
whatever it is that's going

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.970
to make them happy in life.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.090
So I'm going encourage
them to find that thing.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.860
And yes, we're going
to play sports,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.200
and you have to participate,
but you don't necessarily

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.570
have to become a
professional athlete.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.160
It's just what you
take from sports

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.990
that can help you in so many
different areas of your life.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.060
Your kids got to know
their grandfather.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.900
- Oh yeah.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.810
And they knew, but that they
didn't really understand.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.935
Just like when I was a kid,
people always asked me,

00:32:01.935 --> 00:32:04.371
when did you first learn
how great your father was,

00:32:04.371 --> 00:32:05.370
or why people loved him?

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.910
And I can't even really
remember the moment,

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.460
but when I was eight or nine,
you don't really understand.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.030
You understand people
are coming up to you,

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.320
everywhere you go
there's a crowd.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.480
It's kind of annoying
because you're

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.271
standing around waiting
for a couple hours.

00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:18.480
You get stuck everywhere.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.680
I never wanted to go anywhere
with my dad because I knew--

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.832
he loved doing magic tricks
and drawing in a crowd.

00:32:24.832 --> 00:32:27.290
So you're going to be there
for two or three hours watching

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.529
those same magic tricks.

00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:32.320
- Did you ever figure
out the magic tricks?

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.150
- Oh yeah.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:33.650
Oh my God.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:40.820
He had this one where he would
pretend that this handkerchief

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.900
would disappear.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.150
So he had a plastic thumb.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.090
So he'd have the thumb, and he'd
say, here's the handkerchief.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.240
And then he'd take
the thumb off,

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.990
and stuff the handkerchief
into the thumb,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.320
and then put it back on.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.200
So I saw that and
he'd say, oh, and then

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.020
as he got older and
got sick, the thumb

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.340
would be the wrong color.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.620
He would have a
white person's thumb.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.990
I like dad.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.576
People could see it,
but they were still--

00:33:05.576 --> 00:33:07.910
then he had this
levitating one that he

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:09.560
did where he'd act
like he was floating

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.030
and he really was
on his front toes.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.238
So, like, I knew all of them.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.060
As a child, you're just
like, oh, this is so corny.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.690
But he would also pass out his
pamphlets, and he was still--

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.040
about Islam.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.820
So he would write his signature.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.700
And he spent hours
writing his signature

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.520
so that he could pass them out
to people as he met people.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.505
So I saw this all the time.

00:33:31.505 --> 00:33:34.700
And I get it now, but
as a kid I didn't ever

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.020
want to go with him.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.245
I forget the question, again.

00:33:37.245 --> 00:33:41.690
- It was about the kids
and looking up to him.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.980
Of course, you lost your dad.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.979
- Oh this is what I was
going to say, I'm sorry.

00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:50.270
So my kids knew, but it
wasn't until he passed away

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.430
that they really got
the opportunity to see,

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.350
because now they're
showing all these specials

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.550
on my father on television.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.210
We went to his memorial
service, and they

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.980
saw all these
different people come.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.780
It was very
overwhelming for them,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.850
and then they went to
the Muhammad Ali center

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.470
for the first time.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.520
My son is older.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.739
He's 8 now, and he's
really, really bright,

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.560
smart, and he was able to
just kind of watch the videos,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.590
and see the timeline.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.070
And I was even amazed
because I know my dad.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.830
And I'm not a Muhammad Ali fan,
so I haven't read all of his

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.038
books-- of the books written
about him and all that--

00:34:21.038 --> 00:34:25.040
but to be at the Ali center
and just see this long wall--

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.260
this timeline of all
these important dates,

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.750
and all of the things that
he's done in his life.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:33.889
Because I never took the
time to really go through.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.120
It was amazing to me.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.510
And for them to see that, and
see all those wonderful people

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.010
get on the stage
and talk about him.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.040
Then I could tell that when
they started to kind of get it.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.677
And my daughter had this
really special connection--

00:34:45.677 --> 00:34:47.510
like a spiritual
connection with my father--

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.250
ever since she was a baby.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.520
- My father didn't really
speak that much anymore,

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.420
and towards the end, he
was in a hospital bed.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.960
He was on a feeding
tube and all that.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.650
And my daughter-- most
people-- or kids--

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:05.060
were afraid because
he's shaking,

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.535
he's got really big
hands, and my daughter,

00:35:07.535 --> 00:35:09.660
since she was a baby would
just go right up to him,

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.380
hug him, and she'd kiss him,
and then she'd just kind of

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.420
get into the bed with him.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.462
She'd run back and forth.

00:35:15.462 --> 00:35:17.920
Every five minutes she'd go
back and visit him and kiss him

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.270
and his eyes would just light
up because he loves kids.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.530
He loves giving kisses.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.520
And for her not to
be afraid of him--

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.934
so it was amazing.

00:35:26.934 --> 00:35:28.850
It was amazing to see
the connection they had.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.252
That has been the hardest
thing for me is Sidney.

00:35:31.252 --> 00:35:32.210
She doesn't understand.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.620
Why did poppa have to leave?

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.410
Why did he have to go to heaven?

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.260
She's talking about him
still at least twice a week.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.950
So she knows, but she doesn't
really understand why.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.310
So it's going to be interesting
to see as they get older when

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.910
they really understand and
hear the stories of who

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:50.971
he was as a human being.

00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:52.970
And I think they're going
to be even more proud.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.560
But my son looks just like him.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.450
So my son opened a
book the other day,

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.580
and was like, that
looks like me.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.810
I'm like, I know.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.250
When he was 12--

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.749
we've been telling him, you
look just like your grandfather.

00:36:03.749 --> 00:36:05.550
And I love it because
I'm the youngest.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.420
My dad has 13
grandkids, but my child

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.100
is the only one
that looks like him.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.090
So I'm like, yeah.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:13.610
- Good work.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:14.710
Good work on that.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.240
When we were
talking and chatting

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.740
about what we wanted
to talk about,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.660
I mentioned the 1996 Olympics.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.860
And I think because
for so many of us

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.720
it is that iconic
moment for your dad.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.660
Those of us who didn't
really know him in his prime.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.210
Obviously-- I remember
those Ali-Frazier fights,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.360
but I was little, and
you weren't born yet.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.970
But I was at the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta,

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:40.240
and I'm sure all of you
remember this moment,

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.250
but no one knew who was
going to light the torch.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.930
And this is the US Olympics.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.694
You figure it's going
to be a US athlete.

00:36:46.694 --> 00:36:48.110
And lots of names
were thrown out.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.818
But I don't even
remember your dad's name

00:36:49.818 --> 00:36:52.310
being thrown out that much.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.710
Michael Jordan,
all kinds of names.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.134
So now comes the moment.

00:36:56.134 --> 00:36:58.550
I'll set it up, but I want to
hear what you were thinking.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.040
So now we're in the stadium,
opening ceremonies, 80,000

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.540
people.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.906
It's dark and the torch is
going around, and Janet Evans--

00:37:05.906 --> 00:37:08.280
of course, you remember Janet
Evans, the Olympic swimmer.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.240
Now she's taking it up
to near where you're

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.550
going to light the cauldron,
and we're thinking, well,

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.970
it's Janet Evans, which is
not insignificant, and would

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.520
have been very well deserved--

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.580
Olympic gold medalist, and
a great Olympic champion,

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.350
a great athlete.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:29.630
And then out of the
darkness emerges your dad.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.850
And my last words
on this because

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:33.140
this is all your story--

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.840
my last words, though, as I'm
a journalist sitting there,

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.790
and we're all
there, I have never

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:43.040
heard 80,000 people
gasp in unison.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.150
And it wasn't just me.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.280
Bob Costas and I were
talking recently,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.670
for a column about him.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.670
And I said, what's your
favorite Olympic moment?

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.760
He's covered a lot
of them, as I have.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.500
Mohammad Ali lighting the
torch is his favorite moment.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.910
And he said the
same exact thing.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.940
That audible gasp of like
the air being sucked out

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.460
of this outdoor
stadium as Muhammad Ali

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.210
emerged to light the torch.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.450
- It was the same for me.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.960
I mean we did not know we didn't
know our whole family didn't

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.190
know they kept such a secret.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.870
You know it is-- if
you tell one person,

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.635
it might get to the other.

00:38:13.635 --> 00:38:14.510
Our family is so big.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.310
So we didn't even know.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.540
So for me, I was
so proud of my dad,

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.030
and it just really
brought tears to my eyes.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.200
- And you were-- you
were not in the stands.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:24.860
- I was not there.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.520
I wasn't there.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.140
I was watching on television.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:32.025
And I didn't know, so luckily
I saw it and caught it.

00:38:32.025 --> 00:38:33.400
Sometimes you miss
those moments.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.240
- How funny would
that have been?

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.281
Someone calls you, say,
hey were you watching TV?

00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:37.340
No.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.830
- Yeah, so that's me.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:42.135
I'm that person that
would miss something.

00:38:42.135 --> 00:38:43.760
It really just brought
tears to my eyes

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.730
because my father's never
hid the fact that he's sick.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.240
He said that boxing was
going to be his platform

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.360
to do his humanitarian
work, and we already

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.281
know that he had an ego,
and he was conceited,

00:38:56.281 --> 00:38:58.280
and he had a lot of pride,
and all those things,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.730
but not so much that he
wouldn't get out and be

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.194
a symbol for other
people who had illnesses.

00:39:05.194 --> 00:39:07.610
And he was still standing there
strong, even with his hand

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.280
shaking, and so I was
just proud of him.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.570
Because he's such a sweetie pie.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.210
That's the first thing I think
of when I think about my father

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.810
outside of just who he is
as a man, as an athlete,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.660
is just how sweet and
gentle he is as a person.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.280
So it just brought
tears to my eyes.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.867
I don't really have a big
story other than that.

00:39:27.867 --> 00:39:28.700
- That's a good one.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.658
That's one of the best.

00:39:29.658 --> 00:39:32.780
And will be, of course, iconic,
and the video is iconic,

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.610
and we saw it, of course, so
often when he passed away.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.841
And, of course, our condolences
to you and your family on that.

00:39:39.841 --> 00:39:41.090
Should we start the questions?

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:41.640
You want to do that?

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.140
- Why not?

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.710
Sure.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.640
- We've got--

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.150
I believe we've got the
microphone here in the middle.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.829
We'd love to hear your
questions and fire away.

00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:52.370
Why don't you tell us who you
are and then ask your question.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.910
Thank you.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:53.410
- Sure.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:56.060
Hi, I'm Sammy Nagy Chao,
I'm a master's student

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.580
at the Harvard Graduate
School of Education,

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:02.150
and I have a real interest
in developing positive body

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:07.350
images in my students, whether
I'm coaching them or teaching.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.290
So I just wanted
to get any thoughts

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.900
that you have on
developing positive body

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.960
images in all genders,
and especially

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:20.690
challenging a lot of ascetic
sports ideal body images.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:26.150
- Well, for me I don't
have the ideal body

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.570
you would think as far as a
lot of women are concerned,

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:30.260
in general.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.057
Because I'm a big girl.

00:40:32.057 --> 00:40:34.640
A lot of times we're concerned
about our weight, and our size,

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.181
and all that.

00:40:35.181 --> 00:40:37.310
I weighed 168 pounds
when I was fighting.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:40.130
I weigh 190 pounds right now.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.890
So that's the first thing a
lot of people are surprised at.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:45.800
And I have no problem
saying it, because that's

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.850
one thing that I do.

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.770
I talk about it
openly just for people

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.103
to see that it doesn't really
matter how much you weigh.

00:40:51.103 --> 00:40:53.390
It's really about how you feel.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.210
And I try to focus
more on being healthy,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.592
opposed to being
a certain size--

00:40:59.592 --> 00:41:02.870
with eating right,
with working out

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.330
comes the benefit
of looking good.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.730
So when you focus on that
then everything else kind of

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:08.720
falls into place.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.261
And I think it really
just comes down

00:41:10.261 --> 00:41:14.110
to understanding that we're
all special, we're all unique,

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.195
and that God created us
exactly the way that we're

00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:16.820
supposed to be.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.319
That's the first
foundation that you

00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:20.474
have to have, and
stop looking at others

00:41:20.474 --> 00:41:21.890
and wishing you
had what they had.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:23.467
Because nobody's perfect.

00:41:23.467 --> 00:41:26.050
A lot of people may look at me,
and think, oh, you're so this,

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.900
you're so that.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.525
I can tell you, look, there are
things that if I could change--

00:41:29.525 --> 00:41:32.150
the fact that I
wear size 12 shoe--

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.140
that right there,
I don't really care

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.320
that my feet are a size
12, the problem with it

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.200
is it's hard to find shoes.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.207
So I have to order shoes
online, and I'm, ah.

00:41:42.207 --> 00:41:43.040
So that's the thing.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.440
But it's not because it's,
like, I'm embarrassed

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.440
because my feet are big.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.250
They fit my body.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.660
You know, and when
I was younger,

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.160
I was like, why are
my hands so big?

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.390
I got big hands.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.670
You know, and it's hard
for me to find jewelry.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.503
But then when I started
knocking people out,

00:41:54.503 --> 00:41:55.477
I was like, thank you.

00:41:59.293 --> 00:42:02.240
That's why.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.410
Like I said, it's
just everything

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:07.650
is a way that is for a reason.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.050
But, again, I don't have
the perfect answer for you,

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.950
but I think that
with a lot of girls,

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:15.180
they need to understand
when you see certain images,

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.124
people are airbrushed.

00:42:17.124 --> 00:42:18.540
They're not even
the way they look

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.300
like they are a lot of the
time, but even for that person

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.680
you see in front of your eyes--

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.263
you're like, OK,
she's not airbrushed,

00:42:24.263 --> 00:42:25.530
and she looks perfect to

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.739
You got to just accept what you
have, work with what you have,

00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:31.530
and focus on the things
that are important.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:33.113
And that's just a
message that we just

00:42:33.113 --> 00:42:35.880
have to instill in people
on an ongoing basis.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.070
But for me in my life I
focus on health and wellness

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.620
through nutrition
and working out.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.420
I say build it, don't buy it.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:42.920
Period.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.420
- Thank you.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.750
- How important is Serena
Williams in this conversation?

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.927
Because, again, I think one
of the greatest athletes

00:42:54.927 --> 00:42:57.510
male/female ever in the United
States and the world, but also,

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.090
I think, the greatest female
athlete in any sport--

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.070
if we have to add the
adjective "female" to any

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:03.540
of this conversation.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.050
But, again, the size where
what would have been said--

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.530
and she did deal with a lot--

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:09.030
- Yeah.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.360
- But isn't it great that that
five-year-old, six-year-old,

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.399
7-year-old, girl or boy sees
that as the Sports Person

00:43:16.399 --> 00:43:17.190
of the Year, right?

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.240
Isn't that exactly what
you're talking about?

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:19.440
- Yeah.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.550
And her body is the way
that it is for a reason.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:22.980
Look what she was born to do.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.970
And not that everyone
has to aspire

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.227
to want to be that way or not.

00:43:27.227 --> 00:43:29.310
I would have loved to go
against her because we're

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.780
both big, strong girls.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.980
That's why I said, I'd
have something for them,

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.576
if I would have been
playing tennis--

00:43:34.576 --> 00:43:38.119
I'm just playing.

00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:38.910
I think it's great.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:39.701
I think it's great.

00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:43.650
And I think that I love
her confidence in herself.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:49.250
I love that she's able to be
comfortable in her own skin.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.560
So regardless of what other
people think about her body,

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.800
and that's what's important.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.650
That's what I admire when
I see other women who just

00:43:58.650 --> 00:43:59.882
love themselves regardless.

00:43:59.882 --> 00:44:02.340
But it's hard when you're on
that platform and everybody is

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.150
judging you.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.810
I have people now
say about me, they're

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:05.925
like, listen to her voice.

00:44:05.925 --> 00:44:07.800
She has such a deep
voice, sounds like a man.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.985
Or maybe she took steroids.

00:44:08.985 --> 00:44:11.580
And I'm like, say
that to my face.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.780
No, I'm just joking.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.039
- Well, thank you very much.

00:44:15.039 --> 00:44:15.830
- I'm just playing.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:16.367
Go on.

00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:16.866
- Thank you.

00:44:16.866 --> 00:44:18.110
Thanks for the question.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.310
All right.

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:20.310
- My name is Anne Marie.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.884
I'm a freshman at
Nichols College.

00:44:21.884 --> 00:44:23.550
I was wondering what
was it like for you

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.340
when you realized that you were
a role model to so many people.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.580
Was there a time where you're
like, oh my goodness, there's

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.425
so many people that look at me?

00:44:32.425 --> 00:44:33.300
- I knew-- thank you.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.890
I knew growing up--

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.320
I knew before I started
boxing that I would be a role

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.810
model because just
with my father being

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.870
who he is I understood that.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.944
And I never wanted to
be a public person,

00:44:45.944 --> 00:44:48.360
so that was one of the things
that I had to deal with when

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.770
I decided that I wanted to box.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.170
A lot of just because
I grew up around it.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.064
Some people want to be famous.

00:44:54.064 --> 00:44:55.480
They're like, I
want to be famous,

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.730
I want people to recognize me.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.070
I really don't like
being recognized.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.430
I'm a private person.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.889
I'd rather just not get
any attention, but for me--

00:45:03.889 --> 00:45:05.430
so I had to deal
with it, and I said,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.388
I've got to follow my
heart and do what I love,

00:45:07.388 --> 00:45:10.416
and I wasn't really worried
about the role model side.

00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:11.790
I get asked that
question a lot--

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.650
should athletes be role models?

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.740
You're naturally a role model,
whether you want to be or not,

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.830
but luckily, thank
God, I'm a person

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.970
that I'm going to do what's
right for the sake of doing

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.340
what's right, not because
I have to be a role model.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.230
So it takes a burden
off of me, as well.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.604
I don't have to
worry about that.

00:45:29.604 --> 00:45:31.500
But, like I said, I do
make certain decisions

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.750
based on the fact that I
know people look up to me,

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.580
and I always remember
myself seeing

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.050
women's boxing
for the first time

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.580
and how that changed my life.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.800
You know, so someone might
see me for the first time,

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.160
and it might encourage them
to do something in their life.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.017
So that's pretty much it.

00:45:47.017 --> 00:45:48.600
It's been really
natural for me, and I

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.419
think that it's not
the same for everyone.

00:45:50.419 --> 00:45:51.960
Because some people
say, I don't want

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.870
to be a role model to your kids
just because I'm a basketball

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.220
player.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.020
But that's just not
the way that it is.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.640
You are a role
model, regardless.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.210
- Thank you.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.418
- Did I answer your question?

00:46:01.418 --> 00:46:02.640
- That somebody--

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.400
Charles Barkley-- has admitted
that he is, in fact, a role

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:06.900
model.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.010
- Oh, good.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.919
- We had to hold him down
and tickle him, but he did.

00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:13.210
I like that you mentioned that.

00:46:15.737 --> 00:46:16.320
Next question.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.852
- How are you guys today.

00:46:17.852 --> 00:46:19.810
My name is Mike, I'm
better known as president.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.630
I'm a 2008 a graduate
of the college,

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.290
and I study government here.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:24.870
And these days
artist, entrepreneur,

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.330
and recently launched
a diverse ventures fund

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.670
to invest in women and
minority led businesses

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.290
in marginalized areas.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.390
My first question would be--

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:37.380
what specific areas of the
economy of the sports world

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.520
do you think would have the
greatest macroeconomic impact--

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.470
and I ask that just watching
Warren Buffett's documentary

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:47.790
where he said that 50% of our
economy-- effectively women--

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.710
are being under utilized
from a macroeconomic stance.

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:53.700
So given that sports is such an
important part of our culture,

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.920
of our doctrine,
where specifically

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.441
can we put capital to
have the greatest impact?

00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:00.190
- Oh brother, that's
just too deep for me.

00:47:02.507 --> 00:47:03.590
- I got a thought for you.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.920
- You just wore me out
with that question.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.750
Back it up.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:07.250
Back it up.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.360
Look, I went to Santa
Monica College, OK?

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.050
I'm just joking.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.930
Did you get all that?

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.180
- Well, I actually I
have an idea for you?

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.130
For you, but did you
have a second part first?

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.820
- My second part was, what
does balance mean to you?

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.630
- What?

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.110
- What does balance mean to you?

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:24.390
- Balance?

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:25.056
- Balance, yeah.

00:47:25.056 --> 00:47:26.690
- I like that question.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.397
- Something for everybody,

00:47:28.397 --> 00:47:28.980
- Come on now.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.479
- She'll take the
second part first.

00:47:30.479 --> 00:47:31.480
Go ahead.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.390
- Balance for me changes
from time to time.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:37.960
But right now,
balance for me is--

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:45.100
I think of myself as a mother
first, a woman, a wife,

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.650
a business woman, an athlete--

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.356
and then I have
my spiritual self

00:47:49.356 --> 00:47:50.980
that I'm thinking
about, so just trying

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.310
to balance all of those things.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:56.470
So for me, it's just about being
the best mom that I can be.

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.900
Being the best
businesswoman I can be.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.720
Doing everything-- I
have this thing about I

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.900
want to be a super
woman, but a lot of times

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.830
you fall short in certain areas.

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.230
So for me, it's really about
keeping my priorities in order,

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:15.730
really being consistent
about having a clear idea--

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.410
like every day, I
wake up and it's

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.520
like, these are my
goals for the day.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.850
My long term, my short
term goals, and then

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:23.560
really checking
myself and making sure

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.650
that I stay on top of that,
because otherwise life happens.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.440
People are pulling you
from every which direction,

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.600
and for me it's like
opportunities come up

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:36.520
where we want to give back as
an athlete, as a public person,

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.220
but then sometimes you get
so caught up giving back,

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.410
that you don't focus on
your own personal goals.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.710
So for me like I
said balance really

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:49.540
is about just being consistent
and staying on top by writing

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.880
things down you know I have
affirmations that I say.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.730
I meditate.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.910
I have my short term
and long term goals,

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:58.414
and just kind of checking in
with that every single day.

00:48:58.414 --> 00:48:59.830
But as far as that
other question?

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:00.400
- Well, OK.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.170
But here, I've got an idea.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.970
I've got an idea.

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:06.230
When you said the part about--

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:07.340
- He's just so tickled.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.415
I like watching you.

00:49:08.415 --> 00:49:10.370
You're so tickled.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:13.390
- You were talking about the
under utilization of women,

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.810
and women as a power--
or economic force.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:17.500
- Exactly.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.270
- And so women's sports.

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.190
And one of the thoughts I have--

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:24.010
and maybe play off this or not--

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:27.040
is so when you see
all these shows,

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.830
and maybe it is even women
who are scantily clad,

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.990
which obviously I do
a lot of mentoring,

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:35.140
and I really try to encourage
people to have longevity, which

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.920
means if you're 25, can they
replace you with a 30-year-old?

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.880
But if you rely on your
brains and your talent,

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.970
you'll hopefully be doing
this into your 40s and 50s.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.070
So there's that piece of it.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.384
But if it's like ESPN--

00:49:51.384 --> 00:49:53.050
not to pick on ESPN
at all, because they

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.250
have a ton of women on air--

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:58.870
but playing to the frat house
be it in hiring practices

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.190
or just what they're doing--

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:03.880
aren't they missing this
incredible demographic

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.270
of the 12-year-old girl on
the couch watching sports

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.820
with her mom or dad
or her siblings.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.090
That 12-year-old girl-- again,
you can see my brain is always

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.180
moving ahead in
terms of the future--

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.640
12-year-old girl when she's
32 and making all the buying

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.420
decisions for the house whether
it's single person or married

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:27.130
or whatever-- and that, I think,
is where the mainstream sports

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.590
media has fallen terribly.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:33.200
Not realizing that the frat
house is going to buy the beer,

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.290
but that 12-year-old
girl is going

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:37.540
to be a consumer of sports
for the rest of her life

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.498
because she's played
sports like your daughter,

00:50:39.498 --> 00:50:42.171
like you, like I did, even, back
in the days of Rutherford B.

00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:42.670
Hayes.

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:49.360
But that she will be not only
loving sports but a consumer.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.610
And I know this is a huge
tenant of the Women's Sports

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:52.589
Foundation, is it not?

00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:53.130
- Definitely.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:59.446
I think we just need to see more
women over all areas of media

00:50:59.446 --> 00:51:00.070
and television.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:03.130
I co-host a show
called We Need to talk.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:05.260
It's and all-female
sports commentary show.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.460
And I work with so many talented
women, journalists, and also

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.114
other athletes.

00:51:10.114 --> 00:51:11.530
And it's just like
any other show.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:11.920
- Great show.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.510
If you haven't seen it,
Leslie Visser, of course,

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:14.343
dear friend of mind.

00:51:14.343 --> 00:51:15.330
- Oh, yeah, right.

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.304
- It's CBS Sports Network.

00:51:18.304 --> 00:51:20.470
- CBS Sports Network and
its called We Need to Talk,

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.930
but that's the type of
show that I want to see.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.750
And we have a female
producer, and director,

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.910
and it's always a great show.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.400
So I think that has been a
start it has been wonderful,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.360
and it's been getting a
lot of positive feedback.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.740
But I think that just
infusing more women

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.850
into every area of
every thing is always

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:40.851
going to make it better.

00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:42.349
- Well, and Billie
Jean King, again,

00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:44.260
who we've mentioned
before has always said,

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.240
we've got to have women
making the decisions

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.060
at the top of these companies
and the top of these networks

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.060
so that then they're
hiring more women,

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.840
and it all starts
to balance out.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.610
So that's our answer.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:55.360
That's all we got.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:55.960
- Thank you guys.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.740
Thank you so much.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.030
And I just wanted to add.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:59.280
I didn't know too
much about my dad.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.529
He passed when I was growing
up when I was very young,

00:52:01.529 --> 00:52:03.738
but I was watching Facing
Ali and I saw him in there,

00:52:03.738 --> 00:52:05.820
and I saw that he was on
security with our father,

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.430
and I found a lot
of my purpose in it.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:09.920
So thank you for being here,
just allowing me to even heal

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.330
and grow into a better person
just in this whole interaction.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.580
I appreciate you guys so much.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:15.075
Thank you.

00:52:15.075 --> 00:52:15.575
- Wow.

00:52:15.575 --> 00:52:16.526
That's a great story.

00:52:16.526 --> 00:52:18.916
- That's a small world.

00:52:18.916 --> 00:52:20.350
That's really cool.

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:21.306
- That's cool.

00:52:21.306 --> 00:52:23.220
Thank you.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.890
- Hi I'm [? Paren ?]
Grayson, and I'm a graduate

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:27.780
of Radcliffe College.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.330
And when I was here, I had the
chance to hear your father.

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:34.230
He came to speak, and he was
brilliant-- read his poetry,

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:37.220
and it's a very special memory.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.310
But I had a question.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:42.210
I would be fascinated to
hear what was involved

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:45.150
in training to become a boxer.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:46.260
Because I have--

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.130
- Yes.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.020
- Very little idea.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.830
- Yes, I'll tell you.

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:52.410
So before I started
boxing-- like I said,

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:53.330
I didn't play sports.

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:55.020
I wasn't in shape at all.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.229
I was like any other person--

00:52:56.229 --> 00:52:57.603
I shouldn't say
any other person,

00:52:57.603 --> 00:52:59.130
but I was like most young kids.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.300
I ate what I wanted to eat.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.091
I didn't have a gym
membership or anything.

00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:05.550
At that time I was
about 17 and 1/2.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.504
So I went down to the boxing
gym, got with a trainer,

00:53:08.504 --> 00:53:10.920
and they say, well, you've got
to come to the gym six days

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.570
a week.

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.280
And what I would do
when I got to the gym

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.070
is I would hit the heavy bag.

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:19.320
You know what a heavy bag is?

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.570
I would hit the speed bag.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:24.390
There's a double in bag
to work on your eyes,

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:26.644
jump roping, then, of
course, do your sit ups

00:53:26.644 --> 00:53:28.060
and you do all
that kind of stuff.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.518
And then you work
with your trainer

00:53:29.518 --> 00:53:30.990
on your footwork in the ring.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:33.790
Every fighter is different, I'll
say, but those are the basics.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:35.670
And you really have
to take the time

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.610
to assess what your
strengths are as a fighter.

00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.010
So naturally, if you're tall,
and you have a long reach,

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.320
you're going to work on
keeping somebody on the outside

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.450
because you can hit them,
but they can't hit you.

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.160
They have shorter arms.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.800
But that's not as
easy as it sounds.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.517
And then for me, I
had to start running.

00:53:54.517 --> 00:53:55.350
Because I never ran.

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.225
And you have to do your
roadwork as a fighter

00:53:57.225 --> 00:53:59.760
because boxing is one of
the hardest sports when

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.240
it comes to endurance because,
again, you might be getting

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.051
beat up, and you still
have to keep going

00:54:06.051 --> 00:54:08.550
and that takes a lot of strength
in a lot of different areas

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:11.070
of your body, not only mentally,
but physically, as well.

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:14.340
So learning how to run
I think was probably

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.780
one of the things I
was most proud of.

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:18.840
- How far would you run?

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.640
- I started off walking running.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.590
And it's funny because my
mom has always been very fit.

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.600
And she taught me how to run.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.430
So we went out and
we ran and she said,

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.526
OK, we're going to
run for a minute,

00:54:31.526 --> 00:54:33.400
and then we're going to
walk for two minutes.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.250
We're going to run for a minute,
and I kind of worked my way up.

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:36.390
And that's what
I tell people now

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:37.530
they say they don't
know how to run.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:38.940
I didn't know how
to run, either.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:39.981
So I had to teach myself.

00:54:39.981 --> 00:54:42.270
And then I worked my
way up to four miles,

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.490
because depending on
how many rounds you're

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.800
fighting, when you
first start fighting,

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.170
your first fight
would be four rounds.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.720
So for me, running
for miles was enough.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.220
Some fighters might say
they'll run eight miles,

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.830
but you don't really need to .

00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.067
depending on what your
style of fighting is.

00:54:58.067 --> 00:54:58.650
But that's it.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.660
And then just every day
doing that back to back,

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.750
working your way up--
a lot of shadowboxing.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:05.559
Just being in the
mirror, pretending

00:55:05.559 --> 00:55:07.350
there's someone in
front of you and they're

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:08.430
throwing a certain
shot and you're

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:09.850
getting out of the way of it.

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:11.720
And then eventually
you start sparring,

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.470
which is when you
actually get in the ring

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:16.050
and box with other fighters.

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.015
So that's always an
interesting experience

00:55:18.015 --> 00:55:20.306
to start doing that because
you're going to get beat up

00:55:20.306 --> 00:55:23.340
a little bit the first time.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.820
And I only boxed with
men, for the most part.

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:29.030
When I first started boxing,
I boxed with some women,

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:30.571
but it was hard to
find-- it's harder

00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:32.917
to find girls who are tall
enough and weigh enough,

00:55:32.917 --> 00:55:34.500
because boxing is
all by weight class,

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.210
and if you box
with a man, you've

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:37.695
got to find a man
who is lighter,

00:55:37.695 --> 00:55:39.570
and who knows how to
work with you, who's not

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:41.653
going to be hitting you
as hard as he possibly can

00:55:41.653 --> 00:55:44.670
because a man is always going
to be stronger than a woman.

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:47.880
Most men, anyway.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:52.154
I've had some that weren't,
but anyway, it was fun.

00:55:52.154 --> 00:55:53.070
That's pretty much it.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.050
But you have to
understand the pain

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.170
that your body goes through--

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.255
I'm not talking about being
hit, just the next day

00:56:00.255 --> 00:56:01.380
is when you really feel it.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.617
When you're sore from
being hit, and then

00:56:04.617 --> 00:56:06.450
you have to get in there
and do it again day

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:08.390
after day after day.

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:09.540
It's really a mental--

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.112
you have to be strong
mentally, as well,

00:56:12.112 --> 00:56:14.070
to get in there because
if you are getting hit,

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.903
and you keep getting
hit with the same shot,

00:56:15.903 --> 00:56:18.990
and you're in the round, and
you can't figure out why.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:20.880
I'd get so mad sometimes
I would just cry.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.680
I wouldn't like--
but I'd have tears

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.470
because I'd be so mad
trying to figure out

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:27.587
what I was doing wrong.

00:56:27.587 --> 00:56:28.920
But I would still keep fighting.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.045
I'd be crying and fighting.

00:56:30.045 --> 00:56:33.040
People thought I was crazy
lots of times in the gym.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.040
I may be crying, but I'm
going to keep fighting.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:39.630
So yeah, but it was a
grueling workout, definitely.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:40.130
Thank you.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.520
- Thanks, [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.040
- Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE] from the
Ecole Polytechnique in Paris.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.630
And thank you very
much for coming.

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:52.260
What would be the most
inspirational quote

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.590
from your father you
will always remember?

00:56:55.590 --> 00:57:00.210
- I think, and I'm
going to paraphrase it.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:04.620
Service on earth
is the rent that I

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:07.800
pay for my space in heaven.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.200
So basically, the service
that he's doing now,

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.400
he felt like was
his way into heaven.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.200
And he believed
that, by the way,

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.640
which was interesting to me.

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.370
Because my father was always--

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.280
he believed that you've got
to do more good than you

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.872
do bad to make it to heaven.

00:57:25.872 --> 00:57:28.080
I'm just thinking, wow, this
man who has done so much

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.200
and changed the world, and
inspired so many lives feels

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.270
like he still has
more good to do,

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:36.000
as far as in terms of
making it to heaven.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.560
But he really was all about just
giving back to other people,

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.895
and he loved people.

00:57:42.895 --> 00:57:44.520
I've seen my father
just over the years

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.630
get what you would think
taken advantage of by people,

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:49.422
but he didn't care.

00:57:49.422 --> 00:57:51.838
Because if someone stole from
him or something, he's like,

00:57:51.838 --> 00:57:53.730
well he must have needed
it more than I did.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:57.111
And I'm just like,
that's not how I think.

00:57:57.111 --> 00:57:59.010
So we're very
different in that way.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.920
But my father is just such
a giving, loving person,

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.960
and I grew up watching
my father cry.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.150
I watched that,
and that, for me,

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.790
made a big difference in
who I was as an individual

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:12.000
because seeing a man
as strong as Muhammad

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.190
Ali in those moments
when he's crying--

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:17.950
not because he felt bad,
but just even out of joy

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:18.931
or because he was sad.

00:58:18.931 --> 00:58:20.430
And he was very
sensitive and wasn't

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.880
afraid to show his feelings.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.330
So that when I said he
was a male chauvinist

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.940
in a certain way not
in that way, though,

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:29.784
so that was something that I
really loved and appreciated

00:58:29.784 --> 00:58:30.450
about my father.

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:33.090
So yes, it was all
about service to others.

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.170
And he has a quote--

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:35.629
we got to look up
that exact quote.

00:58:35.629 --> 00:58:37.045
- Maybe someone's
got their phone.

00:58:37.045 --> 00:58:37.590
- OK.

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:38.089
- Thank you.

00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.760
- Thank you.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.100
- And I was thinking off of
that question-- you know,

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:45.100
your dad is so associated
with Howard Cosell,

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.790
and Howard Cosell has
been gone for a long time,

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:51.020
but I'm curious, have you ever
dealt with the Cosell family?

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.590
You probably never
met Howard Cosell.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:53.089
- No.

00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:54.780
- But all those interviews--

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.000
you guys remember those?

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.520
And, I'm so pretty, and
all that back and forth.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.950
I mean, your dad
obviously would have

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:03.620
been your dad without
Howard Cosell,

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.390
but I think Howard
Cosell brought out--

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:08.921
- They had a fun relationship
for sure, the two of them

00:59:08.921 --> 00:59:09.420
together.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.753
- And there's some great
comments from those interviews,

00:59:11.753 --> 00:59:14.100
too, if you want to
look them up, for sure.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:14.910
Next question.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:17.361
- Hi my name is Ariel, and
I'm a senior at the college.

00:59:17.361 --> 00:59:19.860
And I was just wondering-- this
is kind of for both of you--

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.870
how have you learned
from your identity

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:25.650
being an athlete and the
things through practicing sport

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:27.870
for your whole life
onto your career,

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.240
and how has that shaped the
person that you are today,

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.580
and the professional
decisions you've made?

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:36.300
- For me, boxing
changed my life,

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:39.064
because there's lots of moments
where you really have to--

00:59:39.064 --> 00:59:40.980
just being an athlete,
you've got to dig deep,

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.979
and that's when you really
find out who you are.

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:45.780
And naturally, as human beings,
we put limits on ourselves.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.400
We think, oh, we
can't go any further.

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.870
I can't push any harder.

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:51.330
And then you're in a situation
where you have to do it,

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:53.127
and you're like, oh, I did it.

00:59:53.127 --> 00:59:55.710
And I remember that moment when
I thought that I couldn't, and

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.126
then I remember that moment
when I found out that I could,

00:59:58.126 --> 01:00:01.640
and then now I can apply that
to everything else in my life.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.990
And any time that I just
think, this is too hard,

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.040
I'm not going to
be able to do it.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.850
I'm like, what are
you talking about?

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:06.960
Yes, you can.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.310
So that alone in itself is just
that confidence that I have

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:12.670
that I've proven to myself.

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:15.090
If I've proven to
myself one time,

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:19.200
that means I can prove it to
myself a million more times.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.410
So that is just the
most basic thing

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.410
I can tell you about
how being an athlete

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:28.939
has just changed my life in
the way that I look at things.

01:00:28.939 --> 01:00:31.230
It doesn't mean that you're
not going to have failures.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.396
It doesn't mean that things
aren't going to be hard,

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.814
but just having the
confidence and the self-belief

01:00:35.814 --> 01:00:37.230
to know that I can
pretty much get

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.970
through just about anything.

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:40.960
And I think that
that is so important.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.570
People need confidence
more than ever.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.340
So many people have
good ideas and things

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.465
that they want to do, but
the fear holds them back.

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:53.754
Like I said, I can't speak
to how sports really--

01:00:53.754 --> 01:00:55.920
I mean, the women that I
know that are athletes just

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.517
have this level of confidence.

01:00:57.517 --> 01:00:58.350
You can just see it.

01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:58.920
You can fill it.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.586
You can hear it.

01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:01.914
And they can apply it.

01:01:01.914 --> 01:01:03.330
- Well, and you
think about this--

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:07.350
for generations in this country,
we were not allowing 50 or 51%

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:09.630
of our population to
learn these life lessons.

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.610
What were we thinking?

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:13.980
Again, Title IX, signed by
Richard Nixon, of all people,

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.950
in June of 1972.

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:19.620
- But I graduated from high
school in '76, so I was

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:23.490
starting high school in '72,
and so I really saw almost none

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:24.060
of it.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.686
Grew up in the suburbs
of Toledo, Ohio,

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:27.560
and I was a six-sport
athlete in high school.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.400
And now you think, oh
she's a great athlete.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.210
No.

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:33.600
I was good enough, and I'm
tall, and so I was able to play,

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.860
and I was coordinated.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.870
But no one cared
about girls sports.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:40.170
Even my dad, who was my own
personal Title IX playing

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:42.850
baseball with me when
I was growing up.

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:44.730
But no one cared enough
about girls sports

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:46.510
to want us to specialize.

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.130
So I literally ran from first
doubles on the tennis court,

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:52.980
to the field hockey match where
I was the captain of the team,

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.120
and then basketball
and volleyball

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.286
in the winter, and then
softball and track and field

01:01:56.286 --> 01:01:56.970
in the spring.

01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:59.940
- In my high school, 100%
of the kids went to college,

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.400
and every mom and dad
wanted their daughter

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.360
to be a doctor or a lawyer, just
like their son, except sports.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.910
To show how ingrained
this was, no one

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:11.250
even thought that we were
mowing the field hockey

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.190
field while our
opponent was showing up.

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.987
This was a Tuesday, where
the football field--

01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:17.820
what would that be--

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.730
72 hours away was already
in pristine shape.

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:23.110
And yet the field
hockey team was

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:25.390
the one that was sending
kids onto college

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:27.970
and winning Ohio
State championships,

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:29.179
my high school did.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.970
And the football team
has had like two boys

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:35.650
be kickers in college, which is
great, but it was so ingrained.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:37.942
And so for me, in addition
to just the pure love of all

01:02:37.942 --> 01:02:40.274
those sports, and to this day
I play sports and love it,

01:02:40.274 --> 01:02:42.760
and it's just a lifetime thing,
as I'm sure for most of you

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760
in this room.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.650
But I also think, for me, it
has informed every ounce of what

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.720
I do as a journalist
because I know what

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.790
it was like to have
it myself because

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:53.920
of my parents
encouraging it at a time

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.800
when no one else was encouraging
their daughter to play sports.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.670
And so I had that, but
most women my age--

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:03.850
and so to fight for Title
IX, to write those columns,

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:07.390
to ask the questions as I
just did at Augusta National

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:09.340
about Donald Trump and women.

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.352
I will absolutely do that.

01:03:11.352 --> 01:03:12.060
Yeah, look it up.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.870
You might your
computer might explode.

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:21.260
- And I'm going back
tonight to drive them crazy.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.790
But anyway, but bottom line
is that as a journalist having

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.855
seen this incredible
change, it's fantastic.

01:03:26.855 --> 01:03:28.480
And it makes me smile,
and brings tears

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.490
to my eyes to see
what girls have now,

01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:33.010
and how wonderful the change
has been in a blink of an eye

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.080
in our nation's history.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.990
Thank you for your question.

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:39.400
- Hello, my name
is Amanda Ortiz,

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.630
and I'm a student athlete at
University of Massachusetts.

01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:46.420
My question was
regarding the inequality

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.450
of women professional
athletes, and I

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:53.560
guess regarding basketball
and soccer, relatively.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.720
Your thoughts and personal
experiences on that.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.730
- I don't have any personal
experience with it.

01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:04.840
I know that the Women's Sports
Foundation does a lot of work

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.480
with collegiate sports
and trying to make sure

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.560
that the playing field
is leveled as far as just

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.990
dollars that are
allocated to the girls

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:18.891
so that we have the same amount
opportunities as the boys'

01:04:18.891 --> 01:04:19.390
teams do.

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:20.590
Do you have anything?

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:25.540
- Yeah, and think we can
declare victory with Title IX

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.126
because of the participation
piece of it where literally

01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:31.000
if a girl-- if you see
a girl in the airport,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.335
what sport do you play?

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:35.080
You never would have asked
that question 40 years ago.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.120
So we've done so
many good things.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.890
Obviously the
under-served areas,

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.120
and women coaching women
is where we're really--

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.890
and Mary Jo Kane has done a lot
on this, and the Tucker Center,

01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:46.840
you guys do amazing work.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.872
So there's a lot
to go on that side.

01:04:48.872 --> 01:04:49.580
So it's not all--

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:51.950
I said declare victory
because I want to be positive,

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:53.200
but there's a lot to do there.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.630
The professional
side-- in some ways,

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:59.650
of course, that's business, and
if people want to pay for it.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:02.320
So while I think the WNBA
is great and, for example,

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.870
in DC where Elena Delle Donne
has now come to Washington,

01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:07.480
that is going to be a very
big deal in Washington.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.730
And the Mystics
will do very well.

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:12.330
But the Wizards are so
entrenched, of course,

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.080
they're not going to
overtake the Wizards.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.570
That would be
ridiculous to say that.

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:18.280
And that's OK.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.124
I think my-- and we
want to make sure--

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:21.040
we have a few minutes.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.837
Want to make sure to get to
as many questions as possible.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.670
Books are written on
this topic, and Mary Jo

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:27.430
would be a great one
to talk to, but I

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:32.380
do think that we judge women's
sports by the male model.

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.960
And if you listen to shock
jock screaming radio, like,

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.000
oh WNBA isn't any good and
whatever-- well, you know what?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.200
Could we start baseball today
if there was no baseball?

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.130
Of course not.

01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:44.785
A sport that never existed
and now corporations

01:05:44.785 --> 01:05:46.660
are going to build
stadiums to have baseball?

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.290
No.

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:50.170
So the bottom line
is women's sports

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.980
are coming into a chock
full calendar of sports,

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.410
and I think they're doing great.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.450
And in 100 years,
we'll be equal?

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:01.534
Probably not, but maybe.

01:06:01.534 --> 01:06:03.200
But there's also
things like gymnastics,

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.150
where the women are the stars.

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:05.858
Figure skating where
women are the stars.

01:06:05.858 --> 01:06:08.680
Soccer where our women's
team is certainly much more

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.840
successful than our men's team.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.892
On and on it goes.

01:06:11.892 --> 01:06:13.850
And I think, again, you
look for those moments,

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.182
but there's a lot on
that topic and feel free

01:06:16.182 --> 01:06:18.140
to shoot me an email if
you want at my website.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.750
I'm happy to discuss
it further with you.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:20.250
- Thank you.

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:21.590
- Thank you.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:24.790
- I am Sharon Turbin,
I'm a sports psychologist

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:29.020
in the area, and I could go
off in 10 different directions

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.780
on some things that
you've said, Laila.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:36.520
One is that you were a
late initiator in terms

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.860
of becoming an athlete
in your own mind,

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.560
and I think there is an
upside to that, which

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.480
is you weren't
necessarily shaped

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.160
by that male model,
which you just described.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:53.020
And as women internalize the
values of sport that are still

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.250
getting communicated
primarily by male coaching,

01:06:56.250 --> 01:07:01.480
there is a humanity about you,
and the fact that you started

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:06.310
later, you already had command
of lots of parts of yourself.

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.570
And I think doing some--
you are a role model,

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:13.240
so modeling that
initiation as an athlete

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.610
can occur all
through the lifecycle

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.060
is actually a pretty
big statement.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:23.020
I worked with a power
lifter who started at 50

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:27.820
and competed at
the national level.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.620
Not age weighted.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:33.280
Like, she competed full
strength at 50 years old.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.730
It's pretty compelling for
people later in the life cycle

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:39.280
to have models of
later initiation

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.010
and not to be necessarily
apologetic about not having

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:44.980
been an athlete in the
developmental years,

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:48.430
and all of the upside
that that kids do get

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.770
from being in the sports world.

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:56.020
And then my other
question to you is do you

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.460
speak to those groups--

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.820
to women who potentially
haven't necessarily

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.610
identified as an
athlete, but are looking

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:05.730
for ways to do that
sort of midlife,

01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:08.410
or throughout the life cycle?

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:10.530
- I haven't up until this point.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:12.530
No one's ever
asked me to either,

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:17.540
but I think that for me
being that boxing is just

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.450
so different than
other sports, I

01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:25.580
was able to get into it late
because of the level of women's

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.659
boxing, or just
boxing in general.

01:08:27.659 --> 01:08:28.700
It's one of those sports.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.450
It's not organized.

01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:30.890
Anyone can be like,
I want to be a boxer,

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:32.240
any would can say I
want to be a promoter.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.790
And I don't really like the
business side of boxing,

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:36.950
but I always want to
put that in perspective,

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.491
because I can't-- like now, I
wouldn't have been able to just

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:40.790
get in and just start playing.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.700
I could, but I'm saying
like tennis or something

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.110
like that because people
have-- their skill level

01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:49.443
is so much greater because
they started sooner.

01:08:49.443 --> 01:08:51.109
So I wouldn't have
been able to do that.

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:53.600
And that's why I, like I
said, that I regret it.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.260
I'm not one of those people
who wants to go back and go,

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.318
I don't care if
I'm 40, I'm going

01:08:56.318 --> 01:08:57.800
to start playing tennis now.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.420
You know, I'm just
like, I'm good.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.740
So I'm good, next lifetime.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.109
I'm all for people who want
to do that, though, but you

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.859
definitely have to be
passionate about it,

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:09.025
and you have to be prepared.

01:09:09.025 --> 01:09:11.060
I have other goals
and dreams that I

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.560
want to attain
because people ask

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.680
me now do I want to come
back and train fighters.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.430
Do I want to come back
and promote fights.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.080
I'm like, that's
not my interest.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.496
And that's not
something I'm going

01:09:19.496 --> 01:09:21.950
to apologize for either,
because the women's boxing

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:23.540
community says,
well why don't you

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.250
come back and do
more for us, and I'm

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:27.979
like, that's not my passion.

01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:30.185
I have a passion
to really encourage

01:09:30.185 --> 01:09:32.810
people to be the best that they
can be in life, whether they're

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:33.859
an athlete or not.

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:36.950
I'm not going to just limit
myself to just boxing.

01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:38.840
If I can just help and
come in and get out--

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.673
get in and get out--

01:09:39.673 --> 01:09:41.520
I can, but to answer
your question,

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.770
I would be open to doing that.

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:44.150
Any time that I
can say something

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.399
that can help somebody else,
that's what I want to do.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:49.040
As far as what I'm
going to make my focus,

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.109
that comes down to
what's in my heart,

01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:53.600
but definitely--
if you're asking me

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.340
if I'd be interested to speak,
then yes, I would, definitely.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.180
So, thank you.

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.040
- Thank you, and you know what?

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.281
We're going to do--

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:03.530
we're going to go to overtime.

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:05.670
We are we're
actually out of time,

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:07.880
but we're going to do a
lightning round where we're

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.140
going to do like literally 30.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.360
Seconds can you guys do that?

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:10.790
- Yes.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.990
- OK.

01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.090
You're up.

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:12.309
- I'm Diane Rosenfeld.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.850
I teach at the law school and
run the Gender Violence Program

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:16.100
there.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.360
And thank you for coming.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.430
And I wanted to bring
your dad into the room.

01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:24.065
I had the honor of
meeting him in '94.

01:10:24.065 --> 01:10:25.100
- Can you bring it up.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.750
- Yeah, absolutely
I'll bring it up--

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.870
- Oh, after you say
what you're saying.

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:31.910
And what really struck me about
him that is living through you

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.940
is he had so much grace.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.500
And I see that in
you, and thank me

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.643
for all your amazing
work and inspiration.

01:10:39.643 --> 01:10:42.008
- I appreciate that.

01:10:42.008 --> 01:10:45.510
And my very quick question
is I pay a lot of attention

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:49.560
to gender equality in
sports and eliminating

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.480
sexual harassment,
and sexual assault,

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.400
and that angle of
Title IX, and I'm

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.970
wondering what you think
about gender inclusive sports

01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:02.050
as a way to address the
sexism that exists in sports.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:05.140
That if kids grew up
playing with each other,

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.150
and it wasn't like a boys
team and a girls team.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:08.486
- Your kids are now, right?

01:11:08.486 --> 01:11:09.610
- Yeah, I was going to say.

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:13.440
- Your daughter's playing on
your son's Little League team.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.240
- So she plays on my
son's baseball team--

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240
- And we're going to
keep this to 30 seconds.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.280
- Yeah, I know.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.200
So I see on the field--

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.130
my son plays soccer.

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:22.290
I see girl's teams,
which is great.

01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:23.790
And I see some teams
where the girls

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:26.123
are playing with the boys,
and I think that's wonderful.

01:11:26.123 --> 01:11:28.860
I think as long as it's
not a sport where power

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.190
is going to come into play.

01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:31.230
Like a lot of times
people say, would you

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:32.979
ever want to fight a
man, and I'm like no,

01:11:32.979 --> 01:11:33.960
because I want to win.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.469
I'm not going to fight a man--

01:11:36.469 --> 01:11:38.010
not that my skill
level isn't as high

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:40.093
but the thing is I punch
harder than a lot of men,

01:11:40.093 --> 01:11:42.345
but they can take it,
and I start wearing down

01:11:42.345 --> 01:11:43.470
when they start hitting me.

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:44.910
It's just the way that it is.

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:45.810
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:47.059
That's the way God created us.

01:11:47.059 --> 01:11:51.270
So if it's a sport where we
literally can be equal, then

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.840
definitely.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.064
Like Billie Jean King
and her wonderful--

01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:54.980
- Beating Bobby Riggs.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:55.950
- Yeah, she beat him.

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:56.820
And he was a man.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.210
So in some cases, I would say,
no, I don't want to see that.

01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:03.210
But for the most part, I think
it would be great, definitely.

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:03.820
- OK, thanks.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:04.320
- Thank you.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.947
All right.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:06.780
Quick, quick, quick.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.250
Here we go.

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:09.450
- Matt Myerson from Mentor.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.160
And Laila, we had
the opportunity

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:16.440
to record a mentoring a video
together in Los Angeles where

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.590
you had a young girl who was
mentoring you in your journey.

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:23.075
And it was interesting because
my life has been dedicated

01:12:23.075 --> 01:12:25.200
to trying to promote
mentoring, and the idea of you

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:25.866
doing one event.

01:12:25.866 --> 01:12:27.510
- Oh, I'm like,
don't I know you.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.620
- Yes.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.342
- This is your life, Laila Ali.

01:12:32.342 --> 01:12:34.800
- So it's been interesting for
me sitting here and thinking

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.990
how I'm dedicating my life to
trying to encourage more people

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:38.430
to sign up and become mentors.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.200
And you spent an
hour recording a PSA,

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.616
and promoted on your social,
and the impact that that had.

01:12:42.616 --> 01:12:44.610
And would love to
hear from both of you

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:47.190
for a minute in terms of what
you want your legacy to be.

01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:49.650
Both have mentioned
mentoring as something

01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:52.110
that's meaningful to you,
but when people look back

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:54.900
on you in 20 or 30 or
40 years of your life--

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.060
not your boxing life-- but your
personal life and your impact,

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.410
what do you want your legacy
to be for both of you?

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:05.910
- Well I'll go first, because
we want her to close the show.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:08.340
It's a very nice question.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.810
I do more mentoring
than anything

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:12.900
else these days in
writing, talking, anything.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.730
And I've started several
scholarships, including

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.430
in my late parents' names.

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:21.690
About six now each year with
Northwestern, my alma mater,

01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:25.060
in Toledo, and with
the Association

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.930
of Women in Sports Media, our
women's sports media group.

01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:30.870
It is very friendly with the
Women's Sports Foundation.

01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:34.710
And just helping young
people get into sports media,

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:35.940
especially women.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.370
And we have thousands of
women now covering sports

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:40.950
in this country, where we
only had a few when I started.

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:44.370
So it's just hoping
that kids can

01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:47.160
reach their dreams, especially
young girls and women

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:47.910
through sports.

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:51.129
So that's among several
things, but that certainly

01:13:51.129 --> 01:13:52.170
is right up there for me.

01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:53.070
Thank you very much.

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:55.020
And all you.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:55.979
Yes.

01:13:55.979 --> 01:13:56.520
- It's funny.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.100
I haven't really given that
question serious thought.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.374
You might have think I have.

01:14:03.374 --> 01:14:05.040
I feel like I'm right
in the thick of it

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.210
right now, and still figuring
out a lot of things for myself

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:14.100
and about myself, but I
can say that giving back

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.990
is very important to me.

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:18.270
Inspiring others
is important to me.

01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:25.030
I grew up in a very
dysfunctional family.

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:26.510
A lot of people
don't realize that.

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:29.570
When my parents got divorced,
my mom got remarried,

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.750
and I went through a lot.

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:35.680
And a lot of that is what turned
me into the fighter that I am.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.220
So I've learned a lot
about myself along the way.

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:42.610
And I always try to
now just try to let

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:45.540
others know that you never
can judge a book by its cover.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.091
We know that that saying,
and a lot of people

01:14:48.091 --> 01:14:50.590
would assume that I grew up
with a silver spoon in my mouth,

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:51.800
and that wasn't the case.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.900
So I literally had
to fight from a kid,

01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.460
and I'm still fighting now.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.920
Now that I retired from
boxing, and I'm like, OK,

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.210
I need to rebrand myself.

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:03.335
I don't want to just be
the fighter because now I'm

01:15:03.335 --> 01:15:05.650
in this boxing box
of first it was like,

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:08.200
I need to be taken seriously,
and now it's like, oh,

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.840
I want to do TV and cross
over, and I have this fitness

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.660
and wellness brand.

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.660
And sometimes I can seem
intimidating to people,

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:15.260
and I'm like wow.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.740
So it's really about
finding balance

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.180
and I'm always fighting.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.570
But I just want to really
help as many other people

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:26.410
as I can along the way while
still being true to myself.

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:29.110
I don't think that there's
anything wrong with wanting

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:31.060
certain things for yourself.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:35.420
And then figuring out what
God put me on earth for,

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.740
make myself happy,
and do the work

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.470
that I'm here to do, and bring
others along the way with me.

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.720
So I'm never going to just
have all the clear answers.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.315
I'm still figuring things
out, but if I can help others

01:15:46.315 --> 01:15:48.940
with things that I do know, and
things that I have figured out,

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:49.589
then great.

01:15:49.589 --> 01:15:51.130
But I never like to
come from a place

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.630
like, oh, I got it
all figured out.

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:55.000
I'm going to be 40
years old soon--

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.960
December 30.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.120
- Kid you.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.700
- I'm excited about it.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.287
A lot of people are like--

01:16:02.287 --> 01:16:04.120
they worry about getting
older, but I'm just

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.980
happy to be healthy,
and have a family,

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:09.550
and have so many different
opportunities before me.

01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:12.820
And I really do feel like I can
do anything that I want to do,

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.220
it's just a matter of
deciding what I want to do.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.130
And I'm really blessed--

01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:19.480
I know to even just have
that kind of confidence,

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.610
and I know that it came
through my parents.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.630
And it came from
them by example.

01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:25.870
My dad didn't sit down and
have conversations with me

01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:28.720
about how to be confident,
how to believe in myself.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.100
He just believed in himself.

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.390
He was confident in himself.

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:33.822
And the language that we
speak-- the way we speak about

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:35.530
ourselves, the way we
speak about others,

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.020
the conversations that we
have in our household--

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.670
kids learn from watching.

01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.680
So for me, I want to
be there for my kids.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.560
And I want to be that for
anybody else watching me.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.830
Something that I say today
might spark something

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:49.750
in an individual and
change their life.

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.760
So that's all.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.220
don't I can't say--

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.940
I don't have a two sentence
answer for that, but whatever

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.430
you can take from that.

01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.970
That's it.

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:02.110
That's all I can say.

01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:03.610
- How great.

01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:05.110
- I hate to end that way.

01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:06.610
- That was fantastic.

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:07.810
That was good.

01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:09.360
- Thanks.
