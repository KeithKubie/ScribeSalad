00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
Whats up guys

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.920
We are back in the lab again today

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.640
with our homemade vacuum chamber

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.460
You remember we built this in a previous project

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.780
And the whole purpose of this thing

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.200
is to de-gas silicone

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.660
so we don't have air bubbles trapped in our silicone moulds

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.660
the only issue i have with it is that ist made out of a pressure pot

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
and this thing is not see through

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.960
so if were doing cool experiments we wont be able to see them

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.940
so i went down to the super center and picked up some of these glass cookie jars

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.080
and wonder if they  could work as an option aswell

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.820
now this project was inspired by my cousin Tie Moser with the mono loco workshop

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.280
who used one of these glass jars to build a vacuum chamber  on his channel

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.020
and I'll put a link in the description to where you can see that

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.200
now the last thing we want with a vacuum chamber is for it to implode on us right as were doing some work

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
that'll spread glass all over the room or possibly in your face and we don't want that to happen

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.280
so before we actually use these in the real world we need to test them

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.140
and make sure there capable of holding up to the vacuum pressure

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.100
now you probably remember with our pressure pot I made a proto putty seal that can be removed and replaced

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.920
and I also did the same thing with these glass jars as well

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.040
we've got a smaller version that's blue and can be removed

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.900
and then we've got the larger version that's red

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.560
now when these things go onto the acrylic they form an air tight seal

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.140
because these are stretchy rubber gaskets

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.980
so I think they're going to work really well and i cant wait to put them to the test

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.800
now since I know my cousin had a chamber similar to this I'm going to start off with this smaller one

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.000
we're going to put it under vacuum pressure and let is sit for around ten minutes

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.300
while it doing that we're going to set up the cameras and run away

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.360
so if it does implode we're well out of harms way

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.480
just for fun I crunched up a water bottle and put the lid back on so we can put this inside the chamber

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.220
so as we're drawing the vacuum we can see how a crunched up water bottle reacts

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm just using a bit of clay on the bottom to hold the bottle in place

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.560
pretty nice fit

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.640
the exhaust valve needs to be closed

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980
and the intake valve needs to open

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.220
and we're ready to go

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.060
so this actually a pretty good sign guys this vacuum chamber has been running for 5 minutes now

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.940
and I don't notice anything that's concerning

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.920
very cool that our water bottle has fully inflated

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.640
and you'll see here on the gauge the pressure has dropped down about as low as it going to get

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.700
so these very encouraging guys I've got the vacuum pump turned off

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.420
and I've got both of these valves to the closed positions

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.740
so in here we still have a vacuum

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.360
and you can see that because the bottle is still inflated

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.320
now what do you think would happen if i opened the exhaust port so air can get back in

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.160
lets watch the bottle and find out

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.360
I'm going to put my mask back on for safety though

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.960
here we go in 3...2...1

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.200
how awesome is that

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.200
so the small jar worked and honestly, that's what I was expecting

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.900
but this here is the one that makes a little more nervous

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.260
this is a lot more volume we're sucking out

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.240
we just need to close the exhaust valve open the intake valve

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.760
get our safety measures in place and run away

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.320
here we go

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.300
take a little bit longer to get the air out of that one

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.960
probably because it's a bigger jar huh

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.160
so looks like our bottle is fully inflated our gauge is down to twenty-five inches of mercury

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.260
and surprisingly the glass seem to be holding up pretty well

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.500
at this point, i'm still a little nervous to approach it though so let's just give it a few more minutes

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.780
and see if it holds

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.500
okay guy's so this is actually working out very well

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.500
this is holding very nicely and it very encouraging because now we have a big vacuum chamber

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.540
we can use to see very cool experiments happening inside

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.760
the question is though how pressure would it take to set this thing off

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.800
just joking I'm not going to do that in this video but if you guys want to see that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.920
maybe we'll track down a slow motion camera  and do that for a future experiment

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.340
now just because this system hasn't imploded yet doesn't mean it wont

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.960
if there were any hairline fractures any weaknesses

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.800
it might just be a tap or a touch to set the whole thing off

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.360
so I'm going to put my mask back on lets open the safety valve and introduce to air back into the system

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.820
YEAH and check this out

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.840
now the lid comes off... fairly freely

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.600
what do you think would happen to a water bottle that we didn't squish the air out of

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.060
could we get it to explode

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.180
WOW LOOK THE WATERS BOILING

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.940
WOW!

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.720
well i guess it makes sense

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.280
we've lowered the atmospheric pressure in there so much

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.480
that the water has a new boiling point

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.120
let see what happens when we open the valve here

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.700
how cool is that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.980
so it must of sucked air out of the bottle as well

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.740
These bottles won't burst until is get closer to sixty, sixty-five PSI

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.880
so I'm going to pressurize with about fifty PSI

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.800
so when we remove the air the pressure differential should be enough for the plastic to burst

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.600
so we've got our purple bottle pumped up to fifty-five PSI

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.500
and if we remove the atmosphere from the bottle now

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.520
hopefully that will be enough to burst the plastic and give us a nice little explosion

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.600
here we go

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.780
do it... do it

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.220
dude how much pressure can that take

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.440
huh maybe it's not gonna explode

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.040
YESSSS!

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.640
I CANT BELEIVE IT FINALLY WORKED

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.440
so there we go our bottle finally exploded I was actually starting to dought whether that was going to work or not

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.440
we tried that probably six times and every time it would explode in my shop

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.280
DANG IT!

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.920
rather then in the container

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.600
so there must be a very fine line I'm not sure why it would be so difficult

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.660
but that one worked and that's all that matters

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.160
and the other thing it the bottle exploded but the container is still fully intact

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.620
so that kind of alleviates my concern because now we can see it can take a bit of abuse and hold up

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.660
so that's good news

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.940
look at the bottle in there it's completely annihilated

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.280
it's completely destroyed

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.480
I think it's a combination of the pressure inside the bottle with the vacuum forces pulling it out

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.240
it just ripped that bottle to shreds

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.220
man it erupts with such power it shakes the table and you can see the camera shake a little bit

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.380
that's is a lot of power that's very cool

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.400
SO it looks like our vacuum chambers are holding up that's good news

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.200
so there you have it guys the results are in

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.560
apparently,  these glass cookie jars are a viable option for our vacuum chamber

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.940
which is really cool because now we can see inside the chamber as reactions are taking place

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.060
and it doesn't hurt that we got a cool explosion out of the experiment as well

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.000
