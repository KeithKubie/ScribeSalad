00:00:00.638 --> 00:00:03.404
Voiceover: Bitcoin is a
new virtual currency system

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:05.546
that's been gathering a
lot of attention recently,

00:00:05.546 --> 00:00:07.043
and I thought I would
do a series of videos

00:00:07.043 --> 00:00:10.010
where I really dive into
the innards of bitcoin

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.621
and explain how it works in detail,

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:15.768
and my plan for this
first video in this series

00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:18.214
is to describe some of those mechanics

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:19.603
at a high level.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.201
And then what I'll do in subsequent videos

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:24.548
is dive a bit deeper into
all of the underlying aspects

00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:27.340
that I have touched upon
within this first video.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.607
And my hope is that by the
end of this video series,

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:31.955
you'll know not only what a bitcoin is,

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:33.575
but you'll also understand the mechanics

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.872
of how transactions are initiated.

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:38.048
You'll see how verification occurs

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:38.860
for those transactions,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.500
and you'll also learn
what it means for someone

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.126
to really engage in a process

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.882
known as "bitcoin mining",

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:46.462
and that may be a term that you've heard

00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:49.392
if you've had any interest
in bitcoin recently.

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:50.629
I do want to point out, also,

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.507
that the bitcoin scheme
is fairly involved.

00:00:53.507 --> 00:00:56.627
It requires some time to really cover

00:00:56.627 --> 00:00:58.072
all of the relevant details,

00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:00.818
and to me the best way
to really wrap your head

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:02.474
around a scheme like bitcoin

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:04.954
is to really suspend belief for a bit

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:08.248
and get exposed to all of
these relevant details.

00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:10.303
Now, undoubtedly, you'll
have a lot of questions

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.288
along the way,

00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:13.502
but my hope is that by the
end of this video series,

00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:16.265
all of the relevant stones
will have been overturned

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:17.517
and your questions will have been

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:18.909
appropriately answered,

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.240
but it might take some time to get there,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.902
and in part, that's because
I'll try to describe things

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:25.127
in a way that's sensible

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:28.413
and that might involve
leaving some details out

00:01:28.413 --> 00:01:31.216
until I can explain enough
pieces of the scheme

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.718
and then add in those
details in as I go along

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:34.880
so that you're not inundated

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.072
with too many minor points and nuances

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:39.127
along the way,

00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:41.003
but you get a feel for the overall system

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.726
as I go through things.

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:44.962
With that, let me go ahead
and just dive right in.

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:46.371
First of all, I do want to point out

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.737
that bitcoin has been described, really,

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:51.293
as a decentralized currency

00:01:51.293 --> 00:01:54.321
because there's no real
central bank or entity

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:57.794
that's involved in generating
or transacting bitcoins,

00:01:57.794 --> 00:02:00.432
and, in fact, what happens
in the content of a bitcoin

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:02.611
is all the transactions really require

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:04.210
what's known as a peer-to-peer network,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.153
a network of just individual
hosts that essentially

00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:09.672
collectively agree on different aspects

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:14.294
of how the protocol is
implemented and used.

00:02:15.477 --> 00:02:17.400
Bitcoin itself is also
referred to sometimes

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.007
as a cryptocurrency,

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:19.957
and by a cryptocurrency,

00:02:19.957 --> 00:02:22.939
I mean that we use a lot
of cryptographic techniques

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.681
in order to facilitate or to really enable

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:27.307
bitcoin transactions to take place,

00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:28.531
and I'll do separate videos

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:29.887
on some of these techniques,

00:02:29.887 --> 00:02:31.855
but just take it at face value right now,

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:33.122
that it's decentralized

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:35.642
and is a type of cryptocurrency.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:38.221
I also want to point out that
the term "bitcoin" itself

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.897
can in fact be a bit confusing,

00:02:40.897 --> 00:02:42.831
and in many ways, bitcoin transactions

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:46.418
don't really resemble
traditional coin transactions

00:02:46.418 --> 00:02:49.040
so much as they represent really entries

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.954
in some type of a global ledger,

00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:54.654
and by that, I mean let's say you have

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:56.250
a transaction taking place,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.341
and let's say the
transaction is taking place

00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:00.682
within, or among two parties,

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:03.437
and we'll call them Alice and Bob,

00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:04.888
which are traditional names that are used

00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:06.567
in many cryptographic protocols

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:08.965
to describe the parties involved,

00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:12.155
and imagine that Alice wants to transfer,

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:13.722
or really wants to assign,

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:15.763
a certain number of
bitcoins that she possesses

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:17.603
over to Bob,

00:03:17.787 --> 00:03:19.277
and you can think of
this transaction, really,

00:03:19.277 --> 00:03:23.481
as an entry in a ledger of some sort,

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.289
and I also want to point
out before proceeding

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.103
that even though I've used terms

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:29.776
like Alice and Bob,

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.288
what I really mean in
the context of bitcoin

00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:36.469
is not the actual identities
in the physical sense,

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.847
but really that Alice
and Bob are identities

00:03:39.847 --> 00:03:41.176
in the bitcoin system,

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:42.802
and these identities are just,

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:44.805
in actual implementation,

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:46.609
are just collections of numbers

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.003
that do not have to be tied

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:52.631
with Alice and Bob's
real-world identities.

00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:55.887
In that capacity, you can
think of bitcoin at any,

00:03:55.887 --> 00:03:57.392
it really is effectively being,

00:03:57.392 --> 00:03:59.432
of being pseudonyms,

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:00.599
rather than real names,

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.361
and the idea is that
bitcoin really becomes more

00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:03.958
of a pseudonymous protocol,

00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.565
where people are addressed
by their pseudonyms,

00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:08.985
and that provides some level of privacy

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.388
to users that want to transact

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:12.619
using the bitcoin system.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.665
Now, in a transaction
between Alice and Bob,

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:16.849
what Alice will basically do

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.546
is specify a few different numbers.

00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:21.127
She has to specify how many bitcoins

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.594
she wants to allocate to Bob.

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:24.861
Let's say Alice started off
with 50 bitcoins of her own.

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:27.209
She might decide that she wants to give,

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:30.949
let's say, 30 of these
bitcoins over to Bob,

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:33.724
and let's say she wants to have

00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:35.286
some number of bitcoins
returned back to her,

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:36.195
so you have to specify,

00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:37.787
or Alice has to specify, rather,

00:04:37.787 --> 00:04:39.278
how much change she's going to get,

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:40.855
so in this case, let's say
her change is going to be

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:43.036
18 bitcoins for herself,

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:45.461
and then the remaining 2
bitcoins are going to be

00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:47.573
a transaction fee,

00:04:47.573 --> 00:04:50.582
and we'll talk about what
a transaction fee means

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:51.722
a little later,

00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:54.137
and I think I'll also dive
into it in future videos,

00:04:54.137 --> 00:04:56.830
but it's basically an
incentive for other nodes

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.858
in the bitcoin network to help Alice

00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:00.893
in essentially validating
some of the details

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:04.099
of this transaction for Bob.

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:07.236
Now, Alice will take
these transaction details

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:12.111
and apply what's known
as a digital signature

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:13.573
to these transaction details,

00:05:13.573 --> 00:05:14.992
and a digital signature is basically

00:05:14.992 --> 00:05:18.109
the mathematical analog of
a traditional signature.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.498
It really binds Alice's
identity to the details

00:05:21.498 --> 00:05:23.002
of this transaction.

00:05:23.002 --> 00:05:24.495
And by Alice's identity, again,

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.552
I mean her identity
within the bitcoin system,

00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:28.850
and this binding is really done

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.824
in a cryptographically strong way.

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:33.517
Now, the details of this transaction

00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:34.966
once it takes place,

00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:36.818
are going to be broadcast out,

00:05:36.818 --> 00:05:38.726
so Alice is going to take
these transaction details

00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:40.790
and effectively just broadcast them out

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.842
to all the nodes in the
peer-to-peer network

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:47.672
that represent bitcoin nodes.

00:05:47.672 --> 00:05:50.624
Now, Bob, when he receives information

00:05:50.624 --> 00:05:51.719
about this transaction,

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.833
he receives it over the
peer-to-peer network.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.271
He'll probably sandy check

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.621
some part of the transaction.

00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.817
For example, he might
check that the numbers

00:05:58.817 --> 00:05:59.633
work out correctly,

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:02.272
that Alice, let's say,
started off with 50 bitcoins

00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:03.272
and is not trying to transfer

00:06:03.272 --> 00:06:06.365
more than 50 bitcoins to
him, and so on and so forth.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.955
He's going to have some
mathematical assurance

00:06:08.955 --> 00:06:11.428
because of some of the
cryptography involved

00:06:11.428 --> 00:06:13.658
that some of these claims are accurate,

00:06:13.658 --> 00:06:15.915
that Alice, let's say, has the bitcoins

00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:17.836
that she's claimed to possess,

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.129
and that she's expressed an interest

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.309
to assign those bitcoins to him,

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:23.205
but what he won't know yet is whether

00:06:23.205 --> 00:06:26.131
Alice has really tried to
transfer those same bitcoins

00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:28.740
to anyone else over the course of time

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.431
or maybe just prior to that point.

00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.146
the way that we handle that situation,

00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:34.445
and by the way, I should point out

00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:37.436
that this concept of Alice
trying to, let's say,

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:39.142
spend coins twice,

00:06:39.142 --> 00:06:41.304
in the context of digital cash

00:06:41.304 --> 00:06:42.956
and electronic currency systems,

00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:45.856
this concept is known as double spending,

00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:47.598
and it's something you have to worry about

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:49.354
when you have virtual currencies

00:06:49.354 --> 00:06:51.706
because it's very easy
for someone to just copy

00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:53.547
the numbers that
represent this transaction

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:56.547
and try to use them elsewhere.

00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:58.731
The way we basically handle

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:00.946
and reduce the risk of double spending

00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:03.236
is through a specific set of nodes

00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:05.042
in this peer-to-peer network

00:07:05.042 --> 00:07:08.727
who are known as bitcoin miners.

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:10.568
You might have heard
this term bitcoin miners,

00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:12.514
and the bitcoin miners are basically

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:14.770
specific individuals,

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.123
specific nodes within
this peer-to-peer network,

00:07:17.123 --> 00:07:19.132
and what they basically do is they take

00:07:19.132 --> 00:07:21.052
all of the transactions that they see,

00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:21.870
and remember,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.146
they're listening to all
of these transactions,

00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:24.585
and not just Alice and Bob's,

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:26.366
but other transactions
that are taking place,

00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:27.980
and they'll take those transactions,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.752
and ultimately, they will
take those transactions

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.136
and will compile them

00:07:31.136 --> 00:07:34.375
into what's known as a transaction block.

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:35.486
So it's basically a recording

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:39.865
of all the previously
unrecorded transactions.

00:07:40.402 --> 00:07:42.592
If you think of a single transaction

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.082
let's say, as a ledger item,

00:07:44.082 --> 00:07:45.749
you could think of a transaction block

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:47.904
as representing, let's say, an entire page

00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:49.613
in a ledger book.

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:53.655
These bitcoin miners will
also include in this block,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.804
in addition to all these
unrecorded transactions,

00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:57.734
they will also include in this block

00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:01.287
a special transaction that's
meant just for themselves

00:08:01.287 --> 00:08:04.004
to basically reward
themselves for the effort

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.481
of doing this mining.

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.132
Now, a transaction block will also contain

00:08:09.132 --> 00:08:11.905
an encoding of the
previous transaction block,

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:14.153
so there's going to be
some level of continuity,

00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:16.640
and then bitcoin miners will also include

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.060
a specially-crafted sequence of numbers

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.525
associated with these transactions,

00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:23.579
and this sequence of numbers is known

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:26.599
as a proof of work,

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:27.556
and it's called a proof of work

00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:30.053
because it's sometihng that's
really hard to generate,

00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:31.844
something that requires
a lot of effort to do,

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:34.085
and that kind of makes
it hard for just anybody

00:08:34.085 --> 00:08:36.796
to get involved with
bitcoin mining willy-nilly,

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:39.599
but it requires that they
really exhibit or exert

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.649
some computational effort,

00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:45.085
basically in exchange for
getting this extra reward

00:08:45.085 --> 00:08:45.974
of a payment,

00:08:45.974 --> 00:08:47.753
and also in exchange for getting

00:08:47.753 --> 00:08:50.282
this transaction fee that
they're going to be promised

00:08:50.282 --> 00:08:53.685
by Alice to engage in this sort of work.

00:08:54.053 --> 00:08:55.671
I'll talk about what
proof-of-work protocols are

00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:57.851
in a separate video in more detail.

00:08:57.851 --> 00:08:59.548
Now, because each transaction block

00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:03.675
contains information about
previous transactions,

00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:04.893
really what you end up having

00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:06.656
is not just a single block.

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:09.169
You ultimately have what
you can think of as a chain

00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:11.295
of transactions,

00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:15.109
and you can call this a
transaction block chain.

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:17.146
The idea is as soon as a bitcoin miner

00:09:17.146 --> 00:09:19.785
is able to construct a
transaction block chain

00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:21.955
containing all these
unrecorded transactions,

00:09:21.955 --> 00:09:22.999
and this proof of work,

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:26.893
it'll broadcast the
details of that chain out

00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:29.592
to all of the nodes, all of the peers

00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:32.996
on that peer-to-peer network for bitcoin.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:36.643
And then once the newly-broadcast chain

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:39.055
gets kind of verified and
meets the right properties,

00:09:39.055 --> 00:09:40.835
the nodes on the network

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:42.299
are just going to go
ahead and start using it,

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:43.244
and they're going to start appending

00:09:43.244 --> 00:09:46.496
new transaction blocks to that chain.

00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:47.381
They're going to take anything

00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:48.471
that hasn't yet been processed

00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:51.278
and start incorporating it
into the transaction chain

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:54.213
that was broadcast out by the node

00:09:54.213 --> 00:09:57.528
who came up with the
proof of work correctly.

00:09:57.528 --> 00:09:58.807
Now, this transaction block chain,

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.249
really what we're going to be doing

00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:02.250
in the context of bitcoin

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.266
is the nodes are only going to consider

00:10:05.727 --> 00:10:08.024
the transaction block chain that reflects

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.881
the greatest amount of work
to generate its contents,

00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:12.769
and again, there's this proof
of work that I mentioned

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:14.928
that is used to kind of determine

00:10:14.928 --> 00:10:17.713
or identify what the,
what work was involved

00:10:17.713 --> 00:10:20.831
in coming up with the
transaction block chain.

00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:22.929
The one that's the longest
is going to be considered

00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:24.746
sacrosanct within the bitcoin system.

00:10:24.746 --> 00:10:26.970
Future miners are supposed to only work

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.904
off the chain that has
the most work put into it.

00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:32.331
Now, what's remarkable here

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.876
is that the whole
process is decentralized.

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:38.190
There is no bank or no
centrally-trusted entity

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.851
that was actually involved
in the transaction.

00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:42.809
Hopefully this first video gave you

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.772
a bit of description,
a flavor, if you will,

00:10:44.772 --> 00:10:47.746
for the high-level mechanics
of the bitcoin system.

00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:50.450
There are a lot of stones
I have left unturned,

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.184
and what I'll do in subsequent videos

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.138
is start covering those details,

00:10:54.138 --> 00:10:55.628
and I'm sure you have a lot of questions,

00:10:55.628 --> 00:10:57.416
and hopefully the future videos

00:10:57.416 --> 00:11:00.113
will help answer some of
those questions for you.
