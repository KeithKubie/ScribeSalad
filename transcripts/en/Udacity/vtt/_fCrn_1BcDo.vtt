00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, I suspect you may have chosen this one. It's so tempting.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And actually technically it's a little bit correct.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I encourage you to go to the forums to talk about why this is a little bit correct.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But I think the best answer is that there's no force becauseâ€”

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's say this was positive. Well then it's going to feel a repulsive force from this positive guy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And an equal attractive force from the negative since these are the same sized force.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These are going to exactly balance out and so no force.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If this guy was negative, same thing except now the repulsion

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
comes from the negative force and the attraction comes from the positive.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now why did I bring this up? This is just some weird coincidence.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay. In this situation, this guy didn't feel any force. No. It's not a weird coincidence.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In fact, you almost never find isolated charges like this in nature.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And why not? Because electricity is really, really, really strong.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's a super strong force compared to gravity.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Man, gravity is so weak compared to electricity.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What that means is if this guy were to exist, this lone negative charge,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and somewhere off in the distance there was a lonely positive charge

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
they would find each other and they would pair off.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And it seems like in our universe there's more or less an equal amount

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of positive and negative charges. Let's take a look at the human body for example.
