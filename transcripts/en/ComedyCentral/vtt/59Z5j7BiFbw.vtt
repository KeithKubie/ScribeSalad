00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:08.642
IT'S TIME TO PLAY "PANDAMANIUM."

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.678
FOR MOST, THEIR 37th BIRTHDAY
CELEBRATION IS NOTHING MORE THAN

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.680
A REHEATED SLICE OF PIZZA AND
THE SOBERING REMINDER THAT THEY

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:15.015
ARE HALF IN THE GROUND AND
COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:18.151
ADVERTISERS.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.786
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.721
I'M 29.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:25.225
BUT, HEY!

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.929
I HOSTED "SINGLED OUT"
WHEN I WAS 9.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.098
BUT THAT WASN'T THE CASE WHEN
JIA JIA THE PANDA TURNED 37

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.934
YEARS OLD THIS WEEK AND BLEW UP
THE INTERNET.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.869
JIA JIA SPENT THE DAY EATING
MORE CAKE AND BAMBOO THAN YOU

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:39.339
CAN SHAKE A STICK OF BAMBOO AT.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:44.311
SHE WAS AWARDED THE GUINNESS
WORLD RECORD FOR OLDEST LIVING

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.347
PANDA IN CAPTIVITY.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.116
I THINK PANDAS ARE ADORABLE.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.085
I'M NOT A MONSTER OR A DENTIST.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.820
SERIOUSLY, ( BLEEP ) THAT GUY.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:58.959
SOMEONE SHOULD PUT THAT GUY'S
HEAD ON A PIKE.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:04.898
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; LOOK HOW SAD THIS CAKE IS.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:13.440
&gt;&gt; THIS, I DO--
( LAUGHTER )

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:21.949
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: I THINK THE PANDA IS
LIKE, "I SAID RED VELVET."

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.751
BEING THE OLDEST LIVING PANDA
IN CAPTIVITY IS UNIMPRESSIVE AS

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.086
FAR AS WORLD RECORDS GO.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.188
COMEDIANS, YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO
GIVE ME SOME LESS IMPRESSIVE

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:30.357
GUINNESS RECORDS. I'M GONNA PUT
60 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK AND

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.993
BEGIN. KURT.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:36.363
MOST WILCO PLAYED IN A COFFEE
SHOP.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:37.331
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS. DISTEFANO.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:38.599
&gt;&gt; MARKIEST MARK.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.133
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:40.601
KURT.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:45.973
&gt;&gt; TENDEREST LOIN.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:46.707
&gt;&gt; ANDY-EST DICK.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.510
&gt;&gt; MOST UNCLES NAMED "RICK."

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:50.310
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS.

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:50.844
CHRIS.

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:52.279
&gt;&gt; BESTIEST BEST BUY.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:55.349
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: OH, NO POINTS FROM THE
AUDIENCE ON THAT ONE.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:02:03.357
&gt;&gt; LEAST CONVINCING "THAT'S WHAT
SHE SAID."

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.457
&gt;&gt; SIDEST BOOB.
