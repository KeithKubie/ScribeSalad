00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:01.434
- [Instructor] Let's get some practice

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:03.566
calculating interquartile ranges

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.285
and I've taken some exercises

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:07.065
from the Khan Academy exercises here.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:09.047
I'm just gonna solve it on my scratch pad.

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:10.357
The following data points represent

00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:13.831
the number of animal crackers
in each kid's lunch box.

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:16.483
Sort the data from least to greatest

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.550
and then find the interquartile
range of the data set

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.860
and I encourage you to do this
before I take a shot at it.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.247
Alright, so let's first sort it

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:25.269
and if we were actually doing this

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.130
on the Khan Academy exercise,
you could just drag these,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.970
you could just click and
drag these numbers around

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.172
to sort 'em but I'll just do it by hand.

00:00:32.172 --> 00:00:35.480
So let's see, the lowest number
here looks like it's a four.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.709
So I have that four
then I have another four

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:40.712
and then I have another
four and let's see,

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:41.734
are there any fives?

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.939
No fives but there is a six.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:47.939
So then there is a six
and then there's a seven.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.212
There doesn't seem to
be an eight or a nine

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:53.129
but then we get to a 10

00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:56.274
and then we get to 11, 12.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:04.126
No 13 but then we got 14 and
then finally we have a 15.

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:07.262
So the first thing we wanna do

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:09.425
is figure out the median here.

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:10.732
So the median's the middle number.

00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:13.194
I have one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:15.564
six, seven, eight, nine numbers

00:01:15.564 --> 00:01:17.726
so there's going to be
just one middle number.

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:19.440
I have an odd number of numbers here

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.273
and it's going to be the number

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:21.902
that has four to the left
and four to the right

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:25.655
and that middle number, the
median is going to be 10.

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:29.080
Notice I have four to the
left and four to the right

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.616
and the interquartile range

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:32.249
is all about figuring out the difference

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.050
between the middle of the first half

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.932
and the middle of the second half.

00:01:35.932 --> 00:01:37.121
It's a measure of spread,

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.692
how far apart all of these data points are

00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:41.780
and so let's figure out the
middle of the first half.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.006
So we're gonna ignore the median here

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.863
and just look at these first four numbers

00:01:45.863 --> 00:01:47.750
and so out of these first four numbers,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.886
since I have an even number of numbers,

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:53.772
I'm gonna calculate the median
using the middle two numbers

00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:55.446
so I'm gonna look at the
middle two numbers here

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:56.672
and I'm gonna take their average.

00:01:56.672 --> 00:01:58.272
So the average of four and six,

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.311
halfway between four and six is five

00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:02.717
or you could say four plus six is,

00:02:02.717 --> 00:02:04.803
four plus six is equal to 10

00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:06.811
but then I wanna divide that by two

00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:08.974
so this is going to be equal to five.

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:11.864
So the middle of the first half is five.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:14.036
You can imagine it right over there

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:15.262
and then the middle of the second half

00:02:15.262 --> 00:02:16.448
I'm gonna have to do the same thing.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:17.508
I have four numbers.

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:19.849
I'm gonna look at the middle two numbers.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.424
The middle two numbers are 12 and 14.

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:25.777
The average of 12 and
14 is going to be 13,

00:02:25.777 --> 00:02:27.093
is going to be 13.

00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:30.321
If you took 12 plus 14 over two,

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:33.959
that's going to be 26 over
two which is equal to 13

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.403
but an easier way for numbers like this,

00:02:35.403 --> 00:02:39.904
you say hey, 13 is right exactly
halfway between 12 and 14.

00:02:39.904 --> 00:02:40.737
So there you have it.

00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:42.905
I have the middle of
the first half is five.

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.110
I have the middle of the second half, 13.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.743
To calculate the interquartile range,

00:02:46.743 --> 00:02:49.254
I just have to find the difference
between these two things.

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:53.783
So the interquartile range
for this first example

00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:56.200
is going to be 13 minus five.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.815
The middle of the second half

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:00.911
minus the middle of the first half

00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.974
which is going to be equal to eight.

00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:05.160
Let's do some more of these.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.324
This is strangely fun.

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:09.213
Find the interquartile range

00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:11.058
of the data in the dot plot below.

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:14.413
Songs on each album in Shane's collection

00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:16.337
and so let's see what's going on here

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:20.015
and like always, I encourage
you to take a shot at it.

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:22.385
So this is just representing
the data in a different way

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:24.712
but we could write this
again as an ordered list

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:25.730
so let's do that.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.897
We have one song or we have
one album with seven songs

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:32.931
I guess you could say.

00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:34.467
So we have a seven.

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:38.634
We have two albums with nine
songs so we have two nines.

00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:43.854
Let me write those, we have two nines

00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:45.860
then we have three 10s.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.043
Cross those out.

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:49.793
So 10, 10, 10 then we have an 11.

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:53.587
We have an 11.

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:55.587
We have two 12s, two 12s

00:03:56.827 --> 00:03:59.568
and then finally, we
have, I used those already

00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:02.225
and then we have an album with 14 songs.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:03.167
14.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:06.912
So all I did here is I
wrote this data like this

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.773
so we could see, okay,
this album has seven songs,

00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:11.302
this album has nine, this album has nine

00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:13.694
and the way I wrote it,
it's already in order

00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:15.475
so I could immediately get,

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:18.169
I can immediately start
calculating the median.

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.128
Let's see, I have one, two, three, four,

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:23.157
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 numbers.

00:04:23.157 --> 00:04:25.901
I have an even number of numbers
so to calculate the median,

00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.031
I'm gonna have to look at
the middle two numbers.

00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:32.608
So the middle two numbers look
like it's these two 10s here

00:04:32.608 --> 00:04:34.445
because I have four to the left of them

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:36.287
and then four to the right of them

00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:39.108
and so since I'm calculating
the median using two numbers,

00:04:39.108 --> 00:04:40.575
it's going to be halfway between them.

00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:43.110
It's going to be the average
of these two numbers.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.603
Well, the average of 10 and
10 is just going to be 10.

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:48.270
So the median is going to be 10.

00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:51.168
Median is going to be 10

00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:55.100
and in a case like this
where I calculated the median

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.526
using the middle two numbers,

00:04:56.526 --> 00:04:59.962
I can now include this
left 10 in the first half

00:04:59.962 --> 00:05:02.912
and I can include this
right 10 in the second half.

00:05:02.912 --> 00:05:04.097
So let's do that.

00:05:04.097 --> 00:05:08.629
So the first half is going
to be those five numbers

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.204
and then the second half is
going to be these five numbers

00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:13.273
and it makes sense 'cause
I'm literally just looking at

00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:14.814
first half it's gonna be five numbers,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.741
second half is gonna be five numbers.

00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:19.354
If I had a true middle number
like the previous example

00:05:19.354 --> 00:05:20.828
then we ignore that when we look

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:22.013
at the first and second half

00:05:22.013 --> 00:05:24.257
or at least that's the
way that we're doing it

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:28.107
in these examples but what's
the median of this first half

00:05:28.107 --> 00:05:29.785
if we look at these five numbers?

00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:31.217
Well, if you have five numbers,

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:32.479
if you have an odd number of numbers,

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.999
you're gonna have one middle number

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.712
and it's going to be the one
that has two on either sides.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.859
This has two to the left
and it has two to the right.

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:42.991
So the median of the first half,

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.501
the middle of the first
half is nine right over here

00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:47.773
and the middle of the second half,

00:05:47.773 --> 00:05:50.129
I have one, two, three, four, five numbers

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:51.558
and this 12 is right in the middle.

00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:54.049
You have two to the left
and two to the right

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:56.215
so the median of the second half is 12.

00:05:56.215 --> 00:06:00.004
Interquartile range is
just going to be the median

00:06:00.004 --> 00:06:01.896
of the second half, 12

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:05.857
minus the median of the first half, nine

00:06:05.857 --> 00:06:07.248
which is going to be equal to three.

00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:09.168
So if I was doing this
on the actual exercise,

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.027
I would fill out a three right over there.
