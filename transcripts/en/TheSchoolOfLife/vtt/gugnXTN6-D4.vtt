00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
POLITICAL THEORY

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.600
THOREAU AND CVIL DISCOBEDIENCE

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.660
In March 1845, the United States acquired a new president – James K. Polk –

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.500
a forceful, aggressive political outsider intent on strengthening his country

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.880
and asserting its pre-eminence in front of other world powers, especially Mexico and Great Britain.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.200
Within a year of his inauguration, he had declared full-scale war on Mexico

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.520
because of squabbles over the Texan border,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.300
and was soon rattling his saber at Britain over the ownership of Oregon.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.920
To complete the picture, Polk was a vigorous defender of slavery,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.880
who dismissed the arguments of abolitionists as naive and sentimental.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.700
Polk was a popular president, admired by many for his gung-ho manner,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.380
but a sizeable minority of the citizenry disliked him intensely.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.680
One especially committed opponent was a writer from Massachusetts called Henry David Thoreau.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.200
Thoreau is now a canonical American literary figure,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.200
studied in every high school for his lyrical masterpiece, Walden.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.300
But there is another, more political side to Thoreau,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.960
now usually air-brushed out of the story,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.800
which came to the fore in relation to the President.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.560
Thoreau quickly realised he was opposed to everything Polk stood for:

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.380
he hated what became the Mexican-American war,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.320
instinctively siding with the losing Mexican side,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.400
he was wary of Polk’s squabbles with Britain

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.000
and was appalled by the administration’s policy of hunting down

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.700
and returning runaway slaves to their masters in the South.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.400
Thoreau's anger against his President found its impassioned expression in an essay he published in 1849,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.680
now known as Civil Disobedience.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.000
At the heart of the essay is the question of what an honest citizen should do

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.460
about a president he or she wholeheartedly opposes.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.200
The prevailing view was that because Polk had won a majority,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.380
those who were against him should now fall silent.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.400
It should – it was often said – be the duty of a good citizen to fold away their objections

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.620
and just respect the will of the majority.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.240
But this was precisely the point Thoreau wished to probe and upturn.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.760
He suggested that true patriots were not those who blindly followed their administration.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.800
They were those who followed their own consciences

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.540
and in particular, the principles of reason.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.020
Thoreau wished to redistribute prestige away from blinkered obedience towards independent thought.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.480
What marked out a noble citizen of the republic, a real American,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.980
was not – in Thoreau’s view – that they respectfully shut up,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.480
but that they thought for themselves every day of an administration’s life.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.160
On the basis of just this kind of independent thinking, Thoreau signalled a radical opposition to Polk’s term.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.800
He denounced the Mexican-American war, the repatriation of slaves

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.100
and the outlook of the government more generally.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.560
And so as to underline his opposition, Thoreau held back payment of his taxes.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.120
In July 1846, he walked into Concord, Massachusetts to get his shoes repaired

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.620
and was arrested and thrown into the town’s jail.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.420
Thoreau saw nothing undignified about spending some time behind bars. As he wrote:

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.740
‘Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is a prison.’

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.100
‘All machines have their friction,’ Thoreau admitted,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.300
but when injustice is too great, you should ‘let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine.’

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.220
Thoreau didn’t advocate the non-payment of taxes as a rule,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.500
and in fact, a well-meaning aunt soon paid his bill.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.480
The non-payment was just one example of the many non-violent ways

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.480
that a democratically elected government could and must be resisted

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.820
when its actions veer into aggression and unreason.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.080
An election may settles who the president might be,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.060
but it doesn’t determine that everything that president does is right

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.020
or that one should simply do nothing until the next election.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.240
Above all, Thoreau hated political passivity.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.680
Sarcastically he wrote:

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.500
‘There are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.000
who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.800
who, esteeming themselves children of Washington and Franklin,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.100
sit down with their hands in their pockets,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.100
and say that they know not what to do, and do nothing.’

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.980
This would not be Thoreau's his way:

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.260
‘How does it become a man to behave toward this American government today?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.620
I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it.’

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.280
Thoreau argued that the citizen must never just ‘resign his conscience to the legislation’

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.640
and put himself ‘at the service of some unscrupulous man in power.’

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.900
Thoreau mocked that ‘most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders…

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.060
are as likely to serve the devil, without intending it, as God.”

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.140
Thoreau would not be such a servant.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.940
This most American of writers knew exactly whom it was right for him to serve:

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.700
his own mind and conscience.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.480
 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.300
