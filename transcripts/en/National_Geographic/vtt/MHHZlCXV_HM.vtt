00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.867
[music playing]

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:07.934
MORGAN FREEMAN: The Cao Dai
religion, an unusual blend

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.367
of eastern and western
faiths, appears

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:12.767
to be flourishing in Vietnam.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:16.867
Across the country, there
are almost 400 temples.

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.367
Followers worship openly.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:20.867
But it wasn't always that way.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.300
I've been offered an
audience with Cao Dai

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.400
senior cardinal [inaudible]
to understand the religion's

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.367
secretive history.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.800
How do you do, sir?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.700
Very pleased to meet you.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:46.166
Can you give me a brief
history of the religion?

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.500
[vietnamese]

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:51.066
INTERPRETER: The
purpose of Caodaism

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:56.200
is to unite the traditions of
all religions in the world.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.734
[vietnamese]

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:02.233
INTERPRETER: Caodaism was
established in Vietnam in 1926.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:05.166
And Vietnam, at that time,
was under the control

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.200
of the French administration.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.300
I understood that
some of your leaders

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.900
were imprisoned by the French.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.166
Is that so?

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.000
CARDINAL: [vietnamese]

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.133
INTERPRETER: There was
some misunderstanding

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:21.166
between the French and
Caodaism at the time.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.333
[vietnamese]

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.000
INTERPRETER: The leader
was arrested and sent

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800
in exile for five years.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.000
But after that, when they
understood the purpose

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.433
of this religion, the French
administration let His Holiness

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:35.800
to be returned to Vietnam.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.266
MORGAN FREEMAN: But
Caodaist struggles

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.900
did not end with the French.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.934
In 1943, they took up arms
against Japanese invaders.

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:52.333
The Cao Dai army established
a semi autonomous state

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.633
in the Mekong Delta that
survived for a decade

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:58.300
after the Japanese left.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.367
When the communists took
control of Vietnam in 1975,

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:06.767
Caodaism was banned for
more than two decades.

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.600
It wasn't just because the
government feared Cao Dai's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.667
military history, or
its blending of faiths

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.100
from all over the world.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.767
It was also because of the
secret ceremony that lay

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:18.800
at the heart of the religion.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.633
[vietnamese]

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.300
So those mediums were used
to establish the religion.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.600
[vietnamese]

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.433
INTERPRETER: Those mediums
received a message from God

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.133
to establish and write
down religious regulations,

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.834
the constitutions.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.100
And now, we use those as
the basis of Caodaism.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:02:58.400
MORGAN FREEMAN: The
details of what happened

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.600
in these seances
is still secret,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.200
known only by high dignitaries.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.600
What is known is that there
were always two mediums

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.734
controlling some
sort of instrument--

00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:15.000
someone to read the
instrument, and a secretary

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.100
to write down the message.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.834
When the Vietnamese government
made it legal to practice

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:24.033
the Cal Dai religion in
1997, one of the conditions

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:28.233
was that seances
would remain banned.
