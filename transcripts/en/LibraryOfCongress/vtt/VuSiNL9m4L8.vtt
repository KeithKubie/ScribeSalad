Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: And is everybody ready

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.510
for the third annual
Youth Poetry Slam?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.430
[ Cheers ]

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.500
The inaugural slam in 2014
featured teen performers

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.890
from around the district.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.240
And last year we expanded the event

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.010
to include teens from
across the country.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.090
So, this year we are delighted
to welcome three national teams

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.450
to join DC's Youth Slam Team on
the stage and, brace yourself;

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.510
they are from Des Moines,
Iowa RunDSM.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.140
[ Cheers ]

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.510
From Indianapolis,
Indiana Indy Pulse.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.000
[ Cheers ]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.510
And from New York City, Urban Word.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.930
[ Cheers ]

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.630 position:56%
Our host tonight will say more
about the format of the poetry slam,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.110
but before I invite him up, I want
to thank a number of organizations

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.130 position:56%
for collaborating with the Library
of Congress on this wonderful event.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060
First, the National
Endowment for the Arts,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.550
our fellow federal arts agency
that helps us bring poets

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.410
and writers to this festival.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.510
Three cheers for the
National Endowment.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.040
[ Cheers ]

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.350
And, Split This Rock.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.020
The literary organization
that helps us reach

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.510
out to our competing slam teams.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.050
[ Cheers ]

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.260
I would especially like to thank
NEA Literature Division director,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.560
Amy Stolls.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.080
And Split This Rock executive
director, Sarah Browning

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.300
for their efforts to bring
America's best youth slammers

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.510
to this book festival.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.060
[ Cheers ]

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.430
So, tonight we have a
terrific lineup of judges.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.080
Two of them are acclaimed
writers who earlier

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.850
in the day participated
in the festival.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.060
The first is poet, Joy Harjo.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.360
And author Meg Medina.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.510
Thank you both for extending
your time to be here today.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.300
And now fasten your seatbelt,
I'm pleased to announce

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.190
that our third judge for
tonight is the 14th Librarian

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.510
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.270
[ Cheers ]

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.510
So, thank you judges.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.320
So, I'd now like to turn the
mic over to tonight's host,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.770
Joseph Green, Split This Rock's
acting youth program's coordinator.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.020
Joseph is also the co-founder and
program director of Poetry Now,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.320
and after school creative writing
program for DC area students.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.310 position:56%
And he has over 10 years' experience

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.380
as a professional spoken
word, artist and writer.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.130
So, Joseph it's all yours.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.930
Thank you.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.400
[ Applause ]

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.830
&gt;&gt; JOSEPH GREEN: Good evening.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.770
How are you?

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.200
Are you ready for a
poetry slam [cheers]?

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.840
All right so, I'm going to
give that like a D plus.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.020
No I mean like you
showed up to class.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.760
You didn't know what
class you were in

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.890
and you didn't bring any utensils.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.190
All right.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.490
No pencil.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.790
No paper, nothing.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.090
All right so we're
going to try it again.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.870
But I'm going to give you some
things to think about this time.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.570
This is a poetry slam.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.950
So, when I ask you to applaud, I
want you to applaud like the future

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.530
of our country is going to get on
this stage and open themselves up

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.740
and share with you the keys to how
to make this world a better place.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.540
All right?

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.040
[ Cheers ]

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.130
That was just like one thing.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.130
That was just like one thing.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.730
But you seem to understand
what I mean, right.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.570
So, every time a poet
comes on stage tonight,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.710
that the sort of acclaim
they should meet.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.440
All right I say it like
this to my other audiences.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.230
Imagine your first-born child
has just won a spelling bee,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.830
in a language you did not
know they could speak.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.130
That is amazing.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.180
And that's how we should
treat every young person

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.480
that comes on this stage tonight.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.510
So, one more time for
our wonderful performers.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.660
[ Cheers ]

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.260
As you heard before, this event
is brought to you by the Library

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.810
of Congress, The National Endowment
of the Arts, and Split This Rock.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.510
Please put your hands together
for those amazing groups.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.700
[ Applause ]

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.120
And we have poets from
all over the country.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.620
All right, so this time I'm
going to say the name of the team

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.310
and I want you all to applaud like
we just learned how we're going

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.610
to applaud for the rest, all right.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.910
From Des Moines RunDSM [cheers].

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.280
From Indianapolis,
Indy Pulse [cheers].

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.580
From New York City,
Urban Word [cheers].

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:43.510
And from Washington DC, Split
This Rock's DC U Slam Team.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.480
[ Cheers ]

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.600
So, to keep things fair, that
will be the last time this evening

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.540
until after the performance
that you will hear the names

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.120
of the participating
groups, because we don't have

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.300
to have any home team advantage.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.020
But please understand that
these young people worked hard

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.320
on these poems.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.910
They travelled from all
over the country to be here

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.920
to share these words with you
and that is a special thing.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.280
Now, show of hands, how many

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.100
of you have ever been
to a poetry slam before?

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.400
Good. Good, good, good.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.880
So, you know everything
I'm about to say.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.130
This is for everybody
else in the room.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.050
A poetry slam is a competition
that was started in the mid-1980s

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.960
by a construction worker in
Chicago named Mark Smith.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.290
&gt;&gt; CROWD: So, what?

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.590
&gt;&gt; JOSEPH GREEN: Exactly.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.480
In this competition people will
compete with original pieces

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.580
of poetry, not going
over three minutes.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.230
There will be no musical
accompaniment, no props,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.500
no costumes, anything of that sort.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.800
All right.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.630
These poems are original
constructions of these young people

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.810
so I just want to really drive that
home that these are their thoughts,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.410
their words, their ideas about
the world and they are welcome,

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.630
welcoming to you after to
come up and talk to them

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.960
and ask them about these things.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.830
We hope that you take these
ideas home and you discuss them.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.540
If this poetry slam is no
more than clapping and scores,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.970
then we have failed here today.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.380
So please keep that in mind.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.680
Other things you need to know

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.740
about the poetry slam
is there will be judges.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.090
They will judge from 0 to 10;

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.930
10 being the best poem you have
ever heard, the roof falls out,

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.500
everybody ascends to heaven.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.800
That's it.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.100
It's over.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.400
That's a 10.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.910
Zero, being the opposite of
that, the bottom falls out,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.820
everyone goes to hell,
it's over, no.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.870
But they have been prepped.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.810
They know that they are
judging on performance

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.390
and they are judging on content.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.330 position:56%
Now, it's a hard job to judge, okay.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.650
So, judges, I'm going to
introduce you one more time

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.950
and you're going to get applause.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.070
This might be the last
applause you hear tonight.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.600
But, you deserve it.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.490
You are experts in your craft and
that's why we choose you okay?

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.790
All right.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:58.510
So, again, poet, musician
and playwright Joy Harjo.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.680
[ Cheers ]

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.700
The Librarian of Congress,
Carla Hayden[cheers].

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:12.480
And YA author of "Burn Baby
Burn" and Yaqui Delgado Wants

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.510
to Kick Your Ass," Meg Medina.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.160
[ Cheers ]

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.220
Judges, do not be swayed
by the audience.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.520
All right.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.820
We picked you on purpose.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.610
There's a reason why
you're here, all right.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:36.220 position:56%
Audience, sway the judges all right.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.240
When they throw a score up and
you do not like that score,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.420
we don't do booing any
more we don't do that,

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.050
we say, 'listen to the poem.'

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.240
Everyone say, 'listen to the poem.'

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.340
&gt;&gt; CROWD: Listen to the poem.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.640
&gt;&gt; JOSEPH GREEN: Exactly.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.940
And that's how they
know how you feel.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.330
If they throw up a score that
you love, you do what [cheers]?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.500
You applaud riotously.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.800
All right.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.100
And [laugther].

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.120
It's a very rough crowd.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.280
That's okay we have security
for the judges afterwards.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.340
No, this is about the poetry.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.640
We will clap for the scores.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.260
You will scream listen to the
score if you don't like the score.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.740
But at the end of the day,
the poetry is the point.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.550
I say again, the poetry
is the point.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.350
These young people and their
words are what matters the most,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.560
we just do this competition thing
to get people out in the seats

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.460
because this is America and
we love a good competition.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.760
All right.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.700
But the fact of the matter is
we are here to hear some poetry.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.510
If you're ready to hear
some poetry make some noise.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:43.060
[ Cheers ]

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.150
You're not ready yet.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.410
So, it is a tradition
at the poetry slam,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.810
that we have a calibrating poet.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.110
We call them the sacrificial.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.680
They come, they spill their
blood on the stage for you.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:58.450
Judges, they will be the litmus for
all of your scores for here on out.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.720
If you like a poem more,
give it a higher score.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.640
If you like a poem less
give it a lower score.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.940
All right.

This poet is not in the competition.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.150
But, they will be scored
as if they are.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.180
Please, this is your first test.

&gt;&gt; YONUS O'RIA: How you all doing?

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.290
This is loud.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.590
All right, cool.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.690 position:56%
I'm going to do a love poem, because
like who doesn't like love poems.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.990
You know? Cool.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.830
If I was brave enough to be your
Romeo would you be my Juliette?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.740
Would you find me important
enough to be in your poems?

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.510
Would you bring me up in random
conversation with people I've met?

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.420
Would you believe me when I tell
you, you are you own worst critic?

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.110 position:56%
See, everything you do is sunsets on
countrysides, drops of rain dancing

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.030
across a baby's forehead
for the first time.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.530
You are nothing less
than a treasure.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.080
I know that people have loved
you for all the wrong reasons.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.680
If I was brave enough to show you
the right ones, would you let me?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.200
I've been thinking of how
to tell you how I feel.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.110
Or, if you would even believe me.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.590
See, you've met the worst parts
of me before the best parts.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.910
Got a chance to shine.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.110
If I was brave enough to take
the time would you let me get

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.520
to know you?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.930
Not just the picture-perfect smile,
or face you put on for others,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.320
would you let me know the
reason you wear the masks?

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.710
See, this isn't a crush
or teenage lust,

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.490
but I wouldn't feel
comfortable calling it love

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.900
because I don't just want
to kiss, and hug you,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.280
or know all your secrets.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.410
You make me want to be the man
I don't ever think I can be.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.780
Your words fuel my inspiration.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.410
My skin dances to the
sound of your voice.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.390
When you speak, I don't
get butterflies.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.620
I get riots of unspoken
words demanding refuge,

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.070
raging pulse of fire in
the midnight of my stomach,

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.490
I wish the flames could dance of my
tongue as easily as they do yours.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.540
You are the night before
my revolution.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.010
I ask you.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.820
If I was brave enough to be your
Romeo, would you be my Juliette?

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.230
So, could we trash all the
metaphors, get rid of the

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.730
over used clichés and
not so well done similes

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.510
and simply help each other be
the best versions of ourselves?

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:38.040
[ Cheers ]

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.610
JOSEPH GREEN: A couple of important
things I want to point out there.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.830
Some of poetry slam veterans
reminded me that I forgot

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.720
to say something at the beginning.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.600
This is not a poetry reading.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.140
This is not a golfing event.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.510
This is a poetry slam.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.810
All right.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.980
So, if you hear something you
like while it's happening,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.880
it is encouraged for
you to reciprocate

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.310
that energy back to
the poet, all right.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.010
There are several ways
you can do that.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.230
If you hear a poem, if
you hear a line in a poem

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.770
that you really like you can snap.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.240
Let me hear everybody snap.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.870
Yes. Sounds like the biggest
bowl or Rice Krispies.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.290
Second thing you do if
you hear something you

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.590
like you can say, 'word.'

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.890
Everyone say, 'word.'

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.190
&gt;&gt; CROWD: Word.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.490
&gt;&gt; JOSEPH GREEN: All right
now this is my favorite thing

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.790
in the world invented by Amine
Drulaw [assumed spelling],

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.620
you can take the word she,
you can take the word Jesus

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.370
and you smoosh it together
and if you hear something

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.840
that makes you feel holy on
the inside you say, 'shesus.'

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.140
Everybody on the count of three,
let me hear your best shesus.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.440
One, two, three.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.740
&gt;&gt; CROWD: Shesus.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.040
&gt;&gt; JOSEPH GREEN: There
it is all right.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.960
So, from now on the poets
are prepared for this.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.580
You're not being rude.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.460
All right they know this is coming.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.720
The snapping is preferred
because they can keep going.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.960
But if something really, just
give it to them, it's good,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.330
it's beautiful all right.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:56.040
So, judges this is the longest
amount of time you will ever have

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.590
to put your scores
together all right.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.210
So, this is the scoring part.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.940
Judges, may I see your
scores in 3, 2.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.440
You all was supposed
to have it written

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.480
down already, 3, 2, 1 scores up.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.900
From Low to high I
have a 9.0, a 9.1,

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.510
and a 9.5 let's hear
it for the poet please.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.830
All right and because this
is the National Book Fair,

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.150
there is a twist to
this poetry slam.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.450
There's a theme.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.210
All right so for the
first round the poets have

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.580
to present a poem about
books, or reading.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.880
All right.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.690
That is a very broad theme it can
be interpreted in many, many ways.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.070
I look forward to seeing how
many ways they interpret it.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.370
Okay. But that's the first round.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.010
The second round will be
a poem of their choice.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.080
Now do you all want to hear the
names of the people who are going

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.930
to blow this stage up tonight,
make some noise [cheers].

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:03.000
All right this is also the
order they will be going

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.290
in in the first round, please
save your applause to the end

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.360

is my chariot?

Where I've been waiting.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.790
I've been stuck here for so long.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.390
Nobody hears my cries.

My cage song.

He woke up this morning, got out of
bed, got ready to chase the big blue

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.110
and yellow exhaust pumping the city
dragon which took him to school.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.260
Little did he know he'd be
fighting many battles that day.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.880
He'd be battling many monsters
and even breaking a few rules.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.210
Jabril, our hero rode the
dragon until it stopped

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.140
at his stop then he got off and
walked to the schoolhouse, 8:30.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.100
The was 30 minutes early, never
neglecting to say, 'good morning.'

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.300
But sometimes forgetting to
finish the homework of last night.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.630
At last the bell rung and he rushed
to his place, sat in his seat

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.360
and prepared for the
monster he was about to face.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.300
This big, ugly monster
wanted to incarcerate him.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.130
The monster who never
wanted to see him graduate.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.800
The monster who tried
to hold him down,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.520
keep his head to the ground
and tell him his fate.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.370
Which the monster, statistic,
made to seem set in stone.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.570
Our hero slayed the
beast of the classroom

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.070
and their preconceived notions.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.370
He fought the rude things they said

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.140
and the negative things
they told him.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.410
He fought the ideas that
the naturally grown hair

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.060
from his head was nappy
and that was bad.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.460
He fought for the education
he deserved to have.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.890
He fought the giant of not having
all the tools that he needed.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.150
He fought the feign, the fighting
to catch the dragon to get home.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.380
He fought the students who crossed
him not knowing his struggles,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.060
and fought punishments
more than he deserved.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.850
And he fought most of
these battles alone.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.440
And sometimes it got hard
wielding swords of open smarts

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.830
and that's why he needed
the schoolhouse every day.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.150
He needed to learn how to
craft things other kids got

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.600
for their birthdays.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.940
Laptops, Wi-Fi, a school board
mom, and automatic good grades.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.170
Nobody saw in him the
vision that he saw.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.660
Nobody thought that
he would ever go far.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.900
Nobody thought his dreams
would ever come true,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.550
but Jabril, I believe in you.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.990
You're paving your own yellow brick
road, wielding your own weapons

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.810
with your melanin and afro.

Fighting battles to help you succeed
and keeping hope when it's hard

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.560

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.790

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.090
Oh, Jabril.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.210
He never does his work, he
doesn't care of school work at all,

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.180
is what the monsters all
say to try to throw him off.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.480
But, hero keep your head up.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.780
None of that is true.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.190
And if everyone thinks
it is, I believe in you.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.600
You are worth so much
time and so much patience.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.050
Jabril, you are worth
a decent education.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.550
They see the habits you've
developed to survive on the streets

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.010
and try to take them at school.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.440
Beasts confiscate them at school
as they try to teach you to fit

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.810
in in a society that
doesn't even want you to.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.840
But I believe in you.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.310
Stay firm in your beliefs,
participate, write, and read.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.000
And I know you recognize that
the teaching tools are twisted,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.780
but do what you need to do
in this education system.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.350
And once you finish school,
you can help to fix it.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.780
And all the problems of our world.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.160

does, or what anyone says,

you hold so much potential
and so much value.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:27.160
up during someone else's applaud
and pretending like it's for you.

As a host, I am not allowed to
talk about the poems as they go

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.960
through so you all have to make
sure that when a poem comes up here

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.130
that really moves you,
you let that poet know.

if you want to hide something

from my people, put it in the book.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.190
The best way they have
hidden everything from us was

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.300
by burning the ones we wrote.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:08.540
How dare you rewrite me into
history as if I be fiction.

sanctions my slavery.

Command of me to praise to a
man that mirrors my conqueror.

I cannot fall bended knee to a
father after mine was stripped

of my people.

to take up 10 pages

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.630
of an American history textbook
that make up more than 1/3

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.930
of the population and feel
like misrepresentation.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.490
And feel like misogyny.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.790
And feel like misery.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.860
I can't. They won't erase me.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:22:02.450
Do you know what it feels like
to have to go and pray to a God

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.970
that doesn't look like you?

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.970
Do you know what it feels
like to not be able to rewind

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.760
and track a tribe that
belongs to you?

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.190
Think back to a time where you
felt incomplete, inadequate.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.770
Think back to a time where you
felt like you were only half

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.250
of something you thought
you were holistically.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.290
Imagine being Hispanic, stuck

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.710
in between black void
and white privilege.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.600
Stuck in between two blood lines.

home, and that yeans

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.000
to rape island of all that it is.

Onto day break long after
the moon has been tucked away

and the stars have left the sky.

It is here in this eerie place
Edward Cullen finds himself

enthralled in the very
thoughts of his love, Bella.

It is she that protects his hallowed
soul with the shield of ignorance.

The state who continues to
press the LGBT community.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.360
I remember the feeling of
being utterly dumbfounded

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.860
by a fair maiden's appearance.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.140
Yes, I was physically attracted to
her, but it was the blood coursing

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.820
through her body and heat
that radiated from her chest

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.820
that I knew there was
something deeper.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.150
And so deep into the
night I thought about her.

day as thoughts of her lean metallic

across my brain.

stepped on by my governor.

His proud hooves engraving state
laws of restoration in my mind.

Telling me to think straight and
I knew it could never happen.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.600
And it can never be possible like
Edward who's 107, and Bella 17,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.550
and myself a junior
and she a freshman.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.870
It was wrong.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.710
But it didn't change the fact
that I wanted it to happen.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.850
But maybe I am more like Jacob.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.710
Hot-headed, ill-tempered, and a bit
jealous in my love, the new moon.

Unsure personality sexuality,
a quarter of a moon shore,

thing could turn him.

From a wholesome human
being in two feet,

to glisten in nervous laughter.

cords when I see her.

The gleam in her smile, the dolls
on her eyes that could the stars

or the sweet aroma of her presence

A force that is not for all rights.

A force that will pray,
hunt and kill.

Anyone not in alliance
with the church and state.

The world of twilight
causes a new born army.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.390
My world causes homophobic
politics and corrupted saints.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.090
Both are newly changed,
untrained vampires, blood thirsty,

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.370
power hungry, and will do
anything for a coat of normality.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.200
What is normal?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.540
What is freedom?

through my chest which is refract.

to get down on my knees and confess

to another woman that I am
dangerously in love with her.

I am the sun.

And for a moment in time
we are perfectly aligned.

The gravitational pull of
human emotion between us.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.860
And as we separate, our eclipse
fades, and day begins to break.

passed the religious freedom

But it's not always that easy.

We don't always get to choose
what it's like to love someone.

when a butterfly placed
itself up on a student's desk.

And I've never seen something
so graceful, full of freedom.

All nature and God wrapped
into a seamless body.

In chemistry, we are taught that
the world is made of matter.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.890
My professor called
it the circle of life.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.680
Necessary for science.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.150
Like splitting mocking birds open

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:05.150
and claiming their
voice boxes as rewards.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.630
But that was to kill, perch.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.600
Any unwarranted reason
to remove a soul,

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.030
they claim it to be swift, easy.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.600
Who cares it's just one
less of them premeditated.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.240
One to see it in full flight.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.420
To know of open hand and small
man will become covalent bonds.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.720
Never seem to think twice.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.030
Just react.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.330
Like atoms.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.630
Like justice system.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.420
Like every black man
slammed into the court bench.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:32.480
Like every family with lost father,
like Tom Robinson, like Atticus.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.170
They are not the body
at the gun range.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.420
Just a noise cancellations.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.140
Our lives just be open statement
using casual conversation.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.560
Something to sign about,
then back to lecture.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.580 position:56%
They will never know how it feels to
be a mocking bird, or a butterfly.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.160
Or every Tom convicted of a crime
they never even thought to commit,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.770
pushed in to the rifles, then
they play Russian roulette

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.530
with intent to kill.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:33:00.970
Murder. Displace this life
whatever, whether it be by bullet,

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:06.500
or jail cell, 1933 or 2016
we are always remembered

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.290
by how easily black
can turn to crimson.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.990
It was on a Wednesday during
my 11 a.m. chemistry class,

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.230
when a butterfly placed itself upon
a student's desk and for a moment,

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.590
I knew that it came as a warning.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.390

&gt;&gt; JULIO: In 2016, 12 teachers
were murdered for fighting

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.700
for educational reform
in Wahaka, Mexico.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.300
I've never been to Wahaka.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.990
But I'll hold the soil with
two palms like a newborn child.

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:53.980
My mother was born there.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.360
Heard the sun was as warm to
melt your heart into a ribcage.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.120
Heard the soil carries the sound

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.020
of three million souls
walking to school.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.500
Education isn't close to home here.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.750
The difference between
a book and a child is

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.880
that sometimes they're seven
miles apart from each other

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.580
and most commonly, the teachers
know the students better

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.880
than the parents do.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.200
And maybe sometimes the teachers
will substitute for the students

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.350
when the parents are sick, when
the parents are on opposite sides

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.770
of the wall, when their
parents are breathing less.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.440
Or when they're breathless.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.110
Wahaka teachers crease
open the floors with seeds,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.960
sprout every child
they can from seeking.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.690 position:56%
So why do they only get
acknowledgement when 12 of them wind

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.650
up dead on the news still arrested
with the their eyes still open.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:42.270
They never get a chance to blink,
or saw the world spin off its axes.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.650
This is what happens when you
speak on a countries problems,

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.290
how crazy it can be for
the Mexican government

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.760
to bite off their own fruit.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.090
Why doesn't anybody ever talk
about how good the students are.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.880
What are the students doing?

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.390
What are the students doing?

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.850
What's proficient nowadays?

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.890
Ask how many miles they
walk to school and calculate

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.740
that with the amount of
times they came hungry.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.450
Ask how things are going at home.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.860 position:56%
But don't be surprised when they ask
you what that last word means, ask,

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.490 position:56%
ask them who their favorite hero is.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.440
And they're reply dead.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.420
Twelve of them to be exact.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.380
Twelve teachers that advocated.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.580
All 12 made national TV.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.710
You can still read the names on
the screen when the TV turned off.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.570
Still hear the screams of
12 generations fighting,

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:30.860
but you probably couldn't.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.940
Sound is always hard
to hear behind a wall.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.220
Always misinterpreted,
always looked over.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.250
How do you kill 12 teachers
and not learn from it?

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:47.320
This will be the first time a
teacher's absent in a classroom.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.510
The first time the students
are actually listening.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:56.080
The first time 12 teachers raised
their hand at the exact same time

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.890
and all got the same answer.

know about storytelling.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.330
Another word for it is
gossip in their minds.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:42.810
To spill the secrets out of our
household for everyone to know.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:47.100
They forget about the tales
they've been told about witches,

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.230
and the thieves in the city.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.290
Their tongues are now stale.

They do not speak a native language.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.290
It's never been this cordial.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.000
It is all something
they've memorized.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.300
A knowledge, a script.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.150
My parents know argument.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.630
They know bland dialect
that will split them a half

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.590
that won't be quiet.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.110
A half that won't forgive.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:22.350
Then their conversations
become worrisome.

Their eerie.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.400

talks about his dad.

How he saw his own friend drown,
how he then walked home to get sleep

for work the next morning.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.750
My parents had to cross rivers
in order to get to school.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.140
They take their clothes off.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.080
They hold them up high.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.760
There's nothing celestial
about that.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.220
At school, they are only
given disciplinary bruises.

You can't blame the teachers.

know how to part their lips.

ways to say, thank you.

back to El Salvador.

Sometimes they'll just look
at you and stay silent.

wanted to be a writer.

we were never people

That we only know demand
and conformity.

Yet, they have never read
something of healing.

I carry when I write.

It is the man's job to build a
woman into the spine of a bridge.

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:19.170
It is the woman's job not to bleed
through the cement in the process.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:24.200
God, is always watching
as this unfolds.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:28.370
When my boyfriend says I'm
stupid, grows furious with me

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.890
because I do not want
to have sex with him.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.950
Makes me feel insignificant
and shames me for it.

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:38.720
I feel him melt me down and
spread me over the steel overlays.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.450 position:56%
Smooth me into a roadway, accordion,
how sweet the sobbing sounds,

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:45.120
when harmonizing of
his blaring engine.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.500
I rate in hot like the sting

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.380
of the first time he
snapped at me, God enters.

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.760
As how I just stand there
and let him drive me

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.960
down to a skid mark, stops.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.070
Says I must get it from my mother.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:59.360
The way we turn fists into
palms full of love notes.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.520
How we be the food he
devours on the table.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.820
And the table he screws
on afterwards.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.040
Absorb a man's darkness
and still lead him

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.550
to a flame he can choose
to blow out at whim.

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:12.750
He kisses my back with his feet.

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:16.480
Stomps across each vertebra as if
I could connect all his broken.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.020
And I saw it coming.

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.900
And the way he's scoff at my
magic as if he were Houdini

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.000
and I were a backyard act.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.310 position:56%
The way he'd make requests into law.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.460
Decree. A rewriting of the Bible

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.210
that I knew would only
end in apocalypse.

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.390
Fooled myself into a fairytale
that played out in the wrong order.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.430
And now here I am.

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:38.950 position:56%
A nymph for a storyteller that won't
remember by name by the end of it,

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:41.500
but will remember my breasts.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:45.260
The fertile mound of my stomach,
how women bleed sustenance.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:50.060
Don't you know our blood is the
binding agent in cement mix?

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.360
God clears her throat.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.410
As how I plan to save myself
now that my limbs are encased

00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:58.950
in rocks says do you
remember when you were wild?

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.430
And I don't.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:03.230
This hug of concrete
done declawed me.

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:07.000
Done polish me down to token
I stand the worst fashion.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.230
Unmoving. Bones degrading
like my name and his mouth.

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:14.230
God asks remember that
time you loved yourself?

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:18.700
And I claw a crack through the
asphalt hoping my voice can escape.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.760 position:56%
But by the time the words interrupt
the metal beams there's no one there

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.770
to receive them.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.010
God is gone now.

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.800
And I do not know if he was there
the whole time to begin with,

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.430
or if it was only yearning
to see myself near divinity.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:37.000
But I know she's always watching.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.040
For the day I snap
the suspender cables.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.610
Split my deck and let
the steel concave itself

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:45.730
into a skull fracturing casket.

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.420
Let him cascade down.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.270
Still screaming for
the womb of my love.

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:51.110
God and I will laugh.

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:54.930
It will be the last time I let
a man make a highway of me.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:56.270
And that part.

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:59.510
I taught my own damn self.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:16.290

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.080
Scores up.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.000
From low to, why you?

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:27.560
From low to high I have a 9.5.

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.980
a 9.6 and a 9.7.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.280 position:56%
Let's hear it for the poet [cheers].

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.810
Keep that same energy going.

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:38.510
Coming back to the stage, Henry.

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:57.550
[ Applause ]

00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.610
&gt;&gt; HENRY: I come from
a family of repent.

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:01.910
My mother fell in love.

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.300
My father was a cigarette
addict I was wrapped

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.180
in that same evangelical blanket.

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.820
I grew up learning how to get
comfortable to sleep on pews.

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.790
I grew up learning how to close
my eyes and have conversation.

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:16.860
I grew up learning how to
not get stomped on by those

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.210
who danced in time of praise.

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:22.090
No church boy, they're asked
to think of God unworthy.

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:26.920
I was probably one of the only
little boys that paid attention.

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.710
I had this trust and fear
in God it was this being

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:36.440
that could turn our church, a
school cafeteria into a sanctuary.

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.660
We borrowed music stands from
classrooms, used them as pulpits.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:43.180
When I was eight, I
finally stood behind one.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.300
I preached in front
of other 8-year-olds

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.000
and the pastor's youngest son.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.070
I delve into the stout
book of "Revelation."

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:57.560
I spoke about the rapture,
horns blowing, a blood moon.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.950
I became a holy infant at church.

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:09.660
I learned to walk,
I became a priest.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.920
My father had me memorize
this verse.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.570
I don't remember it completely now.

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:17.580
It was about a believer
who rebelled.

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:21.690
About a dog that returns
to its own vomit.

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:23.490
Shortly after the understanding

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:28.350
of God comes the absorption
of what baptism is.

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:31.360
I began to take baptism classes.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.790
Most of the people there
are in their forties.

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.370
We had read the same book.

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:39.680
We know that baptism is not a toy.

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:45.130
It is a seal embossed onto your
spiritual and physical being.

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:48.690
And it is not a toy.

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:54.080
It is not guaranteed for
it to be a good thing

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.990
to be baptized at an early age.

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:59.440
Jesus was baptized when he was 30.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.530
I was baptized a couple
weeks before I turned 12.

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:10.300
Our congregation was going to
be uniting at another church.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.600
We did not own our
own baptismal pools.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.880
I remember getting my white robe.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.460
The man who tied it had
very unstable hands,

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:23.200
they tremble mirrored the great
crumble of Sodom and Gomorrah.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.970
That evening I bathed
in God's waters.

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:29.760
They were welcoming, but lukewarm.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.260
I had this conversation the
day before with my mother.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.560
It still lingers with me.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.530
She mentioned how young I was
and the greater repercussions

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:39.770
of sin that came with it.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.510
I was just an eager boy.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:53.940

good time say yeah.

If you're having a real
good time say oh yeah.

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.010
I love you.

01:01:57.010 --> 01:02:00.240
Even if you hate that I say it

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.510
in English sometimes it
still carries the rich rivers

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:05.890
of [foreign word] mango juice.

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:07.790
Your favorite.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.270
I know you grandma.

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:10.570
I know English is foreign

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.880
on your tongue the same
way it is to your ears.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.410
But I promise it will
find its way to your heart

01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:17.540
through the creases of your smile.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.320
Let it soak in.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.050
Your teeth shine like you
ate diamonds breakfast.

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:25.070
Your cheeks are the color of
caramel syrup on pancakes.

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:28.450
Carousels cover the color of
your eyes and I could surf

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:30.600
on the cursive of your hair.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.870
You are the surface of the sun.

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:36.700
So, beautiful and so bright.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.020
The world needs to notice you more.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:44.290 position:56%
Nobody every appreciates how
gorgeous the sun is until it's gone.

01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.830 position:56%
I acknowledge your struggle grandma.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.910
I know raising six kids in
a room wasn't your fault.

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:52.360
Single mothers go through
thorns and flames.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.290
But you made it out just fine.

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:57.400
I know your palms still ache
from holding the ceiling in place

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.140
for my mother, my aunts, my uncles.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.150
You are the strongest woman I know.

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:05.780
You cradled all six of your
children on your smile.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.330
Even if you knew there'd
be no food that night.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:11.260
Love becomes a five-course
meal, you need to stay alive.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.120
And I feel your pain, grandma.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.120
I know having people
taking advantage of you

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.330
because of what you can't
comprehend is cruel.

01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:19.080
It's ignorance.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.830
They only love Spanish culture
when it's not affecting them.

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:23.900
This is not a poem about me though,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.490
but when my grandma tells me what
is the point of learning English

01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:30.320
if I'll be gone before I
can say I love you back.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.530
It feels like I failed her.

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:33.840
Like I disappoint her.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.860
It hurts to see my
grandma struggle with words

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.040
like language is another
barrier she has to sneak past.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.520
Her mouth has been boarded
up like empty homes.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.980 position:56%
My grandma is an empty home, lonely.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.360 position:56%
But she stands bold with no support.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.410
I feel your hardships, grandma.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.090
The ocean tried to swallow you.

01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:54.960
You had some hardships grandma.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.820
Your name will never
sink in these waters.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.520
I tied a rope to every
syllable of your name just

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.330
in case it falls under pressure.

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:02.920
And I am still above water.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.510
Every vein in your body
connects to your heart,

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.580
like all bridges lead to kingdoms.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.210
I love seeing my mother happy

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:10.900
because I can see my
grandmother smile

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.610
as well, like a two for one deal.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:15.650
I'm all about finding
the value in love

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:20.430
because my grandmother knew
struggle, way before she knew joy.

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:22.570
She knew rape before sex.

01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:25.680
Almost like she knew
scars before scabs.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.630
She broke the ocean
in half to get here.

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:31.450
She is the strongest woman I know.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:35.580
Dear grandma, truth is I wrote
this poem for you years ago,

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:41.100
and every family dinners, every
barbecues, every Sunday mornings,

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.270
I'm learning to appreciate
doing all those things with you.

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.170
Because you help be grow.

01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:49.510

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.850
Scores up.

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:19.130
From low to high I have a 9.8,
a 9.8, and a 10 [applause].

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:23.870
Keep that energy going.

01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:31.570
Coming up next, put your hands, or
keep your hands going for Kenya.

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:33.640
All the way to the stage.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.510
All the way to the stage.

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:55.040
[ Applause ]

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.220
&gt;&gt; KENYA: I binge watch
Netflix like a child looking

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.210
for candy in church, religiously.

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:03.930
And my favorite show has always
been "Orange is the New Black."

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.980
Tells jail from the feminine side.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.660
So, it's all for the little woman

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.670
who doesn't think she
deserves to be incarcerated.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.800
Has a life too good for the system.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.470
I think I fell in love
with the fairytale aspect,

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.310
like all jail were formatories.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.520
Where lifelong friends are made
and the food isn't the best.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.820
Call it summer camp for criminals.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.240
But, the sun always sets
on someone else's horizon.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.810
Serving some crime
fiction, to reality.

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.230
More like a spec of our reality.

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.610
Shows police brutality
as a papercut.

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.750
Just another one of our issues,
to profit off, this is the trend.

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.530
Suddenly for the audience until
their ready to vow another meal

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:44.480 position:56%
to our stories to write before their
tongue spit us out and it burns.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.110
Let's see your own crucified,
pinned down, left breathless,

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:50.190
then have the nerve to say
that you can't breathe.

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.620
Even weakened black skin has
turned into bragging rights.

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.280
You need to think of a new plot
for your next season of the way,

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.610
to increase your fan base of the
black body swiped under the flag.

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:00.730
Be careful, you might
reveal the millions

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.840
of message your people
have made, why?

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.300
Does no one want to own up to,

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.400
I mean clean up the
messes they've made.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.330
I know I've heard the story before.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:12.070 position:56%
Too many times I've been [inaudible]
reliving these moments but we always

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.850
for get to read the
preface of the novel.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:16.120
No one wants to know the
beginning of the horror film,

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.940
this storyline has become too
relatable, just ask the victims

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:21.170
of any city education, or
down south voter booths.

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.900
This country has classified
too many of us as villains,

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.590
writing [inaudible]
"Suicide Squad" proclaim

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:27.650
to protect these streets here.

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:28.950
They delete the forward.

01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:31.180
Just skip to the appendix.

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:34.240
You become as transparent at the
Constitution's copyright whether

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.030
in Ferguson or Lynch Field.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:39.040
We are always the cliff hanger.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.250
We are never the last one standing,
but the first ones on our feet.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.800
Too many of our spines
have sacrificed just

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.000 position:56%
to keep this story together, just to
bind severed mouths to our wrists.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.880
We always end up cleaning
the blood stains anyway.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.980
Never knew this is white carpet.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:55.730
Seems to make sense now.

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:58.290
How we always knew what occurred
and wearing at the generation

01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:00.850
of scrubbing motives, the only
things that never come out.

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.000
But you call us the animal.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.100
Place us in cages and tell us
to be civilized, forces to choke

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.900
on your keys, while you
proceed to close the gates.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.530
Release the menace and
smile into the camera.

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:17.230
Life, at our gasp for
life or freedom.

01:08:17.230 --> 01:08:19.790
As the scene fads into your bodies

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:23.890
with fear set upon our
face, spoiler alert.

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:27.790
We're prosecuted for claiming
this last breath to ever be ours.

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:32.510

to attend our own curtain calls?

on an event of this size.

Engine failed to ignite.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.660
My galaxy was closing in on me.

A town where there's
either a church, cornfield

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.660
or liquor store on every corner.

Houston, we have a problem.

My future seems distance,
I'm tailored to my ship

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.480
but everything seems
so far out of reach.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.470
My mother knows everybody
who's anybody,

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:50.450
because of her body
she's hard to miss.

thick flesh adorn her bones.

Where's my copilot, who should have
been my father was merely a faded

ADHD gets in my way an asteroid in
close range, which switch do I use.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.120
The first time I heard the
words behavioral disorder,

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.420
I was in the second grade.

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.730 position:56%

second time I felt like an outsider.

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:22.040

I couldn't find my act.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.470
I stayed hidden, out
of sight, out of mind.

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:30.790
I stayed hidden away from the
gleam they call the bright future.

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:33.450
My family always taught
me education was key.

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:34.750
Go to school.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.050

01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:37.530
My grandfather would
say to me, my poppy.

01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:40.960
Average build, mentally sound,
grey hair lining his mahogany skin.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.490
He's the strongest man I
know and black don't crack,

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.840
but I've seen his brain matter
explode like black matter

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.380 position:56%
by the fact that he lacks an
education prior to the 21st century.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.020
By the sixth grade I was
a 21st century scholar,

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.290
which meant I could attend any
college in the State of Indiana

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:55.730
and it would be paid for.

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:58.230
This was the first time my
mother found faith in the system.

01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.990
Her heart thundered
and her eyes pixeled

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:01.740
when she realized I
could wear a white collar

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.640
as a black woman in
corporate America.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.660
System override.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.360
This isn't supposed to happen.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.110
They're paying my dues because
my mother has everything to lose.

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.860
She falls below the poverty line.

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.560
So, she sends me on
this mission on alone.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.620
So, I tried to defy gravity,
as often did my teachers.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.130
It lost star out of its
orbit like a rocket repelling

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:23.320
into the earth's atmosphere
of education.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.920
I need to know how far I've come.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.740
Show me a demonstration of
the progress I'm making.

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.780
I was always told to
reach for the stars.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.750
And I never gave up, yet
I was always let down.

01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:34.330
Check levels.

01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:35.780
My capsule's going off course.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:38.020
I've been directed to a new galaxy.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.320
The galaxy of Rhonda.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.770
My aunt's big-busted
personality as wide

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.390
as the giant system of the earth.

01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:45.860
A laugh that rings through
outer space, bringing people in.

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.220
She is my new galaxy.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.670
I can stop reaching for the stars,
because she has put them among me.

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:54.760
Her only request is that I choose
one that shines as bright as I do,

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.560
so I don't become a falling ball of
dust that once embellished the sky.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.410
I've chosen the sun.

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.710
The creations of this world.

The particle of our galaxy.

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:05.780
All made up as we know it but
this isn't the big bang theory.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.250
This the phenomena of my life.

up of tiny stars and ideas

I, me and my star have become one.

My bones and flesh are wrapped in
string that tie me to the planet

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.320
to let me gaze among the stars.

My blue dress tames my
curves, so I walk unabashed.

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.500
Yet, man is taught it speak
things into existence.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.800
You're sexy.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.830
My tempo is brought forth,
readies itself for demolition.

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.770
Man gawks at me, uses his eyes

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:06.890
to enter the body I've
tried my best to hide.

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:08.670
Man calls me ma.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.430
And now I am his mother.

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:13.860 position:56%
Forced to feel like I should
discipline him, demand some respect.

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.160
Man yells, baby.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.460
And now I'm an infant.

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:22.280
Gut tells me I should yell,
scream, cry make it clear

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.020
that what he's calling
me isn't my name.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.740
Apparently I don't live here.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:37.560
This ain't my private property.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:43.170
I'm free to the public for viewing.

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:44.550
Man says sheesh, girl, smile.

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:51.790
He wants me to take his
oppression for appreciation.

01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:53.600
Man has the nerve to stare at me.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.900
Up and down.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:59.620
Hard and steadfast waiting
for some kind of gratitude.

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.710
To be thanked for trespassing,
waits for a smile.

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:06.520
Some indication that this
is what we both want.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:15.960
I am barely restraining the bullet
burning to be roared out of me.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.390
My eyes are unrelenting
black pebbles.

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:20.090 position:56%
I can't swallow this man's audacity.

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:21.590
His patience silences questions
if it's really rejection,

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:22.890
or just the front before the yes.

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:24.190
Pauses to see if I really don't
want to share myself with him.

01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:25.490
Man smooches as if
to call a lost pet.

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:26.790
But I will no longer allow
his words to domesticate me.

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.090
The morphing stops now.

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:29.390
I speak myself into existence.

01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:30.690
I am only what I say I am
when I walk down the street.

01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:31.990
I am not your mother,
your baby, your girl.

01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:33.290
My ultimate form is dragon.

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:34.590
Every time you belittle me
with your words, your eyes,

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.890
my jaw widens, teeth sharpen.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:37.190
I thirst for blood.

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:38.490
This is a warning to all the
men who take my blue dress

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:39.790
as an invitation to my body.

01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:41.090
Who don't let me pass them without
yelling sexy, Ms. Beautiful,

01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:42.390
Ms. Guts with a fat ass,
ma, baby girl, I am a woman.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.690
And the beast.

01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:44.990
Still want to see me smile?

01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:46.790
Still want what's under my dress?

&gt;&gt; ALYSSA GAINES: I went

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:08.660
to my friend named September's 13th
birthday party, in rural Indiana,

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.080
where I had to convince her
to take the Confederate flag

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.860
down so that I could come.

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.190
I still went to the party
but the damage was done.

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:19.260
The reason I was so hurt was
because still in our county,

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.620
innocent blacks are
being slain by police.

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:27.050 position:56%
And people have the nerve to display
a flag of prejudice racial history.

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:29.850
She wondered why I was so upset.

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:36.330
July 13, 2013 George
Zimmerman found not guilty.

01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:37.770
Where was she when the verdict was

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:41.160
in when six non-black women
said, Zimmerman was innocent.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.340
I was in Florida when
they picked the jurors.

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:45.780
My Mam ma's house when
they gave the verdict.

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:48.970
I remember in my journal I wrote
how they just gave him his gun

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:51.320
like we're sorry, sir,
you're free to go.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.160
And it hurts that my mother must
tell my 8-year-old brother the way

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.350
to behave if he ever
gets pulled over.

01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:00.630
It's like what you don't hear in
the police shooting recordings.

01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:03.780
The one thing they're
missing, the warning.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.360
Be compliant.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.650
Keep your hands in the sky
and explain the situation.

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:10.520
Drop your weapon.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.660
But the weapon I can't drop
is the reason I'm a target.

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:19.400
It's because I'm black, woke and
politically conscious [cheering].

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.240
No justice, no peace.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.640
No racist police.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.580 position:56%
No killing innocent blacks and
leaving their bodies in the streets.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.140
Hashtag black lives matter

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.650
because police are not
treating us like all lives do.

01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:32.760
When I say black lives matter,
how could that offend blue.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:35.320
How, after everything we've
been through it's rude.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.550
How is it socially unacceptable to
fear for my little brother's life.

01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:41.510
How if I dread the day he
learns how to drive and voice

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:45.660
that it's impolite, because
black people are being persecuted

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:47.430
by police who receive paid leave.

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:51.170
And if you really believe that all
lives mattered why don't you stand

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.620
with black ones in our
time of need [cheers].

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:57.350
When people talk about
breast cancer,

01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.940
would you say all cancers
matter, so why are people mad,

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.240
is the operative word black?

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.540
And oh, the irony.

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:07.860
It's funny almost people say blue
lives matter, when all jobs do

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.830
and their defense is they
never said that all jobs don't.

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:13.540
See we say things like
black lives matter every day

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.480
and nobody combats it because
black isn't what we say.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.650
And legality is only a technicality
when it comes to police brutality.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:24.900
What if, September, your
dad, or your little brother

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.500
or your uncle was at risk.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.970
Would you stay peaceful?

01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:29.270
Would you stay quiet?

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.010
Would you enjoy being
told how to handle it?

01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:34.450
No, I'm upset because I'm tired

01:20:34.450 --> 01:20:36.060
of hearing the officers
have not been charged.

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.160 position:56%
Or they were acquitted and there was

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.670
so much evidence they
could have admitted.

01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:43.640
And the one shooting that made me
particularly mad was Charles Kinsey

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.730
he was laying hands up on his back.

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:48.030
It showed no matter how much my
mother teaches my brother, MJ,

01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:50.640
even if he does what
the officers say.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.880
Even if all the talking
he does is to explain.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:57.280
Even if he's protecting
a man with autism.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.990
All lives can't matter until
black lives do and I won't quit

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:02.640
until every September
realizes that it's

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.760
for these innocent people
whose killer's not punished.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.570
