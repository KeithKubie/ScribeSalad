Thanks to CuriosityStream for supporting PBS
Digital Studios.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.820
We’ve made some improvements in recent decades
when it comes to how we power our society.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.020
But by and large, our world still runs on
fossil fuels and nonrenewable energy.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.880
And as long as we’re dependent on these limited
resources, we’ll need to design the most efficient
ways to harvest their energy.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.180
But, that’s difficult, because the laws of
physics are not in our favor.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.080
The fact is, you can’t make a super-efficient
system without any waste.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.440
No matter how good of an engineer you are,
you can’t invent a perfect engine.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.240
Why? It’s because of an energy crisis that
pervades our universe.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.180
And it’s caused by entropy and the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:50.320
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.100
Since we’ve started designing engines, we’ve
constantly tried to improve them.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.880
Our first engines weren't that efficient,
but we’ve come a long way since.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.600
Take, for example, a heat engine.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.780
Simply put, a heat engine is a machine or
system that converts heat into other forms
of energy.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.300
And we can see how efficient they are, by
looking at their thermal efficiency.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.240
The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is
the amount of useful work it can produce based
on the amount of heat that we give it.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.960
So the more work we get out, the more efficiently
we use our fuel, and the less of it we need.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.960
That’s why engineers are constantly trying
to make engines that are as thermally efficient
as possible.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.240
Many of the internal combustion engines that you
find on the road are around 20% thermally efficient,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.740
meaning that 20% of the heat that’s applied 
n the engine actually does work.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.760
There are some prototypes of automotive engines
that are 40% efficient.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.920
And there’s even an air-cooled gas turbine
that delivers an over 61% combined cycle efficiency.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.140
That’s impressive, but still it’s not
even close to 100%.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.980
This seems to be our limit for how efficient
our engines can be – at least for now.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.020
So what gives?
Why aren’t they any better?

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.240
Well, we’re restricted by thermodynamics.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.920
You see, the first law makes it all seem pretty
simple.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.880
If we can’t create or destroy energy, then any
change in energy that we have, must have an equal
and opposite change in energy somewhere else.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.360
But in reality, it’s a bit more complicated
than that.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.380
Based on the first law alone, you might
think that you could simply recycle energy
over and over again.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.720
But while energy can’t be created or destroyed,
it can change into less useful or even unusable forms.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.460
In fact, every real-world energy conversion has
some amount of energy that changes into a form
that’s unavailable to do work.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.820
And this less-usable energy that’s lost
is usually heat.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.160
But can’t we just convert that heat back
to work?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.260
Well yes, but not entirely.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.019
Heat can never be turned into another, work-performing
type of energy with 100% efficiency.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.080
So every time you have a transfer of energy,
you’ll end up with some more “useless” energy.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.500
For example, let’s say you have a hot bowl
of soup in a cold room.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.819
Over time, the soup will cool off, and whatever
energy it loses, its surroundings will gain.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.549
But you can’t take the energy from the cold
room and use it to heat the soup back up,

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.439
even though the exchange didn’t violate
the first law.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.200
Or think of it in terms of electricity running
through a wire that goes to a radiator and
generates heat.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.640
Electricity goes in, and heat comes out.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.400
But if you tried heating the wire, you wouldn’t
get electricity back, even though, once again,
the first law isn’t violated.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.819
This is where the second law of thermodynamics
comes in.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.520
While the first law is all about the total
quantity of energy, the second law is all
the quality of energy.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.360
The second law states that as energy is transferred
or transformed, more and more of it, is wasted.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.930
It basically restricts the inter-conversion
between heat and work.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.840
100% of the work that you put into a system
can be converted into heat, but 100% of heat
can’t be converted into work.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.800
So to understand what this really means, let’s
look at a heat engine, an engine that converts
heat into energy that does work.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.340
Say we put some heat energy into the engine.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.860
The system will take the heat, go through
a process, and give us energy in the form
of work.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.400
But some of the heat will always be released
at a cooler temperature as a secondary output.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.980
No heat engine could operate without doing
this.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.720
Basically, unless we’re only trying to get
heat, we’re going to have some amount of
inefficiency.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.500
So how did we find any of this out?

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.820
Well, it all goes back to the work of two
great minds.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.049
The first of these minds belonged to Sadi
Carnot, a French scientist who was probably
more brilliant than we’ll ever know.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.840
Carnot came from a famous and influential
family.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.200
His father was a mathematician and a military
engineer whose name would eventually be emblazoned,
along with those of other scientists, on the Eiffel Tower.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.280
And Carnot followed in his father’s footsteps,
joining the French army corps of engineers in 1814.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.960
But, then things got sticky.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.800
His father had become minister of the interior,
under a fellow named Napoleon.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.780
And after Napoleon met his literal Waterloo
and the monarchy was restored, Carnot’s father
was sent into exile.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.020
But Carnot was allowed to stay – languish
is probably a better word.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.780
He spent years inspecting army facilities
and writing reports that no one read.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.300
Until, in 1819, he transferred back to Paris
and, out of curiosity, started attending lectures
on chemistry and physics.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.420
And there, he became especially interested
in improving the performance of steam engines.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.940
He published his research in a book called
Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, in 1824.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.220
And although his work was largely ignored, it
contained a revolutionary idea: a model for the
most efficient steam engine possible.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.140
Today it’s known as the Carnot engine, and
the process by which it works is called the
Carnot Cycle.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.940
The Carnot cycle is actually a hypothetical
process – it’s the most ideal cycle of changing
pressures and temperatures in a fluid.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.140
And it’s ideal because it assumes there aren’t
any sources of waste, like friction or the conduction
of heat between different parts of an engine.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.240
So we use this cycle as a standard to judge
the performance of heat engines.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.200
The Carnot cycle consists of four processes,
all of which are reversible – two adiabatic and two
isothermal ones.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.720
And it can take place in either a closed
or a steady-state system.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.700
Let’s look at it in a closed system.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.460
Let’s say we have a gas that’s contained
in an adiabatic piston-cylinder device.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.560
As we start up our piston, the first process in the
Carnot cycle is called reversible isothermal expansion.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.240
In this stage, the head of the cylinder starts in
close contact with an energy source, or reservoir,
at temperature TH.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.300
This will transfer heat, which we’ll call
QH, to the gas.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.540
As the energy source transfers heat, the gas
starts to expand slowly, which does work on
the surroundings.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.820
As the gas expands, its initial temperature,
TH, tends to decrease.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.240
But as soon as the temperature drops by a
very small, almost negligible amount,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.280
some heat is transferred from the reservoir
to the gas, which warms it up, bringing it back
to its initial temperature.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.780
That means that the temperature of the gas is
basically kept constant throughout the process, which
will continue until the piston reaches position 2.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.960
At this point, we come to the second stage of
the Carnot cycle: reversible adiabatic expansion.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.280
Here, we’ll make the process adiabatic by
replacing the reservoir with insulation.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.380
This means that as the gas expands, it can
cool down, since it won’t be heated back up
by the reservoir anymore.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.800
It will do this until its temperature drops
from TH to TL, which brings us to position 3.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.960
Halfway there!

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.440
Now we just need to go in the opposite
direction as we begin the third stage of our cycle:
reversible isothermal compression.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.040
So now let’s remove the insulation and bring
the cylinder into contact with an energy sink
at temperature TL.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.020
This will cause the gas to transfer heat,
which we’ll call QL, to the reservoir.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:23.740
Now, when some external force pushes the piston
inward, which does work on the gas, the gas will
compress and its temperature will tend to rise.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.900
But as soon as the temperature rises by a
very tiny amount,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:33.980
some heat is transferred from the gas to
the sink, which cools it down, causing the
temperature to drop back down to TL.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.680
Now, you’ll notice that this is really similar
to what happened in the first stage!

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.700
The temperature of the gas will stay the same
throughout this process until the piston reaches
position 4.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.560
Now we’re at the fourth stage of our cycle:
reversible adiabatic compression.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.360
In this last stage, we’ll put the insulation
back on, making the process adiabatic again.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:59.760
The gas will continue to slowly compress until its
temperature rises from TL to TH, which will complete
the cycle and bring us back to where we started.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.840
And, since we’re back where we started,
we have a fully reversible cycle.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.000
This makes the Carnot cycle the most
efficient cycle that we can have between two
different temperatures.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.420
Now, even though we can’t actually achieve it in
reality, we can improve the efficiency of our cycles if
we try to model them more closely to Carnot’s design.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:26.300
His work shows us that the efficiency of a heat engine
is only dependent on the temperatures of its heat
reservoirs, rather than the types of fluids that it uses.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:35.260
As such, the maximum attainable efficiency of a heat
engine is equal to one minus the temperature of the cold
sink divided by the temperature of the heat reservoir.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.180
Now, remember when I said that Carnot was
probably more brilliant than we’ll ever know?

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.240
Well, let me finish his story.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.760
Soon after he published his work on the Carnot
cycle, he quit his job with the army and was left
without an income or any pension.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.300
Diagnosed with “mania” and “general delirium,” he was
then sent to an asylum, where he contracted cholera,
which was sweeping through Paris at the time.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.220
Carnot died at the age of 36.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:04.400
And because all of his personal belongings were
considered to be contaminated, they were buried with
him, including all of his notebooks and papers.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.700
So, the full scope of his work, and his genius,
has been lost to history.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:16.500
Nonetheless, we do know that Carnot discovered the
limitation of efficiency, and his work has become
foundational to our understanding of wasted energy.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.820
But, Carnot’s insights alone don’t fully explain
why we can never build the perfect engine.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:27.830
We still need to understand another property – one
that wasn’t even put into words until a few decades
after Carnot came up with his cycle.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.080
The great mind who gave us this property was
Rudolf Clausius.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.100
Clausius was a German mathematician and physicist
who introduced the concept of entropy around 1850,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.690
after he recognized the confusion between
Carnot’s work and the conservation of energy.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:47.720
Entropy is the measure of a system’s thermal
energy per unit temperature that’s unavailable
for doing work.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.420
It’s also the measure of the disorder, or
randomness, of a system.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:59.300
Mathematically, if the entropy for a system
is 0, then we have a reversible process with no
change in entropy, like with a Carnot engine.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.300
Any value over 0, and then the process is
irreversible and gains entropy.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.710
So, every process results in either no change
in entropy or an increase in entropy.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.640
It’s impossible to have an overall decrease
in entropy.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.940
If you’re only looking at a system itself,
it’s possible to have a decrease in entropy.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:26.680
But, and this is very important, the entropy of the system’s surroundings and the universe would have to increase by an amount greater than or equal to the loss of entropy inside the system.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.940
Simply put, our universe always tends toward
disorder.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.540
It’s just the way of all things.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:39.120
In fact, scary as it may be, entropy and the
second law of thermodynamics actually predict
the end of the universe as we know it!

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:46.620
If everything is tending toward disorder, than the
logical conclusion is that all of the usable energy in
the universe may one day be converted to heat.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:53.360
This event is known as the heat death of the universe
and, in addition to being a really wonderful band name,
it may one day be our fate.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.860
I wouldn’t worry about it, though, because
while it makes sense in theory, many doubt
if it would actually happen.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.560
And even if it did, it probably wouldn’t
happen for a really long time.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:10.760
But whether or not entropy will cause the universe
|to end, it does make it impossible to create a perfect
engine with an output of 100% work energy.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.310
We can try to get closer than we already are,
but no matter how inventive we get as engineers,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:20.220
we always have to follow the rules of the
universe – even if it’s one that will lead to
our own doom.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.910
So in today’s lesson, we learned about the
second law thermodynamics and how we came
to understand it.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:33.680
We started by talking about the differences between
the first and second law of thermodynamics and how
the second law focuses on quality over quantity.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.320
Then we talked about the Carnot cycle and
how it’s the most efficient form of a heat engine
with temperature differences.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.440
We ended our lesson by going over entropy
and the randomness that can occur with a system.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.420
I’ll see you next week, when we’ll learn
more about heat engines and how systems can
operate on a cycle.
