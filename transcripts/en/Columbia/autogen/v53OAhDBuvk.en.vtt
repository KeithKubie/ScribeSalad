we access link data could be by
 

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:30.199
we access link data could be by
navigating them through their connection

given to us as manuscripts and and so

00:36:42.529 --> 00:36:42.539
given to us as manuscripts and and so
 

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:49.079
given to us as manuscripts and and so
the the challenge was how do we identify

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:49.089
the the challenge was how do we identify
 

00:36:49.089 --> 00:36:53.519
the the challenge was how do we identify
the names of the people here which is

00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:53.529
the names of the people here which is
 

00:36:53.529 --> 00:36:57.420
the names of the people here which is
the first step for extracting name from

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:57.430
the first step for extracting name from
 

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:04.510
the first step for extracting name from
the arguments so we have this text and

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520
 

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:10.810
how to how to find out what names are

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:10.820
how to how to find out what names are
 

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.190
how to how to find out what names are
here because our assumption was if

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200
here because our assumption was if
 

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.420
here because our assumption was if
someone here in interview site someone

someone here in interview site someone
 

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.720
someone here in interview site someone
else it's very likely that this person

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:22.730
else it's very likely that this person
 

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.930
else it's very likely that this person
has some level of knowledge of the other

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:25.940
has some level of knowledge of the other
 

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.790
has some level of knowledge of the other
person it could be just knowing the name

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800
person it could be just knowing the name
 

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.560

or been a close friend or being a

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:32.570
or been a close friend or being a
 

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.670
or been a close friend or being a
collaborator we don't know but there is

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680
collaborator we don't know but there is
 

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:41.320
collaborator we don't know but there is
some kind of linkage there so the first

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:41.330
some kind of linkage there so the first
 

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.700
some kind of linkage there so the first
step was create a name directory of jazz

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:45.710
step was create a name directory of jazz
 

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:50.530
step was create a name directory of jazz
musicians then huge use this directory

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:50.540
musicians then huge use this directory
 

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.520
musicians then huge use this directory
to match names from the transcripts and

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:56.530
to match names from the transcripts and
 

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:02.460
to match names from the transcripts and
convert this matches into RDF triples

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:02.470
convert this matches into RDF triples
 

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:08.680
convert this matches into RDF triples
one of those triples we saw earlier well

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:08.690
one of those triples we saw earlier well
 

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:18.220
one of those triples we saw earlier well
what we found ourself doing was a lot of

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:18.230
what we found ourself doing was a lot of

see people doing this is what you should

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:26.060
see people doing this is what you should
 

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.190
see people doing this is what you should
expect to do at this point when you work

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200
expect to do at this point when you work

expect to do at this point when you work
with linked data there is kind of a

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:32.990
with linked data there is kind of a
 

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.680

convergence in building tools for
 

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.740
convergence in building tools for
cleaning up data for mapping data and

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:38.750
cleaning up data for mapping data and
 

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.290
cleaning up data for mapping data and
there are the first end of the first

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:41.300
there are the first end of the first
 

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.240
there are the first end of the first
generation of these tools probably in a

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:43.250
generation of these tools probably in a
 

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.190
generation of these tools probably in a
short time these tools will be available

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200
short time these tools will be available
 

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.920
short time these tools will be available
for others to use but when you work with

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:47.930
for others to use but when you work with
 

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:52.720
for others to use but when you work with
lean data you need a way to create a

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:52.730
lean data you need a way to create a
 

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:57.900

sound and sound set of data to work with
 

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.060
sound and sound set of data to work with
so first of all create the name

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:01.070
so first of all create the name
 

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.840
so first of all create the name

don't know this information so what what

00:41:52.279 --> 00:41:52.289
don't know this information so what what
 

00:41:52.289 --> 00:41:58.569

step was to create have a way to

00:42:06.769 --> 00:42:06.779
step was to create have a way to

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.259
with the variance and so we built a
personal name mapping tool and here we

00:42:15.259 --> 00:42:15.269
personal name mapping tool and here we
 

00:42:15.269 --> 00:42:18.950
personal name mapping tool and here we
see a the interface too heavily

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960
see a the interface too heavily
 

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.940

and these are the results so you have

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:40.470
and these are the results so you have
 

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.670
and these are the results so you have
different levels of confidence in this

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680
different levels of confidence in this
 

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.150

done so these kind of tools are being

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599
done so these kind of tools are being
 

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:06.770
done so these kind of tools are being
built for the purpose of link jet but

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780

they are basically domain agnostic so

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:09.210
they are basically domain agnostic so
 

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:10.940
they are basically domain agnostic so
they're mapping tool that can serve and

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:10.950
they're mapping tool that can serve and
 

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.510
they're mapping tool that can serve and
number of porpoises and so it's kind of

other institutions or initiatives they
 

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.609
other institutions or initiatives they
are building things like this because

00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619
are building things like this because
 

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:29.000
are building things like this because
they are needed and and then you you get

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:29.010
they are needed and and then you you get
 

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:35.420
they are needed and and then you you get
your own kind of authority oregano say

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:35.430
your own kind of authority oregano say
 

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.440
your own kind of authority oregano say
but anyway your your name and reach with

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:39.450
but anyway your your name and reach with
 

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.780
but anyway your your name and reach with
all the possible variants it's obvious

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:41.790
all the possible variants it's obvious
 

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.480
all the possible variants it's obvious
like that if you have all the variants

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:44.490
like that if you have all the variants
 

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.329
like that if you have all the variants
you can perform a better mapping against

00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339
you can perform a better mapping against
 

00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:49.310
you can perform a better mapping against
your transcript because people can be

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:49.320
your transcript because people can be
 

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:56.030
your transcript because people can be
named can be cited in many ways and then

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040
named can be cited in many ways and then
 

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.670
named can be cited in many ways and then
this probably is the two that gave us

00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680
this probably is the two that gave us
 

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.560
this probably is the two that gave us
more satisfaction because now it shows

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:00.570
more satisfaction because now it shows
 

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:04.690

here so you can do some pattern analysis

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:34.850
here so you can do some pattern analysis
 

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:40.630
here so you can do some pattern analysis
but frequency closeness but what we want

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640

the machine is done you have to employ a
human driven approach and and we are

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:57.560
human driven approach and and we are
 

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.960
human driven approach and and we are
doing by creating a crowdsourcing tool

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:00.970

from our point of view the harnessing of
the knowledge should be balanced by

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:04.930
the knowledge should be balanced by
 

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:08.550
the knowledge should be balanced by
offering the possibility to learn and so

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:08.560
offering the possibility to learn and so
 

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.740
offering the possibility to learn and so
that's why we are designing new features

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:10.750
that's why we are designing new features
 

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:16.260
that's why we are designing new features
in a way that the volunteers can also

to also to work hard to to offer
 

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:02.620
to also to work hard to to offer
features for engagement yeah and we

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:02.630
features for engagement yeah and we
 

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:06.160
features for engagement yeah and we
talked with with a number of researchers

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:06.170
talked with with a number of researchers
 

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:13.180
talked with with a number of researchers
and Columbia Rutgers and they showed

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:13.190
and Columbia Rutgers and they showed
 

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:17.109
and Columbia Rutgers and they showed
interest for it a tools that have to

01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119
interest for it a tools that have to
 

01:06:17.119 --> 01:06:20.950
interest for it a tools that have to
analyze date in a new way and you have

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960
analyze date in a new way and you have
 

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.930
analyze date in a new way and you have
to think that now we are doing the hard

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:22.940
to think that now we are doing the hard
 

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.569

stuff of analyzing their relationships

01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:25.579
stuff of analyzing their relationships
 

01:06:25.579 --> 01:06:28.029
stuff of analyzing their relationships
but hopefully we will be able to

01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039
but hopefully we will be able to
 

01:06:28.039 --> 01:06:28.960
but hopefully we will be able to
aggregate

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:28.970
aggregate
 

01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:31.480
aggregate

part it would be the fun part but the
 

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:45.190
part it would be the fun part but the
hard part now is to find out what is the

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200
hard part now is to find out what is the
 

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.470
hard part now is to find out what is the
nature of the personal relationship with

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480

data with the new bed frame and so it
 

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:32.530
data with the new bed frame and so it
could be certainly an extension like
