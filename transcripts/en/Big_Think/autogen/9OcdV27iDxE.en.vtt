the brain has is to store memories and
 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.390
the brain has is to store memories and
we store memories of many different

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400
we store memories of many different
 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.020
we store memories of many different
shapes and forms but the human brain is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030
shapes and forms but the human brain is
 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.970
shapes and forms but the human brain is
also very valuable when it comes to

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980
also very valuable when it comes to
 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.329
also very valuable when it comes to
memory and there's some things that the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339
memory and there's some things that the
 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.770
memory and there's some things that the
brain is very ill suited to remember and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780
brain is very ill suited to remember and
 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.229
brain is very ill suited to remember and
those things are like long lists of

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239
those things are like long lists of
 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.930
those things are like long lists of
numbers or long lists of unrelated words

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940
numbers or long lists of unrelated words
 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.459
numbers or long lists of unrelated words
or names for that matter and one of the

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469
or names for that matter and one of the
 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.669
or names for that matter and one of the
reasons why is it goes a bit beyond this

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679
reasons why is it goes a bit beyond this
 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.199
reasons why is it goes a bit beyond this
of this notion that we didn't evolve to

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:00.209
of this notion that we didn't evolve to
 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:02.849
of this notion that we didn't evolve to
remember numbers or we didn't evolve to

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859
remember numbers or we didn't evolve to
 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.649
remember numbers or we didn't evolve to
remember names which is certainly true

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659
remember names which is certainly true
 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.899
remember names which is certainly true
but it's a bit deeper than that in terms

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909
but it's a bit deeper than that in terms
 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.139
but it's a bit deeper than that in terms
of the architecture of the brain so one

of the operational principles to the
extent that we understand how the brain

extent that we understand how the brain
 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.230
extent that we understand how the brain
works we can refer to one of its

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240
works we can refer to one of its
 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.270

principles if you will is that is what

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219
principles if you will is that is what
 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.889
principles if you will is that is what
I'll call an associative architecture

I'll call an associative architecture
 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.170
I'll call an associative architecture
much of what we understand about the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180
much of what we understand about the
 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.660
much of what we understand about the
brain is based on associations if

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670
brain is based on associations if
 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.130
brain is based on associations if
somebody says what's a zebra you know

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140
somebody says what's a zebra you know
 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.139
somebody says what's a zebra you know
what a zebra is in part because what

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149
what a zebra is in part because what
 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.209
what a zebra is in part because what
that concept is associated with you

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219
that concept is associated with you
 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.490
that concept is associated with you
might associate it with Africa with

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500
might associate it with Africa with
 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.249
might associate it with Africa with
black and white stripes with it looks

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259
black and white stripes with it looks
 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.800
black and white stripes with it looks
like a horse so we understand to a

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810
like a horse so we understand to a
 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.779
like a horse so we understand to a
certain degree the world around us based

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789
certain degree the world around us based
 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.719
certain degree the world around us based
on the associations now when we're

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729
on the associations now when we're
 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.359
on the associations now when we're
memorizing long lists of numbers or

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369
memorizing long lists of numbers or
 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.700
memorizing long lists of numbers or
random names they don't come with any

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710
random names they don't come with any
 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.669
random names they don't come with any
built-in associations so this results in

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679
built-in associations so this results in
 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.649
built-in associations so this results in
something that sometimes we call the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659
something that sometimes we call the
 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.989
something that sometimes we call the
Baker Baker paradox and the Baker Baker

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999
Baker Baker paradox and the Baker Baker
 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.359
Baker Baker paradox and the Baker Baker
paradox is that it's easier to remember

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369
paradox is that it's easier to remember
 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.029
paradox is that it's easier to remember
somebody's profession if they tell you I

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039
somebody's profession if they tell you I
 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.370
somebody's profession if they tell you I
am a baker than it is to remember their

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380
am a baker than it is to remember their
 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.590
am a baker than it is to remember their
name if they tell you my name is mr.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600
name if they tell you my name is mr.
 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.480
name if they tell you my name is mr.
Baker so when you're it's the same word

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490
Baker so when you're it's the same word
 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.990
Baker so when you're it's the same word
but

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
but
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.700
but
brain is better able to store that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710
brain is better able to store that
 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.380
brain is better able to store that
information in the context of a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390
information in the context of a
 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780
information in the context of a
profession so why is that because when

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
profession so why is that because when
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.040
profession so why is that because when
somebody says I am a baker implicitly

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
somebody says I am a baker implicitly
 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.250
somebody says I am a baker implicitly
and unconsciously the brain has a number

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260
and unconsciously the brain has a number
 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.170
and unconsciously the brain has a number
of associations that already built in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
of associations that already built in
 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.230
of associations that already built in
with that concept so maybe you think of

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240
with that concept so maybe you think of
 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.210
with that concept so maybe you think of
getting up early maybe you think of

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
getting up early maybe you think of
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.510
getting up early maybe you think of
funny hats maybe you think of bread now

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520
funny hats maybe you think of bread now
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.120
funny hats maybe you think of bread now
when somebody says I am the mr. break

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130
when somebody says I am the mr. break

Baker that name by itself doesn't have

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580
Baker that name by itself doesn't have
 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.310
Baker that name by itself doesn't have
any implicit connections so it's sort of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320
any implicit connections so it's sort of
 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.010
any implicit connections so it's sort of
standing alone so you don't tap in to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020
standing alone so you don't tap in to
 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.530

have all these links and connections

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
have all these links and connections
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.360

between concepts and words and images
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.180
between concepts and words and images
and knowledge so the brain as a

computational device is well suited for
 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.510
computational device is well suited for
certain types of information storage and

of the decisions we make end up being
good decisions but many of the decisions

which of course is a mystery we don't
fully understand how the brain works or

correct answer cows drink water so your

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169
correct answer cows drink water so your
 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.409
correct answer cows drink water so your
reflective system is a bit slower and

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419
reflective system is a bit slower and
 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.600
reflective system is a bit slower and
it's a bit fact-based it can analyze

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610
it's a bit fact-based it can analyze

what's just happening so in some
 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.180
what's just happening so in some
situations we in very complex situations

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190
situations we in very complex situations
 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.320
situations we in very complex situations
and pretty sure you don't have all the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330
and pretty sure you don't have all the
 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.879
and pretty sure you don't have all the
facts and we have to make a quick

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889

decision yes the the automatic system

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300
decision yes the the automatic system
 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.899

can help us survive if you if you

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909
can help us survive if you if you
 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.570
can help us survive if you if you
recognize a dangerous system a dangerous

middle of a jungle and you have to act
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.890
middle of a jungle and you have to act
quickly maybe it's good thing to just

quickly maybe it's good thing to just
 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.580
quickly maybe it's good thing to just
emotionally react to that and in either

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590

now the reflective system in in most

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039
now the reflective system in in most
 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.370
now the reflective system in in most
situations comes with education and

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380
situations comes with education and
 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.080
situations comes with education and
learning and we have to struggle a bit

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090
learning and we have to struggle a bit
 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.080
learning and we have to struggle a bit
more to tap into the full potential of

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090
more to tap into the full potential of
 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.589
more to tap into the full potential of
our reflective system and I think as

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599
our reflective system and I think as
 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.439
our reflective system and I think as
individuals and a society we much of the

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449
individuals and a society we much of the
 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.119
individuals and a society we much of the
learning and education we go through

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129
learning and education we go through
 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.180
learning and education we go through
learns to requires tapping into our

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190
learns to requires tapping into our
 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.749
learns to requires tapping into our
reflective system another example is if

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759
reflective system another example is if
 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.529
reflective system another example is if
I say if in in certain math problems or

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539
I say if in in certain math problems or
 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.379
I say if in in certain math problems or
with probability problems those are

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389
with probability problems those are
 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.540
with probability problems those are
things that the brains intuitive system

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550
things that the brains intuitive system
 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.399
things that the brains intuitive system
or automatic system don't work very well

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409
or automatic system don't work very well
 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.779
or automatic system don't work very well
so if I say well I'm going to throw up

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789
so if I say well I'm going to throw up
 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:49.740
so if I say well I'm going to throw up
four coins

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750
four coins
 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.830
four coins
what's the probability that I'll get two

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840
what's the probability that I'll get two
 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.930
what's the probability that I'll get two
heads and two tails so there are a lot

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940
heads and two tails so there are a lot
 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.700
heads and two tails so there are a lot
of people you your brain wants to say

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710
of people you your brain wants to say
 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.459
of people you your brain wants to say
1/2 the probability is 50% that you're

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469
1/2 the probability is 50% that you're
 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.120
1/2 the probability is 50% that you're
going to get two tails and two heads but

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130
going to get two tails and two heads but
 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.800
going to get two tails and two heads but
that's if there's anything we know from

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810
that's if there's anything we know from
 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.320
that's if there's anything we know from
probability is that you shouldn't trust

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330
probability is that you shouldn't trust
 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.519
probability is that you shouldn't trust
your automatic system because the brain

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529
your automatic system because the brain
 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.029
your automatic system because the brain
didn't evolve to do probabilities

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039
didn't evolve to do probabilities
 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.200
didn't evolve to do probabilities
quickly or to estimate complex

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210
quickly or to estimate complex
 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.769
quickly or to estimate complex
mathematical questions automatically so

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779
mathematical questions automatically so
 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.050
mathematical questions automatically so
you need the reflective system to come

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060
you need the reflective system to come
 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.029
you need the reflective system to come
in and figure out the answer to that

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039
in and figure out the answer to that
 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.050
in and figure out the answer to that
question and that it's 6/16 if you go

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060
question and that it's 6/16 if you go
 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.409
question and that it's 6/16 if you go
through the number of possible

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419
through the number of possible
 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.939
through the number of possible
combinations there so you have this

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949
combinations there so you have this
 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.820
combinations there so you have this
balance between your automatic system

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830
balance between your automatic system
 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.930
balance between your automatic system
and your reflective system that's

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940
and your reflective system that's
 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.700
and your reflective system that's
driving most of our decisions and part

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710
driving most of our decisions and part
 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.930
driving most of our decisions and part
of our own self knowledge requires that
