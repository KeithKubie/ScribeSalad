- SO THE OTHER THING
I'M THINKING IS MAYBE

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:05.538 line:0%
WITH THE PLASMA BOLTS, INSTEAD
OF GOING THE TRADITIONAL WAY

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.074 line:0%
AND HAVING THEM ACTUALLY
EMANATING FROM HIS HANDS,

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:10.243 line:0%
WHAT IF THEY CAME
FROM HIS AURA?

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.245
THEY JUST CAME--
- UH, HE'S HERE.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.279
- OH, GOD. THANK YOU.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.082
GUYS, THIS IS SO EXCITING.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.851
MARVEL LEGEND STAN LEE
CALLS ME ON THE PHONE

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:22.255
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
AND SAYS, "I'D LIKE TO STOP BY."

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.790
SO I JUST THOUGHT THAT'D BE
A GREAT TREAT SO HE'S--

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.091
- EXCELSIOR!

00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:28.461
- HEY! MR. LEE!
- ALL RIGHT.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.796
ALL RIGHT.
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.097
LET'S GET GOING.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.698
- OH, YOU'RE HERE
TO PITCH US SOME CHARACTERS?

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:36.135
- YOU BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR
I HAVE.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.937
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE HERE.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:43.443
WE GOT TO...

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.110
EASEL WORK'S
A LITTLE BIT RUSTY.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.113
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:51.117
OKAY. INTRODUCING...

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.152
HEYDAY.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:57.623
HE LIVES PERPETUALLY
IN HIS BEST YEAR: 1982.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:01.293
HIS NEMESIS IS
THE EVIL WRITER'S BLOCK.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:04.496
HE'LL LIVE FOREVER AS LONG
AS HE CONTINUES TO COME UP

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:08.468
WITH GREAT, INTERESTING,
AND RELEVANT IDEAS.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.308
WELL, THAT GOT NOTHING.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:16.775
- MR. LEE,
I JUST--I JUST FEEL, YOU KNOW,

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.144
WE'RE REALLY BUSY THIS MORNING,
YOU--

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.414
- UH-UH-UH-UH, THIS AIN'T
MY FIRST RODEO, SONNY BOY.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.949
I GOT A MILLION OF 'EM.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.317
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.519
DR. BALANCE.

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.323
HE'S AN AGING ROBOTICS SCIENTIST

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.926
WHO NEVER SLIPS AND FALLS
IN THE SHOWER.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.995
IT'S WHERE AM I, MAN?

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:39.866
NO MATTER HOW LATE AT NIGHT
HE GETS UP TO GO NUMBER ONE,

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:43.670
HE ALWAYS KNOWS EXACTLY
WHERE HE IS.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.171
THERMOSTATRO.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.341
HE HAS THE POWER
TO CONTROL ANY THERMOSTAT,

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.710
WHICH MEANS
HE NEVER HAS TO BE TORMENTED

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.147
BY ANY SUDDENLY COLD SPOTS.
TECHNO.

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:58.317
HE UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTROL
ANY TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICE.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:01.954
THINGS LIKE THE COMPUTER
OR THE LITTLE HAND COMPUTER.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.990
ROAD RAGE.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.293
HE GETS BEHIND INNOCENT DRIVERS
ON THE THOROUGHFARE

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.529
ON THEIR WAY HOME
FROM THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.365
AND HE LEANS
ON HIS RADIOACTIVE HORN

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:17.636
AND THEY SAY, "HEY! COME ON,
GET OFF OF MY BUMPER, HOT ROD!

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:21.307
WE'RE GOIN' AS FAST AS WE CAN!"

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:25.311
WHERE'D YOU GUYS COME FROM?

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.882
OH, YEAH.
HERE'S THE GRAY CHASER.

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:33.185
HER SPECIAL POWERS ARE
SHE'S 40, HAS NO KIDS,

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.220
AND SHE'S GOT A ROCKIN' HOT BOD.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.157
SHE'S ONLY INTO OLDER DUDES
WITH PONYTAILS AND LIVER SPOTS.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.425
HOMESTEAD.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.226
HE'S GOT THE MUTANT ABILITY
TO FORCE

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:44.563
ANY OF HIS BUSY ADULT CHILDREN
TO COME VISIT FOR A CHANGE.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:46.565
I MEAN, WOULD IT KILL YOU
TO PICK UP A PHONE?

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:48.600
HOW 'BOUT AN EVIL VILLAIN, HUH?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.037
THE OVERWEIGHT JAMAICAN MAID.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:54.373
ALSO KNOWN AS JAMILA!

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:59.345
SHE STEALS THINGS.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.280
- MR. LEE,
I'M--I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.252
JUST, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I-I DON'T THINK THAT, UH...

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.724
I DON'T THINK THAT WE COULD USE
ANY OF THESE CHARACTERS.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.426
- OH.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.395
SO SAY THE ROOM?

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.963
- YES.
- YEAH.

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:21.701
- OH.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.571
NO, I-I-I UNDERSTAND.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.872
DON'T MIND ME.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:30.943
SOMETIMES YOU'RE JUST
SHOOTING BLANKS.

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:32.144
I KNOW WHEN I'M NOT WANTED.

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:35.114
JUST...TOSS THE REST OF 'EM

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:37.616
IN THE, UH, TRASH COMPACTOR
OR WHATEVER YA GOT THESE DAYS.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:38.918
- IT WAS A REAL HONOR, SIR,
TO HAVE YOU.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:39.953
- AH.

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:43.456
[laughs]

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:47.093
EUREKA.

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:50.262
I'VE JUST BEEN INSPIRED.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.499
NOW, THIS IS A SUPERHERO TEAM,

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:58.838
A RAGTAG GROUP OF
MULTIETHNICS KNOWN AS...

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.507
THE FIRED BUNCH.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.143
THEY POSSESS
THE TESTICULAR FORTITUDE

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:06.946
TO BITE THE VERY HAND
THAT FEEDS THEM

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.647
AND ARE CURSED
TO WALK THE STREETS

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.784
FOR AN ETERNITY
UNEMPLOYED.

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:18.024
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.827
- WE LOVE IT!

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.800
- EXCELSIOR!
