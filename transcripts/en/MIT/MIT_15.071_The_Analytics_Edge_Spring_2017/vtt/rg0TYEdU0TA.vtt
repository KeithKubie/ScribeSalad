00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.500
In this first
recitation, we will

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.030
try to understand various
nutritional facts about food,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.710
while getting more practice
using R. Good nutrition

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.120
is an important part of
leading a healthy lifestyle.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.580
Malnutrition can
result in obesity,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.550
which has been rising
at an alarming rate.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.330
In the US for instance,
while all states in 1990

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.990
had less than 14% obesity,
figures started increasing.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.050
And by 2000, half of the
country has more than 20%

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.210
of its population obese.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.550
The trend continues.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.080
And in 2010, all states
have at least more than 20%

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.300
of their population obese.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.750
Many states across the country
reached an alarming situation.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.140
More than 35% of American
adults are obese.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.870
The trends Worldwide
are no different.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.980
Obesity has nearly
doubled across the globe.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.460
Obesity is one of today's
blatantly visible public health

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.900
problems, and
increases people's risk

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.370
to heart disease,
stroke, and diabetes.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.750
In fact 65% of the
world's population

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.200
lives in countries
where obesity kills

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.440
more people than underweight.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.590
So good nutrition is essential
for an overall healthy

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.230
lifestyle and promoting it now
is more important than ever.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.020
We have access to hundreds
of nutrition and weight loss

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.289
applications, and around 15%
of adults with cell phones

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.210
use health applications
on their devices.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.460
These apps are mostly powered
by the United States Department

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.430
of Agricultural, or
USDA, food database.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.000
The United States
Department of Agricultural

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.200
distributes
nutritional information

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.380
of over 7,000 food
items including

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.850
amount of calories,
carbs, protein, fat,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.630
and sodium, among
other nutrients.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.830
It is exactly this
data that we will

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.440
be analyzing in this recitation.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.000
In the next video, we will
read in the USDA data set in R

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.140
and get more familiar
with its content.
