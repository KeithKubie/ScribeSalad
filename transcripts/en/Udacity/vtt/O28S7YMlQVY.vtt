00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.020
All right, I've got my personal site
open, and it still looks awful.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.440
I'll go into dev tools and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.040
then edit the head by right clicking
on it and then doing Edit as HTML.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.620
I set the name to viewport for the meta
tag and then I set the content to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.324
equal to width equals device-width and
then set the initial-scale to 1.0.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:21.555
When I click off it.

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:22.360
Ta-da.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.650
Look at that.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.110
It looks right.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.960
Now, my site actually fits
the viewport available to it.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.740
So, what's the takeaway from this quiz?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.225
Don't forget to set the viewport.
