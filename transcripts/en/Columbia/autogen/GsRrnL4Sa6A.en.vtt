things there are many techniques that
 

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.040
things there are many techniques that
have been used to you know to

have been used to you know to
 

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.880
have been used to you know to
corroborate this for example one thing

corroborate this for example one thing
 

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.090
corroborate this for example one thing
you can do is to take a word that shows

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.100
you can do is to take a word that shows
 

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.220
you can do is to take a word that shows
up in many different into European

you can say if all the languages have

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160
you can say if all the languages have
 

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.930
you can say if all the languages have
this word and if that word

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:21.940
this word and if that word
 

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.600

geographically is only located in one
 

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.269
geographically is only located in one
particular place then that must be where

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279
particular place then that must be where
 

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:30.819

they all languages come from so there's

00:13:30.819 --> 00:13:30.829
they all languages come from so there's
 

00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:33.220
they all languages come from so there's
been a lot of there's a there's a book

on this called proto-indo-european trees
 

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.340
on this called proto-indo-european trees
where the effort has been to take the

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:39.350
where the effort has been to take the
 

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.230
where the effort has been to take the
names of trees and see where those trees

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240
names of trees and see where those trees

grow naturally is a little awkward

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:43.700
grow naturally is a little awkward
 

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.460
grow naturally is a little awkward
because you have changing climates and

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:45.470
because you have changing climates and
 

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.230
because you have changing climates and
therefore you have to look in the

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240
therefore you have to look in the
 

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.490
therefore you have to look in the
distribution of pollens and

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:48.500
distribution of pollens and
 

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.620
distribution of pollens and
archaeological deposits to decide where

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.940
archaeological deposits to decide where
the trees were and the other word that

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:54.950
the trees were and the other word that
 

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.730
the trees were and the other word that
has been used a lot is the word for

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:57.740
has been used a lot is the word for
 

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.560
has been used a lot is the word for
salmon

00:13:59.560 --> 00:13:59.570
salmon
 

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:05.970

with the idea that if basically the
 

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.840
with the idea that if basically the
proto-indo-european word for salmon is

proto-indo-european word for salmon is
 

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:13.960
proto-indo-european word for salmon is
locks and but the idea was that these

locks and but the idea was that these
 

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.550

languages must have originated where

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560
languages must have originated where
 

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.889
languages must have originated where
there were salmon all right that's one

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:17.899
there were salmon all right that's one
 

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:21.639
there were salmon all right that's one
technique but of course if it precludes

the notion that you could have borrowing

the notion that you could have borrowing
 

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.980
the notion that you could have borrowing
from some other some other language

from some other some other language
 

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:32.740
from some other some other language
family so all of this has been an

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:32.750
family so all of this has been an
 

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.910
family so all of this has been an
extremely elaborate linguistic exercise

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920
extremely elaborate linguistic exercise
 

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.480
extremely elaborate linguistic exercise
which is a difficult exercise because

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:40.490
which is a difficult exercise because
 

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.290
which is a difficult exercise because
there's no way prior to writing to

there's no way prior to writing to
determine where a language was spoken

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:46.660
determine where a language was spoken
 

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.420
determine where a language was spoken
you can find things that will correlate

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:49.430
you can find things that will correlate
 

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:55.620
you can find things that will correlate
with the language that is to say

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:55.630
 

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.290
if you have a language that has a word

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:58.300
if you have a language that has a word
 

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:09.499
if you have a language that has a word
for Oh some object say a plowshare then

00:15:09.499 --> 00:15:09.509
for Oh some object say a plowshare then
 

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:12.900
for Oh some object say a plowshare then
and you find a place that has plowshares

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:12.910
and you find a place that has plowshares
 

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.319
and you find a place that has plowshares
then maybe the language is spoken there

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:15.329
then maybe the language is spoken there
 

00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:18.300
then maybe the language is spoken there
something of that sort but what has

something of that sort but what has
happened in recent times by this I mean

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:00.450
stories that were narrated aloud but
 

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:08.450
stories that were narrated aloud but
we're not written down and that raises a

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460
we're not written down and that raises a
 

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.430
we're not written down and that raises a
question of the relationship between

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440
question of the relationship between
 

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:17.360
question of the relationship between
oral history and a written text this is

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:17.370
oral history and a written text this is
 

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:21.350
oral history and a written text this is
an issue that we still have you know is

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:21.360
an issue that we still have you know is
 

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.290
an issue that we still have you know is
there a different value that you get

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:27.300
there a different value that you get
 

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.920
there a different value that you get
when you have an oral text as opposed to

when you have an oral text as opposed to

it's a question of error for example the

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520
it's a question of error for example the
 

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:53.890
it's a question of error for example the
the Rig Veda was a purely oral text for

we know that when you have preserved in

the Indian tradition is the technique of

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:46.930
the Indian tradition is the technique of
 

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:51.090
the Indian tradition is the technique of
memorization so that every verse was

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:51.100
memorization so that every verse was
 

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.190
memorization so that every verse was
memorized then it was memorized

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200
memorized then it was memorized
 

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.830
memorized then it was memorized
backwards that it was memorized sort of

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:55.840
backwards that it was memorized sort of
 

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.210
backwards that it was memorized sort of
inside out you would have several

01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:57.220
inside out you would have several
 

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.210
inside out you would have several
different readings of the same verse

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:00.220
different readings of the same verse
 

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.580
different readings of the same verse
that you would simply get by memory and

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:02.590
that you would simply get by memory and
 

01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:07.310
that you would simply get by memory and
the readings had to had to dovetail and

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:07.320
the readings had to had to dovetail and
 

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.740
the readings had to had to dovetail and
so if you heard someone read it wrong

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:09.750
so if you heard someone read it wrong
 

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:12.470
so if you heard someone read it wrong
you would know simply by your own

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480
you would know simply by your own
 

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.780
you would know simply by your own
memorization of it oh you know exactly

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:15.790
memorization of it oh you know exactly
 

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:18.270
memorization of it oh you know exactly
where it was wrong by contrast the

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:18.280
where it was wrong by contrast the
 

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.740

precisely the same words the technique

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280
precisely the same words the technique
 

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:14.160
precisely the same words the technique
was to have catchphrases

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:14.170
was to have catchphrases
