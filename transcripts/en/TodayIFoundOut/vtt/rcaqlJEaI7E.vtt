00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.280
A commonly held folk etymology for “doohickey”
is that it derives from the mark left on a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.680
leaf after dew has evaporated, with said mark
essentially being akin to a the skin-blemish

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.480
definition of the word “hickey.”

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.520
Thus, lacking a commonly known word for such,
people referred to this dew mark as a “dew

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:34.033
hickey,” with this later evolving to “doohickey”
and eventually expanded to be used to refer

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.680
to anything that was a “thing” one couldn’t
come up with the name of.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.320
This origin story, however, has no documented
evidence to support it and the evidence at

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.010
hand seems to easily disprove it given that
“hickey,” meaning “a skin blemish,”

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.300
didn’t pop up until a couple decades after
its inclusion in the word “doohickey.”

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.339
So where did the word “doohickey” actually
come from?

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.780
As with most words, it’s difficult to say
when exactly people started using the term,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.979
but as for documented instances, it first
appeared in the November 12, 1914 edition

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.340
of Our Navy magazine, where it states, “We
were compelled to christen articles beyond

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.649
our ken with such names as ‘do-hickeys’,
‘gadgets’ and ‘gilguys’.”

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.140
(Incidentally, “gilguy” seems to be a
much older term than placeholder names like

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.460
doodad and doohickey, with the first documented
instance appearing in Spunyarn &amp; Spindrift-

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.530
A Sailor Boy’s Log by Robert Brown in 1886,
where Brown also notes one of the first known

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.710
instances of “gadget”- “Then the names
of all the other things on board a ship!

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.920
I don’t know half of them yet; even the
sailors forget at times, and if the exact

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.859
name of anything they want happens to slip
from their memory, they call it a chicken⁓fixing,

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.690
or a gadjet, or a gill-guy, or a timmey-noggy,
or a wim-wom—just pro tem., you know.”)

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.750
In any event, doohickey soon spread to being
used by airman as well, with it noted in Edward

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.670
Fraser &amp; John Gibbons’ 1925 Soldier &amp; Sailor
Words that “doo hickey” was “an airman’s

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.210
term for small, detachable fittings.”

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.360
Within a couple decades of this, the word
was being used widely throughout America as

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.350
a placeholder name for anything one couldn’t
remember the name of.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.690
As for how the early 20th century seamen seem
to have come up with “doohickey,” it is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.080
thought that it probably derives from “doodad,”
which has uncertain origin, but first popped

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.140
up in documented form about a decade before
“doohickey,” with doodad meaning “a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.450
superfluous ornament.”

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.170
The sailors thus are thought to have simply
meshed this term with “hickey,” which,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.010
according to the 1909 edition of Webster’s
New International Dictionary meant “a device

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.500
for bending a conduit, consisting of an iron
pipe used as a handle fitted at one end with

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.170
a tee through which the conduit is passed;
(b) a small fitting used in wiring for electric

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.030
lights, a fixture piped for gas.”

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.500
By, 1913 (and likely even before) “hickey”
appears to have been given the expanded definition

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.220
of referring to any tool one couldn’t remember
the name of and later to anything at all one

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.650
needed a placeholder name for, as outlined
in a 1928 document from the Michigan Academy

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.580
of Science and Arts: “Hickie, a word applicable
to anything whose name one does not remember,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.910
‘what’s its name’.”

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.950
As to who specifically first coined the term
“doohickey,” this has been lost to history,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.650
but given the definitions of “doodad”
and “hickey” around the time the term

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.840
was first uttered, it seems a fairly natural
combination when referring to some device

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.690
that you can’t remember the name of in a
given moment or just one whose name is too

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.880
obscure for most people to know, requiring
a placeholder name such as doohickey, doodad,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.720
doojigger, thingamawhatsit, watchamacallit,
thingummy, gadget, widget, gilguy, etc.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.260
And at this point if you’re wondering where
the word “hickey” came from, this isn’t

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.260
known.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.360
As for when it came to commonly mean a “skin
blemish,” this first started around the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.730
late 1920s or early 1930s, mostly referring
to pimples and later expanding the definition

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.400
from there, with one early instance appearing
in the May 2, 1937 edition of Ten-Story Love

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.290
Magazine where it notes in an advertisement,
“Hickies spoil everything.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.290
I know.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.490
I had ’em until I began eating Fleischmann’s
yeast.”

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.340
Not long after this, “hickey” also began
being used by printers to refer to various

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:42.509
blemishes in engravings and 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.110
the like.
