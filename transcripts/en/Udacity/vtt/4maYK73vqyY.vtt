00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.850
Hey everybody.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.090
We are joined right now by my friend Neil Williams,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.550
who is currently the lead engineer at Reddit.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.400
Maybe you can tell them a little bit about what your job entails these days.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.530
&gt;&gt; Well, I basically focus first on fixing anything if it's broken, and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.380
otherwise I try to figure out what's, what's the path for the site, like what's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.120
becoming a bottleneck and then try and fix that and make the site fast again.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.220
&gt;&gt; How much traffic does Reddit get these days?

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.490
&gt;&gt; Last month we got 2.7 billion page views.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.938
&gt;&gt; That's billion with a b.

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:37.824
And I think when I left Reddit,

00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:42.262
which was in 2009, we were nowhere close to that amount of traffic.

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:45.338
I don't remember specifically but I think it's like 10x difference.

00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:50.250
I thought Reddit was pretty big when I left, and it was, but

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.510
it's a lot bigger now and, and Neil and his team are basically the guys

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.710
responsible for keeping the site fast, online and functional.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.880
Which, you know,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.910
over the course of Reddit's history, has that always been the case?

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.240
&gt;&gt; We try. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, you guys do a very good job.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.660
It's a very impressive job.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.950
So what we're going to do in this,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.890
in this interview here, is I'm going to kind of, I'll,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.770
I'll start off by describing how things worked with Reddit before I left.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.870
And then as we said, traffic increased dramatically.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.330
And Neil will show which parts of the system are gone and what they're doing

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.160
now towards the future because a lot of things have, have really changed.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.690
You know when a site grows, grows by huge, huge amounts you,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.120
you have to keep adjusting.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.060
So so the way things were when I left if I recall,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.608
Neil will jump in it's been a few years for me.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:44.535
The first piece of infrastructure we had was the load balancer, and

00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:47.740
we talked about load balancers in unit six.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.667
The one we used was called HA proxy, and

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:56.080
you guys still use HA proxy, is that right?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.830
&gt;&gt; Yes we do. Yeah, it's fast, it never breaks and works for us all the time.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.158
I remember the day I found HA proxy.

00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:06.291
It was probably in 2007 and for, god, I mean even after I left for a while I,

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:10.395
is this still the case, do you have, you have multiple HA proxys now, right?

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:11.797
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Like we were for

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:16.743
a long time, like we had this super scalable architecture and one HA proxy.

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:19.044
We had one machine running one HA proxy and

00:02:19.044 --> 00:02:21.355
that handled millions of requests a day.

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:22.800
It was pretty incredible.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.320
So of course, outside of HA proxy is the internet and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.412
all of the Redditors, the unwashed masses of the world, users of the site.

00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:35.856
We also used Akamai.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.509
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:38.036
&gt;&gt; Do you guys still use Akamai?

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:38.715
&gt;&gt; Yes we do.

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:44.059
&gt;&gt; Remember we talked about CDN's, Content Delivery Networks in the,

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.269
in the last unit.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.630
Basically these are third-party caches.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.780
So Reddit pays Akamai to ping the site periodically, cache the content and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.140
deliver it to users who, can view cached content.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.510
&gt;&gt; We use that for logged out users only.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.010
Since everybody has their own personal page if they're logged in.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.680
&gt;&gt; But logged out users all see.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.630
&gt;&gt; The same content.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.810
&gt;&gt; The same stuff.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.450
&gt;&gt; So, so logged out users hit Akamai.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.670
And logged in users who have custom content, you know their username,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.960
their votes, all that stuff come in via the internet, and hit HA proxy directly.
