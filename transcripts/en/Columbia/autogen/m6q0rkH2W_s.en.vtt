implementation plans and we're now at
 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.740
implementation plans and we're now at
the point where some of these plans are

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750
the point where some of these plans are
 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.020
the point where some of these plans are
starting to take effect for example NSF

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030
starting to take effect for example NSF

is about to roll out their plan and
they're beginning a pilot project of

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330
they're beginning a pilot project of
 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.600
they're beginning a pilot project of
their new database to support the public

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610
their new database to support the public
 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.550
their new database to support the public
access of publications and we're having

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560
access of publications and we're having
 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.619
access of publications and we're having
these conversations so how do we support

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629
these conversations so how do we support
 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.890
these conversations so how do we support
researchers how do we ensure compliance

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900
researchers how do we ensure compliance
 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.500

can we encourage compliance as
relates to a researchers career so I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
relates to a researchers career so I
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.270
relates to a researchers career so I
think another important question is how

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280
think another important question is how
 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.910
think another important question is how
why is this important to them how can we

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
why is this important to them how can we
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.460
why is this important to them how can we
communicate this to them what is the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470
communicate this to them what is the
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.010
communicate this to them what is the
incentive incentives that was the other

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
incentive incentives that was the other
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.390
incentive incentives that was the other

about the key offices here who are
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.290
about the key offices here who are
involved with discussing these mandates

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300
involved with discussing these mandates
 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.480

ensure compliance and to also promote
 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.260
ensure compliance and to also promote
open access and so of course we've heard

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270
open access and so of course we've heard
 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.500
open access and so of course we've heard
from scholarly communication programs

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
from scholarly communication programs
 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.200

libraries data management their focus is
 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.610
libraries data management their focus is
a little different from spa because

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620
a little different from spa because
 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.410

and so new systems are gonna be popping

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:52.300
and so new systems are gonna be popping

up some are going to contract with NIH
 

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.430
up some are going to contract with NIH
and who's going to be the subject matter

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440
and who's going to be the subject matter
 

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.350
and who's going to be the subject matter

them get registered even though it's a
 

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.630
them get registered even though it's a
simple process so essentially we're

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:21.640
simple process so essentially we're
 

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.120
simple process so essentially we're
talking now also about system support

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.130
talking now also about system support
 

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.910
talking now also about system support
and I've done a little bit of this and

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920
and I've done a little bit of this and
 

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.460
and I've done a little bit of this and
our library certainly do does a bit of

universities need to talk amongst
 

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.810
universities need to talk amongst
themselves and kind of figure out what

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:36.820
themselves and kind of figure out what
 

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.720

you know PI's and authors communicate

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:23.530
you know PI's and authors communicate
 

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.260

it's very complex in terms of giving

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:36.700
it's very complex in terms of giving
 

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.199
it's very complex in terms of giving
faculty the appropriate tools

publishers and then in terms of support
correcting non-compliance which is

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:48.809
correcting non-compliance which is
 

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.540
correcting non-compliance which is
something that I have been very involved

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:50.550
something that I have been very involved
 

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.639
something that I have been very involved
with troubleshooting assistance

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:52.649

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:56.210
with troubleshooting assistance
providing education when we get to a

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220
providing education when we get to a
 

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.579
providing education when we get to a
non-compliant publication for example

00:14:58.579 --> 00:14:58.589
non-compliant publication for example
 

00:14:58.589 --> 00:15:00.590
non-compliant publication for example
and again in my experience with the NIH

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600
and again in my experience with the NIH
 

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.179
and again in my experience with the NIH
public access policy it's already too

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:02.189
public access policy it's already too
 

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:06.079
public access policy it's already too
late because and let's not forget that

00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:06.089
late because and let's not forget that
 

00:15:06.089 --> 00:15:08.269
late because and let's not forget that
with the NIH public access policy if you

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279
with the NIH public access policy if you
 

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:10.100
with the NIH public access policy if you
have non-compliant publications they

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.110
have non-compliant publications they
 

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.210
have non-compliant publications they
will withhold and delay your future

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220
will withhold and delay your future
 

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.819
will withhold and delay your future
funding until they the publication's get

00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:16.829
funding until they the publication's get
 

00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:20.239
funding until they the publication's get
fixed and so actually looking at a

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:20.249
fixed and so actually looking at a
 

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:21.679
fixed and so actually looking at a
non-compliant publication figuring out

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:21.689
non-compliant publication figuring out
 

00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:24.619
non-compliant publication figuring out
why it's not compliant takes a lot of

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:24.629
why it's not compliant takes a lot of
 

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:27.619
why it's not compliant takes a lot of
effort and so universities have to talk

00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:27.629
effort and so universities have to talk
 

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:30.169
effort and so universities have to talk
about who's going to help support the

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:30.179
about who's going to help support the
 

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.470
about who's going to help support the
faculty when we have non compliance

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480
faculty when we have non compliance
 

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.809
faculty when we have non compliance
issues because they can be quite tricky

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:35.819
issues because they can be quite tricky
 

00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:38.239
issues because they can be quite tricky
and complex to fix in fact there is no

00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:38.249
and complex to fix in fact there is no
 

00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:42.470
and complex to fix in fact there is no
quick fix okay well there we go see I

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480
quick fix okay well there we go see I
 

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.869
quick fix okay well there we go see I
touched on some of these points already

00:15:43.869 --> 00:15:43.879
touched on some of these points already
 

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:47.449
touched on some of these points already
challenges so far that we've experienced

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459
challenges so far that we've experienced
 

00:15:47.459 --> 00:15:51.319
challenges so far that we've experienced
prevent how can we educate faculty to

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:51.329
prevent how can we educate faculty to
 

00:15:51.329 --> 00:15:54.379
prevent how can we educate faculty to
prevent publication non-compliance

00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:54.389
prevent publication non-compliance
 

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:56.720
prevent publication non-compliance
because it really starts with the

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:56.730
because it really starts with the
 

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.169
because it really starts with the
communications that take place between

talks don't happen right upfront in
 

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:08.350
talks don't happen right upfront in
terms of a sponsors requirements and

ensuring that the appropriate checks are

00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:11.249
ensuring that the appropriate checks are
 

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:13.519
ensuring that the appropriate checks are
boxed off at a copyright agreement then

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:13.529
boxed off at a copyright agreement then
 

00:16:13.529 --> 00:16:15.259
boxed off at a copyright agreement then
you could get potential non-compliance

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:15.269
you could get potential non-compliance
 

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:19.519
you could get potential non-compliance
down the road and increasing pressure to

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:19.529
down the road and increasing pressure to
 

00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:21.710
down the road and increasing pressure to
sign copyright agreements without

just starting out they want to get
 

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.379
just starting out they want to get
published and so there's tremendous

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:33.389
published and so there's tremendous
 

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:35.840

thought here's another issue in terms of

thought here's another issue in terms of
 

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:44.329
thought here's another issue in terms of
communications is that so much

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:05.900
award they have to comply with any
 

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.090
award they have to comply with any
publications that they write as well

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100
publications that they write as well
 

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.960
publications that they write as well
with the public access policy but they

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:11.970
with the public access policy but they
 

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.630
with the public access policy but they
may forget or they may not be aware that

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640
may forget or they may not be aware that
 

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.400
may forget or they may not be aware that
they have these compliance obligations

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.410
they have these compliance obligations
 

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.260
they have these compliance obligations
and it winds up being the PI's

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:18.270
and it winds up being the PI's
 

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.840
and it winds up being the PI's
responsibility to communicate with all

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:20.850
responsibility to communicate with all
 

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.940
responsibility to communicate with all
potential authors but again that's not

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:22.950
potential authors but again that's not
 

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.120
potential authors but again that's not
necessarily their first priority with

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:26.130
necessarily their first priority with
 

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.440
necessarily their first priority with
their research publication management

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:30.450
their research publication management
 

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.920
their research publication management
the lack of ability to delegate the

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:33.930
the lack of ability to delegate the
 

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.690
the lack of ability to delegate the
management in the administrative aspects

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700
management in the administrative aspects
 

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.650
management in the administrative aspects
of this has been quite a challenge so

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660
of this has been quite a challenge so
 

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.700
of this has been quite a challenge so
and if I think it's difficult to have

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:42.710
and if I think it's difficult to have
 

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.440
and if I think it's difficult to have
administrators be able to manage and

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:45.450
administrators be able to manage and
 

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.750
administrators be able to manage and
associate ok these publications are

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760
associate ok these publications are
 

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.940
associate ok these publications are
related to these particular awards

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:49.950
related to these particular awards
 

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.950
related to these particular awards
because they are not the scientists and

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960
because they are not the scientists and
 

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.020
because they are not the scientists and
they're not necessarily familiar with

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.030
they're not necessarily familiar with
 

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.320
they're not necessarily familiar with
the outputs of a particular grant and so

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:57.330
the outputs of a particular grant and so
 

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.240
the outputs of a particular grant and so
that has been a challenge

00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.250
that has been a challenge
 

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.010
that has been a challenge
so that again there's more

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020
so that again there's more
 

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.600
so that again there's more
responsibility on a principal

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:02.610
responsibility on a principal
 

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.910
responsibility on a principal
investigator to comply because it's very

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:04.920
investigator to comply because it's very
 

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.070
investigator to comply because it's very
difficult to delegate the administrative

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080
difficult to delegate the administrative
 

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.460
difficult to delegate the administrative
aspects of that to other folks and then

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:10.470
aspects of that to other folks and then
 

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.500
aspects of that to other folks and then
finally when you have these really large

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:12.510
finally when you have these really large
 

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.540
finally when you have these really large
institutional training grants and multi

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:14.550
institutional training grants and multi
 

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.820
institutional training grants and multi
project grants it could certainly get

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:16.830
project grants it could certainly get
 

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.490
project grants it could certainly get
very hairy in terms of keeping track of

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500
very hairy in terms of keeping track of
 

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.020
very hairy in terms of keeping track of
compliance and I know I'm talking a lot

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.030
compliance and I know I'm talking a lot
 

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.450
compliance and I know I'm talking a lot
about publications because that's where

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460
about publications because that's where
 

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.830
about publications because that's where
I've learned where a lot of the

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840
I've learned where a lot of the
 

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.570
I've learned where a lot of the
challenges are as opposed to data

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580
challenges are as opposed to data
 

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.820
challenges are as opposed to data
sharing and data management but I think

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:28.830
sharing and data management but I think
 

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.830
sharing and data management but I think
there's also still so much offices like

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840
there's also still so much offices like
 

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.830
there's also still so much offices like
us in Spa that we are still learning

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840
us in Spa that we are still learning
 

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.450
us in Spa that we are still learning
concerning the challenges of data

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460
concerning the challenges of data
 

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.080
concerning the challenges of data
sharing and data management so I don't

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.090
sharing and data management so I don't
 

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.460
sharing and data management so I don't
know if this is the best graphic in the

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:40.470
know if this is the best graphic in the
 

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.470
know if this is the best graphic in the
world I got three big circles I have

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480
world I got three big circles I have
 

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.150
world I got three big circles I have
sponsored projects administration on the

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160
sponsored projects administration on the
 

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.190
sponsored projects administration on the
top and I have the scholarly

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200
top and I have the scholarly
 

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.020
top and I have the scholarly
communications program and the libraries

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:48.030
communications program and the libraries
 

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.510
communications program and the libraries
over here and everyone else I put in the

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520
over here and everyone else I put in the
 

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.490
over here and everyone else I put in the
nice purple circle but I think really

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500
nice purple circle but I think really
 

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.530
nice purple circle but I think really
what the the point I'm trying to make

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:54.540
what the the point I'm trying to make
 

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.620
what the the point I'm trying to make
here is that we can't have any more

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:57.630
here is that we can't have any more
 

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.800
here is that we can't have any more
silos these public access mandates are

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:00.810
silos these public access mandates are
 

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.340
silos these public access mandates are
so complex folks like myself need to be

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:04.350
so complex folks like myself need to be
 

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.930
so complex folks like myself need to be
better educated

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:05.940
better educated
 

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.660
better educated
to be able to communicate to faculty in

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:08.670
to be able to communicate to faculty in
 

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.320
to be able to communicate to faculty in
terms of how to comply and we all need

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:12.330
terms of how to comply and we all need
 

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.600
terms of how to comply and we all need
to I think learn from each other I need

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.610
to I think learn from each other I need
 

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.160
to I think learn from each other I need
to learn a little bit more about the

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:16.170
to learn a little bit more about the
 

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.290
to learn a little bit more about the
roles of the library I need to learn a

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:18.300
roles of the library I need to learn a
 

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.460
roles of the library I need to learn a
little bit more about Faculty's

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.470
little bit more about Faculty's
 

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.070
little bit more about Faculty's
priorities and then you it would be

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080
priorities and then you it would be
 

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.570
priorities and then you it would be
helpful to also have libraries and

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580
helpful to also have libraries and
 

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.100
helpful to also have libraries and
faculty a little learn a little bit more

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.110
faculty a little learn a little bit more
 

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.550
faculty a little learn a little bit more
about our role as well so that we can

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:31.560
about our role as well so that we can
 

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.780
about our role as well so that we can
all support each other

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:32.790
all support each other
 

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.150
all support each other
for reducing faculty administrative

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160
for reducing faculty administrative
 

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.680
for reducing faculty administrative
burden so I think what's also difficult

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:39.690
burden so I think what's also difficult
 

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.300
burden so I think what's also difficult
as faculty are looking for support for

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.310
as faculty are looking for support for
 

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.950
as faculty are looking for support for
this is as you can see from my nine

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960
this is as you can see from my nine
 

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.050
this is as you can see from my nine
offices there's too many central offices

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:45.060
offices there's too many central offices
 

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.960
offices there's too many central offices
to go to to get to go for help there

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:47.970
to go to to get to go for help there
 

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.810
to go to to get to go for help there
isn't really one key individual that you

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820
isn't really one key individual that you
 

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.790
isn't really one key individual that you
could possibly go to to help you with

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:52.800
could possibly go to to help you with
 

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.240
could possibly go to to help you with
all different aspects of this so and I

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:56.250
all different aspects of this so and I
 

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.930
all different aspects of this so and I
talked about educating each other better

00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:58.940
talked about educating each other better
 

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.790
talked about educating each other better
understanding I think of all of our

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:01.800
understanding I think of all of our
 

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.420
understanding I think of all of our
offices that the benefits of open access

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:04.430
offices that the benefits of open access
 

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.800
offices that the benefits of open access
will foster better communication with

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:06.810
will foster better communication with
 

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.410
will foster better communication with
faculty and again understanding what's

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:09.420
faculty and again understanding what's
 

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.510
faculty and again understanding what's
important to faculty is extremely

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520
important to faculty is extremely
 

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.150
important to faculty is extremely
important for all of us so that we can

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160
important for all of us so that we can
 

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.310
important for all of us so that we can
advocate for them which is my next slide

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320
advocate for them which is my next slide
 

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.750
advocate for them which is my next slide
and I think one of the most important

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760
and I think one of the most important
 

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.480
and I think one of the most important
slides how can we advocate for faculty

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:20.490
slides how can we advocate for faculty
 

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.310
slides how can we advocate for faculty
to reduce administrative burden and so

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320
to reduce administrative burden and so
 

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.770
to reduce administrative burden and so
there are several professional

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780
there are several professional
 

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.730
there are several professional
organizations and I want to talk very

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740
organizations and I want to talk very
 

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.880
organizations and I want to talk very
just briefly about them and I know the

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:34.890
just briefly about them and I know the
 

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.470
just briefly about them and I know the
library's also has professional

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480
library's also has professional
 

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.810
library's also has professional
organizations and maybe this is the time

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820
organizations and maybe this is the time
 

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.460
organizations and maybe this is the time
where the chocolate meat needs to meet

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:40.470
where the chocolate meat needs to meet
 

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.200
where the chocolate meat needs to meet
the peanut butter and we can work

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.210
the peanut butter and we can work
 

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.990
the peanut butter and we can work
closely with each other to help advocate

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000
closely with each other to help advocate
 

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.790
closely with each other to help advocate
for our faculty so this is the federal

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:46.800
for our faculty so this is the federal
 

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.550
for our faculty so this is the federal
demonstration partnership just to give

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:49.560
demonstration partnership just to give
 

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.460
demonstration partnership just to give
you a little bit about the federal

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:52.470
you a little bit about the federal
 

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.130
you a little bit about the federal
demonstration partnership it is a

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140
